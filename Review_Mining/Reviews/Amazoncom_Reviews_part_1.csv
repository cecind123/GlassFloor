rating,review
bad,"A typical day at work Involves getting herded into your workplace pens and berated about non compliance."
bad,Rating is so low due the management only wanting to work with employees that spoke Spanish and ignored everyone else. Once someone would seek up about the problem that person is removed from the building and fired the next day.
bad,Not a fun place to work and management makes it seem like they care about employees and well being while in fact this is far from the truth. I would not recommend working for Amazon unless you are desperate for work and just looking for something to keep your head above water until you find something else. Work load and expectations are not real world ones. Terrible place to work!
bad,I worked for amazon for 6 months  and they constantly are over packing your route. without taken consideration that sometimes it eoyld take 30 to 40 min  to leave there warehouse drivers that counts as your delivery time the warehouse
bad,"Sono stata trattata peggio di un topo in gabbia l'unica cosa positiva è stata la musica alta mentre si lavorava, per il resto niente pause solo una unica di mezzora e solo dopo che tutti i pacchi fossero stati messi nelle bag, quindi potevano passare anche 5 ore prima di fare la prima pausa, i pacchi venivano lanciati per terra per far piu veloce sopratutto durante il blackfriday. Una vera e propria baraonda affidata a gente malata."
bad,Amazon is a business that over works their employees. They expect you to deliver a large amount of packages in one day and doesn’t pay their workers enough. You are constantly micromanaged and everyone has dread and are unhappy to be at work.
bad,Injuries abound amongst amazon employees. Management is argumentative and intimidation is an often used tactic. It isnt unusual to see an employee crying or in emotional distress or physical pain.
bad,I would no recommend this job. I just had to have surgery from a umbilical hernia from lifting things that were not specified as a weight lifting requirement at the initial day of employment. Definitely not enough pay for the requirements and type of work you are required to do
bad,I think this is the worst company that I've ever worked for they don't care about your safety they don't care about that you go the extra mile they're really don't care that you have adequate break times and lunch times this company only they care about is numbers
bad,Does not pay fairly and if you want to promote you have to relocate. Amazon has an internal leadership structure for promoting and they follow that structure. Even if you are qualified for a position you can’t skip levels.
bad,Hate working here.  This is the worse job i have ever had in my life  All they care about is their numbers   Should have a union.  I am trying to obtain another job.  Wish me luck!
bad,"Good hard work, but not for everyone and not for those in not-so tip top health. They to have better shift options and more attention for disablities that are not on a preset list."
bad,"This is the most horrible place to work HR does not care to help you at all , you can literally throw up have a fever and have blurry vision at work and they will not let you go home if you have no pto or upt and if you leave you are fired , Amazon LAS2 literally had a fire going on last night and kept us outside for 2 hours and 15 min freezing no blankets and only bull gloves and socks for warmth , below  freezing wheather 36 degrees and when we asked to go home  the managers started yelling at us saying “NO WE ARE ALREADY BEHIND IN WORK NOW DUE TO THIS “ like really ?? Was that our fault maybe because they have us working 60 hours a week without a complete day off only 19 hours a week are we off and if we miss one day our a couple hours we are fired !!!  this it the most messed up place to work and they have a law suit coming up real soon!!!"
bad,"Esperienza pessima."
bad,"The Management is Terrible."
bad,"Very unprofessional managers, I have worked for good 6 months for them and all over sudden, January 2016, I received a text message telling me I have been fired due to amazon reducing the employees. I was on my way to work when I received the text."
bad,They find ways to get you out once you start making more then $20 per hr. They will make up stuff just to get you out. Management if they know you do the job better then them will try and set you up so they can get credit for your work
bad,"Keine guten Bedingungen , die Leute haben keinen Plan wie sie Arbeit"
bad,"This was the worst job I've ever had. Every day it is the same monotonous task, yet the task is constantly crouching or climbing a set of stairs. All the while scanning and lifting items. At the end of the day you feel emotionally and physically tired"
bad,It’s basically a huge high School.  It’s very political and cliques run everything from senior management down.  If you know people and have friends in high places they’ll bring you up.  If you work hard and speak up for things that are wrong or unfair they’ll find a way to get rid of you.
bad,"Most unprofessional managed and gangster style run facility with the General Manager, HR manager and other managers are hand in hand to bring down any person who files complains or stands up for their rights and voice against harassment. They make you slog and do not really have any concern for the older people who are unable to do certain jobs. They just do not care, just productivity is all that look for. It is Untrue when they say - Employees are their assets."
bad,"New management, managers who joined newly destroyed amazon's culture. Its not a good place anymore unless you are ready to lick their shoes. Hardwork does pay off anymore here. And the worst past is if you have  any issues and report to the higher management they will make sure that anyone who disagree with their stupid decision are forced to leave the company.  And the hardworking people with the dignity have left that place. This is just for the CJB10."
bad,"There is a definite cultural bias at Amazon and it is shown in there hiring practice. They show favoritism to one particular race and if you are not the right color or there chosen race. "
bad,Aucun respect des salariés.services RH très nul.saaires de misère.stress permanent.licencier en arrêt maladie sans preavis
bad,"If you get the right people, they will teach you and grow you better for your career. But if you leave this company, you won't be hired again. So make sure you work hard, have fun and make history."
bad,Stay away from Amazon managers only want kiss a** employees that will do whatever first time you go against them they send you to other departments or give you s*** jobs . Stay away from Amazon you've been warned
bad,"It was an experience I never wish to have again. The job had no form of security, you had to obtain your shifts on a day to day basis. The manager wasn't really present."
bad,I would not recommend anyone work at amazon unless you want to feel like a modern-day slave. They do not care about their employees or treat them well. You are on your feet for 10-12 hours and you aren't allowed to sit. If a manager catches you sitting you will get in trouble. The work environment is very hazardous and they pretend as if they care about safety but all they care about is getting as many packages out as possible. I only worked there for a couple of months and I've seen many people get hurt on the job because of the way management prioritizes productivity. There is also no ventilation in the building whatsoever (no windows or vents) and it is very dusty and dirty. I've gotten sick multiple times just from inhaling all of the dirt and dust on the floor.
bad,"Managers coming in not knowing NOTHING but got the job ONLY because the know the head honcho at the Chesapeake location."
bad,"You literally always feel like you're at risk of losing your job. They hire anyone - with or without a heartbeat - and hold you to strict production rates. If you don't meet those rates you're fired."
bad,"Dsps will go drinking most days while all the drivers are working. If you say anything you get permanently banned from site and they take your job, no appeals. There are no driver complaints procedures because the dsps ARE the complaints procedure. They will bleed you dry on hire Van's and you have no say on what they will charge you, they will valet it when it is already clean and take the money out of your wages, check EVERYTHING as they charge you for damage under the bonnet, I.e windscreen washer pump £150 before my hire. They tried to give me a van with balled tyres and break pads, ended up paying my own money to get them fixed so I could at least keep working, no dsp support. They cut your hours if you buy a van so unfortunately you are capped. If you work hard and fast your expected to help the lazy ones, it's great to help for teamwork but when they've been there 6 months, made to train drivers for free. Bullied and robbed"
bad,Lack of communication no respect for some employees strict things inside the warehouse is a dangerous Zone some of the managers do not take the employees communication skills to be important cuz they feel like they know better because they've been there over the years
bad,The worst place to work. This company treats employees terribly. My aunt passed away so I took a few days off. This company had the nerve to ask me for a death certificate or face consequences. Safe to say I did not provide a death certificate and I put my 2 weeks in. They fired me the day i put in my 2 weeks. Screw this company
bad,"Worst place to work,just modern slavery,they will set you very unrealistical targets and you just cannot do a quality work because they dont care anyway about quality,its all about productivity.Work as fast as you can and do as much as possible.Worst job I ever had!"
bad,Déçu mauvaise paye mauvaise expérience mauvais fonctionnement
bad,"Worst place I have worked, management is unprofessional and disrespectful to its employees. Employees work 12 hour shifts with no break and do not receive benefits except cheap insurance and almost no vacation days."
bad,"If you want to be over worked and treated like trash, this is the place for you. If you get hurt at work they will turn there back on you in a second. I Know this by experience."
bad,"poor communication between management and staff"
bad,Employees are pushed to hard. Expect employees to make unit goals 24/7. Amazon is the number 1 company in the world with the highest rating for employee injuries.
bad,"Terrible place to work. The injury rate is sky high and the management could care less. They acknowledge certain parts of the building are severe safety hazards yet simply say they are working on fixing it instead of actually doing something about it. They track all of your movements using a chip in your badge, The pay is bad for the work you do."
bad,My good experience in good is very hard job for me . 10 hours standing job and is very difficult time of takes I am happy in this experience warhorse Amzon
bad,"Ayant été préparateur de commandes chez amazon, Je déconseille fortement aux intérimaires de rejoindre cette société."
bad,"dont care about staff. really bad system. management doesnt help at all j "
bad,"Very misogynistic and inappropriate. The management has no clue what is happening 90 percent of the time. They will over work the hard workers, and text woman inappropriately to their personal phones."
bad,Horrible place to work managers are two face. It's like a cult your a number arobot a nobody there treat u like scum. I would rather die then ever work there again
bad,Since the day I started working at Amazon I realized that all that they said in the orientation was false they don't follow any policy or regulations floor supervisor call themselves Manager who have no idea what management is all about it's just a number game if you are interested in working there please don't cuz the will mentally and physically harass you all the time by giving wrong instructions and then holding you responsible for their wrong action  ra
bad,I got injured and hade ammonia in they Terminated me this job suck to work at cause of the Arizona laws I can’t believe what happen to me there and my knee injury came from standing on a cheap mats there
bad,Facility DFW7 does not care about the employee and the HR program do not have empathy for the workers nor does the  GM at DFW7. Worst part about being there was the staff discouragement to be a worker at Amazon .
bad,Lavori duramente per poi sentirti dire il lavoro è calato ti lasciano a casa in centinaia in pochi giorni.Poi passi più volte in agenzia e vedi centinaia di persone che fanno corsi per amazon. Persone che conosci lasciate a casa per stessa motivazione e e altre che conosci che vengono chiamate per lavorare.Siamo stati usati e trattato business dietro.Poco seri!
bad,Management is the worst. Expectations are not met. False advertisement and most of the people are apathetic. Easiest job in the world but yet people still don’t want to do it. I rated this job 1 star but I’d rate it zero stars.
bad,They make up new rules every week so they can screw you over and make threats of taking money off your paycheck. You are responsible for everything and you are lucky if they are willing to lift a finger to even insure the company vehicles run.
bad,"If you are in non tech position in amazon, your life is going towards dark. U will never find an opening outside having Amazon's non tech experience. U have to stay in this company forever. Or u have to learn something technically move to tech job as a fresher. Eventually your time here is considered as wasted time."
bad,No support  wouldn’t recommend to anyone  I work there for 6 years and it was the worst   No one listens to your suggestions at all  you are like a machine to them
bad,"They treat people like they are not human beings. You are supposed to function like a robot, while the machines break down whole night. The warehouse is so big by the time you get to the break room to eat your lunch nearly 10  minutes is gone from your lunch."
bad,"Sono pazzi e sfruttatori.All'inizio sembra tutto bello dopo si rivela un disastro,per la pausa mensa si ha 30 minuti e va' bene peccato che devi fare una bella camminata per raggiungere la mensa,fare la fila,mangiare di corsa e ritornare in postazione il tutto in 30 minuti con relativo mal di stomaco seguente,pessima esperienza."
bad,"i do not recommend anyone to work there, because does not treat their staff properly and the conditions are poor. Not a experience I would do again..."
bad,The job is a lot of pressure you must deliver all of your packages in a timely matter. You will receive any where from 185 to 250 plus packages while your co worker may receive 130 to 150 packages. This to me shows the inconsistency & unprofessionalism of there character. You're just another number to them & if you can't do the job they'll find someone else. This is why the turn over rate is so high. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone.
bad,I would highly and I mean highly not recommended applying at Amazon you will regret it working for Amazon is like having no life  they paid me poorly they worked me till I was over worked had no time to sleep the supervisors were very unprofessional
bad,"Scan, move, repeat, all day everyday ad-Infinitum with the only changes being you may or may not ever see the people you worked with/ for again the next day and not know why."
bad,"Milieu stressant, cantoné a son poste, faire ses côta sinon la porte, pas arrangeant, même horaire pour tout le monde du coup gros bouchon systématique le matin et le soir, déçue."
bad,Do not recommend at all. The turnover rated is extremely high for a reason. I think Amazon doesnt care about the human cost of their affect its employees.
bad,"Listen, if someone says that working for Amazon is all ""Dasies and Ponies,"" then they are telling you a HUGE bold faced lie. This company could care less about  their employees and their physical health. Management only cares about their quota (which ""magically"" goes up every few minutes) and their customers. If quota is not met (even for a new hire) you will be written up, or ""laid-off."""
bad,Salary is extremely poor. Working hours was unreasonable. Job culture from management was to MICRO manage and not trust their team. High expectation with no reward.
bad,"Worked at Amazon in Rugeley the wage was great but the distance I found was very far. Its warehouse is huge and if your fit or done warehouse you handle that. "
bad,"Goes through employees quicker than any company Ive ever seen. There is a new manager every week. Workers would get very few hours for an already low pay, with very poor benefits."
bad,I worked in a hostile work environment caused by the employees who worked there and management. They would change my hours so they wouldn't have to pay me overtime. They stole money from my paycheck and when I talked to them about it and informed them on my intent to sue they fired me.
bad,"The work environment lead to the decline of my health to a degree, happy to not work there anymore. I really did not enjoy the work and the breaks seemed too short for how much i was doing. Worst location, try for a different one if possible"
bad,"This place is overall a good job; however, at times can be very unprofessional. There isn't any employee engagement and the cultural is not well. They need to improve in lots of areas."
bad,"This company is always about favoritism, they will not cross train you if they don’t need u in the specific department you want to be trained in. If you never use your time off they will respect you otherwise they’re rude to you."
bad,"Job security is zero, they recruit for permanent position and just like that change poor employees to contract and push everyone out , they just recruit people when they have peak hours ...very bad !!!!!!! This changing of permanent position to contract is done by the internal hrbp people which is really undigetable , I don't know why they fake people"
bad,"Horrible just horrible................................................... back breaking labor, standing all day, working 11 hr shifts. No flexibility at all. Your needs are not important and they don’t care if you get injured or hurt or lose a family member. They still require you to come in and work. If not you’re fired."
bad,"Criminals, slave drivers, lazy management, parking lot favors, discrimination, complainers, dirt bags, lazy employees, only thing good was a few coworkers were chatter boxes"
bad,"Dès le début de poste, on vous fait danser comme des filles de joie, frustrant pour un homme, afin que tout ces chefs de service puissent prendre leurs pieds en vous mattant et tout ça bien sûr, en musique !"
bad,I wouldn't even let rats work for these people And everything else about it is bad there is nothing good about this job not a good atmosphere no good people and you'll be very disappointed to work for people who do not care about other peoples lives all the bosses do is sit on their backside all day long receive big paycheques
bad,"Not enough time and the job took a ton of energy. Amazon had only paid a fix amount of pay with little to no incentives. Everyone uses Amazon to get items,but if they actually see all the work that goes in to getting their package to their home they may shop somewhere else."
bad,i was a mail handler and i scanned package too and i didn't  like the job because the boss was nasty and they work you like a dog and the place is too cold and low pay too i was not happy there
bad,"I worked my last 14 months for amazon, and I moved from one city to another, breaking my leasing spending a lot of money to go to another location, and my last 3 months worked 60 hours every week always on foot, making my best for them, and one day with no reason they fired me! I still cant believe it! But it is what it is! I understand now why people dont like to work for them!"
bad,"It was not my cup of tea. Very hectic, communication sucked! They Expect everything for nothing! Just throw you in and you either got it or you don't. I have a hip replacement so the metal detectors were a constant pain!!!!"
bad,"Do not work here as a driver or work here period.Find some thing better.This is not worth the stress or aggravation.I have been a Prime driver for a year now.And it's horrible ,They are continuously trying to belittle drivers every day.No matter what we do or how good we are.We still are not perfect to amazon.They treat drivers like Dirt.They continuously changed rules and expect the drivers to follow them.They expect drivers now to clock out for a lunch break for 30 minutes using ADP app.While on the road mind you.And the Mentor App they use lie's completely.Any way to cheat you out of money."
bad,Amazon is literally the worst company I have ever worked for. I worked in the warehouse and it was absolutely terrible then I switched to being a delivery driver and it was even worst. Amazon does NOT care about their employees at all. All they care about is the packages and nothing else. I wish I was over exaggerating but I'm not.
bad,It was stressful and problematic to the point that I got hurt because they sent me to a floor by myself and I ended up pulling a muscle in my lower back
bad,They will treat you vastly different if you work there as a temp versus you being a permanent employee. If you work here as a temp keep your head down and do not speak up or you will be fired that day.
bad,"Management has blinders on for some employees lets certain people do what ever they want such as cherry picking which end up giving the people on the end of the line nothing to ship or to heavy a tote"
bad,"Staff are not treated well at all. People are being sold the world and given an atlas!"
bad,"their biggest fear is unions so anyone who is popular and friendly is sacked."
bad,Le poste de chauffeur livreur chez amazon ne m'a pas convenue
bad,This comoany only cares about numbers if you get injured on the job they fire you refuse to let you see a doctor and will not pay you if your hurt and cannot work
bad,"Amazon is not a destination; it is a means to an end. No one plans on staying long here and with their current procedures, most don't even have the chance to consider a lasting ""career"" ( I use that term lightly as few can/ actually want to do so)."
bad,"Worst company i have ever worked for, you have no home life and the supervisor are little kids that don't have a clue how to deal with anything i would not advise anyone to work for amazon"
bad,"Very stressful, bad pay, and lots of work. I would not recommend it to anyone. They bring new people daily, track your time and are very strict with breaks."
bad,"No es buen empleo,te estresan no valoran tu trabajo"
bad,"Pay the employees $20/hr after payroll deductions. They deserve better."
bad,They will literally work you like a slave. They give you 150-200 stops to do a day. No raises or room for advancement . Dead end job. Horrible experience .
bad,"Amazon is  a Horrible, Horrible,Horrible place. Amazin . Needs to be put out of business.  The abuse  I have suffered here is inhumane and deplorable.  Please do not work here at the stl5 location. They are despicable,  hateful meanspirited, team leads. Amazon is Grossly overrated. I hope a plane crashes down in the building along with all the hateful mean spirited backbiting Dogs they are. They need to be flushed down the toilet with my poo!!!"
bad,"Working for Amazon was one of the worst experiences in my life. Between the drive to basically break the equipment to meet numbers and an utter ignorance for employee safety, it's no wonder what Bezos is as rich as he is. Corners are cut so hard, I'm surprised that the building isn't a circle. Workers are expected to meet ridiculous numbers every day, and since no worker is allowed to meet a full work week's hours, the increased pay from minimum wage actually means employees are payed less than minimum, with no insurance. And yet somehow, there are people there obsessed with adding hours to their shift, even going so far as to jam machines to do so. It's abysmal, and I'm glad I am no longer apart of that individuality-devouring machine."
bad,"I loved the actual work. You were basically on your own after you loaded up your van with that day's deliveries. Being outside all day and the challenge of completing your route 100% made the job a lot of fun. I can excel at anything and this position was as easy as they come. I came from a professional sales background with a ton of management and customer service experience, so I think that helped me represent the Amazon brand above and beyond. The bad part about working for Amazon is there is absolutely no ownership when it comes to management. Communication isn't poor, it's NON-EXISTENT! to top it all off, I was assured by the 2 top Station managers in person, in their office, that I would be kept on after Peak season ended...that I was too valuable to lose. I was laid off within 2 weeks. They will lie to your face about any little detail."
bad,Rubbish to work for. Stay away paid wrong every week Van's dont work management dont seem to care for your problems until your van has been unloaded and returned back to depot
bad,Not a good company like Bezos is the slave master and you're the slave. Too much much much much much much much much work in the 8hr shift or whatever.
bad,Bei der Arbeit ist man durchgehend im Zeitdruck und wird von den Chefs/Leitern nicht als Mensch gesehen sondern als eine Maschiene.
bad,amazon mets beaucoup trop la pression a cest employer
bad,travail fatiguant et pas bon pour la santé mais surtou ppour le dos
bad,"Amazon  discriminate against women. "
bad,"Rude people, they don't go over the work so you know can understand better. Coworkers are also rude, talk behind your back don't help you when you ask for it."
bad,"Good place to work people  are cool problem with timeclock. Lot of overtime "
bad,"mode de travail trop exigent par rapport au salaire proposer, toujours en stress, discrimination sexiste.."
bad,"Working at Amazon, in my opinion, is similar to modern-day slavery. It's been a year since I worked there and I still have issues with my elbow. I have had physical therapy and cortisone shots in my elbows and they still hurt. I can hardly lift anything and I can't fold my elbows, because it will hurt even more.  Sleep is uncomfortable. I see no reason, in my opinion, to have the shifts that they do.  Their  30 min lunch is a complete joke because by the time you walk from on side of the building to the next its time to go back to work. They refuse to give their employees an hour lunch why? Amazon CEO only cares about the bottom line which is the main problem with 99.9 percent of companies in the world. When will they start to consider the less, fortunately, and treat us all equally?"
bad,"They don’t care about you "
bad,"They worked us like a sweat shop. The managers did not know what they were doing all straight out of college. They were demeaning, liars .  They threaten our jobs daily. Told us if we talked to the"
bad,Es war Seher Stressig und man wurde die  ganze Zeit beobachtet mann musste immer nach einem festgelegten Taimer am Wand mit der aktuellen Bestellung fertig sein
bad,"Only work no fun as there moto is Work Hard Have Fun Make History, Management is literally not good, they are not looking on everyone wiyh a single eye, discrimination is all around. Like there is a TL name Ghansala."
bad,"These people are overworked, disingenuous, high strung & all about WIIFM.   I was unimpressed   Actually had a Co-worker say out loud they wanted to sh oot someone in the face and I was the only one in the office at the time   I said something to my manager but nothing happened   I moved on   The psy cho stayed"
bad,Absolutely unfair treatment. You pay out most of your wages for your van and petrol. If you have no work for the week you still have to pay for the van hire. Petroleum cards cancelled until 1/1/2020 so you have to pay for your  own petrol!!!!!!!!! If you decide not to work you are still out of pocket because you still have to pay for the van hire! If you take the van back for that week you lose Job!
bad,Was terminated unfairly and they knew the issue but still fired me unfairly.it was a very common practice to terminate employees for not keeping up a rate that t was not realistic.
bad,very bad management and safety team its like they only cared about the numbers but not about what it takes to reach there goals people peeing in bottles just make there hourly numbers they wouldn't leave there machines and supervisors wouldn't pay attention to people and there safety such as how many people picking in one lane or the breaks we are supposed to get didn't seem to matter.
bad,Conditions inhumaines exploitation dans tout les sens du terme
bad,Working at Amazon was extremely pressure your are required to meet un realistic targets theres a lot of politics and unfairness   ridiculous hours and constantly on ur feet for 11 hours breaks are non existent as you have 30 mins of 2 breaks but the place is so big by the time you get ur lunch you have 10 mins to eat n go up.
bad,"Not a pleasant establishment to work due to overwork, unnoticed performance, favoritism, cliches environment, discombobulated communication and limited 30 minutes lunchbreak within a 10 hour shift. A lot of cut throats with subordination attitudes which brings the values of Amazon to SHAME!!!"
bad,During my time working at amazon. They didn’t have any interest in employee health. They only cared about if your working or not and the hours were outrageous. They wanted me to work 60 hour weeks with only 1 day off with little to no leanientcy.
bad,"worked here for roughly a year, got told I was done by the agency pmp ,Amazon don’t want to give contract was the reason, a year work though is ok with them. No loyalty to staff. Managers are bully’s imo. People don’t approach them because they get spoke to like a dog. I would not recommend taking a job here"
bad,"Management tried very little to ensure productivity. No consequences for any action at all. Tried giving opinions to help production and make workers more productive but was unheard, and shamed for bringing to attention"
bad,It’s a good job pays really well . Have pros and cons I don’t know what else to really say about the Job other than work their and find out that’s all
bad,"They work you like a dog and do not care about your well being. You are nothing but a number to them. If you do not hit the goal, they write you up immediately. Doesn't matter if it's off by one. Three strikes and you're out. Developed many health issues during my time here. They are more worried about your flaws than your success. Managers are constantly on you about working harder even if you are at your goal. Have had a few managers become very disrespectful towards me and run their mouths about me to other employees instead of telling me what the issue is. The holidays are the worst. The paycheck at the end is good but the hours will drain your energy."
bad,Working at Amazon was like going back to high school everybody talking about everybody making up lies doing whatever they want lot of favoritism not based on work ethic promotions or educational
bad,"Long hours, over worked and under paid. Be prepared for peak season where you work 300 hours in 30 days with 3 days off. Minimum 10-12 hour shift. Mandatory."
bad,"Horrible overall, dont care about employees, only making money. Barely pay you, dont give you hiurs, no discounts or anything. No benefits. They dont care about you advancing theough the company. They go around laying people off without any notice or separation pay."
bad,"This company will fire any man that is accused of being less than friendly to anyone. I watched the same woman get three different men fired by lying about them, regardless of CCTV proving she was lying. Lgtqaarp friendly, though."
bad,"Somewhat flexible, inappropriate relationship between manager and married person. Favoritism, some of the"
bad,"I did not enjoy working there, plan to never return. It was more the management then the work. I would get complained at for doing a lack of work when I was doing more work than others."
bad,does not care about employees. we are just numbers in their game. they claim that they take care of employees until there are hard times or lifes challenges with employees. then they do anything possible to terminate
bad,"They lie on work load,  they give more then yu can handle. Poor management and you get fired for too much Overtime! They vans are not safe at all ! I hurt my foot by getting out of van! There's no foot stool attach to van"
bad,Amazon sounds good and they make the company seem like some it’s so exclusive to work for but in all reality they are running a sweat shop. It’s ridiculous. Turn over rate is horrible. Nobody actually cares about you they only care about your rate. You have to kiss WHOLE BEHINDS to advance within the company and the standing in one spot for 10-12 hours a day was killing me. I’d rather run in circles than to stand still.
bad,"Davvero un brutto ambiente, troppo frenetico e stipendi molto bassi"
bad,The turn over rate for this company is so high because they do not support their staff like they should. They have you on your feet for long hours handling heavy boxes for 6 hours with a mere 30 minute break. They care more about numbers than actually helping their employees. I would never work here again.
bad,"Amazon did not have the resources needed to run my department."
bad,"If your not mentally strong u cant work there, and they monitor you every min if you slow stowing , and its a very hard job,they use the payment to confused people so they  can come and work"
bad,"First, when you show up to work on your first day and are told ""we don't have time to train you"", not a very good way of getting to know your new employees. Second, don't fall for the flexible scheduling they tease you with by letting you ""pick"" your days and hours. After one week, it all went out the door and they tell you what you will work whether you like it or not. There are a lot of people running around with Ambassador and/or Training vests on, however none of them know what they are doing and most of the time they are hiding. More supervisors/managers than actual workers. If you like 10-12 hour days 6 days a week, this would be the perfect place."
bad,I think it’s very unprofessional to host an hiring event and tell people they are hired and then you don’t actually hire them. Nor do you send out a rejection letter or anything stating that they didn’t get the job. The hiring event started at 1 and the manager came in around 2:30 . He stated that he was punctual but to me he is very unprofessional and they are very unorganized. Need better management!!!
bad,Is set up like a plantation can't even use the bathroom when I was there it was horrible and they treated me very unfairly don't feel like it's a good place for anybody over 40 maybe if you're into sports most of the people that work there had a first job so it was something that they had to do for the holidays it's a lot of stress and quotas
bad,Work at amazon is not paid how it should. They will make you work up to 60 hours as mandatory OT. If you cant show up you have to use your PTO or UPT. If you dont have enough expect to be fired. Sick leave does not exist there.
bad,you will have slip discs and company would not pay for injuries. It is better to stay away from such workplace. Try to find some thing else rather going here
bad,"I have no comments, other then Amazon is not just for anyone. The pay is good but once again Amazon is not just for anyone. I didn't have a bad experience working for this company other then the fact that their human resources were not considerateto my problems. Thank you."
bad,Don’t work here if you want any sort of job security or a home life.  Company is only looking out for one thing… The bottom line and a quota that is just unattainable.
bad,"Keep track of everything, take a notepad. Managers in operations are the worst, they are not a team and often argue and never on the same page. They expect u to meet quota with no work on the lines. They talk to u bad, very disrespectful. The GM dont even respect the place he been MIA for months. The facility is gone to peices bc of upper management and its reflecting in our overall numbers."
bad,"Amazon does not care about their people, you are a faceless number to them. A typical day as a picker consist of a brief before shift meeting then bouncing floor to floor picking. You could be on the first, pick a couple items and then get sent to the fifth floor, no consistency. When you ask about it, because you clearly cannot make rate like that, they offer no solutions and generally do not seem to care. Your breaks include walk time which in a building that size with only two break areas is ridiculous, and your lunch is unpaid. When you learn to pack, they expect you to get it within the first few minutes and get an attitude if you don't. Generally a terrible place to work. The money is good, but at what cost to your mental health?"
bad,I hated working there I was absolutely miserable and they didn’t treat their workers with respect and I was treated differently because I wasn’t in higher up position
bad,"Don't ever work in their warehouses. It is very dull and repetitive. They also do not let you talk with your fellow coworkers. It's like a modern-day sweatshop. You have to have exceptional scan rates, and you're not allowed to go to the restroom as much, since your scan rate will go down significantly if you take a break."
bad,"extremely physical, over-worked, always added unexpected tasks, difficult to move to management, only 30 min lunch with 10hr+ shift, broke many promises, did not care about employees' safety"
bad,"Shameless exploitation of desperate people in financial difficulty. Warnings on safety are clearly only intended to cover the company against any possible future litigation. In reality, due to the constant pressure to work quickly and achieve the prescribed 'rates' the tasks assigned to the 'associate' are impossible to achieve without risking injury."
bad,"This job is for you if you are able to do the following:"
bad,"Niemand zu empfehlen. Finger weg von dem Job, wir arbeiten unter Zeitdruck und werden beobachtet...."
bad,"simply because the work is fairly easy but your on your feet the WHOLE entire shift.. you only get 2 - 30 minute breaks which actually feels like 10 minutes because there are over 1000 employees on 1 shift alone and you literally have to fight over an microwave to heat up your lunch, people are tripping over your shoes just to clock out and get to their lunch. its like packed concert everyday at work. you do not get enough recognition and when you do its half a**, managers do not know a thing so there is no one to ask when your in a bind. they don't appreciate you at all. ive learned that working in an amazon warehouse is NOT for me. the people that you work with can be very messy at times and so can the managers. the pay is alright but its not worth you mental or physical health because this job can tear you down! sleep deprived, sore,etc. i highly suggest you find another job but its like you cant because no know wants to pay over $10 unless you have some type of degree!!"
bad,"Ok, the ""amazon"" driver job is a joke. They aren't organized, and it's all through 3rd party contracts. The pay is only $15 an hour when it should be in the mid 20s. They claim to have benefits, PTO, etc., but this is a glorified temp service which might hire you for 2 months then let you go when they dont need you. Also was told they work 362 days a year. Would not recommend anyone to this. Total scam."
bad,"Too much work, too much feedback, no matter how good you are you are still bad because you are not the top 10% of the North America in every single metric, turnover extremely high, had to report to 6 different managers in less than a year and a half (that probably says something) just don't go there"
bad,"This job is no good "
bad,"1. Disorganization is present in this facility; 2. Workers who work in this facility do not call their names and position (hide badges); 3. The significant excess of weight before loading into a cart for one person over 49 pounds (there may be back problems); 4. At the general daily meeting of employees, I don’t hear what they say. Why do not they use portable megaphone?; 5. Each employee’s personal information can be viewed including the address (I worry about my safety); 6. Before loading, people interfere with each other with trolleys, because behind the racks there is no clear distribution (the building is not so large) because of this, conflicts arise"
bad,Team leader pessimi presuntuosi non fanno niente non sanno valutare
bad,"All the managers care about is how fast you can scan so they can receive their bonus."
bad,Productivity and quality of work not recommended. Its a job till you find something else. Lay offs after Christmas. Get ready. Dont fall for management brainwashed meetings.
bad,"Working for amazon I thought it would be great, but you have managers that has favorited and those people have it a lot easier than the rest and you get write ups for stupid stuff like, going to the bathroom, getting a drink of water. When you get hurt the manger will tell you to get back to work. And tell you she’s going to write up up"
bad,"I worked for one of Amazon's third party delivery contractors.  My boss was nice so out of respect, I will not name the company itself.  "
bad,"We did work like wrap pallets, stage product and scan packages to pallets."
bad,"worst place to work at, benefits are ok. Lots of favoritism among management and HR team.  This place overworks you and does not pay you fairly. Any kind of leave always needs extra care from you end because the higher ups in this building do not care for their employees at all."
bad,"Not fun or helpful, awful management team in Carteret,  NJ. Awful work, with little direction or help from management. The only people who work and stay there do so because they can't find another job."
bad,Treat u like slaves full of foreigners management are rubbish job is rubbish food costs more than in the high street plus its awful people fainting working to hard for rubbish money agency work the lot of it treat u like a dog would not recommend it to anyone
bad,The only good thing abt this job is actually being on the road. but the time spent there BEFORE you’re on the road you’re bound to deal with some bs. The people in this company don’t give not one rats  abt you. They’re always doing things last minute and expecting you to just deal with it. They talk and treat you any type of way.
bad,"I do not want to answer, it is not a good to work for a career. It is only good for people like drama and lack of leadership. It is a company treat employees a number."
bad,da quando ho lavorato ad amazon e ho constatato di persona come sfruttano la gente ho deciso per presa posizione di non aquistare niente da amazon nemmeno se avessi trovato articoli conveniente(piuttosto che lavorare per AMAZON preferirei fare la fame)
bad,"Your scanner is monitoring you all the time. If you make mistakes, you get penalized. If you work slow, you get penalized. Management sets impossible  standards. You get rated every week. You are not a person, just a number."
bad,"You are judged by how fast your able to stow items into bins, and if your not able to hit the units per hour quota per week, you are given a warning,"
bad,Like building the Roman Empire  Remember the companies you thought that would rule the world  such as MBNA or Walmart and before that JCPenney or Sears just to mention a few well even the biggest crash or deflate over time  quite amazing so now Amazon is the front runner I think owners forget where they came from and if making billions you're overcharging and under paying employees
bad,Sono dipendente tutt ora di amazon tramite agenzia l azienda amazon non ha rispetto per chi lavora internamente non danno gentilezza sono senza un animo pebsano solo al loro risultato senza guardare come raggiungono il risultato trattano male moralmente e ti giocano alle spalle senza alcuna motivazione azienda senza rispetto per chi lavora che schifo
bad,Working for the PDA1 pick up was stressful and no profitable. I work hard for the few hours I was assigned and have yet to be paid. I've contacted both managers of the department's and everyone is passing responsibility. I see a Class Action Lawsuite heading towards Amazon if the standards don't change. Contacting the Labor Board for help with this matter.
bad,"the worst job what can only exist.. people treated like slaves..."
bad,Meaningless morning meeting then pushed all day for targets ( beyond excessive.) The whole 10.5 hours. Learn as you move with little or no support from management. It is now a place that speaking English is a problem for the people who only speak English. The bad working methods    that are a part of your working day like the heavy lifting that is supposed to be a 2 man job but told to carry on with the work causing a lot of injuries that become a long term problem for the employees.Some good people to work with and clocking off. In the house sitting wondering why am i going back the next day.
bad,Per fortuna che avevo un contratto di solo tre mesi. Pessimi manager e pessimi colleghi.
bad,If you want to be a slave Amazon is for you. For you like being told your replaceable and nothing but a number that can be replaced Amazon is for you. If you like working as fast as humanly possible or else Amazon is for you. If you like working for a company for 3 years and then the company moves closer to civilization and then your told your current salary is too high and we are going to
bad,"- Terrible Pathways Operation Managers with 0 people skills. Notorious micromanagement. My manager was the worst!!!"
bad,"They have treated me unfairly i cant explain in 150 characters."
bad,"I worked as a picker for a seasonal but was suppose to switch to full time. They are very unorganized, rude management, not enough equipment for everyone."
bad,"do not work there. Hire and fire, do not look after their staff. Health care benifit are good but you need them and they will not regards your safetly and have ways of firing you. Rate Rate RAte !"
bad,"I would not recommend this company to anyone. Managers and HR are racist people. They ""claim"" to be a equal opportunity employer but they aren't. If you are not gay or kiss butt you get treated horrible. Managers may have AA degrees hut do NOT know how to be a manager nor how to speak to employees. Horrible."
bad,Management a l americaine avec de mauvais formateurs.
bad,Management are more interested on productivity instead of employees. HR department consists full of idiots. Nothing is good to say about Amazon.If you have no option so join Amazon otherwise find some good company.
bad,You will wish you were dead.  Some days with the care that your potential supervisors give to safety you may well end up that way or at the very least crippled.  At least there's always the mandatory six day work weeks for peak.
bad,too many hours to have a life and the demand for production pushes the body to the limits. wouldn't recommend working here unless you're in dire need of money.
bad,"If you respect yourself don't work never for amazon and their subcontractors."
bad,I have worked there and didnt like it one bit the managers were too much of an idiot with everyone  so i dont recommend working there also they dont give u help if u want it
bad,"You don't know if you work tomorrow or not, bad conditions, manager thinks only him self, if you have extra mile you pay from your pocket, small roads - dangerous."
bad,"Was there less than a month before it dawned on me that all the promises the recruiters made about the actual job I was promised were complete lies. No one on my team wanted me there and yet I somehow managed to get hired I guess because they were desperate for anyone? I don’t know. HR was helpful in getting me out of there without absorbing all the damage of moving to a new city, I’ve been much happier since I left"
bad,"All information's at interview it's wrong "
bad,"Was with Amazon for little over a year, culture there was really difficult for me. It is like a slavery, took a toll both on mind, emotions and body. Experienced bloody noses all through the day working. Now that I have left, feel so much more empowered and calm. How competitive and anxiety driven it is here seeped into my relationships. Relationships and health are far more important."
bad,"I worked with Amazon for 6 months. The working atmosphere should be reviewed by the Workers Report Board of Canada, if there is one intact. The management team has violated so many human rights, for example, the security guards are all male and they are allowed in the women bathroom. I was let go because the protective shoes worn was heavy for my feet, I had to shuffle along at station10hours each day, 4 days per week, brutal to my physical being."
bad,"Stipendio da fame, contratto improponibile. Trovi ogni tipo di etnia, che non comprendono la lingua."
bad,"Having completed the interview process and being congratulated to work at Amazon via ADDECCO they then don't communicate back what is available."
bad,It’s a waist of your time and the workers play you like you are specially mentally slow When in fact I had autism . I ran the company up before I left . But now it’s looks dirty and old .
bad,"Terrible place to work, you are only a number to the company. You work hard to earn a position and someone who knows someone comes off the street and gets it before you without any previous experience."
bad,"Working for Amazon, was the same as a government job, or union gig. Everyone is so lazy, and make sure they leave enough work for the next person. You will never be appreciated for any hard work, or even showing up."
bad,"Amazon di calenzano la peggiore azienda che ci sia! sfruttano le persone e licenziano ed intanto le agenzie del lavoro guadagnano sopra di te!"
bad,Worked there for 5 months and trained in every role in my department and even became a trainer. And they fired me without hesition because i made a safety mistake that lasted 3 seconds in which safety mistake had no threat to my person self or anyone else. They see you no more than a replacable employee number. If you need a job that pays $15 a hour work here. But while you work here keep searching for a new job.
bad,"Głośno jest, że potrzeba pracowników szczególnie w okresie świątecznym. Radio, bilboardy, ulotki, nawet znajomi proponowali."
bad,"READ THIS IF YOU GET IN FOR THE WAREHOUSE ROLE, I was accepted through the face to face interview and then on the induction day they do a drug test (swab test). You do 10 hours of standing for each day out of the four you work. You are given 30 min for lunch which is not enough to eat. You get questioned for every minute you do not do as they say (in short its like labourers going into work and doing the same repetitive thing like robots) depressing environment."
bad,"Amazon is unethical. I had a schedule, did drug test and background test and passed. Put my two weeks in at other job just to find out my shifts for my schedule is no longer available. How horrible for a company to do. I have a family. This is a messed up company."
bad,"I (57 yrs), lasted 3 weeks and my son, (20 yrs), lasted 1 day. Learning Ambassadors, denied me a seat in the break room one night during our 15 minute break saying he was saving the chair for someone else. It was the only empty chair in the break room and I was told I couldn't sit! The SAME Learning Ambassador lied to me and refused to answer a simple question the same day. So, if you have that vest on you are special and some won't help new hires. "
bad,"A bad place to work. They don’t give you you full breaks and sometimes they don’t let you take them. They say you can’t use the restroom during your shift. Management is horrible.They told us last year we had to work our shift 3:00am to 7:00 am on Thanksgiving, got there early and was told they decided to close, so go back home, after waking up early to come in. They could told us in advance. When we had fires and they closed the freeway, only way to get there. They told us that we could get there if we really wanted to and docked our pay"
bad,Got around £600 pound in about the 3 month i was there this company i would avoid at all costs would ask you to go in on a morning with short notice deliver around 200 deliveries i would not work here ever again
bad,"Alors cette entreprise est remplie de chef d'équipe qui vous rabaissent et exploite tlm"
bad,The stress is not worth the pay they do not care about your well being or about the stress. No one is happy all they care about is how fast are you going not about how safe the work is.
bad,Bad attitude from agency staff. Badly organised warehousing strategy. Unpleasant place to work. Unrealistic targets. Inflexible approach by bosses. Bad place to work.
bad,"Viré au bout de 3 jours chez Amazon bretigny sur orge  ory 4. Juste parce que j'ai dis que j'avais très mal aux pieds au environs de 20h je finisais normalement à 21h et j'ai demandé exceptionnellement à rentrer plus tôt pour voir un médecin parce que le dernier bus est à 21h11. Le chef manager  m'a sermonné et il m'a fait croire qu'il m'emmènait voir l'infirmière, lâche qu'il est m'a fait viré par un autre. Amazon a juste besoin des robots humains oui oui des esclaves bien portant. Ils n'ont rien à ciré de notre avis notre santé. Tout va vite. Ils nous trouvent incompétent à peine commencé ils veulent qu'ont retiennent leurs modes de travail en anglais et français. Gros lol. À ma connaissance ils ont viré tout le groupe avec qui j'étais. Ils recrutent très vite et aussitôt ils virent très vite. Normal qu'ils soient toujours entrain de recruter. Fuyez amazon."
bad,Eh i just did flex so i really dont know.So far it was okay but i think they should give us more pay.They should consider how bad Houston's traffic is
bad,The owner at Postial Mile she don’t pay you your money. You don’t get hours. I don’t Recommend this company to anyone. Bad management. The Vans is unsafe. She have her son do the repairs. She pays here daughter and give more hours then the other employees.
bad,"I have worked part-time there, after around the six shift, I can tell you."
bad,Wenn man wie ein Sklave arbeiten und leben will mit der Angst jeden Moment gekündigt zu werden ist man hier richtig.
bad,Everyone is expendable there and none are valued. Their focus is on numbers and not people. They care not of personal circumstances or even personal health both physical and psychological.
bad,Worst place i have ever worked! I mean the wage sounds great when you start £500 a week is decent pay sure but not when you have to pay nearly £200 of that back per week on hiring a van from them and petrol which you are only given a fraction back of! That coupled by the fact that they make out that you will only work 6-8 hours when in reality you’re working 10-12 hours a day at a minimum. They hate when you bring parcels back but they also expect you to never leave a parcel anywhere other than the owners hands. Impossible if people aren’t in.
bad,Horrible! Worst work environment of my life will never recommend to anyone EVER!!! RUN THE OTHER WAY AND DONT LOOK BACK! It's a sad stressful cutthroat environment where no one is honest with you!!! All management has scripted answers to any questions you can think of.
bad,"A czy ktos powiedzial wam  o normach przecierz ich niema w umowie  .Ogolnie kicha pelna, wejdzćie na gogla na kalkulator  brutto netto ,klamia z tymi 9-ćioma tysiacami potem powiedza  ,ze za puzno sie przyjoles i dlatego masz mniej stary ich numer nie polecam tej pracy juz caly szczecin ma ich dosc  ,ale jak cos to przekonacie sie sami ja tylko ostrzegam"
bad,All you are is a number. Your physical and mental wellbeing mean nothing to this company. If you can’t keep up with unrealistic expectations they will replace you. They don’t care if you’re being sexually harassed. Amazon treats people like robots and if you can’t make their rate for production you’re done
bad,Wouldn't recommend anyone to go and for work for Amazon! Management are terrible and needs to learn more about the delivery business.They want so much done but not willing to pay and that's not good at all.
bad,Most of management is inexperienced under 30 lots of favoritism poor training and you get no guidance learn on your own atmosphere but quick to harass you if you made an error
bad,"Catastrophique comme expérience, plus jamais je n'irai travailler dans cette société de redneck."
bad,"they sell the dream and in reality you are working for less then minimum wage as your own boss. daylight robbery. £124 per day was my rate, i had to pay £191 per week for the van hire, then the fuel costs were easily 3 figures per week. this may seem like a great job opportunity but it really isnt. in this case the grass isnt always greener, only do it if you are out of work!"
bad,"I was initially excited to start working at one of my favorite companies, Amazon. Everything was going good until I injured myself ON THE JOB. I hurt my back, to the point where I could BARELY walk and was in EXCRUCIATING pain! Therefore, I had to take 2 days off to rest my back. After that I went back to work for a week and everything seemed fine til I go in for my shift on Monday and my badge to get in didn't work! Come to find out, I was terminated due to my absence on the 2 days when I injured my back! No notice, NOTHING! So when I go in to find out what is going on, all I get is ""you are terminated due to attendance"". Mind you, I reported that I wouldn't be at work just like we are supposed to but they didn't care. SO MY ADVICE IS RUN, RUN FAR AWAY!! If you don't believe me, there are TONS of of websites listing 1000's of lawsuits against them!"
bad,Management sucks and no raises.  Everyone stalks you to get higher up. No room to grow. The head boss find any reason to fire you. I'm so suck of working there.
bad,"e LBG4 fulfillment center in Redlands, CA.  My primary assignment was working on the ship dock.  I worked with one heck of a team, with good primary leadership.  It was the the area managers and other top personnel that I considered very weak."
bad,"Went to a group hiring fair for a position at the fulfillment center. You sit through a 30 minute presentation and Q&A session. At the end they pretty much tell you will be receiving a job offer once you pass a background check. I passed the background check and received my offer letter in my email telling me that they are scheduling training and orientation dates. 3 WEEKS!! go by and I finally get a letter from the recruitment team saying that they are no longer scheduling training and orientation and to try again later. A huge waste of time, glad I didn't rely on this as my only job offer. For a huge logistical company they suck at employee/employer logistics. Do not waste your time"
bad,"Working at Amazon's fulfillment center was hands down the worst job I've ever had. The quotas were near impossible to hit, and the managers kept expecting us to hit them. The warehouse was always uncomfortably hot, upwards to 90°F in the spring. Workers were prone to passing out, and all Amazon did was give them an ice pack and tell them to get back to work. While the starting pay is alluring, it's akin to the siren's song. I can not stress this enough, DO NOT work for Amazon."
bad,"I worked at Amazon for over 1 year as a temporary associate. I had worked inbound, outbound, stowing, put away, megasort, picking, packing, transport, and receiving. I also worked 48 hours EVERY week because my pay was very low as temp. Even after working almost 50 hours a week for 1 year, and being ""flexible"" Amazon REFUSED to hire me full time. Instead I was laid off because they were getting rid Staff Management X or SMX. That was the agency I worked for. Again Dont listen to Amazon when they say hard work pays off. NO IT DOESN'T!! You are being lied to so they can make millions and treat you like a slave! STAY AWAY from ANY Amazon Fulfillment site!!"
bad,very poor work life attitude at this company.  they do not care about their people what so ever. and they do not pay very well. would not recommend these guys to anyone.
bad,While in there the stress level never went to normal. No meter how hard you work ther is always a possibility of staying without job. You are only wanted when they need your work power.
bad,"Wouldn’t recommend to anyone, only if you are desperate. They will say they care about you and your safety but really just want you to shut up and reach the targets you have set out for you. You could be dying and they couldn’t care less. Breaks are taken up by walking to your locker and grabbing personal items so really you have only a 25 minute to 20 minute break depending on where you are situated in the warehouse."
bad,You will never be recognized for all the hard work you put in no matter how much you slave. Promotions only go to those who get friendly with and kiss up to the right people. Backstabbing and deceit is encouraged which created a miserable toxic culture. Even the HR at my building was corrupt and under investigation at one point.
bad,If they don’t want you they will find a way to get rid of you trust me. I never had my manager number I don’t even know who was my manager. Sometime the manager is half your age
bad,"Amazon is bad place to work for I been there for one year, and I never got move up there cuz if you do not kiss butt you well not move up, also you need to know how to  Speak Spanish cuz that all what work there no one there really speak English, aslo if you are late one minute they well take one 1hour of pay from you, also if you get sick there they well not send you home, cuz they do not care about they worker there just never work there you well thanks me"
bad,"The seasonal position is toxic"
bad,"Work  place was stressful, there where many changes which is never a bad thing. But these changes made work harder for other and it was less effective in most cases."
bad,"If you want to work at Amazon, be prepared to become a robot. No human contact, 10 hours per day working no stop, closed in a cage(picking) , doing the same thing over and over again. Alienating"
bad,"Act like a robot, rate rate rate. Terrible place to work. If you have to go to the bath room you better hold it. Good luck eating in the allowed time."
bad,"They tell you your going to be working seasonal for at least 6months than fire you after 3 because they don’t need the labor, but keep bringing on more outsourced people, than after about 2-3 months they hire people on for the same positions they didn’t need"
bad,They try to write you up at all times it’s like a bonus for management if they succeed managers  hit on women then they try and cover it up saying they want the managers to know your personal life and be personal with you why? They don’t want you to succeed and forget about advancement tried to get them to teach me other positions all they did was ignore me trust me if you don’t care about this stuff work there otherwise n
bad,"Amazon was one of the worst companies I've worked for.  They talk a big game about valuing employees, but don't live by those values.  Leaders are treated so badly its pathetic.  Your contributions are constantly criticized and you are talked down to by all levels of management.  If you are a leader you are not even treated as if you are human.  Hey, they pay you big bucks and slap on those golden handcuffs so I guess they don't feel the need to treat their leaders with basic common decency and respect.  Turnover of leaders at Amazon is atrocious.  But hey, if you are the kind of person who is motivated by being yelled at and criticized, then you'll fit right in at Amazon.  If you like working in an environment where you can't trust your colleagues, then please apply at Amazon.  If you can't stand your family and want to spend 55-65 hours a week working, then Amazon is the place for you.  If you like to pour yourself in your job to make a company successful, only to have your contributions dismissed, then Amazon is the place you want to be."
bad,"Very uneducated and unprofessional crew."
bad,"If you get assigned as a picker, leave. It's a lot of running around, and job performance is based on items picked per hour. Except you can't control if you need one piece of jewelry in a bin with literally over a hundred of them, and then have your next pick across the warehouse. Or even on a different floor."
bad,Unrealistic worker expectations don't ever work here! They had meetings during lunch where the veterans at the facility were 2 years if that has anything to say about the company.
bad,Hi just want to share my experience with Amazon hiring. Applied for a job passed applications online called for interview passed the drug test and background check scheduled a start date and the stardate never schedule waited for 3 weeks called to candidate support they could never schedule me start date in the meantime I quit my previous job and did not get a start date with Amazon job don't recommend to walk therenobody could help me not a candidate support or no one else
bad,"Uno specchietto per le allodole. Una volta dentro, durante il turno notturno capisci in meno di un minuto come funziona, in poche parole una guerra tra poveri. Lavoro massacrante, demenziale e organizzato malissimo, vieni sprenuto in maniera fantozziana senza vergogna. Si nota subito la differenza tra i lavoratoi a contratto fisso e quelli interinali. Meritocrazia meno di zero, va tutto a simpatie, sicurezza sul lavoro tanto decantata da dimenticare."
bad,"If you have any sense avoid like the plague. Long hours , no time to go to the toilet or eat . Canteen is half your break away . Managers are rubbish!"
bad,I worked for them for 4 weeks and not been paid yet and I'm owed couple of thousand they tell lots of lies and never tell you the truth but want you to work like a dog for nothing
bad,"It was not very pleasant working here, as there are grueling 12-hour shifts and not many breaks. When your productivity slips, the managers confront you about it which is quite intimidating. You hardly get any time to spend with your family over Christmas, and there are unrealistic time limits to pick items and send them off for packing. The bosses seem to care more about profit than they do about the welfare of their workers too."
bad,Too much harassment in the workplace the p.a’s in the part time building are either smoking dope or they just don’t get basic thinking. The pay isn’t worth the stress and the only reason I worked there is I couldn’t find another job in time to pay my bills. They really really need to get better management. POINT BLANK IF YOU WANNA FEEL LIKE CRUD EVERYDAY WORK FOR THIS COMPANY.
bad,"At Amazon we’re not people, they pretend to care but in reality we’re written up over issues we have no control over such as glitches in the scan guns"
bad,"Worked here for a week and I’ve never been more miserable in my entire life. Disgusting Inhumane slavery, on your feet for 10 hours but the minute u sit down for a minute, they are on your case. Unrealistic 15 min breaks (takes a good 7 mins to get to the canteen for a quick snack) and need to be back at your station in time for the first scan otherwise your average rate falls and you’re basically Gone. There’s 1 set of toilets on each floor despite the floors being very big so by the time you’d have gone to the toilet, you’d have wasted 20 mins of the time you should of been working which once again brings down your averages rate resulting in management onto you and practically harassing you into working faster and basically telling you that if you want to work there you will not leave your station unless your dying.  You are completely isolated from the world,  no sunlight, no talking just pure labour. No idea how it’s legal. The most disgusting thing is they bring kids on school trips to show the place. You’re not allowed to call it a warehouse, only fulfilment centre but the truth is it’s more of a concentration camp than it is anything else. I first applied thinking the pay was good but after working there I’ve realised no pay is even worth this job and they really do get there money’s worth out of you. For the 10 hours your working, you’re practically a robot. The targets they give you , even robots cannot do. Management are awful, favouritism for the majority of polish and Romanian people, degrading atmosphere. The worst thing about it is that the majority of the people"
bad,"Plus jamais je n'irai travailler dans cette société de pourri."
bad,Quit my job in entry level tech to pursue entry level tech. Amazon has a program called CAREER CHOICE (deliver for Amazon for over 12 months and you're eligible for 90% paid education in tech) After 4 months told employees only have 11 months. Convenient. EVERYBODY. Everybody. was laid off yesterday (7 months 4 day$) tax
bad,"j'ai travailler pendant 5 mois au picking, il y'a des gens qui ont rentrer juste pour une semaine et il font d'autre chose moins pénible."
bad,Company sucks! They are very unorganized. My background came back and they told me to go for a drug screen  and never told me where to go. I sent the email after email with no response. This is not a professional company!
bad,The facility i worked in was so unorganized. The managers were really unprofessional. The tier 3s and even the learning ambassador treat you like you’re disposable and don’t care about how they talk to people. They really don’t do nothing to ensure safety. More than 70% of the facilities guide tape on the order pickers and the lanes are faded or non existent. There is definitely favoritisms in the warehouse. HR is highly unprofessional. They are mainly worried about equipment instead of your wellbeing.
bad,"Amazon is not a good company to work for. They say they will work with you but they dont. If you have an emergency come up, you are supposed to have enough unpaid time off hours to keep your job."
bad,"poor, not pleased with treatment. no chance for advancement. people good guidelines not good . enjoyed the folks I worked with however the pace is not to my liking."
bad,confidential not a great place to work at or for no time for yourself days off are spaced out can't couldn't relax on days off people are not friendly and very very competitive you are on your own most of the time
bad,Worked like slaves for minimal wage 205pound week on a van have to work 6 days to make it worth while avoid like the plague. 200+ stops took too long to even get around all weather no respect for drivers either managers are only there for 1 thing the MONEY
bad,"1 of 2 worse"
bad,"Hectic, chaotic and generally not a good place to work.  I left because I wanted and needed more than 30 hours after my ""conversion"" at the 90 day mark."
bad,Communication between managers suck they are very unprofessional bs job  they talk to you how they want talk to  young managers they are very immature
bad,"Do you wish to be constantly harassed by your managers that have no respect for you? Come to amazon then. You couldn't pay me any money to stay here and work, there is little to no ethics, there is hardly any training, anyone with this company long term is very arrogant and ignorant, people getting hurt all the time to name a few problems."
bad,"would not recommend anyone work at this place, the health and safety team laugh at you if you ask for their help, and the team leaders do not know what they are doing they have been in the job for 5 minutes and get asked if they want to go in HR etc. I was bullied in the corner and got asked to leave because I was 11 under. they do not respect there staff at all."
bad,Work with them for 3 months never late or miss a day. Got injury at home causing me to miss three days of work  came back with doctor and hospital note. Next day they email  saying I am fired because I abandoned my job by not showing up and the doctor note means nothing their policy surpass any note or letter from anyone or any place. Wouldn't recommend working there.
bad,As the saying goes it's like crabs in a bucket.  Everyone pulling the other down.  Most will say or do whatever they have to too make the next person look bad.  Management is fresh out of college and have no clue how to manage or deal with people.  They all need to go through a management class that deals with working with different personalities. No one knows what the  other person is doing fro. Top management to the sorry so called floor suoercisors.
bad,This company breaks everything down to the numbers.  People do not matter only production.  If you cannot keep up because of illness or family emergency you are gone.
bad,"Pessimo ambiente di lavoro, ti sfruttano al massimo e poi ti lasciano a casa per prendere altri da sfruttare."
bad,"Long Hours ,Lots of walking on concrete,Favoritism,not a good enviroment.Managers dont help if you have a problem,They only care about the numbers.Do Not Work there."
bad,"Bad experience. Bad managers. Horrible work hours. Coworkers were nice but that was it. It was too competitive , they asked for too much with very little time."
bad,"The worse place I did work for"
bad,"Warehouse is not ever cleaned always dusty and you commonly see people with surgeon masks on. Unrealistic goals set every hour (rate) and the cherry on top are the ""power hours"" which entices workers to go faster with meager rewards like 5 dollar gift cards for packing or scanning the most items for your department that hour. If you are caught sitting even for 15 seconds (and you will be because there are more cameras than items in these facilities) then you will be threatened with termination for not being productive enough. Breaks are too short and are from ""scan to scan"" so your 7 minute walks to and from the break-room are applied to this time. No ladder to climb just workers who quit after years of wear and tear on their bodies. Must go through a metal detector on the way out because amazon doesn't trust you but if someone brought a gun in the building nobody would know till it's too late. Only water while working which you must go 4 hours before a break on just water. Bathroom breaks are timed and action is taken if you go over a couple minutes each day (known as TOT or Time Off Task). Mandatory 60 hour weeks for peak season. last year it was 5 11's and 1 5 for 6 days a week - November thru December. MET (Mandatory Extra Time) can be called on for your shift at a moments notice sometimes less than 24 hours in advance so don't have a social life. Cannot listen to music on the job. Very little Paid Time Off is granted to workers (about 2 hours) every other week for ONLY 6 months then that's all you get for the rest of the year. Unpaid Time Off is 20 hours every 3 months"
bad,"Greeting customer taking returns and selling amazon basic products. I learned about how online retail has grown. Management needed more training and culture appropriation. The hardest part of the job was the day they sold that part of the company. Most enjoyable part was teaching the customers about the device,"
bad,It was only temporary for me but too much drama allowed for the volume of work to be done.. didnt enjoy it or the pay or the hours worked. Also too strict in pointless areas
bad,"I was told I can be brought back and hired on as full time."
bad,"This place is torture. Sure the work is hard, the hours are long, I can handle that. They will however put you through a mental meltdown. They will break you. At first and at every meeting they will tell you how valuable you are, how they couldn't do it without you. Then like an abusive spouse they'll start ripping you apart......"
bad,"Amazon is only a place t work for the young and thoe who have no pride in teh job they do, Amazon not interested in quality but only quantity. They do not even follow their own rules"
bad,"Bad, terrible , not a good place to work at. Not fair to employees. People are rude. Management is bad. Don’t care about the hardworking people. Don’t recommend."
bad,"A typical day at work was brutal. You're on your feet the entire time and work is fast paced. The culture is ok. It just took forever to walk to and from your station to the cafeteria for a break. A lot of the upper management were very supportive and tried to help out, however I always noticed many of the managers play favorites to certain employees and I didn't find that fair at all."
bad,"I've try to go to amazon Warrington, I've got a invitation for a event and when I arrive, they was very rude the staff, one was polish and didn't talk in English, I find frustrating and not respectful, they treated me as a number, they was make me feel very uncomfortable, both talking rude asking me why I was late but actually they give me a wrong address. After me was come another 4 people also they get lostbut they were busy having lunch, don't care outside its raining and we call as stupid to find out why the address provided was not good."
bad,Amazon will fire you if you sneeze wrong dumbest managers ever seen never picked before. Change rates everyday talk to like your a first grader lie backstab and these are the good points  if I could give a zero I would  also make sure every break you go to the bathroom because other wise time off task you have warned convicts have more rights then amazon employeesconvictshave more
bad,"If you want to pay to deliver packages, be a flex driver. Crazy routes will destroy your car and your bank account. What Amazon is paying here in Grand Rapids is not enough even for the car’s maintenance."
bad,"beaucoup de client a livrer par jour "
bad,"Amazon c'est une honte j'ai travailler 1 an chez eux, c'est de l'exploitation à me faire travailler le dimanche soir pour une Fin de mois catastrophique à 1100 net c'est un emploi qui ne devrais pas exister et Avec pres de 100 à 150 colis par jour à livrer desfois sans vigik Pour rentrer dans les immeubles..."
bad,honestly the only good thing about working remotely from home was the flexibility. You had no flexibility at work however. If I was a minute over from break I would be getting written up. Not worth the pay at all.
bad,"C’est purement de l'esclavage !!! Quand y’a pas d’activité on vous fait gratter le sol !!! managers zéro, incompétents, aucune reconnaissance pour le travail fourni ! Pause chronométrée !! En clair entreprise de Survilliers à fuir !!!"
bad,"The routes are crazy with a lot of stops downtown.  You have to carry 20 to 30 packages and hope you don’t hit a hole in the sidewalk.  The managers don’t seem to know what’s going on.  I got in trouble for having trouble with 200 stops.  I had only been there a week.  The heat is unbearable,  and GPS they have will make your day very long.  They put you in a different area everyday so it’s fun never getting a route to build speed."
bad,"Poor managment and co workers, good pay long days , very fast pased work, goood food in breakroom, they have bbqs and do funj things for you , win prizes, alot of pto"
bad,management seem very unforgiving and uncaring when it comes to adjusting to being on your feet all day. staff are treated as just bodies there to make up the numbers.
bad,It’s just too much going on. The job is stressful plus they cut off for extra hours. You will routinely do the same job every day with no advanced skills to a higher level.
bad,If you value life outside of work do not work at Amazon. Management pencil whips everything and no one is aligned to change anything safety wise if it means they won't hit goals.
bad,"non andate a lavorare ad amazon turni di notte a ritmi insostenibili con una paga da schiavo dal peggio del peggio sfruttamento.contratti di 3 mesi ridicoli poi cambio troupe.dovete chiudere dovrebbero fare come in svizzera che amazon non puo starci perchè li rovinerebbe il mercato,s efunziona cosi anche in altri paesi vi auguro di  fallire,(ma fallierete.)"
bad,It was a mess with the managers not knowing anything Not helping with anything. Tough job. Training is nonexistant. I saw people who quit before the first shift was over.
bad,"I was “fired” for getting into an accident while delivering because the company couldn’t charge me for the damages. They also accused me of cracking a windshield my second week of working there. I hade to pay $500. I was warned by other employees they blame who they can so they can get money. Isn’t that why they have insurance? I wasn’t even told that I was being let go, very unprofessional. Don’t care about their"
bad,They lost my i9 documents and suspended me because their hr team wasn’t trained at the time I tried to get it fix no I don’t have work and I’m not getting paid for something they done wrong
bad,They don’t care about you all they care of is how much you a hour. They dnt want  you talking to anyone or you’ll get a write up. The mangers are rude. If your not a female you would get any help
bad,darker toned people work here and amazon doesn't care if there put in harms way due to delivering packages in the dark with no uniforms plain white van and no lights
bad,"Probably the worst company I ever worked for. The management bully , the staff haven't got a clue and the whole atmosphere was akin to a work camp . You are constantly threatened with losing your job and eventually you say enough is enough and leave. An absolute shambles"
bad,"Même en CDI c'st esclavage pire cauchemar de toute ma vie , viré dans moins de 20 minutes en CDI"
bad,"Worked here for over a month started off ok on 65% route which I think should be a full time thing, but then went on 100% route, then got impossible to deliver in the time Amazon seem to think is possible even with speeding, if I moaned that it's ridiculous on the group then management would call and say I see there is a lot of whining going on, so I'd ask where are you right now? He would say at home, I'd respond well I'm still delivering your stupid amount of parcels, so yeah I think my whining is justified as I want to go home too and see my family, drops 10mins apart, 150 drops that's makes for a long day, no breaks, illigal driving hours, Amazon are a bad ppl lace to work, richest company on the planet because they don't care about the people that help make them rich"
bad,"Its a frenzy to try and get blocks, they continue to hire people that are not needed making it hard to even get a route. People have bot apps and Amazon does nothing to stop it"
bad,"Completa incoerenza tra ciò che viene detto e il modo di operare. Indisponibilità, incompetenza, arroganza e fanatismo. atteggiamento motivazionale completamente demenziale per dementi che dormono."
bad,"I’ve learned how to be friendly and how to respect people how to move at a fast paste and stay energized. "
bad,"worked 5 years at Amazon, changed 11 managers . change so frequently, not a stable environment. Learnt a lot, but could have learnt more in a more stable environment within 5 years time."
bad,"The 10 minute break is a joke because once you took off your harness, parked your pit machine, your break would be over. The higher up management is a joke because they literally don’t even know how to operate machinery but demand the impossible."
bad,I dnt recommend at all. Lack of work. Always waiting for truck at delivery station 🚉 . Always wants u to vto. Manager and supervisor needs to be better trained. Showing favoritism is horrible
bad,"It was a decent place to work at aside from wrongfully being let go, i personally would never recommend this job to anyone, they slave you and treat you as an animal. Wholeheartedly convinced the managers i had truly  didn't care for the people they were managing. They treated us as robots and only cared for our numbers being high because it made them look good to their bosses."
bad,"the worst place to work in and the managers don't have any knowledge. and they treat their employees as a machine, beside HR they taking manager side always."
bad,"Long hours. no work life balance, below industry pay. average benefits. toxic work culture, politics in all departments. run away from here. don't go by the name."
bad,"Ich würde Amazon keinen empfehlen weil ,ich war kurz davor einen Arbeitsvertrag zu unterschreiben plötzlich war eine totesfall in der Familie die hatten keine verständlich, habe keine Vertrag bekommen"
bad,"Everything is numbers, if your numbers fall behind on a really slow dawn, they threaten to fire you. You get six strikes before you're fired and every little thing will get you a strike. They offer part time and let you apply for it, but theres only full time when you enter the door. I left because they told me to my face I couldn't leave 15 minutes early to go to my college classes and that they didnt care about an individual's education."
bad,Minimum pay. Keep you seasonal and contractual so they dont have to pay benefits. High turn over rate always hiring and firing. Dusty and not a clean wear-house. If you are allergic to dust and dont want to work like machines for minimum pay - this place is not for you. MANAGERS are biased and have double standards.
bad,They currently have zero routes and just recently had a hiring event.  Give it about one more week when ppls background check comes through they will have an additional 30-40 drivers just standing there two months before Christmas. Stay away from 8824 e Adamo drive. Be a delivery service partner you are guaranteed routes. They have contracts to maintain.
bad,"It's not a good company to work for, management would make your life miserable if your not one of they friends,  the will send you to unload trucks,  load trucks or to do anything that their friends dont wanna do."
bad,"Amazon is not a company I would typically work for at first it wasn't so bad, then they started being harsh and rude. I had medical issues before I started there I had surgery a few months before I started and it was still affecting me and they chose not to care or listen."
bad,"I can only talk about the one of many new delivery companies created for amazon. I dont think the ppl taking on these companies have a clue as to how to run a delivery service."
bad,"If you are in a pinch for money it's fine but don't stay long, you are expendable to them and that is exactly how you are treated. Plan on having a new manager every couple months because they never stay long"
bad,"It is the worst company in the world to work, bulling, harrasment, very low culture, they insult you, and they scream at you, and if you don't reach targets they kick you out and if you working for more than two year's, HR looks at the way to get rid of the workers by bulling them, harresment, etc,  this job is not even for your job , it is a waste of time. I send this Company to Tribunal"
bad,If you take time off for being hurt you get fired without cause eevin if you bin there for over 6 mouth.. tarable pay almost every week mandatory overtime with only 1 day nontice. More you learn to do they don't pay u more so if you can do everything u get paid the same as someone who just packs. They don't fill out r.o.e. out property so it takes unemployment  forever to finger it out.
bad,"they hired me for 7am-3pm five days a week, but when schedules came out i wouldn’t be on them. after talking to countless managers, hr reps, and anybody that would listen, i was told that they only hire workers for flex schedules - meaning that the groups of people that were hired were only there to pick up shifts. "
bad,Challanging position. Difficult to find shifts that work consistent with home life. Co worker competition is highly valued. Workers are often sent home if there is no work for them.
bad,"Even though I had outstanding numbers and no concessions, they dislike the time I stopped delivering. I enjoyed to be able to drive around and learn about the different areas I'd go to everyday."
bad,"I never understood what SLAVERY is until I worked there. Low Wages, They treat you like a slave, and very stressful with horrible managers."
bad,no support at all from the managers whether you work for amazon directly or working through agency after making complaints about other workers throwing parcels they still did nothing about it
bad,"you are pushed every single moment, its clear management doesn't care about you they will harass, lie and cheat as long as it benefits them, worst job I've ever had. No one explains anything to you, management lies to you on a regular basis, completely unsafe working conditions. all of this took place at DLA8( Hawthorne CA)  (sun Distribution)"
bad,"I didn't believe all the bad press I heard about Amazon, and anyway I was going to work for Amazon Web Services, not in the retail side or at a warehouse, where most of the stories come from. Boy was I wrong. Soulless and backstabbing, unless you are into working all your waking hours and being a predator in the workplace, stay well clear of this place."
bad,"Do not work for Amazon. Amongst their many problems:"
bad,"No advancement"
bad,"Avoid this company, is the worst company from delivery's . You don't have life when you work for Amazon!  Very long hours, incredible routes, you can't finish the route, to many parcels, over 220 parcel every day, sometimes can be up to 250. So believe me stay far away. Is a shi....."
bad,"No security at all and awful management overall. Long hours, repetitive job with no probability of progression or development of any valuable skills. I met some good people there and good work environment between colleages."
bad,"They want (and have) a required amount of packages you do an hour. It's not ""hard"" work, it's just very steady and is apparently never ending. I didn't mind the 40 hrs/ 4days a week schedule... I kinda liked it. What I did mind was the mandatory overtime for a change of 60hrs / 6 days a week schedule. I applied for their ""supervisor"" position (yes I have experience) and was told after, it wasn't a requirement before, that I had to have a college degree... if I did have one, I would find a job somewhere else. All this was after I had been working for them for almost 2 years never missing a day, and had NEVER heard of the collage degree thing before then. It wasn't even a requirement to apply for the job."
bad,Work for 8 months had an injury so they fired me still fighting for my right to be cared for my injuries  Amazon is no better than a sweat shop they treat their employees like cheap toilet paper which is sad
bad,"It sounds like modern day slavery to me, ....................and they're allowed to get away with it ????? People aren't robots, puts me off ever going for it !!!!!"
bad,worst job people were mean an they treated temps like unfairly i think it needs better management that will respect their employees. I don't believe people should work there.
bad,"You have to be self motivated. NO ONE will hold your hand and tell you that you're doing a great job. If you need constant affirmations from management, this company isn't for you. More on-boarding training before new employees are thrown in the fire. The first couple of weeks can be very confusing on where to find the information you need that pertains to your job."
bad,"Do not apply with any regulations for care of employee. Work 12 hours a day, no breaks, extreme pressure daily to get parcels delivered. Didn't insure me for the use of the van which resulted in them taking my wages and me losing out on £1000 the week before Christmas."
bad,"The hours sucked ! The pay was good but for the hours we got it didn’t benefit any, they shorted my pay checks repeatedly and didn’t do much to try and fix it when I brought it to their attention"
bad,terrible experience stress through the roof push and push unmanageable roots and no suport still haven't recieved last week's pay and £350 for the van i hired
bad,"Management sucks  as well as HR because they do not listen to the voice who actually does the work in the warehouse.   "
bad,"Do not waste your time with this piece of trash company they don't care about you and definently don't care about African Americans, they fire you over the littlest thing if it involves one of they petty code policies, they'll throw you out the door like a piece of junk trash forget them forever on soul!!! 100%"
bad,"Amazon is by far the worst place I have worked,in the winter it's to cold and summer it's way to hot ,no air conditioning or heating ,they expect unrealistic targets that the majority of people struggle to hit as there so high,I'd never work here again"
bad,"Amazon doesn't care about their employees, that's the biggest problem. All they care about is production, if something comes up it ""happens to everyone"" and you're supposed to overcome it. Managers work long hours with no extra pay, stock payment not very much anymore."
bad,"Management team is shocking and the agency staff are the worse. I would not recommend Amazon to anybody. They dont see you as human beings, they see you as an employment number."
bad,Please donot work at this trifling place.Management is a rude awakening.Bad attitudes. Arrogant and nastiest management  staff ever. This is a modern day slave camp. Extreme heavy lifting and shorten breaks.From the time you leave your work area you are being watched and timed for the 30 minute break.This means you really only got 10 minutes.Lo and behold  if you have to use the  toilet then no break for you at all folks..My title is a trainer. Trainers get paid to watch you like a watchdog or they are hammered.Look forward to being belittled about any and every aspect of the job you WORK AT  IN ORDER TO MAKE YOU WORK FASTER.Again modern day slave quarters. DO YOUSELF A FAVOR.DONOT ATTEMPT TO  WORK HERE.PASS THE WORD.
bad,"The 10-12 hour work days will leave you beyond exhausted. I worked there for about a month and I had the overnight shift, it was a nightmare! I am in fairly decent shape and thought I would be able to handle it but I was wrong. After 11-12 hours on my feet I was barely able to walk. At the end of the shift, everyone leaving there looked half dead. And god forbid you can't keep up with their quotas. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. I believe they will crash, the bigger they get the more workers they will need and I don't know how long they will have enough employees to work like animals."
bad,"I've worked at an Amazon warehouse for about a month now.  Your advancement is based on a point system.  To be in good standing in order to advance, you cannot have more than 5 points.  I received .5 points on my first day for showing up to work 15 minutes early.  I had received and email from Amazon with my job offer and it told me my start time was 10:45.  I showed up at 10:30 only to find out the real start time was 10:15.  The trainers told me and everyone else in training that Amazon lies to you.  They told me that I wouldn't be penalized for this, but I still have the half point.  A few weeks later, I hurt myself on the job.  I saw a manager who sent me home and told me to fill out a report and to bring it in the next day.  I received a point for being sent home because I was too hurt to finish my day.  You will never be able to talk to HR about this as they work a different shift and you would have to wait at work for hours in order to talk to them.  If this is a second job, this will be impossible."
bad,Management took away the enjoyment of the work. The lack of management and labors being on the same page. It would be nice if the incentive were still in place. They should consider removing the salary cap. There was too many dedicated good workers left because of lack of a job security and salary.
bad,Constant turnover and employees are treated badly. Management does not care about you. There is no work/home life balance. They always expect 100% productivity and 99% is unacceptable.
bad,i was comfortable and they don't pay for overtime and plus they make people work on someone else shift without permission and it was a slow paced so had to leave.
bad,The job was decent but I didn’t like it at all I will never work there again because the job is very stressful n the pay is less than I thought it would be
bad,"I worked from home. Long hours work on Thanksgiving and had to try and transfer people to different departments that were not clearly outlined in training. Training was long and poor. Also, mostly answered calls about returns and customers were very disappointed with the company. Upper management was unhelpful did not communicate at all."
bad,It’s ok I guess but it’s alot of drama I do not think I will ever go back you do not see your paycheck it’s just a rap off and waste of time tfvhjjnnkk
bad,"cold overstimulating environment, other packers who have been there for years have gone insane and just whoop and holler all day long like stir crazy inmates. the building is so full no one says ""excuse me"" when they are in your way because you are ALWAYS in someone's way. security is rude and intimidating and singles out new starts to harass. there is no AC so it is hot as heck, and pack stations are nasty and dusty, i constantly had dust and cardboard get in my eyes even though i wear glasses. please, please, for your own health do not work here."
bad,"The work I did at the Amazon warehouse moving packages and staging them for the delivery drivers was EASY-PEASY. However, the way people were being treated at the warehouse was terrible. "
bad,"Il lavoro non male, ma anche se vai bene  rinnovano il contratto solo per pochi mesi. Lavoro non consigliato"
bad,Amazon is placing all of the work on the drivers slowly but surely so they can replace the warehouse associates with Robots. You are expected to do 12+ hours of work in 10 hours while also taking your lunch and your breaks. They micromanage their micromanaging and cannot disband a theft ring so they punish all of their drivers instead of just the one DSP company that is causing the issues.
bad,"To be honest Amazon criteria of numbers ( quality and productivity are so bad) nobody meets that they are even firing people off of that, managers doesn't warn you until you get to work pull you over talk to you and simple they just fired you."
bad,"Like the title says. If you give your employees the wrong tools, don't expect them to excel. Where do I start Amazon? There are many things but discrimination is among one of the many things you'll run into while working at Amazon. I have a medical condition. And before you stop reading (in case you don't have a condition) even if you don't have a condition. It'll affect you too. I couldn't have said it any better than one of my workmates. Amazon is one big ant colony. And we are just ants. We work hard to keep the colony working we do what's asked of us. We care no questions asked. But to AMAZON we are replaceable, common, unworthy workers among masses the and for Amazon we easily vanished at the snap of a finger and the next day, they'll place another at the helm. To do their dirty work. The company does not care about you so don't waste your time is my advice. They don't care if you have a medical condition. But they do cover themselves by saying they're equal opportunity so they don't get sued. Not that anyone would take on a giant like Amazon anyways. And that's where a fault lies, having no legal system wanting to take them on because of the size makes them think they have the power to do anything and they take advantage of that. By treating the employees like trash.  They have a so called ""accommodation"" system in place for people with disabilities. They give you a number. You call and are routed through a system that tells you to press 4. When you finally get someone on the other line they tell you to call another number and offer to transfer you. It's a discouraging"
bad,Management is more concerned about numbers than saftey. They want high numbers but have to many people working to achieve numbers. The longer you their you think you will get prompted but oftened are overlooked for someone new. Almost all of the high paying jobs are given to people from other Amazon's they don't usually promote local.
bad,I’m bad with my sleep and it was just a bad experience because it was over night and I had school too. I never had a real interview because it was threw a temp agency
bad,"About an hour of training for your position is all that I got. They restructured our management arrangement about 7 times until they finally had something that came close to functional. But if you need a job and have a pulse, you are practically guaranteed a job."
bad,Amazon is the worst place to work.They don’t care nothing about there employees well being are anything at that matter. Also they do a lot of underline racism
bad,Amazon is a horrible place to work. They don't care about safety. Management doesn't listen when you tell them someone is going to get hurt & I ended up tearing my neck & back muscles. Which could've been avoided if they listened to us about safety issues. I haven't been able to go back to work for 2 yrs now. Some of the managers were racist towards some employees. The pay wasn't good for the work you actually do.
bad,Tenet Concepts is the worst contracting company to work for though amazon they talk to you any kind of way schedule 4 work days might only work 2 sucks
bad,Well to be honest first the money they pay is not enough for the amount pressure u feelto much stress all thecmanagementbwill sell bbn u a dream all they do is write u up for any little mistake
bad,"If you love having to deliver a astronomical amount of packages in a limited amount of unrealistic timeframe this is the place for you. No praises for going above and beyond , Just criticism for faults found in your performance."
bad,"Amazon is a HORRIBLE company to work for. There is a major lack of senior leadership, and proper work Ethics are almost non-existent. I am a college graduate with corporate work experience and I’ve never seen a company disorganized in my life. Managers  are practically zoo keepers/ therapist/ police officers. The pay is complete trash for the amount of work and stress you take on. Not to mention, they decreased manager salary   Do not work for this company. Don’t let a big name fool you. HR will hire people with mental disabilities then make managers fire the.  I had to fire 2 people with autism and it was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do in my life. I’m c"
bad,Not good I thought that the company would offer more stability for the employees  but I was wrong. I and others were let go just before  our 90 day mark.
bad,"Nothing to say about that thing they call it JOB."
bad,"all about speed, health and safety a joke, workers no more than a "
bad,"Amazon is the absolute worst company you can ever apply to work for. It is not about what you know, only about who you know. Great work ethic will only get you treated like a slave and sent anywhere and everywhere until completely burned out at every position. Be prepared to  get on your knees and brown nose relentlessly in a degrading manner if you want any sort of advancement. Keep in mind they only offer a meaningless job title called ""ambassador"". This title basically appoints you to be in charge of more responsibilities without any extra pay or compensation but you do get a shamelessly cheap blue and orange vest. Most people chosen for ambassador do not deserve it and only got it due to favoritism hence they become even lazier and unproductive. The only way to actually be qualified for management is by working their for 2 years or having an Associate's degree in good knows what. Yet time and time again the favorites were chosen for management positions despite not actually possessing these prerequisites. The head managers are a sick joke. They do not actually respect or acknowledge the ""inspiring"" mottos on the wall encouraging involvement in the process. The managers only care about the statistics and impressing their bosses which they still were unable to do. Employees are nothing more then numbers, plain and simple. Be prepared for any worthwhile recommendation to improve the process to be completely ignored. The technology available is quite literally obsolete and pathetic. The management obsesses on having high scan rates over 300 per hour but pretend like it is easy"
bad,"Get written up for dumb things, work is extremely high paced. I have worked there twice for seasonal positions through the staffing agency. I would never go back."
bad,"No room for advancement,  employed with Amazon for 3yrs and filed out 23 applications an no feed or no response in reference to application status. Not to mention I have a educational background in Mechanical engineer. Im stuck here 🥺It's like I'm over looked, due to college students who comes in from the outside an granted an Area Manager position. Health Benefits or GREAT, I mean they have an awesome health care plan. Amazon, reminds me of slave Factory."
bad,DONT DO IT !!! You are a slave  management aren't to bright  lot of theft  can't trust anyone. slave labor  very high turnover  one minute your working with a group the next thing u know all new people
bad,"The job is very hard on your body. But also extremely boring. The pay is horrible for the jobs that you will have to do. The management is horrible, most of the time you do not even know who your manager is. The mangers object is only to make there goals; they do not care about employees. You  are constantly being threaten with termination for every little mistake."
bad,Worst possible place anywhere to work.  Fast is never fast enough. 100% is not good enough. They push you hard enough that it was common place to see 2-3 people/week be taken out by ambulance.
bad,Not a good company to work for.  You work long hours for little pay. Management can care less about your personal home life. No wage increase and you can be fired with no warning at their discretion.  There are times when your check will not be there on the day that you are assigned to get paid.
bad,"ambiente estremamente competitivo, alcuni vogliono essere migliori di altri pensando di ottenere un contratto indeterminato. i più grandi dell'azienda cercano di umiliare i più giovani nel tentativo di mostrarsi ai dirigenti. un lavoro completamente irrealistico, che ti fa lavorare per due persone e nessuno dice niente, suonano musica estremamente rumorosa durante 4 ore di lavoro. dopo 3 mesi ti mandano via senza alcuna valutazione, ti dicono sempre perché il loro flusso di lavoro è rallentato, ma La gigroup ogni settimane cercano nuove persone da ricominciare. mai più!"
bad,Billion dollar company only paying you their good. All amazon employees deserve a minimum start hour pay of 18 an hour . Worked too hard for little money”again amazon don’t care about employees” just money from customers”?
bad,managers know how to make employees miserable and down right nuts. managers do no know how to manage employees. the company enjoys creating a rough work environment so they have turnover rate and the company does not have to pay high labor costs.
bad,"Fasted work environment. No real direct, different supervisors/leads telling you to do different things. "
bad,Managment is not good.. Changes come without notice. There no concern for employees..its whatever is good for Amazon employees are not a factor at all..Things change weekly no stability..
bad,Not the best place to work but not the worst. Just do your job and mind your own business and you’ll be fine working there. Just do what you’re supposed to do.
bad,I didn't enjoy working at amazon because of the hours.  if they had 8 hours shifts of part time shifts i would gave this company a good rating. When i 1st was hired they had me in stock then moved me to pick after the 1st day which i wouldnt have took the job if i had to pick.
bad,"The managements dont work as hard as the the regular staff,too much standing and impossible things the require from staff.....do not apply to work there!!!"
bad,Start up companies by rich young people using own money. Street mentality used by management. Poor communication. Most companies strapped for cash after a month
bad,The place in not a nice place to work. These people are like slave masters.if you don't make your quota you get written up for the most minimal things. There turn over rate is astronomical. I'm not a former disgruntled  employee. The place just isn't a nice work environment. That's just my opinion.
bad,"This place is legit a joke. They won’t let you pack your belongings when you decide to leave.  The managers let others go through your things and get what they want from them. OH, they also won’t do anything about your stolen things! My friends brand new iPhone X was stolen, Amazon didn’t do NOTHING. I receive my stuff and half my stuff is gone. Especially the new stuff, like my $50 charger! If you have kids, don’t work here. They do not care about you nor your kids. That’s just a bigger reason to fire you in the end. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRRIBLE PLACE TO WORK!!!!"
bad,"Fired hundreds this week in Bristol, CT to avoid free medical after slaving 90 days. Promised our jobs were secure, although termed seasonal. Too many packages makes it mathematically impossible to deliver without breaking traffic and safety laws."
bad,"I was signed up to work the worst hours: 9pm-1am, 1am-5am, and/or 4am-8am. The workplace culture in the facility was unsafe, unprofessional and unfair."
bad,Amazon does not value it's employees as much as it values its reputation. There are often changes made almost instantaneously that are not properly communicated. Management and staff are under trained and under informed. And after 2 years of inconsistency and poor management and communication of policies and procedure they showed no appreciation when I departed. They started promising benefits then changed us to full-time and reduced our hours so we would not receive those benefits in exchange for a $2 raise.
bad,"The work isn't hard. The rate at which they want you to work is IMPOSSIBLE. I'm the event you can make rate, and never need to use the bathroom, keep in mind your work needs to be flawless. If you make too many mistakes you could be fired on the spot."
bad,"HR members are so racist, they careless, they don’t care about employees, the way they handle circumstances are really unfair. I personally got fired for no reason. I had a circumstance that stopped me from going to work for 1 day, I had prove to give them the reason why I missed work that day, they still didn’t care"
bad,"The CEO of Amazon sees his employees as robots not humans. He doesn't pay fair as it should be, he literally exploit us with so much work less pay. Hard labor benefits aren't that great. Customers need to stop buying from him so he can learn something about it as well for workers go down and strike for better pay! "
bad,Pathetic untrained managers. Everything you ask them they don’t know. Manager’s chosen by time in job not actual qualifications for the job. Other departments do not fulfill their duties. Consistently passing buck and DO NOT UNDERSTAND ENGLISH
bad,"this job is great if you just need quick money and aren't looking to advance. Plenty of favortism and dating within the company. graveyard shift is from 6pm to 4 am. this is a fast paced enviornment and they change your job titles whenever they feel like it regardless on if you agree with their decision. benefits are cool but make sure that you read the find print for 401k and health. this is a job designed perfectly for anyone fresh out of HS because thats how much drama goes on. fights, and arguments over whos dating who. I would skip this job if I were you. Modern day slavery."
bad,Horrible place to work. Management was horrible and they reated there employees unfairly. Would not recommend working at Amazon in breingsville PA. :(
bad,if you choose to work for amazon you will be treated like a slave and you'll have no time or energy to do anything but work and recover from work.  the metrics and rates expected out of every single person are bone crushing and often unobtainable.  the pay is not nearly enough to compensate for the amount of work that's required on a daily basis.  job seeker beware.
bad,"Been working for about a month now was told that it takes time to get to the route 1st was training 2nd wk out on your own hrs a day finished one day at 11.pm  very very stressful job when you’ve done your routine  asked to help other drivers the only good thing is the MONEY  just been told that they are terminating our services because the company not satisfied with our performance even  though we’ve been working 12-15 hours and giving All we can ABSOLUTELY Astounded though we still"
bad,"Wouldn't recommend working there."
bad,Amazon creates a very hostile work environment depending on what department you work in. They set unattainable quotas and threaten to write you up if you can’t attain them. Break times are inadequate due to how far from the job site the break rooms are.
bad,"They treat you like an animal and only care about their numbers. Advancement is a joke. They tell you to apply, but give the jobs to unqualified people."
bad,Be prepared to be treated like a manual laborer in expectations of accountability and growth opportunity.  Amazon abuses work ethic with promises of pay raises and advancement with the classic dangling carrot management style.  Finish your task and the goal post moves every time for your manager with no follow through or word being kept for advancement.  Experienced this with multiple managers and group managers.
bad,"This place suck no leadership at all Run away as fast as you can."
bad,"Started at bottom with continuous praise and promises. Not one of which was given; supervisors well versed to heap praise and tell you what a great company it is but eventually they are using you to prop up their own production numbers. Hectic, stressful and always pushing. Numbers based. This is why people order from Amazon; cheap labor."
bad,"Amazon lies to employees. I accepted a DAY shift job only to be put on nights starting on my first day/orientation. They start paying $15 an hour for days and nights gets paid $15.85 hourly. I was getting paid $15 even tho i was working nights. They never explain any medical benefits, the expect you to learn them by yourself. Management doesn’t care if employees follow rules."
bad,Job was very stressful times you would see employees going to the restroom to cry. Managers scream at you for not moving fast enough. Put you down saying your basically not worth it. If you don’t move at they pace of time they can terminate you
bad,"None. Don't have one. Go to work, find where I'm suppose to work on floor and do what I'm told.  Either stay caught up or fall behind when sorting packages. "
bad,No organization. Managers don't know what they are doing day to day. They blame employees for their quotas not being met. They should split jobs noone wants to wrap pallets 10 hrs a day. Work you like mules. I hated working here they dont let girls advance in learning machines.
bad,They worked u like a slave. And whatever you did wasn't good enough. Do not be a Picker. You are running down them halls to get the score the want you to have. I never missed a day and I was getting good numbers. But I caught the flu and came to work. And my number slow down cause I was sick. And they fired me.

bad,"You find out quick its your rate that is everything, if anything breaks or you have to fix your on your own. Supervisor just fire you for any reason, its all about control and fear of you losing your job. There is zero job security, plus you get write ups for using the bathroom. This is the most stressful worst job i ever had."
bad,Targets are ridiculous and they will get rid of you quickly if you don't meet them.  there's hardly any support there and it would be better if the managers were more approachable
bad,"If u enjoy ur boss having no exsperance and disrespectful to you contract then give it a try. "
bad,",si eres un comentarista con maldad entonces prósperas en esta empresa, utilizan el miedo a no renovarte y si reportas a un superior las malas formas de un Lid como yo hice no te renuevan."
bad,"This place is a terrible environment,  they hire people everyday,  the reason for this is because they only care about the packages not the drivers,  the training has nothing to do with the job. If you actually do what they say at training expect a 10 hour route to be 14 hours . The GPS system they use and routing is often inaccurate. This company DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU OR YOUR MENTAL OR PHYSICAL WELLBEING. the trucks are often beat up and they hardly fix them. I don't know what its like to work for Amazon,  but the subcontractors that run the delivery part of the company are not at all interested in KEEPING EMPLOYEES . THEY HIRE PEOPLE EVERYDAY FOR A REASON."
bad,The problem with working at Amazon is the opportunistic managers who delegate their assigned tasks to their junior associates that work the hardest in and out of their assigned tasks. Managers will often attempt to delegate their data entry tasks to their junior associates so that th err y will have more time to flirt with married men and women. The only department that conducts themselves professionally from top ti to  bottom is the customer service department.
bad,"Would never go back or recommend amazon multi drops to anyone unless they have their own van and 7 days a week 10/12 hour days spare, I like the job though anyway was a good job but the costs were too expensive and wouldn’t of had enough money for rent and food at the end of the month etc. None the less though great people to work with and very friendly"
bad,"Unfair pay, overpriced foods, poor working conditions. the facility was serverly dusting. during my employment there i developed a respitory issue. one of the worst jobs in the world. would not recommend to my worst enemy!"
bad,"6 day 10 hr shifts during Christmas period. Fired when they no longer need you."
bad,A éviter si vous tenez à votre vie de couple social et surtout votre santé mentale
bad,"Amazon.com is only a company someone should work for if they absolutely just need a job for a little while.  Not only is working in the warehouse a tough, physically demanding job, but you are consistently set up to fail with higher and higher goals that next to impossible to meet with little to no help from any leadership.  Avoid at all costs."
bad,"Would not recommend  to anyone to work here.Short break times, long working hours, does not accommodate employee after returning after sick leave. Pay and insurance was good."
bad,While working at Amazon I have noticed very poor management and when you complain or report and issue it will not be properly addressed and if it is a serious issue with a manger does get addressed their solution is to transfer the manager to a new location and give them a clean slate claiming they have no record in regard to the issue.
bad,They unfairly fired me and reinstated me after appealing. Currently applying for other jobs before they lose it again on me. They seem fair but they couldn't care less.
bad,"In just one week, on just one shift, of which there were many, 3 people had seizures, three ambulances arrived, in one week, on one shift.  Dangerous!"

bad,Working for this company has been very stressful. They are very demanding and unable acceptable for any lack. Working for the company for 5 years i am unsatisfied with the work development with the company.
bad,"The fulfillment centers does not focus in employee retention.  The words that are posted in the breakroom is for decorative purposes, because none of them reflect the toxic culture that created by leaders.  There are many employees that are owed hours that have not been paid.  Do not leave a job that you have now to start with Amazon, because you will not get paid correctly."
bad,"This huge corporation has no respect for humans.  They use you physically, oftentimes being injured on the job, and then spit you out.  HR and management work together to find ways to fire you, legitimate or not."
bad,"The Delivery Sortation Center In West Columbia Is Horrible There Care More About A Record Then There On Employees And Don't Fall Because They Will Blame It On You Then Instead On Management Who Should Have Been Doing There Job And Then Mess Like That Wouldn't Have Happened - I Thought They Were Good People I Was Horribly One - Seeking Better Employment - Honestly As Long As You Are A Walking,Breathing Bag Of Bones That Will Hire You - Not Me - I Deserve Better."
bad,"Amazon is very team-centric.  If you are on a good time, then work is good.  If you are on a bad team, then work sucks.  In my first year, the team I was on had 60% turnover, 3 ""reorganizations,"" and I have 4 different managers.  Expectations were shifting or never defined.  many senior leaders are folks who got into Amazon early and stuck with the company through the lean times.  They're now rewarded with leadership positions in which they are not qualified for, nor well suited."
bad,"Awful place, extremely poor management, extremely poor HR and not enough pay, but mainly management, no consideration, young and have no experience and due to that reason of hiring a child as a manager you will get bullied and harassed and also some are racist!!!!so do yourself a favor and find a job where 1 you get treated as a human and 2 have a proper aged experienced management and professional HR!!!"
bad,"Welcome to your permanent back problem.  This place is EXACTLY like being incarcerated.  You are a robot, and that is all.  You wreck your life, your mood, and your body so that the richest man on Earth can have $127 BILLION and not $126 BILLION.  HE TAKES PICTURES OF HIS PRIVATES, CHEATS ON HIS WIFE, and Amazon doesn’t pay taxes."
bad,No amount of money can justify the cruel and punishing target orientated working conditions amazon imposes on staff. There is no union representation and staff dont have a voice. Modern day smart slavery. Making billions off the back and sweat of many innocent men and women pushed to breaking point. Disgusting.
bad,"They treat their employees terrible, work you until your dead, mandatory overtime. Have you standing all day or sitting on a tiny hard stool, if you dont move fast enough you get yelled at by managers"
bad,"The wok environment is terrible. if you plan to work here just for a check, don't raise your hand for anything. They abuse their employees without offering advancement opportunities. Jeff Besos is a penny pincher."
bad,"Long hours with mandatory overtime was the norm with some days having to stay 10 hours if a holiday was near."
bad,"they changed you time and lie to your face n not good manager to work for , thats why they cant kept drivers..... owner dont care about his driver health n safety"
bad,Neanche un saluto come se non fossi mai esistito. Vergognatevi tutti non avete neanche una coscienza
bad,harsh work enviorment break room was too far away by the time you get to break room you can only sit for 3 minutes made ous work really fast paced which i did not like they treated us like robots instead of employees
bad,"Catastrophe, aucun respect, aucune reconnaissance, stressant, pas d’horaiRe fixe , flicker par les managers..."
bad,did not like the way I was being over worked for little money I will not be returning to amazon again do to lack of team work also  management it was not what I wanted to do.
bad,"Nopar se pasa el día controlando a los repartidores, llamadas a cada momento y broncas, no te dejan trabajar. Direcciones mal ubicadas, rutas que te hacen perder el tiempo, un desastre."
bad,This is a horrible place to work. The Washington post story was true. You can lose your job at the drop of a hat. Bad upper management. No support. No training for managers
bad,"Avoid this company at all costs. They treat their workers like absolute garbage and only care about your ""rate"". They set you up for failure then fire you without any warning at all."
bad,They will work you to DEATH and favoritism is the way you can advance out of your given department.  It is a very sad and sometimes demoralizing experience.
bad,"I used to work here and when i started I was told I would be working for ICQA and I was discriminated against by me team leaders because I have ADHD. My manager and HR did nothing about the verbal abuse, discrimination and the public humiliation my team leaders would give me almost everyday. I had a meeting with the HR manager and the general manager but they are useless and did nothing I also told the assistant general manager but she ignored my message and did nothing. I have never worked in a place this bad and I would highly recommend you find a job somewhere else."
bad,"This company is not a good place to work.  You are just a number to them, not a person.  They set you up for a fall and that's what happened to me.  Check them out if you would like to."
bad,Stay away! Amazon is taking over the world. They put children incharge with zero work history and expect you to follow their instructions when the managers dont even know their job.
bad,"I don't have anything good to add about the company, Most of what you heard is true. Bottles of wee in the shelves, miss half your breaks to walking though the warehouse and waiting for security to search you. If you don't have a locker you can't bring anything into work as it will get stolen as you cannot carry anything in the warehouse with you, managers will pretend to help but then forget within 15 minutes. Still missing my jacket. Heaven forbid you forget to put your phone in the locker, they will demand you provide proof you own it. Scratched up phone with 3 years of personal photos on it, nah isn't yours you need to provide proof you bought it."
bad,"If you used to work a crappier job, this is the one for you. It beats general labor, but the work is not very well organized in warehouses and breaks are not long enough to use the restroom and turnover is a part of the business plan."
bad,I worked in the packing department where deliveries would be packed to be be shipped off. This role taught me the importance of time keeping because deliveries had to be out of the building at a certain time or we would have more work for the next day.
bad,"No air ventilation,they make up as u go type of job,the pay is weak bcuz they take too much taxes out of your check,they hired people who have mental issues,they hired too many kids that don't want to work,theres no HR in the building,no security,they don't evaluate employees for there work efforts bcuz half the people in there work efforts sucks they should of been got fired"
bad,Bad place to work. I would never recommend working here. They will chew you up and spit you out with hesitation. The best part about working here is that they paid me to quit.
bad,Stay away. They do not train you.  You get maybe 1 hr of training onsite then your on your own.They work there employees like slaves. Everyone break at the same time. Not to mention there is no air.  And they have a high turn over . I saw people walk out
bad,This job is very competitive and stressful. I would say that this is a job that will pay you if you absolutely need a job immediately. This is not for everyone.
bad,"Do not work for this place."
bad,"worked for amazon in leeds,due to mental health was off for a year,they cant even give confirmation to say i was off,i lost my house because management a shi   t"
bad,The vast majority of the management staff at the Bellmawr. NJ site has NO idea what they are doing and appear to have no interest in helping their staff.
bad,"This job is practically slavery. If you pull high numbers, they expect that from you day in and day out. If you're sick, too bad, you need to pull high numbers or they seclude you in the furthest bay as punishment."
bad,"Literally worst job I’ve ever had in my entire life..Management is a joke. Unbelievable workload. They change your schedule without any notice. Vans are boarder line death traps with minimal maintenance bald tires etc."
bad,The employees are looked at as numbers and not human beings. They would work us like we were employed in a SWEAT SHOP regardless as to the proper number of people it would take to work a line.
bad,Refusal to comply with ADA Accomodation and transfer to a position that I could do with my disability. After submitting countless ADA Accomodation letters from my doctor HR still refused to transfer me to another position.  I was hired to do Count and transferred to do Stow and obviously could not physically do stow due to my disability.
bad,"Worst job I have ever had... the commute was horrible, the pay was worth and amazon makes employees feel like they dont need them and they are replaceable."
bad,I join this company after learning the 14 principles. Upper management dont follow. Very political environment. This job has caused all types of anxiety.
bad,"Extremely terrible experience, managers have unrealistic powers which they use to intimidate employees, pathetic company, pathetic culture. No development work remaining, only operational task for developers"
bad,"I was scheduled to work 40 hours in 4 days at the Opa Locka facility which was great, but 2 days before my first shift I was called and told that my shift was no longer available, but I could pick a different one there or at another location. I was looking for an overnight shift and the only other one was at the Sunrise location. It was only 26 hours but I figured with the season coming I could pick up more hours so I picked that location and shift. My first day started at 9:15pm and we all were happy because the next day was Memorial day so we would also be getting overtime pay. Well after talking with the guy who showed us around I found out that I wouldn't be able to get anymore than 29 hours at that location. I had another job that I was to start part-time on Tuesday so I just changed that to full-time and didn't go back to Amazon. When my pay came it was shorter than what it should have been so I called ERC and they are trying to tell me that because my shift started the day before Memorial day they do not pay time and a half even though the majority of my shift was on Memorial Day. I should have had 5 hours and 45 minutes of overtime pay since my shift was 9:15pm to 5:45am. I really think that's illegal and they shouldn't do it like that. That definitelly wasn't told to us when they were talking about holidays in orientation and everybody else that started that night thought they were getting time and a half also."
bad,"nothing to say more,,  i can t control the job the ist not for me,  if you like to have PANIC job, then  please   join with the  AMAZON. TO Many STOP 1 DAY"
bad,Amazon is a slave driven company. The breaks are horrible and the environment is not healthy. My nose was completely black at the end of my shift. The people there are somewhat friendly. They will not hesitate to fire you if you are not making rate everyday.
bad,I didn't like the job & the management was very poor. They didn't take initiative to encourage the employees! That job wasn't worth my time or energy!
bad,"Job only secured  if youre a vet in management  people had their lockers and cars broken into and results ended nothing from h.r or and security. But take snack out the break room without paying theyll do a full thorough investigation people getting terminated for not making rate even when there was no work to be done  went from 13.25 and after many lawsuits, high turnover rates,and wrongful termination they went to 4 ten hours days  and raise their pay to 15 and hours and now they work us even harder and time us on everything.  Bathrooms are a mile away from your station. So you had to be quick or not go at all if you didn't want managers in your face  questioning you as a female why you went to the restroom"
bad,"they treat employees like a robot more, any excuse is valid to dismiss people, the system judges the actions of the employee, always being very unfair to dismiss people because I have seen people dismissed by the system's own error,"
bad,Shifts are too long. Breaks are too short.  Pay is very low for the amount of work we do. They are slave drivers. We work as if we are in a third world country. They don't appreciate or acknowledge our hard work. They promote based on favoritism and not production or work ethics. They will suspend you for the smallest accusations and then terminate you with no cause because they say they can't take any risk and because Florida is a right to work state there is nothing we can do to fight it.
bad,"Ideally you have your defined job position. The case with UPS and FEDEX or any professional logistical company, but at Amazon you are more than a driver. You share the role of delivery driver, warehouse worker, Amazon representative, and non affiliated employee. Long story short, on your own. Be prepared for change everyday, flawed systems, and bad management. Each day is a circus release where ultimately you pay the price for a company driven by self expansion and customer care with no focus on the employee or workers. Beware, long days with increasing expectations with zero to no help or pay incentives."
bad,"Management treats you like a number, and works you like a slave. They don't care at all. The people there are the worst, so many rumors were spread about me that weren't true, it was a hostile work environment. HR didn't do anything about it. The job itself was easy, but so monotonous, boring, and repetitive."
bad,when 1st started was great and fun to work but then became very poorly run.When started had a voice after about 2 years they didn't want to hear our voice anymore we didn't metter
bad,"These people are insane! I'm not sure what kind of sinister game they're playing in the background, but something is definitely not right here. Management is negligent and regularly degrades its employees, you will be forced to work Mandatory Overtime, sent home early, lied to, have your bonuses retracted, time-off cut, and eventually led to accept compensation to quit. They promote on an ethnically biased basis, refuse to listen to employee suggestions/complaints unless brought to upper management, and DO NOT FOLLOW LABOR LAWS. Good luck taking them to court too."
bad,"You must keep a good rate to stay working at Amazon. They always have a rate in place anywhere you go. They might as well have a slogan if you want to get in shape and loose weight work here. The will work you hard and they don't care. Big giant sweet shop. The money might sound good., but don't do it. If you don't exercise don't you won't last a week."
bad,"I don't like Amazon at all, terrible working conditions, you are only a number, would never recommend anyone to work there now or in the future. Terrible"
bad,I just quit that place under a week and you wanna know why? On my second day i got injured due to a injury from going up and down the ladder over and over over period of 10 hours! Went to amcare and i was given a gel that did not did a thing for me and was expected to be back on my feet stowing when i was about to collapse on the floor on only my second day at MC01. The managers do not care about your well being and your health. You can freaking lose your leg the next day and the managers will expect you to be performing at the same performance as a robot. Your rate have to be like 300+ or you get written up. On my first week as a trainee i was given threats of termination and write ups. Their alot of factors out of your control as a stower that can give you a low rate. The pods be having small slots for the big items and you can not fit a big box in a small slot within the pod! If you think about turning away the robots for a bigger one guest what? Your in trouble for skipping to much robots that are too small. Same issue with small items and big slots. Ambassador and Pa and mangers never leave you  alone! Its easy for someone going around with a computer on the cart making threats and whining at you for anything when they have it easy. The turn out rate at MC01 is really high! Meaning majority of the people quit really fast! Their a reason why they always hiring because they can not keep their people!. Other than that the co workers were cool and respectful. I am not lazy but i am not going destroy my body for a company that will not give me benefits or medical leave due to
bad,"Not worth it after they make you go down a road and Amazon GPS makes you driving to a swamp. There was supposed to be a driveway there, but instead it was a swamp. They totaled out my whole car because of that. Then Amazon says it's not their fault, and they won't help for compensation. Amazon Flex makes you use your own personal vehicles. In other words mine got totaled because of them. Next time I'll throw the package is right in the swamp and never bring them back. Cost me over $4,000 in car bills"
bad,"I worked night shift, 12 hrs in pack. Crazy schedule, crazy break times, no time off. When you had a day off all you wanna do is sleep and relaxe because your body is in so much pain."
bad,Working with Amazon can be overrated and my skills can be put to use in other places. Amazon does not promote within and brings people in to manage processes and people with no management experience at all.
bad,Sgobbi un anno andando a tremila e vieni fatto fuori anche se non fai neanche in assenza perché hanno le assunzioni già scritte DALL apertura
bad,Relatively tall individual and they had me shrink wrapping pallets manually for extended period of time. Hurt my back they threw me on medical leave for 2 months before shipping me to a different warehouse. New warehouse put me on medical leave for 5 months to prove my health was affected by the long hours working in a 100 degree warehouse.
bad,This place plays favoritism dont let them dislike you trust me you wont have a job. They pick and pick and set you up for failure so dont waste your time.
bad,"The higher than minimum wage pay might look tempting, but turn back while you still can. Amazon has little care for their workers or the workers' safety. Breaks never went as long as they were supposed to, we were forced to work past our shifts on multiple occasions with no extra pay, and most, if not all, of the safety measures in the building didn't work. Once a large group went on strike to protest this. They all got fired on the first day of this, and they brought in new people to replace them. My experience there was so bad, I can't even bring myself to use Amazon.com as a consumer anymore."
bad,"I have never worked in such a demoralizing, uninspiring place. You have no ability to be creative & are worked to the bone.  Pay was actually really bad for the hours worked. I'd rather slowly tear my eyeballs out than set foot in that place again."
bad,This place was horrible..  I also tried to sell items on Amazon. It was horrible too.  They over charge you.  This company is a bunch of horrible bosses. It also had two classes of workers.  Temps and perms.  The perms got all the benefits.   It was like being in high school and prison at the same time.  It was not good.
bad,Ist day of training was suppose to be in classroom but there were no classes they put me in a van with other driver that had me jumping in and out of huge van 90+times for deliveries. I was told i would be trained to succeed but that only trained me to fail. Because i couldnt even move for the next 3 days. So i failed. I felt set up because i saw 2 other people i was hired with and they had been there for 2 days and they were in a classroom. So i feel the manager just made a fool of me.
bad,"There is no job growth at this company , the environment is very negative & not inspiring at all to do better , management finds a way to hold your progress back"
bad,"Ambiente oppressivo ,lavoro durissimo, non c'è rispetto per la persona."
bad,"Amazon expects you to work like a robot. I was a packer at Amazon and worked 10 hours a day. They give you a 30 minute lunch that everyone takes together and two 15 minute breaks (really 10 minutes because you have to count for the time walking back to your station to and from the break room) The break rooms are extremely far from the workstations but it’s the only place to sit and get off your feet. They expect you to pack a box within 27 seconds for 10 hours a day and if you go to the restroom it affects your production time and you could be written up. Your body gets tired after picking up and bagging large bags of dog food, cat food, canned items, tools, etc. but amazon doesn’t care because you are not a person but treated as a machine. Oh and they only hire seasonal workers so they don’t have to pay for benefits for full time employees."
bad,Worst job ever ! Trust stay away . This is new word slavery . Amazon one of the worst companies to work for. Everyday I worked here I was in happy . They don't care about you at all or the work load !!
bad,Inhumanité  rendement rendement rendement... Si vous voulez être traité comme des animaux allez-y
bad,My overall review of this past employer is no safe work place environment to work in. Work conditions were unhealthy and not safe. Pay wasn't enough amount for work that was giving to us to do in the amount of hours that we had to work to get it all done. No real job advancement options or advance schooling tuition offered. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone to get job with this company.
bad,"Worked to the bone in unsuitable conditions. Temperatures switched from freezing to sweltering at the drop of a hat, and limited opportunity for bathroom breaks due to exceedingly high performance targets. Would not recommend."
bad,I want to work at the amazon to put things in boxes at the warehouse I want to work as soon as I can work 4 days a week I can start at orce times when
bad,I would never go back to that place. The management was lazy and always expected the hints to do all the work. It was hard to fit in or find your crowd to hang out woth. There were in intives only for the fastest stockers
bad,"Third class management Amazon BOM 3 . P.A third class behaviour. So many problem here , but here management not solve clearly. Here only visit day all the clear five marking show up. But other day not properly work here. Also managers and p.a and h.r involved the is that situation."
bad,"Typical day at was about 9+ hours on your feet. One 30 minute break, but depending where you were that day, your break could be 20 minutes by the time you get to your break location. Two 15 minutes breaks but same concept as my previous statement. I learned to never ever work under a Amazon company. Management was sub-par. Took over a month to give me my payment. Workplace culture is non-existent. Can't talk to anyone really when everyone has to yell pretty much to be heard over the machinery. Even if you could talk while you're working, management highly discourage it because it would be consider as an interruption to meeting your quota. Hardest part of the job was being able to meet a number that would be your quota for the day that seem so close but be out of reach because you have to work as if you're hyped off of a monster energy drink from start to finish. Being a former member of the U.S Army, I never felt so overwhelmed about being able to do tasks that you would think would be simple, except you have to do everything at a fast pace and if you make a mistake, which you will because that's what happens when you do most tasks at a fast pace, you get a penalty against you. The most enjoyable part of the job honestly, was simply leaving it. Work here if you don't care about your physical and mental condition."
bad,"I was employed there 4 about 9 months and at 3 months it was great,  however after that it was all micro management,  they the Area Managers would be on us if you,  leave your spot and made errors,  if you didn't stow items in the first 10 minutes and also if get totes from the production line. Also to much favoriting other people good health benefits"
bad,"Staff are treated like slaves and the team leaders are on a power trip and speak to their staff as though they are children. Hours are long, breaks are short, and don't you dare go the toilet unless you want to be talked down to as if you've just broken the law."
bad,"You could be on the road for 12hrs plus with no break, I was expected to drive to Bristol for a week doing 17hr days with no break. I nearly fell asleep and missed my junction driving home one evening. I ended up 10miles in the wrong direction due to lack of concentration from tiredness. My first drop was 1.5hrs from the Bristol Depot with 200 parcels. "
bad,amazon was an terrible experience for me the hours were long the management lack communication skills and had terrible leadership it was beyond stressful there were no real opportunities presented for growth in my experience
bad,"Was only there 3 month working for one of the many driving firms there and a absolute joke if a company to work for. You get 2 days training in class room and 1 day out with another driver, they said you can make really good money, don't believe a word. What they dont mention us all the hidden costs that come off. Only work the if you have no friends, family or life because your out till all hours. Be warned."
bad,"Ambiance communautaire, type racialiste."
bad,"If you want to be mugged off, go ahead join Amazon. It's really not worth getting out of bed for. 12 to 16 hour days for very little money!"
bad,Workers were forced to endure long hours in environments which were detrimental to their health. Turnover rate left lines often understaffed as a result
bad,"When you're a man you can do whatever you like. As a woman, your actions will continually be magnified. "
bad,"Nejhorší pakárna, buzerace, všechno na vteřinu přesně... Vaše nejhorší noční můra je tady! Jen suplujete robota, kterej ty lidi stejne jednou vystřídá. Copak to nechápete vas cas je levnejsi, nez zatim porídit armadu robotu. V nemecku probihaly stavky i kdyz nemci braly za tuto praci 80.000 mesicne (tedy v eurech) a bylo to malo za takovou pojebanou rachotu kde na tebe vytvareji neuveritelnej tlak. Nikdo, ale opravdu nikdo to ani neskousejte. Je to jako ten napis v osvetimi (ARBAIT MACH FRAI) !!!! Ať se dou bodnout za 100 000 mesicne bych uvazoval ze se necham zotrocit max. na 2 mesice takze asi tak !!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,"id never work here again the manager is not a smart man, he didnt understand the software or the app needed to complete the job. He was a horrible trainer and the pay was not enough to be playing supermarket sweep basically."
bad,"They do not respect associates dependability or loyalty.  You are just a number.  If you do not hit the numbers they think you should make, you are gone, with no remorse from either your managers or the company itself.  I don't plan on working for any Amazon departments again."
bad,"Your advancement depends on numbers produced by warehouse workers, they are overworked, forced to complete tasks that they will fail, and when they fail you fail. Management is put under a crazy amount of stress to produce, It's trickle down. They do not hold non workers accountable, but put more pressure on those that produce to produce even more"
bad,"Basically, the way they look at it is, there's always someone who can take your place. Every two weeks there's a class of new hires. Only half of the new hires make it past the first week. It's horrible. You will work like you've never worked before.. and state minimum on breaks! In an 8 hour period you will get a ""10 minute break with 5 minutes of walk time"" and a 30 minute lunch."
bad,"Troppo lontano da dove abito io, 3 ore al giorno di viaggio"
bad,"warehouse job did not fit my skills and abilities, was not empowered to fulfill my career expectations, would never recommend this place to anyone with critical thinking skills as they would not be used, required or encouraged to develop professionally"
bad,"Do not shop here, do not work here. If you value your time and your body you will RUN! or that is exactly what AMAZON will do to you.. RUN YOU INTO THE GROUND! You will walk 15-20 miles per day. You will have two 7 mins breaks and a 20 min break in between a ten hour shift. The building is nasty, management changes almost every quarter, they are petty and always in your business. Managers are small petty and limited in thinking. Ideas are narrow and so is the faculty by which you should submit them; no one cares actually; not people friendly."
bad,"Would not reccomend, management was not up to date, contradictory with others decisions. I was the only female and as such, did not feel as if the company was equal and unbiased towards my employment."
bad,Management frequently overlooked their own safety procedures and showed little to no concern for workers or their complaints.Poor working conditions and equipment.
bad,"Always on edge, lots of favoritism. Safety is not as important as they claim. I would not recommend for anyone to work there. It only focused on getting packages out not on employees at all"
bad,They hire again and again.which goes against they fire him.work in pressure.if follow them they happy otherwise no .launch time half hour but you get only 20 minute.honestly I work in amazon  due to his 5 day working and transfort facility .
bad,"Without a doubt the worst job I have ever had the displeasure of doing. You are treated as nothing but a number and are expected to sprint round the warehouse picking an impossible amount each hour. When you don't achieve this the management constantly degrade and humiliate you. If you clock in even 1 minute late you are docked, the tiny car park not making it any easier. Management always looking for any excuse to bring you down and ultimately get rid of you."
bad,"awful place to work, no help or development for those needing it or having difficulty understanding the roles. targets are set too high and almost unachievable"
bad,"Working for amazon sucked, they only employ you par time and the benefits were a bad joke.  "
bad,They treat you like a kid and work you like till you body gives up and its everyday. The managers are on the computer all day. They work for cpt. Management sucks
bad,This was the worst job I’ve ever had. Particularly if you  are a female do not work here you will be harassed consistently and nothing will be done about it and if you follow the proper channels to report it you’ll end up terminated for something completely unrelated. I’ve worked ops and admin in HR so I’ve seen a ton of dirt please just listen otherwise after about 2 moths you’ll severely regret it. Also the disrespect..... smh I can go on for days.
bad,"When i first got hired here it was a very fast paced environment but was a fun place to work. Over the years that has drastically changed. I got switched to nights early on and have been stuck there ever since, they refuse to switch me to days even after working there for 4 years. Management consistently praises my work but wont let me try to leave because I am ""too valuable"" in my department. Typical day consists of packing thousands of units for this miserable company that treats you like fodder. Workplace culture rewards conniving/Machiavellian behavior. Most enjoyable part of the job is Friday when the bell rings to go home cause thats the longest possible time before having to go in again."
bad,"I have excellent work ethic but this company is a joke. Let's start with management, who, half are incompetent, but entitled.  They come around with laptops, telling you your scan rate..But you're building pallets, base wrapping, lifting heavy boxes, sorting boxes, while others scan jiffys. What a joke. They move you from lane to lane and wonder why your scan rate is down. Scan rate was at 160 and since I was one of the ones to be let go, even  though promised to start 3-7p shift, they got rid of many people without ANY notice. No warning. Had schedule in place. Oh, after a year of service, you only get a 20 cent raise. Part time ONLY positions.  No one works full time here, except managers. Makes you wonder as some are dumb as a box of rocks.Oh, as soon as Christmas week started, they cut hours. Scheduled 930 to 130p shift and only worked 3 hour shifts. Disappointing. Call you on the phone when your job has ended and say apply again at xmas time. You work your butt off only to get let go."
bad,"Robots. there are no liders only scared little managers that follow orders with no questions asked. If it looks good on paper it's ok by them but in reality everything is wrong. There is no health and safety, again ,on paper it looks good but in reality it's a jungle"
bad,"Don't expect to be treated like anything but a number. Safety is important but only if it doesn't affect production. "
bad,"no work, lazy supervisors, dont promote from within, youll spend more time seeping than anything else, the best part was all the time off you can take since they are only busy in november and december"
bad,this was one of the worst places I've worked. the management was laughable. they mocked employees would lie to get them in trouble and didn't help any of us in the slightest. I recommend this place to no one.
bad,Essential the worst warehouse job availble in twin cities. Stay away if you want your morale in tact. the night shift especially worst.  would never recomend it
bad,If you love to go. This is the place for you except when youre waiting on mgmnt. They lag and are unorganized. Then because youre now behind on what you need to do because they lagged you have to hussle to get your van together. There are no such things as breaks as a adas. You clock in clock out for lunch keep working then clock back in. Otherwise you wony meet all your stops. It is impossible. You fall the exact amout short everytime if you take a lunch. Then you will get a call. I liked it though it was great to not be hovered over the whole time at work.
bad,"After 2 months, I´m waiting 617,12£."
bad,je préfère m'abstenir des commentaires.mais il y avait de belles femmes au telephone.Mdr
bad,The worst place to work. No job work balance. We were hired in at $18.25 and now our hiring class is being replaced with cheaper labor ..$3 less with more work. They use physiological warfare to get people to quit or they fire you for petty stuff. Lots of favoritism ... not sure how amazon being such an amazing company is running this division in this manner.
bad,"Working here was fun in the beginning. After the first couple months, the management wasn't too friendly with some of the associates. Also their Human Resources had attitudes whenever it came down to a normal associate asking simple questions"
bad,"Unable to advance even with years of experience and education. If you are not a YES man, do not work here. They only want employees who will do as they are told and follow those rules to a T. Care more about numbers than actually assisting customers."
bad,good place to work i learned nothing. physically demanding. long hours long days long night slow money the grind dont stop until the clock is punched.
bad,"Be a driver with a Amazon good to be as a 2nd job , "
bad,"The worst job ever , this company thinks that your a robot  unfair treatment of employees, the company does not give proper brakes all these people care about are numbers!!!"
bad,You had to move very fast to get the boxes and take them where they belong and then after you had to take the boxes and place them inside of bags so they can go out as delivered tomorrow morning when the drivers come on shift.
bad,"They make you reach a quota ever day and if you don't meet that then you get a write up. I was injured on the job and required surgery, when i informed my manager he told me to turn in my badge and that i was fired. I moved my whole life from fort wayne and worked my butt off, just to be fired for getting hurt on the job (that they knew about) and requiring surgery."
bad,"Being a picker was an isolated environment. You feel like a cog clicking into place with each repetitious task being presented before you. This particular position isn't for everyone, and that's fine, but these were the issues that I faced on a daily basis."
bad,"Bad place to work, they will turn you into a mean person. Give you unreachable goals and blame you for others wrong doing. I trained others that were starting off making more then me and never got promoted. I leanered jobs below me and above me but would always get passed on promotion. After 3 years finally got to travel and open new sites but was told when i came back to my home site they could afford to let me open other sites which i had 3 other managers asking for me."
bad,Amazon treats all employees like robots. They claim to be a team based company but in reality there is no team in the warehouse. Managers often dont have a clue what's going on and PA's are often useless as well. They expect you to go above and beyond for very low pay and minimal recognition when you hit targets. If you are considering applying for Amazon I urge you to rethink that decision... after one month of work you'll start to get thoughts about burning down the warehouse and escaping the prison you call work
bad,this job was very stressful no job security lots of standing very high turn over terrible training bad management short breaks for the amount of hours you work.
bad,"you work like a slave and you have no rights  , you are just a number...  managers only care about productivity and they expect you to work at 100% since your first day and telling you that if you dont you lose your job .. only work there till they need you"
bad,"No real future here, do the same repetitive task. Managers ask for too much that was actually possible we sometimes couldn't meet expectations due to shortage of equipment."
bad,"Post management at the Monee,Illinois location I will not recommended this job they is unfair and will terminate you without warning don’t work here frfr"
bad,"They didnt value or appreciate anyone for the efforts they made. Honestly, I would never work for them again. They play with your money, and they left me without a job even though I was a great asset. I told them I was the only one working in my household and went homeless because of them. The managers dont appreciate all thw hard work you do and make you feel bad. They expect you to be Speedy Gonzalez and deliver 200+ packages within the hours but if you don't they force you to stay out past your scheduled time to finish the route. They are always late and dont value your time."
bad,"Sachez une chose avant d'aller chez amazon à Lauwin-planque, pour y faire carrière, il faut savoir danser la choupetta ou le tcha tcha tcha, voir la foulamoi ..."
bad,"Lavoro ripetitivo e poco gratificante. Pause quasi inesistenti, poca considerazione della persona come essere umano ma piuttosto come schiavo di una grande multinazionale dedita al solo sfruttamento della manodopera."
bad,Horrible experience. Management was horrible. To much work for not much pay. Long exhausting shifts.No room to advance in the company. Management expected to much.
bad,"Worst company to work for. They treat the employees terribly, give out the worst shifts for anyone with a family, move you to a new OU without asking and you're not allowed to ask to be put back"
bad,"Kilkanaście dni temu postanowiłem złożyć aplikację do jednego z centr Amazona na pracownika magazynu. Dość szybko otrzymałem odpowiedź i zostałem umówiony na rekrutację. Umówiony przyjechałem jak sądziłem na rozmowę o pracę. I dość szybko sprowadzony na ziemię. "
bad,Poor pay dodgy people bad managers threatening staff abusing managers even Amazon staff is bad.They promise you lots of by the time you starting you will see ! Avoid
bad,WORST PLACE TO WORK AS THE STAFF EXPLOITS THEIR WORKERS.I also faced the problem of excessive pressure to work at continuous work speed.The most basic problem was of lack of organized staff especially at YVR(Vancouver)
bad,"There is nothing redeemable about this company. I can honestly say I have never worked in such a hostile, patronising and oppressive atmosphere.Even if they paid double the wages I would not go back"
bad,It's so easy to get fired from this place for rate. I went up to my managers and told them what was going on but they didn't even take that into consideration.
bad,"Moved across country after signing a contract and being told by the recruiter I was day shift to find out 2 weeks into my training it is a permanent night shift position. They throw young and new people into level 4 positions without proper training. I was one of them straight out of college. I discovered as soon as I worked there we had a bullie in our team. He put the manager down in multiple team meetings as well as other staff members. As time went on he started to get aggressive with me. Over time I let it slid, but I eventually talk to my manger thinking that's what I was supposed to do (WRONG, go to HR). They proceed to tell me they dealt with it and to figure it out myself, that it wasn't their problem. It got worse over time and I told HR, but they were such a tight nit group that had been working together for years they denied my claim. I found a job immediately after a lot more happened. I am happy with my new company because they are actually training me and helping my career grown in a positive way rather than you figure it out.Overall Amazon is a horrible company to work for. They have one of the highest turn over rates for a reason. The PPE is horrible for the employees and they don't care much about you. I was off the floor and watched employees and helped on an nightly basis. If your ready to feel like nothing you ever do is good enough this is the company for you."
bad,"horrible scan tools no gps  or anything to mount too ur scanning with a samsung the battery dies halfway through your day. left with a charger to charge it."
bad,"Amazon over works you, does not pay much for the work you do, doesn't give good working conditions, and cuts your breaks.  They counted you walking to your break as part of your time. Their medical staff treats everything with a icepack and ibuprofen."
bad,Managers were like machines. Job was extremely demanding for the pay. Mistakes were often made and you felt under pressure constantly. Pay was low for how well company thrives
bad,"A modern-day living concentration camp, you're just another number.  They find any possible reason to let employees go and bring them back after a ""probation"" to avoid paying them health benefits.  They actually brought back employees that were caught stealing food in their lunchrooms.  "
bad,"Even after years of service and hard work, associates are forced to switch to other paths and 'fired' after write ups. They do have an appeals panel and all other 'sham' processes to show how 'fair' they're but its all a big sham."
bad,"Every couple of days they have a new group of people joining the company and out of every 20-30 people that join only about 4-7 stay after 2 weeks. It's like a rotating door people go in and they come straight back out again and I don't blame them."
bad,I worked as hard as I could to make a career at amazon but was treated like a joke. Extremely difficult to become a manager without a degree and I worked there over 4 years
bad,"poor job, very, about 200 parcels to deliver per day I am driver myself-so i am not defending Amazon or any other companies.But how much parcel delivery should cost to us?- they need to collect parcel,deliver to depot and load on lorry,lorry have to take it to sorting place,then back to other lorry and get delivered in other depot,then loaded on vans and delivered locally..."
bad,Local HR is lacking knowledge and LOA is facilitated by a third party administration company.  Neither communicate with each other and this inevitably leads to convoluted situations.
bad,Management truly shows you who their favorite employees are and belittles the employees  who aren't their favorite. Bad vibes throughout. DLA5 in Riverside is the WORST!
bad,"Paid breaks begin at your last scan until you scan another item.  That's all great, but when you work on the 4th floor of a facility that is over 1 million sqft,and the front door and lockers are at the opposite end of the building, you can barely make it there before you have to start your 5+ minute walk/run back to you station.  Bathrooms are at least a 1/2 mile walk away.  your time off task is monitored and write ups are generated by the system.  I hope you're quick."
bad,"Management was very unorganized, They also had very poor communication skills. It was freezing cold in the winter and the heat was overwhelming, we didn't even have a ice machine. They could have at least offered us water bottles, and hand warmers in the winter."
bad,Work here until you find something you really want to do. Mindless moving of product from one place to another while giving the richest guy in the world even more profits
bad,I worked a couple peak seasons and it was stressful to me also I was pregnant and I had to be on my feet for more than 12 hours a day. could not go to the restroom or drink water other than breaks
bad,To get there to run through a door you get to your station you start packing you havwe to meet a certain qouta if you dont theyll fire you withing 1 days
bad,it was very unprofessional the end not a good place to work at what else i need to said about it what else you want me to say it was done and over with
bad,Amazon didn't care when I found hundreds of thousands of zombie VM's customers were paying for. I had a pager going off all the time and at three a.m. and the boss is totally political and made the mistake of being friends on facebook!
bad,"it is not a fair place to work, the culture is bad, they expect a lot from you. They ask you to do things that seem impossible when you first hear the task at hand."
bad,Worst place to work. Made promises and never kept them. Treated everyone (even managers) like we didn't deserve better treatment. Under paid for the amount of work produced.
bad,"The HR team in that company its the worst HR you ever gonna work with, Don't care about employees at all. that's the reason i left, i treat to be treated.the management even worst, they just horrible and the preference with some employees it's typical in the place, if they don't like you, you have one they of employment left."
bad,"Their rates were impossible to meet especially if you don't do that type of work,  I also had difficulties working in the freezer with my sinus's & my tendentious in my right wrist, which they aware but they still let go because I was too slow."
bad,"They allow customers to disrespect you"

Understands implications of work and makes recommendations for solutions. Normally receives little instruction on daily work, general instructions on newly introduced assignments."
bad,"they suck, and work you to death, and you walk 10 to 15 miles per day with or without break and breaks being 10 mins, and having to walk 1 mile to break room."
bad,"clock in go straight to work, "
bad,Worked at DM01.Managers pushed people like indentured servants. When goal were met no one ever received any positive feedback. Great co-workers make the job tolerable.
bad,"They expect everything from you but in return given you bare minimum.  The other contractors offer bonuses for your hard work but not PMLS/EBK. if you are not their "" favorite "" dont expect anything from them.  Dont waste your time!!!"
bad,You literally have to run from the van to the door or you won’t make your deliveries on time. The smash u with too many packages. Training is not very good
bad,It was boring. Your just a number. I had some life changing incidents and all they want is paperwork this paperwork that. I sent them information and they denied my leave.
bad,"not a good place for students and old people. Managers are not well educated and trained, The rules are in mess, don't care about their associates, no respect between leaders and associates"
bad,"As my books are with Amazon, it is really inaccurate to say I work for the company.  I know nothing about Amazon, save the fact that they give me a page to promote my books and send me a check every month consistently."
bad,"So much favorism and disrespect at Amazon. It's a dead-end job with little chance of promotion. Turnover is extremely high and management is full of idiots that don't know what they're doing. Mentally disabled people can run the warehouse better they can. The HR is the reason I quit and he purposely cut off my paycheck. I called him out on it, he didn't do a thing. You would as long as I stayed there(8 almost 9 months), he would respect me. But they do not care about you at all and employees only stay there from a day to a month. The management is so dumb that they cant tell a good and bad employees apart. I done my job correctly missed only 2 days and only been late 3 or 4 times. The ERC (Employee Resource Center) is just as bad as the management there and they don't help you with your attendance points and you end up cussing them out or yelling at them because that's how incompetent they are. The only good that came out of working for Amazon are the weekly pay, my income tax, and the friendly coworkers. Everything is horrible about Amazon."
bad,"Dog eat dog "
bad,Most of the management here will barely bother to learn your name. I actually liked the work I was doing but the atmosphere was horrible. They will push you to work as hard as you can just so they can cut your hours back at the end of the day.
bad,"I hated working for amazon. I was harassed, injured, ignored, belittled, attacked, over worked, underappreciated, you name it it was all bad. They encourage conflict so others feel like they need to do better than the others, there's a hierarchy where they don't care about who is below or beside them, you could be the hardest worker they have and they will still treat you like your not doing good enough and they find ways to fire you over anything so you don't get your paid time."
bad,Good grief where do I start ? I heard everything great about Amazon but what a wake up call this was .This place is just horrible .I know it can't be like that at other Amazon warehouse locations like Kentucky . The training was nothing like related to actually getting into the actual work .Seems they rushed to get this opened . Man the yelling by managers is just uncalled for . A lot of people left good jobs to come here . What a huge disaapointment !
bad,Amazon coimbatore us like a typical third class call centre. Managers are not upto the standards. Worst place to work. Current employee . Never move to CBE
bad,"Travail penible mal payé Turner over permanant aucune reconnaissance "
bad,"The Company is lacking in the basic to understand the need of the customer and the health benefits of the employees. "
bad,"Management is terrible, the culture is abusive and the staff are all young and working in a hostile environment. I would never recommend anyone to work at Amazon.  Jeff Bezos does not care nor respect his employee that are providing their time for his business."
bad,"High numbers to meet, little training with poor management not wanting to help excel new members."
bad,"Pros - "
bad,Entreprise médiocre qui ne pense qu'à la production et non à ses employés. Beaucoup de pression morale pour au final ne pas avoir possibilité d'évoluer.
bad,"Worked at Amazon in 1.6 years... The worst experience of my life as I have also heard from many of my colleagues that have left."
bad,The work environment was ok I worked up until I found out I was pregnant. I left because I asked for something that was not going to be hard on my pregnancy and they denied it.
bad,"Horrible place to work for and will never associate with amazon and its affiliates again. Was fired after being injured on the job, was written up for using the restroom."
bad,"I do not have many good things to say about working for this company personally. Management was very about favoritism and let some slide when other hard workers got in trouble for using the restroom a little over 2 minutes. I worked about 10 hours a day and i was called a stower where you stand for the whole 10 hours and place products into shelves. Its very repetitive but also kills your feet, so invest in good shoes. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job were my peers, some were nice and would help out when they could and others were just trying to make a new friend. Overall i do not recommend working here as the culture here was not that great and management was not fair to everyone."
bad,Lack of communication and  work availability long hours very unprofessional staff training was available if you could learn it all in one day could have been a great place to work with better understanding of operations .
bad,Very disorganized and hiring process is terrible and human resources when hired is overseas. I do not recommend anybody working here. In order to move up you must know people. No good work is recognized.
bad,I worked as a contractor for amazon....now maybe as a direct employee amazon is ok but i worked for a contractor called wheels for work and it was unreal...i do not recommend anyone to be employed by any contractor for amazon....you will definately regret it it because all the contractors hire mostly is addicts w a ghetto mentality....the atmosphere is toxic and the managers do not care at all about your safety they only care about you getting them packages being delivered....if you cant get directly hired w amazon then 4get it because the contractors only care about their pockets
bad,"Couldn't go to the bathroom without falling behind on your quota, since we got no breaks. I got an injury and they kept making me work despite asking for lighter duty they put me on the heaviest stuff."
bad,"Don't work in the warehouse!!"
bad,the only good thing about this job is the benefits. this job is very unorganized. The managers don't know what's going on. No flexible hours.  They took away the .25 raises ... they make promises they can't keep. The only way to move up is to be under the managers all day every day it's never about how hard you work or how good you are.
bad,Not a great place to work if you are working on the line. Bad money and you get tracked by employers and searched every time you enter and exit the building.
bad,Great startup type experience. Positive and supportive but it is very apparent being over 40 is a negative attribute. Diversity of age is lacking. Older workers are often sidelined or not involved. All 4 team members over 40 in a sub group of 15 were let go within a few months of each other.  This could be a coincidence but it is typical of many tech firms now where diversity does not look to balance for all ages. I expect to see people from there 20's through their 60's+ in tech.
bad,"working over night wasnt for me. Management was okay. kind of strict, i liked the fact you could listen to music. standing on your feet long hours and scanning boxes"
bad,i hated working at amazon and for me the work was to much for my body to handle and my doctor advised me to leave due to the fact that i was becoming sick
bad,I found Amazon to be a terrible company to work for. They don't give a about you or your work /life balance. They just care about productivity. The robots can't come fast enough.
bad,I was a temp and got sick my first week with bronchitis and they let me go . I kind of enjoyed it but picking was a little diffucult because I didn't get every good training and training was only for 2 hours
bad,"This company is all about production and safety you will get fired if numbers are low and if you working hard to make your numbers then you get in trouble cause of how u pick up a dang box. Break is supposed to be 15 minutes but it takes 5 minutes to walk to break room from floor u sit for 5 minutes and then walk back to floor the next 5 minutes, if you sit down the whole 15 minutes you get in trouble when you get back to your station. I hated that because your on your feet long hours and carrying heavy boxes well over 50lbs why cant I enjoy a whole 15 minute break. Management sucked"
bad,"Amazon is notorious for treating its employees as expendable assets. "
bad,I never enjoyed working there people there are very rude its hard to take your job serious when everyone is just playing around using inappropriate language even the PAs thereis so much favoritism there
bad,if your on pack they push you to lift more than your own weight and you have to do it all really really fast and even if you get hurt working their they still expect you to come in the next day management are no help if there is an issue and only good part about it is lunch and going home maybe another part like pick or somewhere else would be better but pack is not good if your rather small and weak i applied for pick but i got put on pack and its always so cold there the glue from the tape makes your hands feel weird to the point you want to wash them every two minutes they do give gloves but they are useless cant work properly in them
bad,They work you overtime and they base the systems off the lower of the group so they are always cutting the low 5 percent of people so you are always competing to keep you job and they treat you more like a machine.
bad,It was an awful and toxic work environment. Constant dread looms over you everyday you work there. Management is disconnected from everyone else. Terrible.
bad,"Worst job I ever worked at, worked you like a dog in a none A/C warehouse. Bad pay, terrible management that pick favorites. Using a scanner to scan in Items that need to be shipped."
bad,"Of all the places I have worked, Amazon stands out as the worst job I have ever had the displeasure of having. They don't tell you during the interview that you will be required to work at least 10 hours of overtime a week, sometimes 20. The management does nothing of note and more often than not I found them sitting in cushioned chairs in the back room laughing and cracking jokes while everyone else works. "
bad,It just could’ve been better.. It was easy but there was no growth and they purposely added points to me for no reason...... employees well they’re employees some act like children
bad,"Shady management tactics, they will lie and twist your words to your face and to upper management. Favoritism is a cornerstone of both management and supervisor tactics"
bad,"There was a mandatory day which I was never consulted about. On that day I wound up in bed extremely ill, too ill to be within the permits of standard health-code policy. I was incapable of much movement or having many current functionalities at the time; if I had had the ability to come into work, my illness would have me standing in health-code violation. Regardless, without warning as well mind you, they promptly and unjustly terminated my position at Amazon."
bad,"I honestly do not see a point in working there, no such thing as work friends as you wont ever have a chance to speak to anyone else. You are overworked and just end up suffering and are only hired temporarily ."
bad,Everyone there was negative all the time. Very low self esteems and not any positive vibes. No one wanted to grow and because its so easy to get a job there they don't screen out any of the weird personalities.
bad,Worked at BDL5 from late summer through peak.... environment is chaotic and you're treated like cattle. Co-workers are miserable for the most part although i met a few decent people.  Management is amateur to say the least and no matter how hard you work it's never enough. . You're not allowed to be out sick unless you have time off points accumulated and you're allowed ONE medical waiver. Also break time is supposed to be 15min but in reality it's barely 5 minutes from all the walking you do to the break room and making you're way through people who just move too slow. Not recommended at all...other jobs pay as much if not more.
bad,"1. A typical day at work 10-12 h."
bad,"they didn't give me enough hours to work. the pay wasn't enough. the manager came to see how i was doing, and said that my productivity wasn't perfect"
bad,"Amazon only cares about the numbers you put out. You are given 15 min. breaks but there are only 2 breakrooms in a 1 MILLION sq. ft. building. the time it takes you to get to and from the breakroom counts against you. Same for your 30 min lunch break. Boils down to 15 mins with walking time. After work, everyone goes through metal detectors and may be searched. The metal detectors are ALWAYS broken. The policy is not to search or help you when the machine breaks but to allow ALL others exiting to go through first and then you will be assisted. This results in you being held for 30 mins. or more after your shift. The security guards are lackluster and slow to act as you leaving doesn't affect them and they are not too shy to tell you they don't care."
bad,"I hated working here. They changed my Schedule without notice, as well as would cut shift or prolong without notice as well. They were not very understanding of sick time and made it impossible to get in touch with anyone"
bad,"I would not recommend working at amazon, unless absolutely necessary. The environment is extremely stressful with overseers breathing down your neck at all times. You are expendable to them, as there is no leeway for mistakes, and there is little to no understanding of conflicts between life and work."
bad,leider kann ich nur negatives berichten denn ich hatte nur Schichtführer mit einer üblen Sozialkompetenz...
bad,Toujours plus pour être jeté une fois que des nouveaux arrivent. Jamais assez de production. Aucun point positif
bad,"Dont unless you're desperate, long hours with no consistency, got paid on time once, the people are miserable because of the working conditions, just dont"
bad,"Do not work for this company or any of its Delivery Associates courier company’s. I worked for a DA company and was paid £120 per day and a mileage allowance of 18p per mile. I was expected to delivery between 100 to 200 parcels per route which was to be completed before 22:00hrs each day. The Amazon training in the UK is over four days for which you don’t get paid and the training shows you how to driving your van / vehicle but it’s based around a video that was made in Australia and does take into account the UK Highway Code rules. Out of the daily pay of £120, I had to supply my own van which had to have 5.5 cubic meter volume, which if generally around a Ford Transit size vehicle, my own Goods and Reward insurance for that vehicle, my own phone with suitable Android software for their Amazon App and public liability insurance. Out of the pay you receive, you need to pay an account or the Delivery Associate will provide one that they use but you pay for that too which can be expensive. The Delivery Associate will generate your invoice for you so you don’t know if you are being paid the correct amount. So their isn’t anything good I can say about working for Amazon, it’s just badly organised for the people who turn up everyday to do the work. One thing before I sign off, if you see something online that you want to buy and it says “ free delivery” , don’t buy it. Everything in life has a cost element so nothing is free. It might be free to you but to get your item from the supplier to you , how much does to cost to transport it. Someone has to pay for it and it will be the"
bad,I work at the downtown delivery station and we working out of a tent. They have some gas heat hoses that can make you sick from smelling the fumes. Even though they have the heat hoses it still be very cold and we have to stand out side in the cold in rain sleet or snow. They don't provide the proper gear we need for an outside job. We asked the manager several times about that but he still haven't done anything. It's a bunch of inexperienced very young managers and supervisors there. They don't care bout you period. They just changed everybody work shift time and forcing us to accept the new shift without giving us other options as we are permanent workers but telling us if we don't accept we will be temporary and then fired. That is very unacceptable. I heard the other locations are bad as well. Please think again if you thinking about working for Amazon in Memphis.
bad,not enough pay for what you are required to do not enough time to get to where you need to get for lunch and breaks to much is excepted for the worker for the amount of money the company is making
bad,"It is very stressful abusive job. I dealt with it for two years low pay and new manager almost every month. I tried to get a full time position, but  I was told I had to apply for a whole different position to get it. The most enjoyable when I did get understanding customers who were happy I could solve their issues and concerns. I love I could chose my own hours. I hated that if their is an outage in my whole neighborhood I was threatened  that I would lose my employment."
bad,It sucks and the head hr lady in northeast md amazon mdt2 is the buggest rasist there a black lady. They dont have the equipment the workers need in order for them not to get hurt and they dont care about both sides of the story cause it h
bad,"Entreprise a éviter si vous tenez à votre santé on est traité comme du bétail  les nuits sont  longues"
bad,"Waiting for the hammer to drop on working conditions at Amazon.  Can only describe it as ""slave like.""  Had to use the restroom once, when it was not scheduled.  Was harassed the moment I walked out the door.  Constant harassment while you are working.  Worst working environment I ever experienced. Bar none!  To much emphasis on ""quotas."""
bad,poor management. lack of schedules. was never given the opportunity to show my own potential now improve my own skills. the hour were unsocialable and the rate of pay didnt reflect.
bad,"The job was very physically demanding. Management is solely focused on productivity numbers. Management 'plays favorites.'"
bad,You'll Apply just for there to be no hours available. what's the point of POSTING EVERYWHERE that your hiring when there are no hours available. Look elsewhere my friend works here and it's sweatshop slavelabor that pays decent.

bad,"Back breaking, unrealistic quotas. I would rather do landscaping in the Florida summer than work back at Amazon. They hire anyone for the warehouse and it shows, your coworkers will be stupid."
bad,"I worked for Token Logistics a startup company. The fulfillment always starts late. The mapping is chaotic, management shows favoritism. Doesn't value drivers. A random driver ran into me and I was let go shortly after. I was not at fault. You are told to your face that you can be replaced and that someone else can take your job."
bad,"Amazon supervisors gave us hope to be hired full-time after seasonal job, but after the holidays every single delivery employee was let go without any notice. They lied to us all. Very disappointing"
bad,amazon not a place nor safe environment to work in. work was good i loved it at one point but then it became violent in the work place. i was a sorter.
bad,"Worked there for all of 2 months, I is away to make decent money through the holiday's but will burn you to your last nerve with a micromanaging leadership that doesn't know your job any better that you on your first day."
bad,"Worst company I ever worked for. Breaks are non existent, company is cutthroat and your managers do not care. Do not work for this company unless you want to hate your job."
bad,"O lavorato  per tre mesi tragici ""amazon"" non e stato molto picevole i menager si credono chi sa chi,  li saluti come un persona educata loro manco ti vedono e questo e"" amazon "" in piu  segnatevi le ore ,se li intascano loro ,la gente si fa in due  per poi essere cacciata  Non e giusto "
bad,Only work here if you need money. If you intend to take pride in your work or feel good avout coming to work. Never apply here. Your spirit will get smashed to pieces by how robotic the work is.
bad,Amazon is a great  place to work for they just have high demand in term of work preformance. I love working for Amazon because I got a chance to see what was available in other work ethic thought out company for other opportunities and advancement.
bad,"Worked at smf1in Sacramento, California started work in November as a package handler,worked excessive hours during seasonal peak 12 hour days 5 days a week for entire month of December. Breaks were ""15"" minutes but really only 5-8 minutes by the time you get to break room. Couldnt go to the bathroom otherwise your rate would drop so had to wait tell break. PA's rarely helped mostly on there laptop wasting time away and on employees nonstop to keep rate higher then the average daily rate. Most seasonals quit or didnt make it through december because of excessive hours and hard labor. Always end up sore the next day and have to drag it on for 4 more days of the week. I was one of the seasonals that survived all the way through January, was told by managers that I should convert for blue badge because I was good at my job and managers liked me as an employee. I wasnt told by managers/hr when last day of seasonal was and neither were other associates. Ended up getting a call on day off that the season was over and not needed anymore. I feel lied to and the conversion of blue badge was all a lie just to make us all work harder so they could get the most out of us then to get rid of us."
bad,They work you like a slave but dont want to pay you for the hours that you worked for. They tell you that your on the schedule for 4:30a.m. to 2:30 but you come back from a break they gave you  and they tell you that you gotta stay til 3:30. If you cant stay you get a verbal warning. Which is not fsir at all.
bad,I worked as a driver. I’ve now left and I’m getting completely ignored by the accounts team about my pay. Long hour which aren’t even worth the money. The management is awful. I was ill one day and they forced me to stay on the road.... I went home! They decided to tell me they weren’t paying me a penny. Horrible people that work there seriously I wouldn’t even bother getting a job there
bad,"Terrible company that had you fight for workable hours. Never had guaranteed time worked, and did not ensure that the other employees were legally allowed to work in the united states."
bad,"My biggest problem with Amazon is there manipulative ways. They raised the minimum wage to 15 per hour. Had this huge press run about how they are ahead of the game looking out for employees. No you are not Nyc just raised the minimum wage to 15 perhour 2months after. Secondly you constantly put caps on the hours. The most a part time worker can make at amazon before taxes is 600 dollars. Why put a cap on that. So u raise the pay which is still mimimum wage, then u cut the hours? Then u have all these weired things about consecutive days worked. So one week I did 40 hours the next week you are blocking my shifts blocking the amount of hours that I can potentially work. It's ridiculous. Let people work if they want. But it's all a math game to amazon. They don't want the staff working hours because they don't want to pay benefits"
bad,"The managers show no support for employees. Even when doing the job, in the stowing department at least, they stopped you from having a friendly chat with colleagues. If you want your soul sucked out as effectively as kissing a Dementor, go for it."
bad,It was an awful experience that I hope to God never to repeat in all my working days. Never had I worked so hard and been aware of so much overarching sight at a place that honestly didn't require so much.
bad,"they do not want people to stay. from day one they look for reasons to fire. over managed. a modern day slave market. only college kids allowed to advance, NO respect older workers"
bad,worked here 4 years and it was not a great experience. I had some good experiences early years but it only got worse the longer you stay. Some managers were good but I had some terrible ones as well. They don't help you succeed or advance. Pay is not great for what they expect from you.
bad,"if you like your life outside of work don't work here they will work you all day from morning to late night. no benefits no raises, to mention  pay is low considering to other parcel jobs."
bad,"Too many people trying to run the show, fast-paced, not enough notice for overtime. When it was peak season, they would hire tons of people they were just going to fire after peak season is over."
bad,Hated everything about it! Would earn more money doing the same hours on minimum wage. 10 mins to load your van that you have to pay for yourself. Out far too early to be knocking at peoples houses.if no reply then to take back at end of run rather than return to Amazon. there is more but can't be bothered typing any more.
bad,"very fast paced work place, had long distance travelling. drivers were constantly put under pressure. drivers expenses were really high, which then downgraded the salary gained"
bad,"I’ve worked harder jobs physically and emotionally and have never felt so terrible about myself emotionally and physically.  Management doesn’t help, everybody has their own cliques and if you weren’t hired in with them you aren’t worthy. Nobody’s willing to help"
bad,"Amazon needs to take better care of there employees and not treat them like they are slave workers. They make you feel like your getting something great until you actually start working inside. At the end of it all, I was very disappointed."
bad,I didn't even know who my managers were to go to with things. The warehouse was unbearably hot and the pick times were impossible. The break times included the time it took to walk all the way back to the break room and the time to get back to your pick area so you were lucky to get a 5 min break.
bad,Working here was one of the most monotonous and tedious things I have ever endured. After your first week or so it seems like the trainers forget all about you and you become a ghost in the machine.
bad,"Quotas are very high and are raised every few months to a year. Little pay, little benefits, management cares only about quotas. 2/10, wouldn't work again."
bad,"Amazon is one of the top OSHA ""Dirty Dozen"" employers for work place abuses and injuries.  It is a modern day sweat shop.  The management style is abusive and demeaning.  Only negative feedback is given, never positive feedback.   "
bad,"Management is rubbish he came shouting in my face for absolutely no reason reported him and got the sack because I reported a member of management. "
bad,"Horrible place to work. A lot has changed "
bad,"had to work a month in hand, whilst paying your own fuel. after resigning they stop giving you work but continue to charge for the van, then lied on the look around sheet for damage and invoiced me almost the exact amount that i'd earnt. basically worked for nothing and ended up owing them money"
bad,"Was to much heavy lifting, in a period of ten hours. During the holiday season it is too much heavy lifting for a twelve hour shift, and you only receive 30 minutes for lunch."
bad,"No room for advancement from PA, when Amazon hires 120 kids right out of college ,at the level above you.  You are then expected to train your boss, while trying to do your own job.  My other PA and I trained 3 Area Managers in less than 2 years there."
bad,Treat implores like answeat shop. People that are hurt are still talked into working. One arm one leg it doesn’t matter. Management hates working their so they take it out on peons
bad,over work you micro manage and are never satisfied.                         they take charge of everything you do and dont care about  your well being. plus the 4 10 hour shift sucks
bad,"If you're looking to start a job don't work at AMAZON. Amazon is a place of slavery. You work 10 hours a day doing the same thing over and over again. It such a slow paste job. Standing on the same spot for 10 hours is tiring more than a physical work, scanning boxes, packaging, folding boxes will kill your brain. And on top of that during busy day you will need to work 12 hours a day 5 days a week. It's like SLAVERY. The training is stupid, they give you so little time and they expect you remember everything they taught you on the first day. This is the hardest warehouse job ever, for me at least. NEVER COMING BACK TO AMAZON."
bad,The supervisors and bosses foster a culture of rats and snitches.  Everyone is replaceable and is a number.  They are all anti conservative and liberal views are the norm.  They bully those that do not agree with their opinions.  Those that are vocal are sought out and terminated at the first chance.  Bullying is a normal.  They took away all stock bonuses and overtime.  It wasn't worth the bad work environment after they took away any extras.  Full time employees suffer so Amazon can look good for raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour to part timers.
bad,"Working here was terrible because of the service and the way the management of amazon ran everything, constantly lied and overworked the workers forcing mandatory overtime."
bad,"Barely gave hours, had to fight for a shift, didn't give full training . the atmosphere wasn't comfortable . Managers were barely around for help, had to figure everything out on my own."
bad,"Completely ridiculous, worst training.  Worst safety.      Brandy.  Is without a doubt the worst “trainer” and person I’ve ever met.        Absolutely the worst company in Oklahoma"
bad,"unless you are a robot then there is no way I could meet the requirements they expected to work as a stow person, which is putting stuff on shelves from totes. It's not a realistic number to expect people to put away 500 items per hour."
bad,"I had graduated from with an MBA degree with A+. I joined Amazon as every season where I work fantastic and meet all the targets. When the time comes for my conversion and my manager who is polish, of course, knew that I have MBA does not allow me to progress. Even to get permanent there, they never let me. Thus I know some Romanian, polish etc. that was the only a month and get a permanent contract...That is an absolute shame. Even managers do not speak English at all, and they are arrogant as Amazon is in Poland or whatever. I can never go back there to work."
bad,There is nothing to say about the job it is a warehouse job its closed off no windows no music its hot we rush around to make rate pushing heavy carts
bad,"The day started about the same time every day, the same routine, but warehouse organization was a disaster. Finding where I was supposed to load was a daily struggle, my workload changed from day to day. Some days I would finish my route as early as 3pm, while other days towards the end of my time there I couldn't even think about going home until 9pm, and with that being said I wasn't getting any additional compensation for the extra 6 hours I worked. Those extra hours were tacked on because of the disorganization in the warehouse meant you'd find packages you were supposed to deliver earlier in the day, but would be in an entirely separate bag and I was obligated to retrace my entire route untiI all packages were delivered. I met 3 different sets of advisers in my short time there, with only added to the chaos."
bad,the company just did not care about the employees that were working for them all the care was focused on the production that's about it.  there were major problems.
bad,Horrible place to work still haven't gotten paid since my start date and I started November 1st HR is absolutely no help they take you around in circles and make you feel like it's your fault for stuff they should be on top of hardly saw my manager you can't talk to them for nothing inside is like customs at the airport everyone is a suspect.
bad,Over worked and want more out of you. Did not pay well for the high volume and expections were not achievable. Do not listen to workers for solutions to problems. Have young mangers in high positions with no experience and do not promote with in the company would rather higher young mangers who are yes men or woman.
bad,"High work demanding position with limited to no breaks. For the past month they have been making my site stay longer and they have cut out one of our breaks. There isnt any loyalty and they regularly tell us that everyone is replaceable at the beginning of the shift meeting. Regularly I have witnessed employees breaking the rules and management allowing the rules to be broken. I would just say that my experience is contingent with my location, but if you read reviews internationally the conditions are bad."
bad,Intérimaire ont nous prend pour des c.. sefty rien du tout production a font contrôlé surveiller a la limite du harcèlement moral ont fait tout pour vous cassé et rentré dans un moule les lead sont vraiment a évité je dirait pas de nom mes par contre chapeau a nadia la pg Laurence et fatou mes 3 instructor préféré avec celine du sweep eux devrait être lead elles sont humaines pas des machine a succès le cerveau
bad,Don't work at MEM1 Terrible . The HR department is inexperienced and unprofessional.  They treat you like a kid talking very rude to you. Stressful and not worth working at the MEM1. Sad place.
bad,Micro management on steroids your tracked constantly to the second theirs no time to get to know fellow associates and your breaks are laughable because by the time you get to where you need to go your break is already over and you have to go through more stringent security than you would if you were trying to catch a flight on top of being stuck in a building with no windows and exposed to ridiculous heat
bad,"these will drain the life out of you + more. Management is clueless, pay is way less than minimum. £200 a week for the van and they'll charge you for damages that were already there!"
bad,"I HATE Amazon!!! There is absolutely NOTHING positive about working there. I feel so sorry for anyone working there. The management treat staff in a disrespectful manner all the time, to include saying repeatedly to staff, ""You suck. You need to be doing your job better."""
bad,"trash, I hated it don't waste your time on such a job managers don't even know your name, I didn't know who was who and I worked there for at least a month, they don't care about their employees and see them as expendable pawns to be used at their will."
bad,"Aucune considération de ses employés. salaire minable, travaille posté sans. Obligation de faire des heures supplémentaire de manière cachées : Faites des heures sup, vous serez récompenses sinon ciao."
bad,"The training for Inbound putaways is terrible. They only give one day of training. They put you on your own next day. We make multiple of errors they dont like. They are always rushing you to do more and more. When you are putting away items , you look for the locations the scanner dont tell you where to go. You have to go down each isle to find a location to put it away but the scan gun will say improper location so you spend time looking to put it away , it affects your quota they want 100 percent. They are others I know are over riding the scan gun to put items away. I know thats how they are getting these big numbers. The Ambassador are suppose to train you correctly but it only maybe a 2 hours cause they others to train also. If you are picker you will do great the scan gun tells you where and what location and bin number.  They should have the same for Inbound putaways but they dont. They set you up to fail on this job position. You ask a manger for help they forget about you. They are always finding ways to write you up. They are way to strict for what they are. Employees are rude esp one that been there we ask for help from one of them that does well on numbers he just laugh ask how he does it...that so wrong when you are suppose to be a team. Amazon says were a team. The 15 min breaks are joke cause you dont it by the time you park your picker it take 5 mins to get to break room so they count once you park your picker not fair I do believe. You might get 8 mins of break if you are late they write you up. The supervisor tells you to eat on your picker. You aren't allow"
bad,"Careful wasting your time on this one, jumped on it due to it being a sponsored posting within this website, but unfortunately was not worth my time at all."
bad,"An adversarial management approach. Every manager was a bully. Every bathroom break followed by an inquisition as to why you had those, as few as three, minutes without production on you login."
bad,"They write you up one after another until you are fired, only liked it the  first month.You start to see people come and go quick, they over staff because the turn over rate is so high. They make you feel like a robot only caring about the numbers, the money is not worth the stress."
bad,"This is a horrible place to wok no advancement, favoritism is unreal here. If you are not like at this job you will not get any  type of opportunity for other positions.I have tried time after time but they stop me or ignore every time. I hate this place.We got a raised but before we got our raise they cut down our days, so it don;t seem like we got a raised. no pay vacation, no sick time no nothing"
bad,This place is terrible I’m in the Charlotte NC area and when I started they tell you all these good things but really it’s lies as a company they don’t care about nothing but those lights they put the pressure on you to keep them down but that takes up time when your trying to keep your rates up which their on your back about those too 15 min break is really 10 mins and 30 min lunch is really 20 to 25 mins and here in Charlotte peak season started off slow it’s been slow for the whole month of November I started in October I just got terminated for my rates being low in a slow peak season they monitor rates everyday because it’s peak and it’s supposed to be a lot more work coming in so they are expecting for your rates to be high but it’s impossible when your on the line and it’s slow so when your rates are low they skip over to a final write up that is what happened to me it’s slave work you can’t win for losing in that place they set you up for failure in that place only good thing was the 15 dollars but it’s not worth it when you have to go through the most and back for it and on top of that you get a half of a point for being late from your short 20 min lunch break which is unfair  I had to do a lot just to keep this job put my child in after school which isn’t free and then they just fire me over the dumbest thing ever if that’s the case fire everybody because everbodies rates are low in this slow peak season and they know it and that’s why they put their rates and final write ups in place to get rid of people because peak isn’t what they expected it to be this year please
bad,Bonjour chers internautes je tenais à laisser mon commentaire à travers ce site je travaille chez Amazon pendant 2 jours j'avais un contrat de 2 semaines pendant les périodes de fête au tout début quand j'ai commencé on m'a présenté l'entreprise dans la section de recrutement et ensuite j'ai commencé j'ai débuté dans le poste de agent d'exploitation logistique c'est-à-dire triage de colis et je peux vous dire que Amazon considère les intérimaires les employés comme des esclaves des vrais esclaves j'ai abandonné est-ce que je me suis dit que l'argent ne peux pas être mon maître et je vous conseille vivement de ne pas aller là-bas si vous tenez à votre vie et à votre santé de plus le salaire très mal payé à fuir e cette entreprise
bad,Avoid like the plague over worked under payed very little family and social life and very little gratitude from anybody who are directly employed by amazon
bad,don't go there. they treat you like the scum on the bottom of your shoes. Management don't treat you well and unless you have a permanent contract they look down on you.
bad,There is nothing pleasant about this job but the associates!!!! Management does not care about your personal life and neither does the company. I WOULD ADVISE YOU TO LOOK AT OTHER JOBS!!!! Also you will work 70+ hours during holidays and are only paid for 40 hours!!
bad,"médecine du travail gérer par les infirmières de l entreprise, nous ne sommes que des machines!!!!"
bad,"When i started working, there were plenty of shifts available, after having to wait a month to get a chance to pick a shift, due to an error on Amazon's part.   Now, there are never any shifts available to those who are not ""gold"". And, because all of the shifts are already taken by the time they become available to the rest of  us, we'll never be able to become gold to  get to even pick a shift."
bad,"started out great"
bad,"Amazon is a poor, overworking environment. Harassment was very prevalent there as well. Managers would hound you if the scan rate was not where t needed to be."
bad,"Very stressful....slave like environment. No room for advancement. I was VTO on a weekly basis. Traffic was horrible, it took me 30 minutes just to get to the parking lot and about 15 minutes to get out when it was time to go home."
bad,"back breaking job, as a part-time associate you don't get really good benefits. Manager are sometimes OK, but they don't care about the people just about their quota"
bad,"Mucho trabajo, poco descanso. Demasiadas horas trabajando para obtener un sueldo digno."
bad,Terrible Evaluation Process.  Only one person holds your destiny in their hands.  Need to have more managers involved in process of evaluation a Level 6 Manager
bad,"Si quieres trabajar 65 o 90 horas a la semana, fines de semana, festivos y no tener vida este es el mejor sitio en el que puedes trabajar. Por cierto, las horas extras no te las pagaran. Si te gusta trabajar en un ambiente de trabajo agresivo donde tus compañeros no dudaran en pisarte para que les reconozcan a ellos y trabajar en el lugar mas individualista y con menos conciliación familiar del mundo, entonces Amazon es la empresa para la que quieres trabajar."
bad,"When I try and get a job off there site it just a waist of time it always says uh oh so I try again and again I'm up from 5am till night trying to get in so I just stop trying they try and make there selves look good but it's no jobs and if it is all the way in jefferson ga, that is a far ride almost 3 hours away from where I'm located that's just not cool."
bad,Amazon do not treat their business customers nicely and I was abused for telling business owners Amazon's policies about not paying the sellers but sellers must still ship item to customer.
bad,"i hate amazon.i will never work for amazon. they dont care about your health, your just a number there, they always tell you your replaceable bad work environment"
bad,"Spent 2 yrs there and it was ciaos from day one. This company will risk your safety or others safety just to "" get it done"". Useless meetings sounds like a train no training."
bad,Pas terrible les gens sont aigris ont dirai des zombies
bad,"When I started November 2017 poor training had to fend for myself about answers to questions time off task. Hiring  unqualified people  to be supervisors who never picked product favoritism, galore can’t even take a bathroom  break . Oh  yeah Bentley manager dumb as a stump along with Kevin bonk horrible manager   Juliet can’t  even talk and Jeremy mr restaurant manager a real horrible human being    They write you up  for anything "
bad,10 hours of repetitive work 2 30min breaks 1 paid 1 unpaid treated like school kids the unpaid break is made up with an extra 30min working time shift starts at 8am and ends at 6:30pm walking time to canteen from receive is approx 5min if walking at normal pace or 3min speed walking. Management continually reminding you of your targets and time to and from stations before and after breaks. If you're late from a break it goes on your record. Receive you need to scan 600 items an hour a bit hard to do if you're scanning large items. You get trained to do various different stations but all the same repetitive work. Foreigners seem to have most of the supervisor and management positions and seem to be pushed forward in instructor and problem solving positions. Staff turnover is extraordinarily high for a reason. Forced to do compulsory overtime over the Xmas period 50-60 hours a week. Ok if you have no family or social life and live in a communal house. Not a job for anyone opposed to slave labour. End users to blame for Amazon success I will never work for Amazon or purchase anything off of Amazon again.
bad,"I was a stower for about a month in a half before quitting mid shift. They have unrealistic quotes you have to meet each night. I was one of the fastest stowers starting out but it became very demanding and slave like. They don’t care if you’re one of the best stowers because the minute you slack off, they throw it in your face and constantly threaten you with write ups. Most nights you’ll have a pallet with very large items to stow away ex: (large toys, cat litter) with little to no pod space to stow them on. Which results in your (takt time) being extremely high and overall a bad production night for you. They monitor your time off from your station with a system called time off task. They monitor your time by scan to scan, meaning how long it takes you to scan one item to the next. Not mentioning it takes a good 5 mins to walk to the bathroom and you spend about a minute in the restroom rushing to get back and another 5 minutes to walk back to your station. They give you 30 mins time of task a shift. So don’t try and go more than once to the restroom a shift if you don’t want to go over that 30 minutes. It takes 10 whole minutes to walk to the break room so you’re really not getting you’re whole 30 mins break. I find myself scarfing down my food in 5 minutes. I like to feel relaxed on my lunch break without being rushed to get back to your station exactly 30 mins after your last scan. I can go on and on about this place. My review will turn into a book if i don’t stop now lol"
bad,I feel that the management in place cares very little about their employees.  They take credit for things they did not do.  Very micromanaging to the littlest detail.
bad,"if you don't like to your HR, doesn't matter how many experiences you have - they don't care."
bad,It is worst company to be employed the associates do not have any rights Amazon only cares about their challenge of product not the rights of employee they are not deserve to work for them.
bad,This is the kind of place that says safety first.  But it is production numbers first all day.  Seems someone was leaving in an ambulance every other week
bad,Lamentable te explotan y te despiden con un mail de madrugada mientras duermes después de trabajar como un burro de carga. Fiel reflejo de la realidad del mercado laboral actual
bad,"Amazon is a huge company with the coolest and latest technologies. However, the company culture is really bad. Managers made their decisions based on their interests."
bad,"This company treats you like utter garbage, like a slave. You're nothing but an expendable tool for them.  "
bad,"Too many 3rd party vendors involved, no communication, no accountability, repetitive breach of contract between Amazon and Integrity on Amazon behalf (inaccurate workflow forecasting demanded increased volume and speed of onboarding, which resulted in mass layoffs just BEFORE the holidays); delayed compensation with promotions, minimal training, unethical business practices (forcing all employees to remain standing for hours on end while the 'floor' was down due to robot-related issues. "
bad,Was good experience wouldn't mind working there again just hard to get to as I live far away from the ware house so I was late ll the time if I found some where closer it would be good
bad,"How can an individual work for a company such as amazon, that does not care about people? treats them as robots and does not pay any attention to what they have to say?"
bad,On call 24/7 as a 1 person team overseeing issues from employees stealing to trying to commit suicide. If you don't answer your phone prepare for poor engagement surveys. Talking to employees who are suicidal with no training leaving most in very confusing difficult situations.
bad,Amazon management was overall very rude and careless. Safety was an issue around the loading dock and there was rudeness from other workers. The other workers would often slack off and leave the majority of work to the hard working few.
bad,"Worked/ treated like a slave.  Bad management, very short breaks. Low pay, very fast paced. Hard hours, heavy lifting, very loud from all the machine. A prison system with higher pay."
bad,"Poor Management"
bad,"They raise your rate so you can't meet it, if you do meet rate they will say you haven't even if your scanner shows you've been above rate, working conditions don't improve and aren't important to the company. They also took away pay raises, stocks, and vcp. $15.00/hr is good but you will never move up."
bad,only if you like a military atmosphere not for me enough already what do you want to know?see what I mean they want you to write all this for what to make themselves look even worse
bad,"Amazon is no for employees who are hard worker. they don't deserve you as a best employee. Rather to go to other company with the same benefits. I pesonally will be losing $5,000.00. This company is for the young ones who want fast money and doesn't care to have quality workmanship. Leaders are not well experienced. Management don't know to motivated the employees or laborers."
bad,No one was on the same page and I have never felt more like “just a number” in my whole life. Having a box thrown into my face and breaking my glasses was the last straw for me. I would not recommend this job
bad,"Make friends with whoever is in charge of bringing you work, otherwise you'll never survive as you won't receive enough work to complete your daily numbers."
bad,If you like being forced to work overtime this is the place for you. It's a grueling soul sucking place - go anywhere but here! They will lecture you that safety matters most until you start working then the only thing that matters is money. I will never purchase another item from Amazon in my life & if you give a $!&@ about working conditions neither should you.
bad,"I was a Tier 3 Senior Yard Driver with the most OTR Driving experience  when I was hired. They hired new drivers that wrecked trailing and gave them senority over me ..just because the work on the floor at a different building.I was not treated fail. Mgr Put me on 3rd shift knowing that I my wife worked those hrs..I resigned from amazon as a Tier 3 ..I have experience on the floor,Logistics shipping and management. It became the worst experience at a job ever"
bad,"Suffering from IBack, Knee and Hand problems are part of the job. "
bad,"Youll be sad :( They treat everybody like a number."
bad,Horrible place to work. Constantly switching managers who know nothing of work hired to do. Always giving out negative feedback during slow times to get rid of veteran workers
bad,Management treated people and technicians as disposable commodities. Was not a happy work environment. I would like the opportunity to show Amazon how to treat technicians but I feel it would fall on deaf ears.
bad,Worked here 2 yrs and only got a 25cent raise!  People make more working the drive-thru at Chick-Fil-A. Only work here if you hate yourself and have no education or job prospects and enjoy being talked down to as if you are a little child.
bad,"I worked in Coppell, TX and had A supervisor that knew absolutely nothing about her job. She would catch an attitude and storm off when she was wrong. The job is also paid fairly if you are A student. No grown person with a family can live off $11 especially when hours are always being cut."
bad,I think that amazon is a horrible company.  I was not given enough hours with gasoline price.  I could not do scanning for food items.  You should have a sister-nun in charge instead.
bad,You are overworked and underpaid.  This place slave drives people.  When you do get a break you don't have ample time to even actually have your full break because you have to walk so far you lose half your break in walking time not to mention you are working all 10 hrs on a concrete floor.  Also it was very hot inside the warehouse. Prepare to sweat and work your butt off and not get your full breaks to rest for a minute.
bad,I had a seasonal position for this job. The workplace was hard to figure out. The higher-ups were very rude and didn't really care about you. I saw them fire people on the spot.
bad,"felt like a slave labor, above average compensation but still not enough for the toll it took on your psyche"
bad,The job talk like they care but they don’t. You will have to to overtime just to make your rent when you ask for a shift change they say they can do it but when you put in for a shift change they say that they can’t do it only if you are in school or medical readon
bad,This job is the worst place to work. If you make a error in amazon terms you will get written up no matter if u just started or it’s your first week. The management act like they care but they really don’t. The only ones who truly care about your work ethic is the ambassadors. The management there is dizzy. This is the worst company an will not be referring no one to this job.
bad,Bad work environment slave labor. bad work hours. I did not like working for this company I will never recommend anyone to work there. painful physically. supervisors are not understanding of personal employee issues.
bad,Worse company I have ever worked for customer always comes first even when they are clearly in the wrong they massively overwork the drivers and don't allow enough time to finish routes according to their guidelines so if route done 100% how they would like they can take over 12 hours you have to be self employed so absolutely no job security they will just get rid of drivers when they feel like it
bad,兎に角現場が暑くて冬でも汗疹が出来る 歩いては行けない  走っては行けない  が基本でした 安くて厳しい仕事でも現場で仲良くなった人達とタバコを吸う🚬時間に馬鹿話をする時間が楽しみで行ってました
bad,i worked with amazon for 2 months and everything about the company was shocking.  the management team did not deal with issues that were raised and everyone was treat like they was in prison instead of work.
bad,I think that amazon Dosent pay their employee much is not fare they should pay more it’s hard to live off of 11 dollars and hour especially if you ha e kid
bad,"This was the worst place that I ever worked at."
bad,"HR dept is worst. They only focus on work rather than focusing on someone’s health. They just need work done person’s health doesn’t matter to them. Stay away from AMAZON, DELTA"
bad,"Needing to keep pace and rate. Rate isn't achievable especially when you aren't getting anything to scan. And if you do, good luck making reasonable rate. All attention needs to me focused on finding the smallest packages and totes to meet rate even though they say we aren't allowed to do that. All this is also in part with ""Hardest part of the job""."
bad,Working for this company was stressful and tiring no matter what you did.to get your rate up meaning every week you have to make 100% or meet their requirements  that was the stressful part. you just have to work there to know.
bad,I was working at Peterborough in England and contracted cellulitis due to shower facilities being not properly maintained. Was then told not no return until the problem was sorted out. Then my employment was terminated even though they knew the reason for my absence. This is clearly a case of Unfair Dismissal!
bad,Do what yo feel. I left due to poor management and hr was no help in the process. I was harassed by a supervisor.  Just find another job if you can. God bless.
bad,absolute appalling company to work for rubbish management communication expect drivers to drive round like idiots and dont like packages being taken back to base
bad,"Do not work at an amazon warehouse. Its the next thing to a sweatshop. they do not care at all about the wellfare of the employees, even less so if you are a temp worker."
bad,No me gustó nada el trato tanto ami como a mis compañeros no recomiendo a nadie trabajar en amazon
bad,Instead of trying people at other jobs they would let you go. They need to see where the people will or can work better. Just because they may not be able to meet your needs at one job doesn't mean they couldn't be better at another
bad,"horrible. dont do it its the worst thing you could ever do, i aint even joking either. stay away, moneys ok but the time youll waste wont be worth it."
bad,"Amazon was not the place for me, it was too cut throat and management only cared about the ""numbers"" being produced rather than an associates health. I would not recommend to anyone."
bad,They work you hard and hand you more work that is possible to achieve. The expectations are unrealistic and there are no support. They embrace a self-learning culture and you are expected to deliver regardless of the circumstances.
bad,The Management needs to be retrained in how to deal with people and stressful situation. None of the management does the job they are suppose to do. They have no positive communication only negative communication.
bad,Pathetic place to work. Extremely watched job. I would never recommend it to anyone. They pay you basic & expect you to work as their robots. Physical demanding work. Noise pollution. Stressful work.
bad,"Unless you don't have responsibilities or any bills to pay, do not work here. There is no room for advancement even though Amazon claims there is, employees are treated unfairly, favoritism, and low pay for extreme amount of work."
bad,"Worst job I've ever had, no respect from supervisors or managers, You are just a number to get things through the door as quicly as possible and they drop you like a stone for no reason when they have fulfilled the xmas period"
bad,The forced overtime could make the best worker buckle under stress. The management would lie about company events blaming workers on production shortfalls and would work overtime outside of required bounds.
bad,not worth working for. alot of time off and no pay culture is favortism and bulling.  Not worth working for.  Revolving door of people to much politics.
bad,theyre treating me like a child. they are watching us like we are their children. manager have a lot hope for us. too fast pace. stress job. my hair is getting grey
bad,"I found it hard to stand in one spot and do the same thing over and over what seems like without any human interaction even know their are many people around. Your breaks are timed exactly 15 minutes; however, it takes about 5 minutes to get anywhere in the building and then the ten minutes is enough to run to the bathroom and maybe eat a cracker on the way back to your working area. If you are two minutes late you can be written up. I found many managers who were disrespectful. I felt I was a number working there. The job was physically exhausting as well. Ten hours of the same movements all day long will wear out your joints. And if you have to get a temporary leave of absence due to hurting yourself on the job it was extremely frustrating and difficult going through the steps and contacting HR to do so.  I will never work their again."
bad,"There was a hiring event and a group of people showed up but Amazon team never arrived . No Email ,No Call . No type of notice to anyone . The hotel said they didn’t even book with them . What a waste of time. The managers had so much attitude over the phone ."
bad,"Management sucks, they treat you like robots,  and if you dont meet your quota. They write you up. All they care about is quantity and how fast you work.  Dont work there"
bad,They cut my hours for no reason along with everyone else there because they were hiring new people and cutting the old ones. I did not like working there.
bad,Worst job ever. Underpaid. Sexist culture. WORST HUMAN RESOURCES of any company I have ever worked for . They abuse their employees. They fire them for things that aren't even their fault and blame the computer
bad,"I think it would be a lot better if they switched to three 8-hour shifts instead of two 10-hours. Also, if they lowered the work pace, raised their pay, and cooled down the building and allowed workers to use the bathroom and sit down."
bad,"very hot, temp service lied to you and told you they were going to hire you on but your interview with amazon never came or they some how miss placed your application"
bad,"they call you if your not working hard enough in the middle of the shift you do not get paid enough, theres no on site training. Worst company ever do not work here"
bad,It paid good and overtime was available other than that it sucked. After I had my baby I wasn't available enough for them to make them happy. Not a family friendly company
bad,I did no like the job because there are no chances of success and as a company it should offer more flexible hours or better pay. They choose by hand who they want to succeed
bad,Company they hire you full time and never tell you its seasonal. They lay you off a week before Christmas. Do it through voicemail. I would never return and the only way i could is full time seasonal.
bad,"In this job you are just treated like a number that is easily replaceable. All management cares about are rates. Safety is not important at all unless someone gets hurt. If you get hurt all you do is go to AMCARE and get a longer break and ice for your injury at best. At the end of the day you gotta hit that rate or you are at risk of getting a write up and with enough write ups eventually fired.  Do you want to advance? Then kiss management's butt and you won't have an issue. Breaks are ""10 minutes"" when in reality you are timed as soon as you leave you station. Water is tap water, so bring your own water. Your job consists of repeatedly doing the same thing over an over again until your next break comes up or you are blessed and can clock out. I would not recommend this job you anyone. There's a reason why there is such a high turnover rate, so avoid it at all costs unless you plan to be treated like trash."
bad,"The work I did was easy. I like the fact that the dress code was casual example: jeans and shirt. The work was part-time, basically four hours per day."
bad,We got told we were all fired 5 days before Christmas after about a month of hard work. Break times usually meant that we spent half of our small break being frisked by security.
bad,"I have been at Amazon for 6months. I've had 6 managers and been transferred to 3 different departments. None of this was by choice; I was told either do this or find a new job. Also, Amazon manages by committee, you do not have just one manager/supervisor, you might have 3-5."
bad,"This is a bad job to work. Not a career or a great job at all. I guess it will work if you are desperate for a job. All my coworkers and myself were not happy. People dont stay. As fast as they hire, thy fire and quit good luck."
bad,"job étudiant entre des études pour gagner de l'argent, pas d'intérêt professionnel"
bad,I would not work for amazon.com again due to the character change of the company and mainstreaming business culture changes.  It is too hard to work there now.
bad,I went through so much with this company and when I leave I’m finding a prosecution lawyer to put a lawsuit for all they have allowed in this facility
bad,"it was incredible awful. Poor management, their 'work life balance"" rule is a lie, petty annoying work drama and favoritism constantly.  Racism they wouldn't do much about even if you told HR. HR ISN'T TO HELP Y O U"
bad,"les managers aiment avoir affaire à des larbins et manquent d'arguments quand on leur tient tête.On nous envoie des rappels a l'ordre c'est à dire des menaces de futurs sanctions disciplinaires par le biais de l'intérim car ils estiment que ce n'est pas juste d'arrêter de scanner des articles 5 minutes avant la pose alors que l'on est des fois à 5 minutes de marche de l'endroit ou l'on dépose les scanners et donc forcément on perd ces 5 minutes sur le temps de pose."
bad,The only way to move up on management was to be friends with other managers. Poor communication during start ups. Only worried about numbers did  not help when associates ran into obstacles. Worst workplace i have ever worked at would not recommended to anybody
bad,"We're do you start? "
bad,"Amazon isn't a good company to work for. If you need money and can't find anything else, maybe consider selling your plasma first. I'd cut off my hand before working at amazon again."
bad,"nothing valuable, to much work to do. they have to pay worker like UPS and other carriers with benefits. as i work for select express logistic. i don't have PTO, no sick days, no vacation paid. they need to change that."
bad,there is nothing to say about Amazon that everyone does not already know. You have to work hard for your full time or you will be let go with relative ease.
bad,"I was a stower, there are forced targets that you have to do in a short space of time, the shifts are long but you only get 30 minutes overall for break. I don't recommend working there."
bad,"Hours sucks and management, breaks are too short. Security lack in assistance and sit around playing games on their phone. The management in charge gossips about employees and refuses to help employees with their needs via safety especially when it comes to anything personal or personal items missing as for example missing badges on floor or missing cellphones.                            "
bad,"Amazon is the premier example of greed and what it takes to get it! There is nothing wrong with a competitive and innovative company in the business climate today, BUT profit at all costs at the expense of human dignity and consideration of those who labor under GREAT stress and health threatening conditions is not only unethical, but EVIL!   I myself gave them all i had and was denied full time employment in favor of those who compromised their principles.  Exposure and time will reveal to customers who these people really are.   God bless!"
bad,"I would never recommend any of my friends or family to work at amazon! This place is a joke, management are all incompetent jerks that get switched out every 5months or less. I have had at least 12+ managers in 3 years."
bad,"If workers are looking for a great place to work, where you can get acknowledged for a job well done, or a chance to advance (with a raise) in a company that has MILLIONS, or be treated with RESPECT for the job you do, then Amazon IS NOT FOR YOU!!!"
bad,I would not work for this company ever again.  It is like working in a slave shop and they do not care about you.  They have 4 levels of concrete stairs you have to climb 6 times a day.  Their bins are overly packed when they tell you to not pack them that way but if they see you try to find a place to put items and can't they get upset with you.  They want the stowers to do 270 items an hour when you first start off.  They put a lot of stress on you.  I don't mind some coaching me on to do good but what they did was crazy.
bad,"took to much energy and time, not worth the pay. amazon goes through so many associates, i wonder why. and the the only time i enjoyed work was the breaks, sort of."
bad,Sucks. You will literally slave yourself for nothing. You have no freedom. Management sucks. You will have no outside life. Hours suck. People around you are no help.
bad,"Amazon seemed like a good place to work at first.  After a few weeks, it was noticed only the ""in people"" were getting special treatment.  Other employees were written up without any knowledge of the transaction. The working conditions are horrible.  Management says you get a 15-minute break, but that includes the 2 1/2 minute walk to the break room and back.  You are only as good as your rate for the day."
bad,"You work 4 hours, but it feels like 8. You can't stop moving, you have to be busy doing something the entire time. The temperature in the warehouse gets hotter than the outside temp due to all the hundreds of cars and vans coming into the building each day. There are no raises or any benefits of any value for the warehouse associates. All jobs except management are part-time, so there is no way anyone could make a living working there."
bad,"Best description in two words : Modern slavery!!!!"
bad,"management à la hauteur des chevilles, les chauffeurs ne jouissent pas de conditions viables pour effectuer leurs tâches quotidiennes convenablement : application lague sans cesse, points de distributions enormes pour 7 heures de travail quotidiens, les heures supplémentaires aux oubliettes, à la recherche de qualité sans y mettre les moyens ... la liste peut s'allonger, j'en découvre tous les jours"
bad,"I do not like working for amazon! the environment is bad, the pay is terrible, the vacation time was taken away.  the bathroom time allotted is very minimal"
bad,"Rythme insoutenable, aucun esprit d'équipe, aucune conscience pro ou humaine."
bad,"Unload truck shipments onto a conveyor belt as quickly as possible, "
bad,Not enough time for breaks... never any down time. Just not a fun place to work at all. managers where always making excuses. I wanted to get off nights but there were no opening.... I know they had something I could have moved into.
bad,"I have worked for Amazon for over a year."
bad,"Gouldsboro, PA Location is a heavy bulky facility. You are required to learn how to drive forklifts witch no description is stated about it when applying. You’ll have to lift and move heavy boxes for 10 plus hours. Longer days when they give mandatory early starts 6am. Regular 7 to 5:30pm. I do not recommend working here, extremely stressful and chaotic, and unorganized. Fast turn over, only old people stay because of the benefits....the young employees are sent to the outbound dock and put inside of a 100 degree trailer during summer alone to load boxes bigger than yourself. Starting pay 12 something, raise every six months but they have a stupid cap on everything at 15 dollars. Paid bi weekly.  Manegment and process assistance don’t care about you and never know what’s going on."
bad,Management sucks. Very low pay and long hours. They pay you every two weeks which I hated the most. They're watching all day with hate. Stay away from this terrible place. You just making them richer with your money and time.
bad,"learned how pick customer orders, packaging and organizing for delivery"
bad,"Very hard work with no reward, this job is the highest form of modern day slavery. Very poor management, who will work until you are broken, then show the door......"
bad,Amazon is a machine that will replace parts when necessary. The pay is unfair and the lunch break is laughable. Management get better treatment I guess. In my overall opinion its a complete waste of time working for them.
bad,"I worked at Amazon for only 1 month as a Tier 1 Employee before being transferred to cover a Non-Inventory Employee. For months I covered that position with no temporary pay increase and during the holiday busy season. I knew I performed it well, was punctual, learned quickly, and got training in all required equipment to do my job properly in a short amount of time. There came a time for interviews for a permanent spot in that position and I was denied without real reason. To cover that position with not even a temporary pay increase or any recognition at all was demoralizing. I just had to leave Amazon."
bad,the hours are horrible for people that take the bus t only gives you 5 minutes to walk from where the bus lives you and where you come into the building its around the block pretty much. the brakes are not long enough to get from one end o the building to another.
bad,"Unfortunately I must write a 150 statement in order to complete a task, so I'll say that with every company I've ever worked for this would be the worst. To start off the management team knew nothing of what was actually going on, on the wear-house floor but would rather walk around and engage in conversations with ""friends"", and other people they knew, then when others would be above the ""quota for the hour only the said friends would be rewarded. Not how management should be taken."
bad,"If you can be perfect despite having issues that are out of your control this is the place for you. They expect 100% for a rate and quality when stuffing items into bins that seldom are the correct size you need. There is rarely enough space in the bins and if you have a single asin(pallet with the same items), just forget about it. Oh, and management is hardly around if you do have problems so pretty much you're on your own."
bad,"Managers are idiots, hr the same, you are treated as a slave. You are just a number. As harder you work as harder job you'll have. Nobody appreciate your hard work. The best and easiest jobs are given only to brown nooses and to the laziest people and  those are promoted to team leaders and managers. No chances for you if you are a hard working person, intelligent, honest, have no mates managers or HR in Amazon."
bad,"You’ll only be happy if you feel like you’re being paid enough. If you feel like you’re being paid enough it’s because they trust you to keep quiet. Worst corporate office life ever, terrible wage, lack of career choices. Nobody cares about you, and you are micromanaged every step of the way."
bad,"Definitely worst place I’ve ever worked. I had several work related injuries and my supervisor basically could not do anything about it. I literally had to work in pain and I ended up with 3 injuries all related to working there. Never even knew who my manager was and the part-time off is horrible. Worst of all if you used all your part-time off it didn’t matter if you were sick or if there was even a death in the family you were still required to work your shifts no matter what and if you didn’t come in you were laid-off, no questions asked. Only full-time employees got the most benefits if you were part-time, no one would even care to know who you are. I was expecting a friendly safe work environment from all the good things I had heard about amazon but I was sadly mistaken. Do not work here its unorganized and definitely not worth wasting your time."
bad,very Bad Place to Work..very poor Managment very Rude People..Horrible Managment no Communication no respect..too many Bosses no Indians....very Short Breaks.
bad,"Amazon is a black hole.  It will swallow your life, hopes, dreams and humanity.  If you exhibit the slightest conservative values, you will be marked and never again promote or receive a decent review.  Hostile to veterans."
bad,"Not everyone is treated fairly. Cutthroat. "
bad,"Amazon is a cut throat environment. You stand for at least 9 hours a day. Every day new people start. More times than I can count, people would start in the morning, go to lunch and never come back. There is no consistency. Ask 5 HR reps the same question and you will get 6 different answers. Yes, I know I put 5 reps and 6 answers.  "
bad,"Pay is bad, they need to get understanding management and work on not pushin"
bad,"its the bad place ever seen at work.they didn't  care of the employees"
bad,The breaks are short and the targets are really high. You are constantly on your feet and it starts to become really painful. When break begins half of the fulfillment centre take it at any given time and you will have to go through security checks before getting to your locker. Not only that there is a massive queue waiting to get through the only 2 gates. The wage is also minimum for the work you do.
bad,"horrible, not fair, treat you just like a number, not enough break times, monitored washroom breaks, wanted much more than was told when interview, timed for everything."
bad,It wasn't an enjoyable place to work as I had to stand for long periods of time and work at a very fast pace with very few breaks.....................
bad,"Was not told I would be self employed until I started so no holiday or sick, lots of waiting around, terrible route wasting time and fuel, easily 12h shift without commute, had to work every weekend, can't chose your shifts."
bad,"It's very unorganized, Hot, and the managers have lack of respect. They don't have pay increases, you work the same pay. they don't offer any benefits."
bad,There are many different positions at amazon and I feel like my last position I was in was bad and the manager was horrible . So maybe other positions would be better.  It’s easy but get tiring and boring making you miserable . I worked in CRR.
bad,"Not employee friendly at all, long hours, not enough pay for the work you do. I was a supervisor and only made 30,000 a year, which is not enough to supervise departments with over 200 people in them."
bad,"The job overall is horrible, the management does not care about you as an individual or a whole. I will never recommended someone to work there, crazy"
bad,Not a good place to work. They only care about their numbers not the employees. They do not care for people with families. All they do is push. Your doing the same thing for 10 hours a day parts of your body start to hurt they will tell you that you had that before you were jired.
bad,"robbing thieves! how many more characters do I need to type in to get to 150 lol. Never again! Hmm, 95 characters more needed to fill this form in this will do it!"
bad,"Working for Amazon is a lot of work for not a lot of money. The people there are nice to work with, very upbeat and keep you going. The management has a lot to be desired. In my experience they only talk to you if they like you, if not you're on your own. You can try to work in a different group but that's hit or miss. And if you're fired no matter what they say they will not hire you back in three months time."
bad,"they make you work very hard without break...Your break is when you leave..managers are very unorganized ..each one on different page."
bad,"Workers are treated poorly. Everyone is just a number, and if you can't exponentially increase your speed while maintaining your quality, you will be talked down to and possibly fired. Time off is a rip-off. You get about 1 week for a year, but to get that one week you have to work there for that year since vacation time is given in hours, 3 hours every 2 weeks for 10 hour work days. Unpaid time off was ""sick days"" and ""emergency days"" and was also very limited. If it reached negative hours, you're immediately fired."
bad,"There's nothing good to say about amazon from the basis of what the ground level employees have to endure. No air conditioning, no local water coolers, no clocks, no music, no anything, and when it gets too hot, better hope they bring out fans otherwise they'll just have paramedics waiting outside rather than install air conditioning units."
bad,"everything about amazon is great expect the poor choice of people management/ human resources are choosing to hire for the company. as well the hiring process, training process people bring personal issues to work etc things like this are a big problem for the company their are a lot of things that goes on in the warehouse that important people such as the ceo etc doesn't know"
bad,"Horrendous."
bad,"Horrible atmosphere there at amazon, they don't treat you right. Everybody pretty much does their own thing and there is no supervision to organize the work space."
bad,"soul destroying, grim place to work"
bad,"Amazon was a company with terrible management that did not care about employee success or advancement. If you had tech problems because you were working remotely they'd write you up, even if it was their technology that was the issue."
bad,"Dort klappt gar nichts. Der Lohn wird nicht oder  viel zu wenig ausgezahlt. Vorgesetze wollen dauernd Kinder Riegel, keine gute Bildung. Den Mitarbeitern wird nachgestellt auf Facebook etc"
bad,didnt work there long enough since seasonal. There were not enough hours to go around to make a decent amount of money. Also I had to relocate it is very face paced though.
bad,hours sucked there were no air conditioners in building when I worked there so it was so hot they had to close down some floors because of heat.  I had to quit because of a car wreck where I can no longer work there anymore ever again.
bad,"Amazon does not allow any associates to work full time, which means no one gets a livable salary and no benefits such as a 401K, PTO, medical benefits... The hourly wage is nice, but because amazon doesnt let anyone work more than 30 hours a week, it doesnt help. You have to apply for a new schedule as well, which can be stressful to wait 2+ weeks for a computer to decide if it is accepted or not. They can let you go home early or make you stay, if they ask you to stay and you leave you get ""points."" Once a certain amount of points are accumulated, you are fired. You can get points for being late as well. The pointing system accounts for all days taken off, any lateness or early clock outs. Doctors notes are only accepted for temporary associates, so basically if you are permanent you cannot get sick and be gone for any longer than 20 hours of work time or you are fired."
bad,The job itself is alright.Problem is management. Theres no reward for loyalty or good behavior or even hard work. They arbitrarily fire people so they dont have to give them full benefits. Work at Amazon at your own risk.
bad,"Only work here if you can't find another job and you really need the money. The pay is very low, the work is hard and the hours are long. There is mandatory overtime constantly."
bad,"Slave pit.Inhumane targets,clowns for managers,physical work.Liars,hypocrites,fake people.Keep away,from the company and whatever this company is related to."
bad,"They tell you it's a set time everyday, but they make one shift do over an hours worth of work than the other shift. While one shift does way more than the other, the pay is the same. The managers are useless. No one knows anything that is going on there. No paid time off whatsoever. The pay isn't worth the work and the people you have to deal with, not to mention the situations you have to deal with. I would definitely steer clear of this job if at all possible."
bad,demanding unreasonable production rates poor management overall hostile working enviroment no regard for older employees alwats hiring and training new employees
bad,"Move boxes from one location to another."
bad,Management is useless. Hours are long and unforgiving. The pay is extremely low for the amount of physical work and stress. I would not recommend anyone working here unless you are desperate for money and like being slaved
bad,"You are basically treated bad, run into the ground, made to do overtime 60 hours. Timed to even go toilet so found myself not drinking water all day to avoid going. Targets set are unrealistic or attainable so job is constantly under threat. If thinking of working for this corporate monster Don't it would be worst mistake you would ever make."
bad,"If your looking for work keep looking. Cause Amazon is not what your looking for. They treat you like a robot and track your every move. People constantly overheat and ambulances are on stand by instead of them just giving you a/c. Advancement is laughable, your competing for the 3 promotions between 500 people. Just do yourself a favor and never under any circumstance work in this helll hole."
bad,"They treat their employees like slaves and micromanage you into the ground. Then if you get injured on the job, they will “investigate” you and whether they find you compensable they will pay you (or not pay you). They don’t help you with your medical payments so that you may receive care and return to work."
bad,you have to drink red bull before your shift and management does not understand the human factors of the jobs and rates set to high for one person.human slaves
bad,This is definitely not a good place to work at. Try not to work there as much as possible. The management is really horrible in being passive aggressive with all employees and they do not know how to lead or manage.
bad,"Impossible goals, constant bullying. No coaching or training. Extremely dysfunctional within HR.  Everyone was unhappy and only stayed because of the RSUs."
bad,Working at amazon was terrible experience due to lack of training and throwing aside any other training from other facilities. Had been trained with P.I.T (Power Industrial Truck) and they dismissed that part of my training
bad,Its not a career. Nothing close. They work you until you cant take it anymore. They operate their employers like theyre pieces of equipment. I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone.
bad,"the rate are completely bogus, management is derogatory to workers and when inefficiencies are found by workers their suggestions are completely disregarded."
bad,Don't care about employees. All they care about are their children numbers. They don't make sure that people are treated fairly and give too many people authority don't need to have authority.
bad,"if you work hard, there is no incentive. everyone around you makes the same amount and you will be so tired after pulling your load plus those around you that you will feel drained and frustrated."
bad,"Everything has just gone down hill. I feel like there just giving reasons to fire someone. And they also denied us a raise, even though every other building got one. Part  time or Full time. if one gets a raise we all get one."
bad,very poorly managed wouldnt rely on them with fixing problems HR is a joke and they suck. They dont resolve problems in a timely manner. good company. but sucks at the same time
bad,i been working for amazon in 2017 but it was great and i like the way the company work i was quit because i was in high school but i want to go back to work with them
bad,Very fast paced and stressful work place.Walked an average of 15 miles per day. The workplace was not very pleasant. The management monitored your every move. The hardest part of the job was moving constantly at a super fast pace and had to often move from one end of the warehouse to the other. Had only 34 seconds to find the item and place it into the tote. If there was a problem with the items in the compartment then that time it took to try and fix it is still counted against you. There wasn't enough time given for training. Only one day and the training process was very crowded and fast paced also.
bad,"What I find so funny is that there are some leads here whose only job is to walk around with their laptops and tell you your scan rate...every single hour. Its just laughable--dude really? That happened on my first day and I was like, do you really need to update me every hour?"
bad,"I would never work here again or tell anyone to work here. The hours are long, breaks are short, no music, loud, cant talk to people. No phones only on break."
bad,I did not like working here. The managers did not help out at all. The job requirements kept changing and that was not laid out in the beginning. Things should change.
bad,It's 100% or NOTHING. I was written up once for being 99% to quota due to a slow forklift driver. They would wait for you at your department to make sure you are not even 1 second late returning from break
bad,They work the employs way too hard  there hourly rates are to high for picking and packing. you get a written warning if you are under rate. they do not give long enough breaks. If you run out of time to take off and your even 5 minutes late you will get fired.
bad,This is the absolute worst job Ive ever had.   You work on inhumane situations with no air and virtually no fans...in Texas.  They expect you to sort 260 packages per hour while @management does nothing.  There are way too many managers in the warehouse and they need to learn leadership and communication skills!  Terrible place
bad,"Don't do it!. they have no remorse for human life, and for your well being, this is the Pinnacle of communism in a company, where if you don't meet your percentage, then you need to start wearing diapers because you'll just have to stop going to the restroom just to make rate."
bad,"The facility i work in was very straining and management team very rude. does not give you enough time to learn job task . As you adapt to the work culture it becomes relax cause the employees are very helpful even though they are not suppose to help you . enjoyable part was working with my cousin, and being able to get discounts when shopping online. hardest is lift heavy pound boxes with no help."
bad,"All the mangers are aggressive "
bad,Didn’t listen to people’s needs even when told during interview. Couldn’t work the hours they changed my shift pattern to so was forced to leave and they didn’t understand why
bad,"Stressful days "
bad,You never will have enough 20 hours per week. No means to talk to an immediate supervisor if you have work-related question. You won't  have any phone number to talk to management. If you are lucky then your supervisor will return back a phone call for you in a few days after leaving a message for them.You have to compete against everyone to get 20 hours per week. No salary raises whatsoever.
bad,I would never recommend this job to anybody. If You Can Count 600 items per hour then you can do this job and that's why I'll going up and down the stairs sitting standing stooping bending stretching grabbing pushing pulling same repetitive motion for 10 hours a night
bad,"Politically correct company . Theeeey are not open to new ideas. Poor training, but expect adherence to the same. Lack of respect and younger manager maintain a perversion of authority."
bad,Management does not like you and will not help you in job advancement if you do not kiss their buts. The cap out in paid does not happen for three years and it is not enough for the amount of work that I as an individual gave the company. The stock benefits are more trouble than they are worth and do not help with monthly bills/basic needs. The job culture is that of a high school and their is way too much drama and who slept with who at this warehouse than anything else. Also this is a place where everyone cheats on their girl/boy friend and/or husband/wife. Human resource is a huge disappointment and is willing to fire you even if you did not do anything wrong.
bad,they are not family friendly and when their computers don't work they take pay away even if the server issues where their fault. Any issues with internet they write you up.
bad,Manager micro manage and push workers to meet the numbers. They lack true leadership and have no care for the employee. The hours are too long and condition are a nightmare
bad,"Amazon may be great to order from but working for them is another story."
bad,Managers never had our backs...short notice given when you had to work over. Had some good people working there...poorly organized.. Seems more like Amazon was working for the delivery companies rather the roles in reverse. The drivers threw their bags and stuff every where while the Amazon associates were expected  to clean up after them.
bad,scanners were unreliable kept going dead or batteries needed replacing. managers and supervisors didn't help they would scold you. too many hours or work for very little pay.
bad,very thirsty not enough break time the break rooms are so far away and the restroom buy the time you use the restroom breaks are over with the hardest part of the job was when they took most of the workers away to a different department so now you got 1 person doing everything and its very hard and frustrated because everything is depend on 1 person
bad,"I are just a robot there easy replaced and treated that way"
bad,"They hire anyone, so you don't know what type of co workers your going to get.  They treat people badly and tell you often that your replaceable or expendable.  Ya know, feel the love kinda stuff."
bad,"I have been working at Amazon LAS 6 warehouse since it opened in July 2017. I hate it. The managers are not accountable to anyone or anything. The culture here is awful. I have never worked someplace with so many disgruntled employees. People lose their jobs every day due to things that are out of their control or poor management. I don't feel like I have any job security. I started in a group of 40, only 6 of us are left."
bad,"Do not come to this job at all, they treat you like a robot / number. you can be off from scanning the average unit per hour by 1 and they will write you up for these type of nonsense"
bad,"Hated every min of it, they always harass you about rate, if you are on ranpak by yourself good luck,  75 packages a hour yeah right, especially when the people in the back can't keep up, more like 10 minute breaks cuz of all the walking, only work here if you are desperate"
bad,I worked in a large metro area and it was constantly turning over workers. All the good people leave in a few weeks because the managers work them hard. I was always put in the toughest areas while other people got half the aisles and little to no work. Some people always got the easy areas. Managers were rude and always talked behind peoples back about their work ethic.
bad,"0 sobre 0, teniamos contrato de 38h. y cuando habia fiestas nacionales, no trabajabamos y nos quitaban la parte proporcional del sueldo."
bad,"This company did not promote fairness, in my opinion.  They want their employees to be robots but we're human.  There is no transparency in how your are judged; which is a practice they call rating.  It's common to make employees feel inadequate which makes it simpler for them to layoff associates right before they qualify to exercise their stock options."
bad,I had a really bad experience. I was worked to Amazon in Enfield and the company in the interwiu talking nice for everything but the real is different. First thing When u do the training and they sad is paid. NON PAID!!! And after you work for 4 weeks and they sad sorry but We will pay you after 6weeks.... and fire you..... nice company...
bad,"I'd rather not say. This was a temporary job for me,but they do need to learn how to treat their employees. The managers need to act professionals and know that that they are managers."
bad,"a typical work day u come in, go to stand up and wait for directions on whats going on that day and your station. i learned how to keep a pace to stay up with the 350 items an hour minimum. hardest part of the job isnt the job, its the isolation. You cant' take a 5 minute break after standing for 3 hours straight because that will count as time off task and can put ya job on the line. Nothing enjoyable about this job."
bad,"Stressful, managers do not listen to workers concerns. The hours and were terrible i would go home wasting my life sleeping all day and working so hard at night to make a poor amount of money. These managers are lazy and throw everything to the other employees"
bad,"Amazon give u no life,its a very hard job u always have make rate or you will be written up.they don't even care if you pass out. You always in sore and in pain cause the work is so demanding"
bad,Managers are inconsistent they don’t pay you enough for the stress and labor mangers are rude feel as if their running a prison they have a labor tracker if your off one minute that’s it you’re getting a write up
bad,they had a games table and a huge break room but it just was not always a friendly environment you were constantly stressed looking over your shoulder for management to see what they were coming to get you for this time depending on what shift you worked day shift was amazing but twi shift was and is terrible they try and get you for crazy off the wall things that didnt even happen or they try to pin stuff against you that never even happened
bad,"Terrible place to work. I wouldn't even recommend my slave if I had on. Workers are treated like robots. No interpersonal relationship. For billion dollar company workers are treated like slaves , having to stand for protractive number of times and very short breaks."
bad,"Worst job. Nearly 5 years later still battling it out with lawyers. Was over worked and under paid. Witnessed many employees suffer heat stroke in the warehouse in PHOENIX I was working in. When I was injured on the job Amazon fought me every step of the way, and their lawyers will always be better than mine."
bad,"Bad company to work for, you are basically a slave if you work in their main warehouse. Most of the ""higher ups"" don't have a clue on what's supposed to be done."
bad,"This palce is fine as an in between job or something temporary for extra money, but the warehouse will suck the life out of you. Almost no opportunity for advancement, and mandatory overtime can be called at any time"
bad,Worst job ever. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone its temporary and they use you to get their products out to customers and breaks to short...I hated it I'll never go back rather work at McDonald's
bad,I did not like this company because there was not too much of an advancement in my career. I was working on a bachelor's degree and wanted to move up the chain but was not allowed to.
bad,"Worse company to work for ever. Unreal work hours 10-12, basically you take it or leave it. Unreal target hitting, even when you go above and beyond your targets you still get no praise, it's basically like ""well done, can you keep going at that pace everyday"""
bad,"This position is basically support for the rollout of the new Amazon Fresh program at Whole Food Stores. I am thinking that overall, Amazon is a great company to work for but they have a ways to go to develop this position. The job listing was sort of vague, they made it seem that you would be working in an Amazon Warehouse when in reality you are only a Shopper at their Whole Food stores filling customer grocery orders."
bad,worst experience of my life. I cried every day and I was abused discriminated again and the men are all perverts. horrible place and made me hate the company.
bad,"I was not happy with working at Amazon.com as the pay was low, the work was stressful, the expectations were too high, the trust factor was nonexistent..."
bad,They treat people as disposable pieces of garbage. Unhealthy environment that encourages people to treat each other poorly and routinely fire people who have life issues that occure
bad,awful hours nobody wants to work for 10 hours straight a simple 5 day 8 hours a day would be perfect but they are want to drive you crazy by standing there all day with nothing to do
bad,Treat employee like trash...nobody seems to have answer to employees questions. No second chance at your job if you on the chopping block for not making rate. Your are forced to come in whenever they decide.
bad,they work you like slaves or worse.they never are happy with your performance. breaks are short especially when you have to walk so fare to break rooms.
bad,"The worst job I have ever had in my life. All posts are occupied. There is a lot of preference. The teamleaders if managers would not have to be in those positions. I recommend you not go to work at that site. You are timed when you go to the bathroom, when you return, to the seconds."
bad,"I didn't like working for amazon, every day was stressful and an argument over the job. A lot of people didn't know what they was doing, just pretend working sometimes. Management was awful and thought they knew everything and the situations but didn't know nothing. low pay, low hours, not treating people fairly when it came to time off or pay, no raises, no vacation time, sending people home for no reason, not fair at all...place was just a big mistake to work for, decided to find a better place to work,"
bad,"company refused to write report on work injury, then denied workmans comp due to no report of injury, but refused to allow back to work without workmans comp md release to work without restrictions"
bad,"If I could describe this place in two words "" Sweat Shop """
bad,If you have other options DO NOT WORK for them!!!I spent 10 months there giving my best because I was promised a BLUE BADGE.They gave me fixed term blue badge and at the end of the term when they had not enough job for everybody they gave permenent contracts only to people with relations!!They used us to do more than we were supposed to do and lied us giving us a blue badge just to make sure they will have who to work hard until they need!!It is not just me in this situation it is about 100 people!!And the people from the agencies who lost their job are so many more!DO NOT work there!You are just a number for them.After peak you will have no job!
bad,"overworked and underpaid. management definitely had their favorite associates, whom they let do whatever they wanted. Billionaire owner pays his underlings pennies."
bad,I feel Amazon Is a good stepping Stone Place to work but as far as career wise its not a great place to have a career at. The Pay Isn't good at all and i feel they don't treat the workers good.
bad,make rate or get written up from your first day. no loyalty to associates. most p.a's are in their early to mid 20s. no advancement for people over 40 unless you are a veteran. managers swear at you and down grade you every day.
bad,Worst experience ever.  Stress management culture.  Terrible shifts.  No work life balance.  Middling pay compared to similar jobs at other companies.  Garbage benefits.  STAY AWAY!!!  There's a special place down below awaiting the owner...
bad,"join this place. The management times your breaks, and then they tell you have to package 180 items an hour with barely air condition in that warehouse. If you like fast pace job that works you like a work out join this job place."
bad,"it was terrible the management was bad, worked you like a slave no breaks, very low paying job. I hate amazon and everything it stands for they claim to care about people truth is they don't give a Fu** about anything but making money"
bad,Management is so disconnected and they treat lower level employees very badly. Overworked and underpaid with management that would never appreciate you no matter how hard you work.
bad,"To say that I was unhappy at Amazon would be a deep understatement to how poorly the whole place is conducted and how they treat everyone. Although the pay is decent what they have you do on a day to day basis, in my opinion, does not cut it. It is an intensely physical job that will have you sweating as soon as you walking the door due to there being very very poor ventilation. If you are given a job that you can not perform they will not allow you to move to a different task, even if you beg them multiple times. Instead they would rather hand out write ups like its Halloween. They are not understanding of personal circumstances what so ever because no matter what you are just another number on their screen."
bad,Worst management ever and you get paid the least compare to other warehouses. Rather go to Walmart warehouse and get paid more than to come here. Somebody dropped my motorcycle in the parking lot and had to find out by myself and the company didn't even assisted to find the person.
bad,"this company is more about greed than there employees. they tell you they will work with your schedule , when you go to H R it all told not so story. they all want to supply them there need and not your."
bad,"no good at they take the job to serious and have no people skills they don't give hours like you would want to, some employees are okay but annoying an everyone there is from military so they still have that mentality over the top"
bad,They barely teach you anything from the very start and they stack every mistake against you. If you're unable to meet their quota they will berate you and eventually fire you.
bad,"they literally take m-o-n-t-h-s to even consider you. first time i ever went in, they messed up my drug test so i had to go in a 2nd time to redo it, by the time that got accepted, my background check information wasn't valid anymore so i had to go redo that, once i did that, i had to redo orientation because the whole retaking drug test and background check took a while, so then i go into orientation and they make me take yet another drug and background check, and then for god knows whatever reason, they withdrew my application. ??? i went in again about a month later, did the whole process yet again. everything finally went through and i scheduled my start date. before you can even start your first day, you have to complete a KNET training video. guess what? they never, ever sent it to me even after i inquired about it multiple times. i kept getting told to 'wait' and i had to reschedule my start date TWO WEEKS away from when i was supposed to start. okay, maybe THIS time they will send me the e-mail with the training video. 1 week passes.. more days pass.. 2 days until my start date, no e-mail. i ask the help desk about it and they tell me again to 'wait'. my first day starts, still no video, and they withdraw my application. i've been trying to apply at amazon since OCTOBER of 2017 and it's March 2018, they can't do squat right apparently. If you have nothing better to do than to have amazon run you around all over the freakin place then by all means, try to apply. hopefully you guys have/had better luck than me."
bad,"I worked hard during my shifts doing whatever I was asked without complaint. even with the loss of my house, and the car breaking down I missed 3 days only. The manager pulled up my old records from way back in october of any late days and yelled in my face about tardiness even though I didn't miss that many days and worked my butt off I was there to make up for the few lost day. I don't recommend working here."
bad,"Managers and/or Leaders only want their productivity numbers. They do not relate to your issues or barriers. They have their favorites to pull out of the productivity hours. When there is an opening for a position, their favorite is hired miraculously even though they do not have prior experience or tenure."
bad,very productive and busy work environment . constantly changing depending on orders and seasons such as holidays and peak seasons that is amazons annual sales.
bad,Great pay but thats if they pay you properly and for the schedule good luck. They do have allot of hours to give out but that's only because the turn over rate for employees is incredibly high. People quit daily and new people are the norm there. The only people who have stayed there from my experience longer than a couple months were the management team. I left due to unresolved pay issues. Your lucky if they fix anything within a couple weeks regardless of the matter. I even talked to HR and was assure things would be rectified and things only got worse from there. So highly not recommended to work at amazon.
bad,Management thinks they are top notch but unfortunately they are not at all knowledgeable. They recruit people for a particular role and assign a completely different work which is very very unfair.
bad,"Lavoro martoriante, monotono, insensato."
bad,The job is good but the management there is not so great they go by favoritism and never on top of there problems. You have to keep reminding them about things
bad,"The company does not utilize people to work in places that could better the company. It was just a typical warehouse position, There is really not much else to say except, I would not recommend anyone except young people that need a part time job. They expect way to much work for to little pay."
bad,"This was not a good place for me. Very loud, independent work, not allowed to speak to co workers outside of break or lunch (even if it was about work), expected to work as fast with large heavy items as small very light products. Although there were good managers at Amazon Fulfillment Center, mine was not. Very rude and expected too much."
bad,"it is HORRIBLE place to work, Management is bad, HR is worse. Horrible pay, you work extreme hours,  They lie about the school tuition repayment program, but if you desperately"
bad,"Amazon is a horrible place to work. They push and push their employees to the limit. If you can't hit your numbers, your chances for promotion or a transfer to a different department are impossible. If you are not in the right click, then you will never be successful."
bad,"Amazon Stellenangebot ist nicht frei."
bad,People lie to get what they want and do not do the job they are hired for.  Managers will write up a Tier III but not a Tier I for some of the most stupid reasons
bad,All a big family business.If you're not part of the 'family' you're left out.People that have no ideea of how to perform the job or do it very badly all the time get permanent contract and those that perform at high standards are left out or have to do the job of the others.They are forwarding the people by a method like picking a name out of a hat or by who is related to who and not by attendance and performance.I would not recomend it to anyone.
bad,"As a college student, there was always discrimination against people of my age, and being a female college student, there was harassment. I was terrified to go into work everyday because I never knew what comments the older men would make towards me. I would not recommend to a fellow young woman."
bad,"Managers had zero respect and talked to us like we were scum on the street, and expected you to kiss their butt. People who have been there for years were treated like sshit, especially older people. They would favorite certain people and let them do whatever they wanted and not say anything but quick to fire someone who worked their butt off. I can honestly say I have never experienced anything like this and I hope Karma bites Amazon right in the butt"
bad,I would only recommend working here if you have no other alternatives.  There is no such thing as down time.  Management is constantly looking to find something for you to do every second of the shift.  Use it as a bridge and not a crutch.
bad,Don't give you longer lunch time and want you to work your  butt off but know they dont care about their employees. You do not want to work for a company that all they do is suck the living out of your life
bad,If you want a resume booster then by all means work there. But be prepared for long days and and constant pressure. There is a facade of being a family and there being an open door policy but that couldn't be further from the truth. There is a 6 degree of separation between management levels. No focus on Personal/professional development even though that's one of the leadership principles. Everyone has a Type A personality. It is a dog eat dog environment with peers sizing you up and conspiring against you every step of the way. Everyone has their own personal agenda and is completely out for themselves even those who should be guiding you.
bad,"I would never recommend anyone to work at Amazon!! They treat their Customers with some Respect but treat their workers very poorly!! I should know, I worked for them!!!!"
bad,"was seasonally employed hoping to be hired on full time. poor communication and mismanagement. "
bad,I cannot comment for I had a very negative experience with Amazon. I do not recommend working there at all. There is a lot of favoritism for younger workers.
bad,I was falsly accused of something and terminated after being here for 2 years now I have no job and have a family to take care of and cannot due to not being able to find a job
bad,"Work/life balance was not good."
bad,Bad management need better training supervisors and managers need to take classes on how to train and talk to workers also they need to learn how to respect the workera
bad,"Amazon.com is good if you need a job, as you can typically get hired on very quickly and start almost immediately after going in for an interview. However, the work hours are ridiculously long and the weeks can be very stressful. The system is also unreasonably strict, as you're told time and time again that you are expected to begin work DURING YOUR BREAKS or the system will count it as you slacking off. Hourly rates are reasonable only during the training period, but quickly become absurd. This job will also take a heavy toll on your feet if you happen to be a picker."
bad,"Arrive at work, do morning stretches , look at assignment on the board. Work max 5 hours a day. Scanning packages and placing them on pallets. Enjoyed working with some people. This company really CAN CARE LESS ABOUT YOU AND YOUR FEELINGS. Their attitude is, be thankful you have a job. They really treat people like slaves. Seriously!"
bad,The worst job I've ever been to. They treat people like slaves and leave them without hours. You can see that the movie about the Amazon did not lie. Never in my life again.
bad,"Working in the Amazon warehouse was like stepping into a ten hour nightmare."
bad,It’s really bad no pay raise or anything. They don’t acknowledge good hard working people and they fire a lot of people for no reason. They need better supervisors and HR because they don’t know what to do at all.
bad,"Terrible people and working conditions, They would not give us more than 4 hours a night and the drive to Kent was too far for the pay we received. A miserable experience"
bad,I worked there 6 years and it's up and down. Far to many managers changing depts. Pulled up for being seconds late back canteen food shocking. Targets are a joke. And in pack they don't let you talk to anyone.
bad,Terrible place to work. made me feel out of place because I'm ENGLISH. Management have no idea. treat you like a prisoner.Very glad to be out of that environment.
bad,too many packages to deliver in a short time. You don't finish on time you're EXPECTED to work overtime WITHOUT pay as a slave driver. Conflict orders
bad,"Very stressfull and unforgiving not the king of place i would honestly recommend to anybody else unless you really needed  some form of work. But understand they care nothing for you,"
bad,"I would never recommend this as a place of employment.  They overwork you, and people are always written up or put on finals.  Management is mostly hired straight from college, so do not understand the toll physically or mentally on the associates."
bad,"They aspect you to delivery parcel till late, the payment isn't great. The positive side is that you get experience in different jobs.Should be better"
bad,Management sucks. They are the most under qualified mangers I've ever seen. The pay is nothing you can live off. Averaging only about 150 a week at the most. The only good thing about the job is the other employees you get to meet. I wouldn't recommend this place to no one. Management nit picks and harasses you all shift.
bad,They are a fast paced employer who doesn’t care about there employees. I had a family emergency and they told me that I had to stay there and work while my child was in the picu.
bad,The managers stand around and do nothing and laugh while the workers work really hard and only a select few are congratulated for that hard work while all the other people are forgotten. Its extremely hard for women like myself to get noticed with my work and there was no career advancement. 
bad,I wouldn't recommen working for amazon theyy really only care about numbers and don't take the time to really hel you out after they train you if you are going to slow by their standads they write you up and if it keeps happening you get fired
bad,it was hard work people smelled bad hours sucked and under paid they don't keep you longer than a month or two so no stability it is not somewhere id like to work
bad,Job is stressful no enjoyment at all. All they worry about is the deadline nothing else. Except you to work break aren't even 15minute. Work for 10 for four days
bad,"not the best place to work, not aloud to talk while working forced to stand for long periods, can turn up to work and not know your have been let go, also can be fired mid shift with no warning."
bad,"Management is unfair, do not know procedures for packing, materials needed to perform job are not  at packing station"
bad,Not a great place to work. You'll do more work than you are paid for. Communication needs work. Over all not a good place to work. Can be a very hostile place if you voice opinions or concerns. They basically just want you to follow blindly.
bad,I was excited to first come to work for Amazon but the lack of leadership from management trickles down to bad morale for the workers. We don't have the tools we need to do our job properly and highly skilled workers are leaving daily. They entice you with stocks and bonuses but read the fine print. Nothing like HAVING to show up to work at a place you don't want to be at because you have to fulfill your contract.
bad,"The pace at Amazon was fast and I got lots of exercise and time flew by quickly.  I liked that about the job a lot.  But management was very poor. The overall atmosphere was  chaotic, and few folks took pride in or enjoyed their work.  The hardest part of the job was putting up with little supervision and almost no training."
bad,"In my opinion it was boarder line ""slave-labor"". Even though you did what you were paid to be doing. They always wanted to do much more. And not pay you for it. THAT is the reason why their turn-over rate is so high."
bad,This place is not good  I will not recommend anyone to work there and  the pay was pretty low for part time the managers are horrible so unprofessional they are not doing thier jobs right  !!!
bad,wet disappointed too many manager and too many team leader they always chatting and spent time with chatting frinds . then they posh staff to work hard like slave . hard job and not worth it with some monk manager or  team leaders .  there is no role and management every thing bad  and missed up and no one care . some manager and team leader they missing for hour and they going and they doing what they like .  no one care very disappointed
bad,Amazon was terrible with payroll. They never gave me my check on time and on top of that they always shorted my checks................................
bad,"Awfull workplace, short breakes , very big targets , does dot care about experience workers , i won't reccomend forward to anyone to work for Amazon ."
bad,no respect for the employee and you feel some racism and also you cannot move up into the company especially with the way they treat people which is very bad
bad,"This is a very micro management place and a fast pace environment. where people are not treated as people,but as robots and I do not recommend anyone that I know to work there."
bad,They simply don't care about employees. For independent contractors there is no monitoring of anything. Some contractors use bots to get blocks which makes it unfair to get work for people that do it how it is suppose to be done.
bad,"The worst place I've ever worked. They mistreat, abuse, and do not want to pay a decent salary. It's a slave driver mentality. The managers lack experience and know how to properly do they're job"
bad,Absolutely joke of a company to work for!!! Everyone is suspicious and treats you like a criminal if one bad apple dose something bad wee all must be doing the same and that’s the words out the horses mouth!
bad,"They don’t pay their employees enough, even when getting certified in forklift or other areas. Then you hit a period when there isn’t enough work to do so they find meaningless tasks and either have you do something that’s not your job or they send you home. Some managers and other employees such as HR do not have enough experience or knowledge for their positions"
bad,This was an easy job but I didn't like that it was only temporary. I was a picker and puller. There was no customer interaction and that is something that I enjoy.
bad,"this company does not care about its people. Amazon has problems with the following areas: HR, Worker's Compensation, Am-Care (First Aid station),  Management at all levels, Leave of Absence. Management does not listen to employee concerns at all and will laugh in your face.  Management has placed my life and the life of my wife in fatal danger."
bad,Hard work low wages and high targets. No Job security. Information included on job spec is not accurate and you will find that Staff bus is still to be paid for and promised perm postions and a fiction.
bad,I was termed after a very busy and cold holiday. They stated I had late orders but my weekly summary stated other wise. Great worker even when you have only 20 mintues to make it across down to your block. Need cell phone charger and I had to buy a pass for tolls as they don’t tell you that is paid out of your pocket.The gps they give you to follow takes you the longest ways.Bought flashlight due to at night you can’t see house numbers and some of the places are scary. Good luck with this company cuz it won’t last long. Staff at station not helpful and I would get bags that we’re ripped or bar code messed up.
bad,A good place to learn. Cut throat competition. Innovation is good. You will learn a lot when your working here. The interviews are tough but it is worth it for the learning
bad,"BUF 5 is laughable at best, when I was hired they told us we would be getting  full time hours but instead we get 4 hour shifts, management communicates very poorly with workers & you are lucky to get 20 hours a week. I work at 4 hour shifts 5 days a week and 99% of the time they send us home at the 3-hour mark, The only positive thing about this company is the dental insurance, a lot of favoritism & there is no room for advancement, for the job itself it is complete slave work, if you like working 10-15 hours a week then this is the job for you."
bad,"Human resources,managers, and leads more training is needed from the front desk to the dock. A lot of running around to get an answer about anything. Detail is important to oncoming and current employees, Amazon does not have that. Detail in their hiring process."
bad,Horrible place to work.  Stand for 10-12 hrs. Feet hurt back hurts. Not nice management. Terrible staff. I would not recommend this job to anyone. I was not happy there
bad,Treated like slave ! And fire you for errors ! Races bosses working there from hr to manager all races ! If your English is poor treats like sh.......
bad,"My experience at amazon was really bad I just didn't enjoy it at all. The lack of communication was terrible in the work space, managers seemed like they didn't care about there associates at all, felt like I was slaving for them hurting my body for only 13 an hour when we should've got paid a lot more than just 13 an hour."
bad,"terrible sweat shop job.  Lack of adequate supervision and long hours.  Would not recommend.  Also hard to get to, no public transportation available.  Work load is unproductive and inconsistent.  Be prepared to work 12 plus hours in extreme temperatures.  Most enjoyable part of job was the end of the day!"
bad,"Don't work for Amazon. They pay you $13.85/hr, YES, BUT you'll be working 4 twelve-hour days with only 3 days off, which is not enough to recover from the work week. The management is super terrible and doesn't care if you have leave, they will hammer on you to always be at work. The managers are total a**holes. The pay is amazing, but this company will work you like a dog. The job is so unforgiving & the managers are a**holes."
bad,you're expected to slave from 60-72 hours of the week and then told that you have no choice but to do the hours or be fired. they expect you to walk at a really fast paced even though you're burnt out
bad,"Demoralizing, cut-throat, unorganized, very hot in summer and had ridiculous rates required. Rules changed every day. Favorites were very obvious and supervisors very rude."
bad,All management at amazon is rude and does not care about employees. They could careless if you get hurt. They dont accept doctors notes and dont care if you had sick hours or vacation time saved.
bad,its a poor job i do not recomannd anyone to work there they work you like a hebrew slave they expect you to do things they like and give you a 15 min break
bad,hateee it its a terrible place to work your feet will hurt you will get tired and the breaks seem very short and the days are sooooo long so be ready for ha terrible job
bad,"If you are a robot you will have no problem.  The management are terrible.   Every second you are under pressure."
bad,"Not care for customer service, the payment benefits are very bad and now the have take away the tips drivers receive from customers. the app you must instll in your phone work really bad and the telephone support people seam the never know what to do. you are on your own when delivery if any problem Amazon only will blame you for late deliveries and never give you oportunities to explain the circunstances. Pease avoid to work for this slaving company."
bad,slave work you are sttressed out attend to there needs to an rate on the computer to get customers packages merchandise ect they force you to work harder each day . holiday season you work 60 hours a week and it doesnt feel like you get one day off because night shift  work on there day off till 5 am
bad,Abzocke vom feinsten für Saisonarbeiter und widerliches Arbeitsklima
bad,"Overworked"
bad,"Employee standards were not met. Every day lying about when the shift will end. Employee discrimination between the different nationality, and faulty equipment"
bad,"Bad work environment "
bad,"Do not recommend this job for women , its very hard work on your body and its pretty much a man handling job . if you like to work hard I'd say go for it"
bad,"I worked at Amazon from April 2015 to January 2016. It was fast paced, and quite frankly, a danger to the human body. I messed up my lower back, left shoulder, and both my knees just doing the easy work. I took care of my body and stretched as often as possible, but it was not enough. Don't ever work at Amazon."
bad,Can't wait to leave this place. I need to be challenged. It's ran very poorly with little to no respect for the Drivers. This place is as unprofessional as can be with no regards to Safety.
bad,"The environment as an overnight sortation associate is stressful and fast-paced as soon as you clock in. Management preaches safety but when it comes down to it, they want fast workers who don't complain. Management is adverse to rotating assignments so your body gets worn down doing the same repetitive motions for 6+ hours at a time. Management also plays favorites when it comes to promotions."
bad,"Favoritism, long hours, Compulsory overtime, targets cant be met, unable to progress, short breaks, strict rules on arriving to your station on time from short breaks, limited communication between workers and agency, rules not explained properly, old paperwork given to employees, if you make a mistake by the time some feedback is received to rectify it you're already out of a job. Avoid at all costs."
bad,"physically and mentally demandinag, fast paced, when you have finished your delivring your load in a timely manner you are forced to rescue/help other drivers deliver their packages. Vehicals are not safe. no breaks poor managemnt"
bad,Overrall Amazon can either make you or break you. If you're not an avid learner and are easily sidetracked then you definitely would want to reconsider working for this company. There are too many rules and restrictions and you get a coaching for everything.
bad,The job almost everyday can be very stressful and they make us overwork ourselves... I have NOTHING good to say about Amazon whatsoever and I regret ever working here.
bad,"NEVER AGAIN,"
bad,"Easily replaceable employee feeling.  Don't work to keep employees long term, they just want you to work for a couple months then try to find anyway they can to release them."
bad,"Management are useless under age and no people management, or people skills... Laughable that the managers can’t even HIT the expected targets however expect the F.C. to be able to do does!! A lot of double standards and extreme amounts of brown nosing ...."
bad,Stressful and they work you too hard. They will spring overtime on you at the last minute the only thing that is good about working for amazon is that they do have excellent benefits.
bad,"Physical work. The management people are higher level, most of them look down on workers.  Amazon is so mean to share the growing benefits with these labor workers. Most of them only paid $10__ $13 hourly without any extra penny. No health insurance for most of us. No extra penny for night shift. Everything is NO."
bad,YOU WILL be on your feet 12+ hrs. 
bad,The worst job i have ever worked in my life.. i hated working there and i will never work for that company again. I injured myself and was mistreated.
bad,"It was alright at first..but then it starts getting competitive.and the manager had no experience at all,all he would do is get mad and expect us to go even faster"
bad,"I worked at amazon for four years. During that time all they cared about was how much they could ship out. They never (and still don't) cared about quality. If they treated the associates as well as they treat customers, it MIGHT be a good place to work. AMAZON SUCKS!"
bad,"I did not like working for this company at all. It was very long hours, break wasn’t enough . Uncomfortable working conditions. Feet hurt every single day after work."
bad,I would not recommend to  working at Amazon in Massachusetts unless if you want to be reprimanded by the Human Resource center and also be called a threat as to them. If you are a criminal then there is a slot of chance that you can grow
bad,Actually they don't care about employee and jus want to run their business because they have some partnership that can not control all things and in some occasions out of control.
bad,"lack of consistency between departments. managers each have different policy enforcement's. semi fast paced and very low pay. lack of training. new policies not conveyed by new managers, lots of team swapping."
bad,Hurry up and find a new job before they fire you cause once you max out they trying to get rid of you just to cut the budget . 2 to 3 years max and watch  what happens  either you  move up or move out..
bad,"You give it your best day in and day out and management complains about it. On average you walk 20 miles a day minimum. Management will find anything to nit pick about. You will get very bored doing the same thing over and over again, and you can not listed to music because you wont be able to hear the fire alarm (that vibrates the floor and blows your eardrums out). You also are not aloud to talk to your coworkers when your bored."
bad,amaazon was a seasonal job but due to the heavy weight impact i would not recommend amazon to a fellow friends or citizens  you are over worked and not appreciate
bad,"the first couple months were ok but once they started on their hiring spree on people that were suck ups and hadn't been there but a week or less got the ""ambassador"" position. To which was basically you just stand around chit chat with your clique and not do a thing . many people were injured and the management was aware of this n told the people who were injured to keep working and work faster. This was the only company I have ever worked for that had the biggest turnover because not even management knew their you know from their head. None of the management at the Kent Plant had any experience in the higher up positions ...."
bad,make no mistake this is a modern day plantation. they dont care for you but what results you can give them. accidents happened frequent because they employ high schoolers and in groups. there isnt any culture we were just slaves to master..
bad,"worse place to work ever, you come into the place thinking its amazing and  you will love it to the fullest but you will soon learn that its all a joke and they will purposefully try to fire you for their own mistakes"
bad,no i do not have much words to say about amazon and working in the warehouse building. A typical work day there was stressful and hard labor work with no breaks and no pay. This is my personal opinion only.
bad,"Working in Amazon has been the worst experience of my life so far. Unrealistic targets, enormous pressure, ignoring health and safety of the employees are the everyday things at Amazon. Avoid at all cost."
bad,"This was my worst job so far. The one time I met my supervisor (which was after 2 months) was the day I quit my job, she was treating me like a piece of machinery when I was tired and trying to go to break. She was telling me to hustle in a very rude way and telling us we were slacking after working a 12 hour shift. Horrible management and work environment."
bad,"terrible place to work, my family member passed away and i was sacked due to this. its a joke. I had 4 days off due to sorting out the funeral etc and it wasnt good enough and i got sacked due to my family member passing away. so please be aware that PMP are terrible to work for. i wouldnt waste my time."
bad,Would not recommend anyone to apply to the Amazon in Richmond California do not have good management and they're not equal opportunist they're racist and do not treat their employees Fair
bad,A lot of racism and cut throat individuals. Too many hoops in order to get a promotion. You can have a master degree and never be promoted and be highly qualified for the position. Bad environment.
bad,"Terrible work culture and environment. "
bad,"Mi experiencias en Amazon(Getafe)a sido muy dificil.Primero entrevista con mampower,que te cuentan lo que quieren y luego es mentira todo.Te preguntan que turno preferente te interesa y despues te ponen en un mes en 3 turnos diferentes,imposible de adaptarte con el trabajo de tu marido y tus hijos,pero a ellos y a Amazon no le importa tu vida privada,quieren disponibilidad para cuando ellos quieran y si dices que no vas a la calle.Una pena haber dejado otro trabajo que tenia para que al mes no te renueven el contrato por que no eres un arrastrado.Suerteh"
bad,I really wouldn't know I really never had a chance to work at amazon.com I was given a start date and when I went there they told me that I wasn't in there system and for me to call the agency that sent me there to work
bad,"It's an awful place to work. You are treated as nothing but a tool. Whether you are a manager, associate or part of the leadership. Everyone wants to achieve a target, there is a clash of goals and ambition."
bad,I️ wouldn’t recommend anyone working at amazon fulfillment. I️t was stressful and hard and a face paced environment with little to breaks or room for advancement b
bad,Would of liked to be able to change to different shifts if you weren't able to do that particular shift .....to fast paced on rates they were wanting every shift
bad,"hard fast work place, no easy promotions, not enough training, bad expectations. the management is unfair and do not treat us fairly or give us ridiculous expectations that most people can not meet."
bad,"Working at amazon.com is very physically demanding on employees seems fine at the start until you reach peak season then you will work 60 hours a week no exceptions, if you have any physical limitations i do not recommend to anyone."
bad,"Dispicable discriminating workplace, underpaid and overworked ( the reason why they require you to be self employed if you are a parcel delivery driver ). Constantly treated like a slave... just a number, a nameless replaceable character. No satisfaction, no rewards, constantly receiveing new rules to follow and more and more ammount of work. you are worked until exhaustion or until you quit which always happens. you don't get to promote because nobody can cope with working for amazon long enough"
bad,"Avoid they hold your payment, working hours are long no organisation  you have to work 2 weeks in hand and they expect you to use your own money for fuel before you see any of it back. If you don't finish the route before a certain time you failed and wont get paid / if you get sweep you lose half your day wages!"
bad,Failure rewarded while strong ethic is abused. I would never recommend anyone to work for nor buy anything from this company. Such a backward and regressive place to work.
bad,"treated and feel like a robot. "
bad,"Empresa que de cara a fuera con muy buena imagen te venden lo que quieren. Pero una vez dentro al poco tiempo te das cuenta que lo visten todo muy bonito. Su política de empresa se basa solo en la producción, pocos descansos y siempre corriendo, turnos rotativos que abecés no se respetan horas compensativas que cuando acabas contrato no te pagan, y las ETTS pagan mal, casi siempre se equivocan  o no pagan las horas extras cuando toca."
bad,"The climate control is terrible! In the winter you have to wear a coat and you can see your breath! In the summer, working midnights, it would get up to 120 degrees in the building. This was based off of thermometers in the building. You get a 15 minute break but that break starts the minute you stop scanning and it would take 7 minutes to get through security and into the break room. So you really had no break. The managers were cold and unfeeling and would come yell at you if your scanner stopped scanning for any period of time."
bad,"Deliver customer’s order in a timely manner with the upmost care for packages"
bad,During my employment with Amazon I was sick and put into the hospital due to lack of cleanliness in the facility. Once I ended up with pneumonia and the staff had zero empathy because my doctor wanted me to be out of work and they would not adhere to his recommendations.
bad,"The pay is garbage,  there is no prospect of advancement or better pay.  I have a masters degree and was offered a fulfillment position at 12.50/hr  very insulting and obviously set out to take advantage of desperate workforce instead of offering competitive wages."
bad,"Left a decent job for this.  Should not have.  Dissuades talking to other stations, quality over quantity, but measured on both.  Good job for 18-23 year olds who have not seen much work life yet.  Pay sucks for what they expect.  Very dissapointed."
bad,"After applying to a specific location and having the New Hire Orientation; that specific location two weeks following said it no longer hiring in that location but another still has ours available.  "
bad,I really loved it at first. I wanted to stay for years but after a while if you dont kiss a** they want you gone. Its stressful and theres so many new rules all the time.
bad,"While working there it was fun when there was team work but once the co workers started slacking off due to following the managers role, everything went crashing down. Every at least 2 people quitted. I'm not sure why to be exact, but I also left the 2nd month. You deal with boxes everyday. Help flex drivers sort boxes. Scan boxes and put bags away. Kinda like labor work. Not a career just temporary in my opinion. Hope this helped. Good luck."
bad,dont get sick or they will just fire you. wont let you take a day off. wont give you flexible hours to pick your kids up from school. will NEVER work for amazon again.
bad,its a very hard day lifting heavy boxes a lot of steady work the most enjoyable part of the day going home body sore management they a great get along with all of them.
bad,"Pleas don't work at amazon , its not a great place to work for ..... They will work you to the bones ,I have to give a star to make a comment  and if I could I would not ."
bad,This was an interesting job. Ive never had one like it. Its definently a learning experience for me. I think that this job proved that I am trustworthy considering the fact that I was surrounded by thousands of dollars worth of items.
bad,"they dont care about your well being and they will have you working like a slave, and im not rey work like that, that job is slavery at its best, i dslike it"
bad,stressful there isn't any organization at the work place. the managers really don't care about the employees. the employees are overworked and underpaid hands down.
bad,I don't like amazon. I want to work somewhere else. They screwed so many people over by letting them go. Because its a temporary job for some. The only way to get full time is to do a conversion or quit and wait 90 days..
bad,"i applied for a $17.00 reduced time, but my paystub has $14.50 as my pay rate. its a fast pace job. i only work 3 days a week but my hand are over used by the time i get out that i need all my days off to recover from the soreness, a lot of people that work there have said the same thing. im a packer. and we don't have clean up time, all our time is for packing, 230 units an hour.. no sitting on tables. if your production is bad they have a ""big"" group of HR that someone will come and talk to you about your performance, you have to walk really fast from your station to the time clock because if your 4 minutes late to going to your break it will eat up you unpaid time, which could possibly lead to termination. you have to stand there all day and they only have one long thin layer of mat for all the packers. this is a horrible place to work."
bad,"Wow, where do I start! I think I'll start with the ugly and work my way to the bad and then the good.(Don't expect a lot of good!!!) .The expectations are for a warehouse associate to receive, open, inspect, scan, re-pkg 350 items per hour or more! Employee moral is very low. At break times you can hear the talk around you of why they are going to get written up and or lose their jobs. One employee told me he just got hired as a regular employee. He got ill, was absent for 2 days, turned in a doctors note but most likely will still lose his job. I mean really he had a contagious disease that I don't want nor do I want to bring it home to my family. Turn over rate is truly exceeding high. 90 days ago they hired 60 new warehouse associate. There are only 2 left. Because you are not allowed to make errors, if your computer has no activate for more than 5 minutes you face a write up or termination. Don't spend more than 5 minutes if you have to use the restroom on non break time!!!  If you can not keep up at the 350 rate per hour after 2 weeks you face termination. Its very passive/aggressive there. The trainers will tell you they are giving you the skills needed to succeed but will also tell you not to make errors or you face write up and terminations. If the trainer tells you to let product go and they told you incorrectly its not them on the line it is YOU! You could get written up and or fired. Work culture is terrible."
bad,"Bad management, horrible hours, lots of mandatory overtimes which puts you at 55+ hours per week during the mandatory overtimes, lots of physical heavy manual work, building has constant renovations going on, you're on your feet for 11 hours with two 15 minutes break and a 30 minutes lunch break. just not worth $12.25 an hour even though they advertise $15/hour."
bad,"The worst company to work for. They treat you like slaves, it's always hot in there. the pay sucks  compared to the amount of work they have you doing."
bad,I worked as a packer and picker and a gift wrapper at Amazon. I absolutely loved my job the people were friendly and kind and always helpful and helped you if you needed to be helped.
bad,Very poor place to work...poor management....full with undesirable co-workers....poor work place environment....communication skills for all people there not at all desirable.
bad,"A kid with a degree worked next to me complaining all the time about keeping pace which he couldn't do, a month later he was promoted to first aid.Amazon thinks a degree equals talent, they are so wrong."
bad,"very unfair, dont care about staff pay was less classed as self employed but then forced to pay for a in house accounts some days nearly 12 hours on the road, easier routes were given to those who the managers liked and harder routes to those who were new, the most enjoyable part is the scenery or route to the drops and the pleasant look on the customers faces when delivering their parcels."
bad,"Amazon is a nice place to shop but it is seriously lacking in management and environment. There are tons of wonderful workers that have to labor their lives away for pennies on the dollar compared to other warehouses ""fulfillment"" centers near by. Amazon is lacking in almost everyway and has no loyalty. The management staff and production assistants who are pretend supervisors are given positions based on favoritism and not experience. There is a blockade placed almost immediately upon new hires where one cannot advance in their own department."
bad,"Amazon have a speedy process from receiving application to responding with a job offer. However, staff are treated like robots without any benefits nor job security whilst on low wages."
bad,"Low expectations of employees, no motivation, lack of interaction between management and employees, low pay, high hours, no paid vacation, no sick time."
bad,"this place was awful , and poorly ran they tired to make if fun with there corny shift meeting and warm ups before you went to the floor. people would get into fights on the line about packages backing up because somebody was working to slow"
bad,"Złe traktoanie ludzi, brak pomocy, nieprzestrzeganie BHP, liczy się tylko norma, człowieka traktują jak tanią siłę roboczą."
bad,it was a horrible time working there they would not send my support in on time it wasnt amazon it was the CDS the company i worked for i also asked to switch my schedule and they would not help me
bad,"this Amazon FC is full of racism and favouritism, British people are taking over the highest jobs, and the Romanians are taking over the other jobs, permanent jobs are being given only to the British or Romanians and the rest get kicked of without reason."
bad,"Amazon was a horrible place to work. The pay is poor, the employees are bottom of the barrel. Management is clueless. The whole place is run backwards. Thank God I don't work there anymore"
bad,"The job training in that bulding is poor.The blind leading the blind all bad...The managent team sit around and look in dont help,The new bees are on there own to find there own way around the places.The fake ambrasser just walk around in dont trainer the new bees at all they expect u to know stuff "
bad,This place is the worse place to work. They treat you poorly and don't listen to anything you have to say. They are not a team company and only care about their rates.
bad,Had an injury that i am still struggling and dealing with. Amazon did not help when I was injured or many others working in their wear house. Sad to see such work slavery in a company that seems like such a good company. They over work their employees and give them little respect. horrible place to work
bad,"Management is awful and employees do whatever they want. No one follows the rules, a lot of people stands around not doing anything. People don't know how to talk respectfully."
bad,I worked here temporarily and it was terrible. We were forced to pretty much run from one side of the place to the other to get our timed picks. This place was the size of 3 football fields and 3 stories! If you didn't make your picks you were let go.
bad,"Amazon is the worst place I've worked. There are few chances for advancement, the hours and intensity of the work make it too difficult for most people to do for more than a few weeks."
bad,"i worked there for the contract security company Securitossers, what a disgusting rabble, scruffy dirty looking security supervisors, no training, zilch"
bad,"horrible pay and management, the people were nice at least but other than that i wouldn't recommend working here. Nice little paycheck for college students but if you're looking for advancement and better opportunities, i would advise looking for a better job."
bad,"honestly a awful place to work, maybe it was just at my building but this job is garbage. everyday we get pushed to do more and more with less resources than the day before."
bad,"Very hard non stop work for low pay with very poor management. If you are interested in having a bunch of young kids telling you what to do while each supervisor contradicts each other, this may be a good place for you. They will send you home early when they are not busy and REQUIRE you to stay if they are busy. This is not acceptable for parents or people who have full time jobs."
bad,Work hard  to do well and they want more and more with no appreciation.  Management changes like the wind.  They are hiring mostly all military associates now to get the most out of their payroll tax incentives.
bad,"this warehouse or company doesnt care on your hard working,they terminate you without them caring how hard you worked and helped them to get the gift packages sent to the right person,they arent very smart when terminating"
bad,"The managers only cared about productivity even though I did my best to keep my ""rate"" up.  I tried as hard as I could working in the warehouse and picking various items from various areas and putting them in the totes.  The hardest thing was finding all the items to put in the tote.  It was difficult because there were people in the aisles in the way.  I most enjoyed working with the people there."
bad,I didn't like working for this company at all. the staffing was very unorganized and chaotic. they didn't take take anyone thoughts into consideration.
bad,you ran all day. day after day. all supervisors where kids that never had a job.it was bad. nobody likes working there. not even people that been working there
bad,"The absolute worst place to work. Ready to work with absolutely horrendous working conditions? Ready to never, ever have a life again? (Mandatory overtime)."
bad,I hate it I'm so glad to get away they are only there to work u like a dog hahaha with there brown noses dnt have to do nth every day will never go back ever ever again
bad,terrible place to work way to much mandatory overtime poor management to many write ups for stuff out of anyone's control company does not look out for the well being of the employees
bad,"The worst place to work for in the world. The low level management have no clue and you will take a hit for everything."
bad,I dont think this place is fair value to employees. The staff run is very unprofessional. The weighr of the demand for satisfactory needs is out of reason.
bad,"It was a very fast paced job. Not the best working environment, the management was very unprofessional, and the breaks are very short. Everything was unorganized"
bad,"Good Temp Job, go in do your job and get out. work is usually 10 to 12 hours. Managers are okay, depending on where you work you can have a good or bad day same with coworkers everyone here hates working."
bad,"Worked there for almost 5 years and it is the worst place that I have ever worked. Managment, from the site leader down to the CSM's were terrible. They pile more and more on you but do not up the compensation. Stock options are there but they are given out based on the price at the time and do not vest for 2 years. Supposed to be ""customercentric"" but management forgets about its most important customer, the employee."
bad,"Lack of advancement, lack of pay for experience and work output, lack of respect, lack of support, lack of ownership from partners and upper management."
bad,"They didn't treat the employees well. Although I was supposed to work in one dept, the other manager would come over and tell me I had to do work for them first. They would send you home early and then have mandatory Thursdays"
bad,Worst Company I ever worked for in my entire life! Its modern slavery. Management is all about favoritism. They time everything you do. If you use the restroom to long you can get a write-up. Breaks are to short. Facility is Huge and half of your break goes to traveling to the break-room
bad,"I had so many problems with amazon, it was a living nightmare. None of the managers were willing to help after I reached out for help because I was struggling. Workers are rude, managers, everyone there is extremely negative."
bad,"Horrible place to work. They run you for the entire shift and yell at you as a group, to work harder. Any goal achieved must then be passed. Holiday time is the worst to work there. NO parking so you will constantly be late. They will park you down, across the road and 'bus' you to the job. Don't miss the bus !! Walking on concrete ALL day will destroy your knees and feet. But they DO NOT CARE. They are only worried about the customer and profit. I worked the holiday and was told I would be picked up full time for working every day and not being late. SO, I showed up and worked hard every day. Never missed a day and never late. Come January they gathered groups of workers together and said ' you are done, you don't fit our profile of a good employee ???' And those that stood around and talked the whole time still had a job."
bad,It's not worth the pay you are over worked and under paid. Little breaks and management doesn't care. Your standing all day and they only give you basically a 10 min break.
bad,"Fun but time consuming, high demand very  little pay. Need a lot of equipment which can be pricey and easy to damage during time of work. Self-employed so I always managed my own time daily."
bad,Employer will fire you for any reason. They will terminate you for things that have nothing to do with work. They work you to the point you have no life outside of amazon.
bad,"Worst company exp. and there is no security of job here.Management is so poor here and the owners are also not so good."
bad,i don't like how they deal with their employees. in the beginning it was good but now not so much and it didn't look like there is much room for growth
bad,"From the very 1st email sent to me by Amazon,nothing promised was delivered. No details were given about available jobs,no choices allowed between different departments. One of the most profitable companies on the planet and the equipment used to do the job was bargain basement. Equipment CONSTANTLY broke down,computers regularly crashed. Constant jams,substandard supplies used from day 1. And everytime a problem occurred,the associates were blamed. If you have no choices left,I would recommend applying because it is at least a paycheck. No interviews. One need only to physically show up and pass background check and drug screening to be hired."
bad,They are far to strict with everyone and it's hard to understand the foreign team leaders. Do not get long enough for the breaks aswell by the time you get up its time to go back down
bad,"I worked from home as a Customer Service Representative(Fluent in Japanese/English). The company would never try to solve the problems that occurred. Instead, Amazon would make us do all of the dirty work and put the blame on our shoulders. They only cared about performance rates and numbers. It was very discouraging. "
bad,management is so awful and they dont take care about their emolyees they treat them so wrong and long hours. they do not believe in team work at all they do not help u or train u correctly
bad,Terrible to work for as the staff were more interest than getting targets rather than treating their workforce with dignity. Panorama made a programme a few years back about Amazon and the way they treat there employees so I advise you watch it. Unless you are absolutely desperate for mone STAY WELL CLEAR!!
bad,Worst management ever feels like high school drama all over again. Everyone is willing to step on people to get easier positions. They track your every movement feels like you're in prison. Not to mention the constantl harassment you have to deal with everyday.
bad,"I worked for TLT transportation, through Amazon. I did not receive any benefits and I would not recommend this company. They over work their employees and treat them like a number."
bad,"If you're looking for a very boring, long hours, standing constantly, zero percent chance of promotion, terrible job.. then go work at Amazon. If you get a seasonal position there's a 99% chance you'll get let go the day after Christmas."
bad,They make you work hard and the pay is very good. You work for around 3 months and then they lay you off right before you get your health benefits. It's frustrating.
bad,"Working for such a large company you'd think that you'd be allowed to grow as an employee. Once you get past the fact that you are only a number when it comes to working for Amazon, you then realize that they're only worried about getting their products out no matter the cost. People are hurt all the time on this job trying to appease the numbers that they scan so they can keep their job. Anyway good luck growing in this company."
bad,"I remember I was so excited when I was hired by Amazon.com - so proud to be able to say I worked for the iconic online leader. Boy, I was wrong. This company lacks in business ethics to the point of anyone having an ethical mind at all, will, at some point, leave."
bad,I regret joining Amazon - culture sucks. Employees are treated as animals who can be slaughtered at the will of managers. This place is like Game of Thrones - you are forced to play even if you do not want.
bad,Everyone is just a slave no one cares about health and safety  its always been just targets to do more and more. Canteen's food is the lowest quality ive seen in years
bad,Neskutečný dril a značně vyčerpávající bezútěšná práce.
bad,The pay for a PA/ Shift Supervisor is 14.50 an hour. When associate had a negative feed back on a PA/ Shift Supervisor it reflected on all the PA/ Shift Supervisor. The GM would only come out to the floor and yell at the PA/ Shift Supervisors and never acknowledge them on the positive they have done for the department.
bad,"I've worked at the amazon in Avenel, NJ and goes to say that the hr department is terrible. Being that I was terminated on a medical leave due to their incompetence and lack of communication. They don't really care for you and you're just another individual riding on Amazon's conveyor belt. Sad to say that I could publish a whole book of this I disliked about Amazon."
bad,Amazon integrity has no sense of humanity for its employees. They give you probably but have blackout dates that you can't use it. Also they are only concerned about the bottom dollar not the employee's well being.
bad,"i have wasted lots of time with interviews, assessment day then finally signed a contract, no one ever got back to me to know when i would have started.called, went there, nothing at all. none was able to tell me what happened"
bad,"Wake up go to work. "
bad,Only 4 hours per shift and only allowed to work 6 shifts per week. Good for side money job. Hot environment. Only a 10 minute shift. High volumes all the time and unrealistic time off
bad,It is a ok job but it is a job not for me.Although if you are a young male or female it would be a ideal place for them. I can say there lunch room was amazing.
bad,in this job you always had to be on your toes when it came to lunch break was only half hour which after security checks and lines to get out was ridiculous
bad,Nothing! Worthless company don't appreciate good workers when they have them. They make you have to make rate and if you don't they will fire you right away no if ands or buts!
bad,"need help with job portal"
bad,Very productive work place nice coworkers but not longer breaks. You meet new people everyday. Mangers are nice and helpful. The hardest about working at Amazon is the walking all day and the long hours.
bad,"This job is too repetitive, long hours and boring. Management is horrible and they don't know what they are doing half the time. They require you to work 3-4 11 hour shifts depending on the rotation."
bad,"Management only saw an individual as a number and had no concern to treat any employee with respect unless it was a member of HR. Breaks were very short, but had a ""market""."
bad,Each experience is different for each person.  Give them a try if you are desperate.  They write you up for rate when you are sick.  They always make it clear to you that you are replaceable.
bad,"This is the first job I've ever walked out of. They hardly provide training and then throw you to the wolves. I was thrown into a position that I was not trained for and proceeded to get screamed at by the area manager. Breaks are a joke, 15 minutes, but it takes you 5 minutes to walk to the designated break area, and if you're late from coming back, even thirty seconds, be prepared to get a nice lecture about it. You're not a name here, just a number, all they care about is quota and hitting numbers. I walked out of this job after a week and a half and never looked back."
bad,Needs better Management and HR. Horrible people very rude and disrespectful. Everything at Amazon is bad and it makes people feel uncomfortable. I wish things would change and quickly.
bad,"Amazon is not a good place to work if you value your dignity, time or self worth. you are under paid and asked to do way more then what is in the job description. HR is incompetent and a mess and you never get to know managers because they are gone within a few months and replaced. and good luck moving up they only seem to hire people outside the company for hire roles. If you work at amazon only do so for a short while because its not worth investing time in this company."
bad,It Was A Terrible Staffing Agency To Work for. They Didn't Really come Around to interact with the employees like Amazon does !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!
bad,"I like to work there, everyone is doing his job, but sometimes we cover one to each other."
bad,They ask you what shift you'd like to work during the application them have a small piece of paper inside the office telling you only certain shifts are available. Would've been nice to know that before wasting my time and gas. Absolute waste of time
bad,amazon was the absolute worst job ive ever had. they have rediculous production rates that are nearly impossible to meet. you get short breaks and spend half of it just walking to the break room to sit down. short lunches. managers dont know the job they are reprimanding you for.
bad,"I am a current employee, this is the worst job that i have ever worked in my whole life.  They hire you to work 10 hour shifts but constantly give you mandatory overtime.  they work  you like a slave.  the only thing that is good about this place  is the benefts."
bad,"I have been working here for 8 months and at first it seemed like a great opportunity since you could work from home. That all changed when I had system issues, my VPN would drop and reconnect randomly and when their IT department looked into it and said it was my ISP. I talked to them and they said nothing was wrong with my internet, I fought this for about 6 months with no resolution until they sent their own devices for us to work on. Great it worked but now I go to school and they claim to be flexible but will put you on the schedule even though you have school because of Prime day or whatever and I expect you to work into the next day. They have done this to me now and I am not happy at all since school is important especially since this school is a training school and they don't technically have schedules. I had to give them a schedule that my school was not too happy about to appease them. This job is not flexible and the pay is horrible $10/hr is not enough for what the employees that work from home have to work with."
bad,"Management there is lacking proffesionalism. Policies change everyday to fit some employees needs and not others, employees are not told of changes. Lack of tools to perform jobs. Unprofessional working enviorment."
bad,Fast-paced and little time for breaks and hydration. One must always be aware of quota times and quantities. Not impossible work but hard work. Shoes should be required from employer.
bad,The company does not put any focus on motivating the employees.  They are only concerned with the bottom line and production numbers.  The machines break down daily.  The managers would rather blame the people running the machines and issue write ups instead of focusing on machines OEE as being the root cause production inefficiencies.
bad,"Working here basically made me feel like I'm doing slave labor. I have had to go home on a couple of occasions due to the pain of repetitive motions for at least 10 hours a day. When I told them the pain is more than your typical work soreness, they did not take me seriously. And straight out of the gate they throw you into mandatory overtime. And if you're not meeting goal for your numbers, you're as good as terminated. And they make it pretty clear that's all they care about. Not your health or wellbeing or pain you might be in from being expected to move at inhuman rates."
bad,"Where to begin? Amazon's mission to be the most ""customer-centric"" company in the world may be a success in the works, but only at the cost of their employees' physical, mental and emotional well-being. You are nothing but an expendable number there, no matter what your role is. And regardless of exceptional performance. One week you get a huge pat on the back. The next week its like it never happened. The environment is toxic in the most corporate of ways. The communication breakdown within the hierarchy is abysmal. And try staying on for 3+ years, and expect to be weeded out as you are then to expensive for them to employ, while ""new-starts"" can be brought in by the dozens. If you must, go in on a temp assignment through Integrity Staffing, but only during holiday peak as that's the only time the money is actually worth it. Upon completion of your temp assignment, hit the door and don't look back."
bad,One way street.   Its only what is in it for the company.  PT--basically no benefits.  Very high turnover rate.  Sorting Center conditions--brutal.  Physical injuries common.
bad,"managers sit on there butts all day and yell at you when you don't make rate. terrible company to work for. "
bad,"I did not enjoy working at Amazon. Although it was a temporary place holder job, it was definitely not a good fit. Overworked and underpaid. I do not recommend to anyone."
bad,managers had a horrible tone when working. they would walk away as your in midsentense talking to them. they picked favorites and played around more than work. If you weren't a favorite your work day was horrible.
bad,"I hated the job, that is nothing that I would like to do again. you have to be there at 5. you park so far away. sometime your badge does not go throw. you are on a time management. people hurt themselves all the time at that job. it is a super super fast job."
bad,First off i helped launch the second amazon in California. The way it works there is some if you kiss up to your manager or hes your friend then you can move up. If you're  a hard worker and hit 500% rate youre stuck in that position.
bad,I have to down stack and stack product and when Im done I also have to receive my items. I also work on the double walkie where I take pallets to the robo stow area an I work on a turret truck where I pick old orders an drop them to stow new orders in the racks.
bad,Didn't like it every thing is quick pace and if your done they will have more for you I don't know about the wharehouse part but as a driver it didn't work for me.You can't mess up the mess ups are called conssessions to many conssessions can cause you your job becareful
bad,"Overall poor experience, very little in ways of team ethic or personal development. A place where you need to be ""one of the lads"" to achieve. compulsory OT which gets cancelled at any point, normal hours can also be cancelled resulting in loss of money but this was rare."
bad,Low level team leaders are promoted from within which is good but at the same time give way to favouritism and kissing up by low level staff and to  the higher level managment. Not a lot of people survive the probation period. The pay is good but you suffer for it with long shifts and being watch every minute for scores. Would not recommend.
bad,"Amiguismo, mucho mamoneo, peloteo.... los mandos tienen plena libertad para elegir a dedazo, así q las chicas atractivas tienen allí todo un filón, pues son las únicas q se quedan indefinidas. La lista de chicas cotorras, perezosas y sin actitud, con más fallos de ubicación y calidad q nadie en plantilla, q han sido renovadas por delante de compañeros competentes y trabajadores, es de película de comedia. Pagan bien, todo ahí q decirlo, tanto como de empresa como cuando estas de ETT, pero ya os digo q como no estés buenorra te van a pedir una productividad imposible de alcanzar. De compañerismo nada, la gente se pisotea, y es q es la única manera si quieres quedarte allí. Por otro lado, tienes a los de seguridad, auténticos perros de presa q te tratan como si fueras un delincuente, más q un trabajador. Mucha vergüenza, en general."
bad,"Good hours if you're full time, other than that I can't say much positive. Way too many people getting hired for tasks that don't need 5,000+ Employees"
bad,"On a typical day at work, it feels like a daycare and an insane state asylum.  I have learned not to trust superiors, especially with those with hidden agendas like those of upper management.  I have never had to watch my back so much or have had such little respect for management as is with this place.  The culture is dismal and depressing, yet the company tries to fan out the thick fog of misery with handing out silly prizes that, in the end, the associate ends up paying for in taxes or having ridiculous contests that are self defeating and only serve the the higher ups.  The hardest part of the job is forcing myself to clock in every morning, knowing that my work will go on underpaid, my sweat and blood will be unappreciated, I skills will be undermined, I will be played with like a mouse in a ridiculous psychological experiment to rev up production, and in the end, I will not have enough energy to even spend ample time with my family and children, before I have slip into a brief coma and have to wake up and do it all over again. "
bad,Pas une bonne ambiance dommage et mes personne ne son pas soliable
bad,"Everyone's experience with this employer is different. Some love it and stay for 20+ years, some leave after their first week. Like any other job, you get out of it what you put into it."
bad,This job is only for you if you do not intend to do what you love for a living or pursue a better life for yourself. It is gruesome and a very sad work environment especially with the difficult promotion system.
bad,"They had the worst work truck ever. They had no mirrors on they, some of the truck needed brake fluids, engine light was on, some vehicle needed transmission fluids, and the brake was squeaking."
bad,"Poor management and time-consuming. You work for endless hours and if you perform well, it does not matter. Favoritism is the biggest problem within this company. Most managers are fresh out of college and they do not hold any true experience when it comes to managing large amounts of people. The employees must be treated like adults and with respect. Amazon has so much potential but it fails to perform up to the expectations. So many safety issues within the company. The safety department is not knowledgable at what they do and they constantly break many laws."
bad,Horrible place to work with no job security. You are constantly put under pressure to meet unrealistic targets. The management is poor. I couldn't believe how poor such a big organisation like Amazon could be. Google Amazon warehouse and you will see numerous articles saying what I am saying.
bad,"This is the worst company I have ever worked for... You are not treated like a human being, its all about unrealistc speed and micromanagement. Plus they go off of a point system, once you reach 6 points your gone, even for emergencies you get a point if you have to leave early. I know it happened to me to pick my child up from school and no one notified me. I got a point for going to get my child. This company is not for people with children. You must be single, with no children inorder to work here."
bad,Very boring job. Management is not the best. They talk about safety but want you to do your job at an unreasonable pace. They can call overtime whenever they want which can ruin your schedule at any time.
bad,"long hours 12+  and bad pay, they didn't have working AC, the pay isn't worth the overtime and back breaking work. The company doesn't care about the employees and it's beyond overcrowded. I wouldn't recommend working there."
bad,Amazon core values are not practiced in Las Vegas.  Senior leadership does not communicate well and they are too lenient with employees but cruel to leaders
bad,"At Amazon there is no growth been working here for seven years I haven't move up yet, all they do is hire all these kids from college that don't know not a anythingthing about the job. There is a lot off them manager follower they work you like a Django over here. leave this job I'm too tired to apply for a different job but this year I'm taking all the time off to get out of here . please God help me get out of here I cry a little every time I clock in. breaks/lunch are short ex: break is at 3pm its 15 min they want you leaving at 3:02 mind you it takes about 9 min to get to the break room so when you get there sit down its time to go back too your station so just think about how lunch is. Try moving from one building to another, even try out of state they are all the same . this job like a hungry game. Please I beg God to beg you not too work here"
bad,They don't care for u as a person. Horrible management . Rude staff . HR works at their own time. Facilities are rude . Just don't work there. The pay is good tho
bad,I did not enjoy working here simply because it was not for me. It is hard labor and the work environment is not friendly. It is fast work pace and not a very friendly place to work.
bad,amazon is like modern day slavery out of 100 people hired same time i was the 3 rd person left terrible place very high turn over. i would not want a monkey to work there much less a human
bad,"This place is very unorganized, and they only care about getting the packages out! They don't care about the people that actually work hard and doing the job they don't supply us with any protective gear such as rain coats gloves hats and scarfs we have to pay for everything and they expect us to do other peoples' work when you're done with yours and they only want to pay us $25 extra this company is horrible to work for we have to work like slaves!!!!"
bad,Lots of turnover means training new associates all of the time.  Bad management is the number one factor.  Not a good company for advancement.  If you like being a number and not an individual Amazon is for you.
bad,"For being the most customer obsessed company they have to be one of the worst employee appreciative company I've ever heard of.  They pick and pick, they micro manage... and will not accept any medical notes.  You can be on your death bed and if you have too many attendance infractions in one quarter (too many could be one over) and you are toast .  They will fire you for no reason at all.  They do not care how much customers like you, how hard you work .. they just do not care about their employees period.... "
bad,they treat you as if you are disposable. I hated the fact that the problem solvers created problems in reality. they were also very rude when it came down to checks and hours.
bad,you had to attend a meeting every morning and afternoon the management were OK but it was through a agency you had to work and if you had to go to the toilet you had to make sure that you were back in three minutes
bad,"I did not like it at all there when I first started back in October 2016.  They do not communicate, are not organized, managers are more confused than the new employees."
bad,Poor working conditions and not enough break for employees considering very hard work. Employees are underpaid and treated as they do not matter. If Amazon cared 10% for their employees like they care for their customers business company's high employee turnover would drastically decrease.
bad,This place is he77 to work at one of the worst place I worked in my life your treated like a animal nothing worst then that in my book  its unfair no hrs to work
bad,"Auto Sorter (Temporary position)"
bad,This job is literally like slave work that is why they are always hiring without interviews. You have to hit a rate every week that is impossible unless you run from pick to pick. Trust me all money is not good money. They also make you use 5 minutes of your 15 minutes to use for walking.
bad,"the company creates a very casual working environment with bean bags and all kinds of amenities to make the employees extra comfortable. In turn it demands from the employees to stay upto 14-18hrs a day working on different projects. now the biggest issue is that 80% of man hours are wasted in gaining access to data which is most of the times either incorrect or duplicated across reports as per MIS/data analytics. Management is almost entirely ISB pass-outs with no/little experience in the corporate world hence are incapable of handling real time operational issues like retention and employee satisfaction. salary package is way below the market standards & perks are very basic compared to other companies in the market. overall, i would surely not recommend anyone to join this company unless the person wants to sacrifice all other aspects of life."
bad,They show you how to work at the amazon and how the hours and position of your job works and then. You get a tour of the place and once your done with everything then you go do your job.
bad,It was great at first then it went down hill constantly moving back and fourth in the building always wrote people up threw them on a final and got let go by phone worst place ever always dirty mad me sick people were nice to you one day and rude the next
bad,"This is a very bad work place they treat you like you are a robot,"
bad,Management doesn't seem to care about their employees or their well being. It's a;; about the rates and nothing else matters. Management talks to their employees like they are robots and expect you to perform like one.
bad,"Work is hard, they expect you to be fast and never slow down or get tired the entire 10-hour shift. I have a disability and they still expected me to perform like a robot. If you can I would say avoid this job. It may be great for certain people, but I cannot stand the mind-numbing, mundane, repetitive tasks. I enjoy to be mentally challenged now and again and this job is nothing of the sort, it's only physically demanding."
bad,"They don't match dollar for dollar for Stock. They demand high performance ratings and will fire you if you can't maintain their expected rate, despite all of the barriers you face on a daily basis, which they never fix. You are their Scapegoat and you are Replaceable. They don't care about You, only their numbers."
bad,"A typical day at work is standup meeting for safety and quality suggestions, plus news of any sort involving management or changes in work environment. You either be placed as picker pick items into bags with scanner or slam line person processing picked totes of pickers, and worst the tote builders or ice preppers which is hard intensive back breaking work."
bad,Very sucky place to work they don't value their workers. you are always over worked very tired and no time to do anything with you family all they care about is the customer's and the company
bad,I absolutely hated the fact that the workers over everybody did absolutely did nothing but walk around. The workers tried to be smartellic with me which I didn't appreciate. I didn't learn anything from orientation. I had a friend that worked there and while I was in training she helped me out not the ambassadors which is why they are getting paid for. Every time I turned on my light I had to walk over to them to ask them what I should do.
bad,"I worked here for quite a while & they beat me into the ground the whole time. You have to be a brown noser to get promoted & when they want you gone, they find a way. They mandate overtime at the drop of a hat, then next day offer VTO. Management is a joke, the place has change hands so many times its not even funny. Everyone is out for themselves & they don't care about anyone. No compassion, vindictive & a bunch of back stabbing. Unrealistic rates that go up annually. I wouldn't recommend anyone work there, but hey there are people who love it there. I'm just one person..."
bad,"I worked for amazon for what i think is along time and the truth is i hated it. The only things is numbers at the job. And you expendable as a water bottle and if your lucky after 1 year if your lucky you may have some link of temporary promotion but odds are that guy they just hire that doesn't know anything with less experience then you will get it. The trun over rate is the worst, the 1st day, two will be sent home. 2nd week half of the people you where hire with is gone. After 3 months out of 40 new hires and me in my group. me and one other is lefted. I can go on and on about this job, like poor management, work conditions, schedule changing with out permission, and HR is just temporary is you. The job is for money and about 3 months of work. Even if you are hire as temp, full time or part, to the company you are just a number and there are countless more....."
bad,Vous prenne pour des pigeons après avoir travailler a certain temps il vous reprenne plus sans savoir pourquoi.
bad,"I liked the job but it came down to where there was never work and couldn't make rate with no work available so they left me go! I like to keep busy! My duties were unpacking, packing, taping boxes, counting products, bagging products, stickering and labeling products and boxes, sent boxes of products down conveyor."
bad,"Amazon is a terrible company, Pa's have no idea what they are doing. The hardest part about working at amazon is trying to not off yourself, I dont even want to be filling this out im being forced to."
bad,"Long hours, impossible targets, un supportive management. Short breaks time from when you leave your workstation, you the have to queue to get through security to get to the canteen."
bad,"12 hours a night standing, supervisors who had no clue what they were doing, insufficient break times, noisy environment, constant breakdowns and delays."
bad,"Terrible place to work I only took a job there as a stop gap till I got a perm job somewhere else, never expected it to be as bad as it was, imagine working in a concentration camp and you will have a rough idea of Amazon, one guy actually died from a heart attack at hemel Hempstead Amazon FC last year that's how bad the management run the FC impossible pick targets you have to walk 15 miles a day picking 300 items per hour or face the boot on your first week lol just leave this company well alone it should be closed down."
bad,"No life balance, no fun, just stick to your laptops. Things are turned around. lots of biasim. Management is the worst. HRBP is also not that supportive. Nothing new to learn."
bad,"I worked here for 6months they to speak to you like trash, no progression within the company. Short breaks and shorter diner breaks. They do not care about  health and safety at all."
bad,"Amazon is a fast paced job, lots of work load, the managers dont listen to their employers, HR messes up a lot of people paycard. The job is easy and their is diversity in the warehouse."
bad,"Leadership from the CEO on down is dysfunctional. Management have no clue how to lead or manage people. They do not recognize talent, just suck-ups and yes men/women. Hence, why they hire so many foreigners in the fulfillment center. They work you like a mule. pay is low for what you do."
bad,Working at Amazon was an awful experience.  Careless co-workers caused me an injury.  Amazon is refusing to pay my medical bills or any salary while I am off work.  Awful place to work! False advertising about benefits.
bad,"wow is enough to describe it, horrendous non english speaking management, speak to you like dirt, impossible targets to hit, instantly on warning system for one late"
bad,"Run away! Trust me you will hate it here just try and stay away, The managers will over work you for like 3 hours and then have you leave, do not work here! Managers will lie to you, you will not work  full time, no matter what they tell you, you will not get in to a full time job unless you are the managers go to slave. you will need a college education for a promotion, Again run away!"
bad,"The work hours are to long for such low pay, the targets are they set are to high and level of disrespect for their workers is terrible."
bad,"Worse place Ive ever worked. And I was in the Army. It's horrible. Horrible management, and zero leadership. Managers dont do anything and theyre not even there half of the time. They send half of the building home everyday because theres no work. Also they fire people for absolutely nothing all the time. Dont protect your co-workers from nut cases that work there because theyll fire you for that too."
bad,"Amazon breaks so many labor laws I'm amazed they haven't been sued, oh wait, I forgot they are being sued. Worst company I ever worked for. They breach contracts as if contracts were never signed. Tips get taxed and I'm pretty sure they take some of our tips before adding them to the check as part of the hourly pay."
bad,It's not a very friendly place to work when I applied they never told me I was going to be doing something different they need better team leaders
bad,"it is a most bad job i had un my life!!!! I.m currently work there it it; managers treat us like we are solders!!! even they dont give us 30 minutes break, Im working 10 hours at day ,and if i need going to the bath ,they counting how many seconds have at the bath!! HR only protect white people !!!!! bad job for work!!!!"
bad,job was boring and there is little to no communication between management and employees plus management never pays attention to the workers except for their favorites
bad,"slave labour, ridiculous expectations, poor workforce, sub standard workplace advancement, I learned nothing the whole 7 weeks I was their, I was lied to, and told I could come back, then I was lied to again, we are treated like criminals, moved around like sheep, I can go on but I think ive made my point."
bad,No actual management to report to. May managers with many different answers.The hardest part is not having someone to go to if need further assistance. Set hours are not standard and when they are available have to run to get them.
bad,"I did work there for nine months. "
bad,Did not care about employees well being they do not give accommodations per drs orders they dont accept drs notes they are only worried about numbers and ratings
bad,"Amazon where do i start ? Amazon isn't a good place to work. The employees,disrespectful managers. I didn't like working at amazon. People were disrespectful."
bad,"Great company to work for but management needs a lot of work. Morale is very low. With my experience working at Amazon, too many people there in management positions that don't know their job and alot of them show favoritism. Not enough support from management with training and development. They use and abuse you and then find out ways to get rid of you."
bad,"The location in moonachie and perhaps in the metropolitan area over works their employees , they make workers  "" call in"" for their lunch breaks but in reality they can not take their lunch breaks due to the over whelming schedule on making sure all packages are delivered ASAP! So many just hustle through it without being able to have lunch. Management or supervisors do not treat their workers good either. A lot of screaming and a very stressed environment. They have a very big turn around due to many quitting due to What they put you through. If you go fir a job here trust me you will be hired because Many always  quit. And at only 16 dollars an hour it's laughable all you have to go through for such low pay. No benefits. Nothing. The people who stay long there have an eye out for better paying jobs but hustle through until they can get one. Your body goes through a lot of hurt and pain- if it snows - they make you go out there with no safe vans most of the times guys get into accidents due to the terrible conditions. It's horrible. Amazon pays these companies money to hire people but yet don't want to give benefits it's really sad how they over work their workers. For such little pay. They want robots for workers. I suggest better pay , better management , more organization if you want to keep good workers!"
bad,"Worst management. Constant worry if whether your job will exist in the morning. Unrealistic target system. Hung, drawn and quartered for talking to a colleague. The permanent workers get their targets exempted by sucking up to the team leads so they stand around and do nothing whilst the temps work their butt off. Wouldn't recommend to anyone to work here after the short and dreadful tenure I had there. 0/10."
bad,"if you were laid off after peak season, the holiday season, be happy. Amazon did you a favor because amazon laid off more than half of its workers during peak season so their are fewer workers now. Only 30 percent of workers compared to the amount of workers during peak season remain. So now their are few workers so the work load is heavier and the management keeps on rushing workers and checking scan rates and spying on workers. Some workers who used to work hard got laid off. Their are still plenty of workers that barely work who only pick up yellow envelopes all day instead of picking up packages. Yeah people keep on getting laid off as their are spies spying on most workers and snitching to management. But its not a workplace you want to work at because the workload is heavy even though its a part time job. Thought about applying for full time but after going thru the heavy work load of part time where management is rushing you, I decided not to. Also their are some honest friendly managers that will appreciate you for your work and their are some managers you want to avoid working or being around because they are their looking for the next person to lay off so if you happen to be doing something around them like taking a rest they may think you are not working and lay you off on the spot. Like I said not  good place to work and you should only work their temporary and try to find a better job. A lot of people were upset they were laid off, but they should be glad because the work their got worse and its place you'll hate working at."
bad,"Worst place ever,bad management,long hours,supervised by eastern europeans looking after there own,lied to,agency supervisors gee up there own people to get there numbers..........The list goes on...............Dont ever go there ! Its worse than what is seen or spoken about by the media its beyond a sweat shop ive seen grown men cry at this horrid place."
bad,Do not work for the UTX2 location they will not pay you and just hire a new group of people when you figure out they are not paying. Training is fast but a lousy group of managers and very unorganized for new employees.
bad,"Not a good place to work "
bad,This place runs a slave ship during the holidays half an hr lunches on 12 hr shifts is crazy and two 15 minute breaks but in reality only 5 minutes from how far you got to walk and that's if your not up top on the 3rd floor
bad,i worked there and i did not like it and i did not like the  staff  and i worked 10 hour shifts and all weekends it was busy and a lot of people there
bad,"Amazon demands that you worship it as your God. If you enjoy anything close to the idea of free time forget working here. As you will easily give 15 hours of your day to Amazon. Hardly any training for your incredibly face paced work, a ""Safety"" team that I've seen cause more injures due to poor medical care, and a slew of nigh illegal business practices make Amazon less than the ideal workplace."
bad,Warehouse associates are over-worked and under-paid! Corporate office is apathetic about our needs!  Unable to get help from our local HR team.
bad,"The managers only care about meeting their quota and pushing others to receive as many pallets possible by hovering over them and letting them know who is in first and last place. Not the environment I want to keep working in where there is a winner and loser type competition. I drive forklift and they always ""insist"" we let them know if we don't feel safe operating the machine I let a manager know I was tired and didn't get enough rest I was told to pull a pallet jack instead which was worse. So I ended up driving while I could barely keep my eyes open. They also vote for a schedule change from 5 8's to 4 10's. This is a job for you if you don't have a life outside of work or a family or live at home and don't go to school. You sign your soul and social life over once you work for this company."
bad,Stow Mgrs are a bunch of 20 year girls that have no management experience and should be cheerleaders instead of managers.
bad,"i went sexually harassed more than twice by the same male, i reported it to HR and supervisors and they did nothing to help except to move the man away from me.He kept harassing other women as well and they still continued to do NOTHING."
bad,"It's an OK company to work for, can't live on the salary they give you though .  Disorganized at times but fun to work at sometimes."
bad,were not getting paid enough to do the thing that we were doing. other amazons were getting paid much more but the amazon in san Bernardino were the one that was pushing the most volume . employees were not getting recognize of their hard work
bad,"Aucune opportunités de développement"
bad,"hate this place with all my heart. All they do is work me as hard as they can and yell at me, mess up my pay checks, delete my schedule, and tell you they can' t fix it until you yell at them."
bad,"they don't care about their employees and you will work hours that will be unrealistic."
bad,All lies They promise you. room to grow and after 2 months they let you go with a BS excuse. Especially the plant in Hawthorne.
bad,"there a greart monday-friday no money no benefits , and rude people customers and mangers... they are very unorganized and needs new managment."
bad,More on-boarding training before new employees are thrown in the fire. The first couple of weeks can be very confusing on where to find the information you need that pertains to your job.
bad,The experience was life changing. The managers were not as profession as I`d hoped. My co-workers was amazing to work with. The hardest part of my job was dealing with my managers.
bad,Company management have no leadership skills whatsoever.  They are good at cracking the whip and micro managing associates. They are all brain-washed to the corporate mentality. They expect you to work for low pay for 10-11 hour a day. All while standing.
bad,I have been calling them multiple times and was told they will send me a cheque but it never came. I had to quit my job because of a schedule conflict with school. They have offered an option to pick thurs-mon schedule but when I was about to start working they did not have that shift and was told they did not have a choice but to let me go!
bad,very bad worst place ive ever worked its a plantation jobover worked and under paid to many mandatory hours no home time or family time requirments are out of controll
bad,A typical day started at 7:30am where you would be constantly on your feet until the minute you left at 6:00pm. Not enough time to enjoy your break. Laid people off when they had a bug or injured themselves. One person had torn a ligament in their leg but were made to work until the end of their shift.
bad,Essentially slave labour.  Majority of workforce are agency on temporary contract.  The agency is solely concerned with hiring and firing people and I seen no constructive learning process just alot of very stupid people in positions of authority. I was employed as picker / packer and the work was exhausting.  I once visited 5 water stations and all were empty.  This led to written warning on productivity. I  informed management who did absolutely nothing.  Left the same week absolutely shocking workplace and management extremely lacking in any coordination or structure.
bad,"While I was working at Amazon, some of the supervisors were kind of petty and did little petty things including penalizing people for a minute or two of lateness from our breaks which were very short."
bad,Spend most of your break or lunch walking to break area. Your production efficiency is determined by which type of picking you are doing but viewed as all the same production type for your weekly efficiency numbers. Horrible job and way under paid.
bad,"I have worked for them twice now and I can say both times have not been pleasant. When asking for any sort of help they are either rude or have no information on what you need and when you have an injury or a sick child or are sick yourself they don't give you any type of leeway, they are down right rude and inconsiderate."
bad,"Where to start, you will get written up during your training and probably more than once. I don't know where these people are getting a lot of room for advancement from, I mean you can move to different positions, but not any extra payment. They tell you its a privilege, to move to a different task, how fast they can take it away if your late coming back from breaks and use the restroom too many times. The management are just yes men and read everything they say and do from a constant stream of emails on the laptop's they carry around and are constantly refreshing, so they don't miss a single email from the upper tier. If you want to keep a second job don't even bother applying as they lie to you about flexibility, they will not work around any type of schedule. Most of the managers walk around looking for the smallest infraction of any kind of ""rule"" due to the fact they have so little to do. Most of the managers are in their early twenties, which speaks for itself. Overall it's not a great place to work, a redeeming factor is the benefits, the healthcare, dental, and vision plans are fairly decent as is the 401k. Anyways good luck."
bad,"Expected to work like machines, very rude staff and had unrealistic work requirements for a human to be able to physically do.  They have employees come and go because they do not treat them with respect."
bad,Most of the days are same as picker... long distance walking with not to much breaks. the hardest part is that long hours. Management is really nice and helpfull.
bad,"Worked there last year..what a joke.12 of us started and me and the 2 oldest people got put on picking,you have to run around a football field full of  shelves picking items..time limit to get to next one...i was hitting 70 an hour..target is 120"
bad,"every thing is over a computer and their are no people to talk to, you ask were your check is and they have no answers. i have had to fight to get a check through a second party."
bad,"Completely hated working here. Long hours, high hourly targets, management don't care about you only want you to work faster. No care for safety or the individual just work faster make Amazon rich."
bad,"Amazon is a joke!!! They are always hiring because they can't keep employees! Their picking rates is 305 an hour!"
bad,Not a good place to work management is terrible and they expect you to work as a robot. Hour are terrible. They received one star each only because it was required because personally I give it zero stars.
bad,Unexperienced management team right out of college. Hardest part of the job is not going home when you are being criticized. Only enjoyable part was meeting new people and making new friends.
bad,I'm very sure who ever is running this site is pocketing a lot of the money that can be used for resources for this facility. Not only does the owners harass the staff by rushing the process of things that everything from receiving to delivery is all messed up. On top of that they have no proper equipment for drivers or the vehicles they use to deliver at night and during inclement weather.
bad,UN-realistic work expectations for a human to possibly be able to do! Rude and dis-respectful supervisors.  You work 10 hour shifts and have to move like a robot even when your giving it you all it goes un recognized.
bad,It has been the worst job I ever had to work for. They treat you like lab rats and expect you to work long hours to high standards with little breaks and encouragement.
bad,"Many articles have been written about Amazon's brutal work culture. While it beats starving to work at Amazon, you need to keep looking for work no matter how tired you are when you crawl home from the distribution center. You will eventually fail to increase your rate and you will be let go no matter how punctual, dependable, cheerful etc you are. Numbers are the only thing that matters. You will also leave with permanent injury if you stay too long. Your body was not meant to walk 12-15 miles a day on concrete, Your wrist was not meant to haul and squeeze a one-pound scanner three to five thousand times a day. And no matter what they tell you about promotions do not believe them especially if you are a woman or anyone over forty."
bad,"I worked from home as a VCC Customer Associate Seasonal worker for Amazon for 4 months.This Seasonal position was supposed to be for 6 months. The training last 3 weeks which seems like forever with endless training and test that you have to pass each and every one before you are able move on to the next test. During training they informed everyone that the main thing that Amazon reviewed for you to get hired permanently was good attendance which I had perfect attendances. After training you start taking customers calls up to 100 calls per day none stop. The team leaders and managers would listened to each and every calls that you receive from each customer and at the end of each call a Survey is automatically sent to the customer; and though management can hear how hard you are trying to accommodate the customers needs, they still over look that and focus on the negative rating that you receive.  Which ratings are based mostly on what amazon's system allows you to do; and with that being said that can take up a lot of time to assist that customer. Timing is one of reason why associates would receive bad reviews; overall it's the delivery process that upsets them more than anything, completely understandable!  There wasn't a ""written"" warren, working at home or not; they can be issued through email, print, signed and scanned back to them. Amazon literally decides to let you go randomly, AFTER completing your long shift. This position was not ""Seasonal"" it was for whenever it was Bennifical to them; every week you would see new co-workers in your team room and everyone you started"
bad,"First of all, management is terrible. I imagine they are just following the silly protocol (cheerleading at breaks, bugging you multiple times each shift to tell you how you need to go faster, walking around with an open laptop without actually doing anything) set up by the company, but seriously, after working here I realize the garbage people buy and am compelled to do a complete purge of my own home! They harp on the importance of safety, but remarkably exclude the carpal tunnel issues you will most likely feel after a few days of hanging on to a 3 pound scanner that dangles from your wrist for 10 hours. This is a really dismal working environment where you are made to feel like a complete cog in a machine. Turnover is huge - HUGE! They don't care though because they don't have to since another poor unassuming soul is ready to take your place. The breaks are way, way, way too short. The job culture is degrading. You'll see people who desperately need the job and will do anything it takes to keep it, no matter how miserable they are doing it while you are trying to plan your escape. Everybody is treated as if they are dumb as doorknobs.  It seems Amazon knows how terrible they are since they start new employees out with a bunch of unpaid personal time and some paid personal time. What sort of a place would do that unless they knew how miserable they made people? The mantra of ""have fun, work hard, make history"" is a complete joke. It's NO fun. As far as working hard, you will do that, but making history? Umm...no. After 3 weeks, my hands hurt so much that I was waking up in"
bad,"Amazon do not care about their staff morale, work/life balance or health."
bad,"Horrible job.. the pay is terrible, the expected rates are ridiculous and the management is nonexistent. I would certainly not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"Worked for Amazon at their Mississauga warehouse, Mill Creek avenue. SMX - Staff Management is their in house employment agency. Extremely rude and arrogant people from both SMX staff managemt and Amazon. No respect or manners or courtesy."
bad,"Treat you like slaves. "
bad,"This job is all about getting out inventory as fast as possible. Too many strict policies, regulations and guideline to follow. I don't even care to work for this job ever again."
bad,They alienate older workers. They cater to young people. The old are treated inappropriately. They have a bunny ranch in the bathroom. You do get a water bottle with amazon and a thanksgiving dinner from boston market.
bad,"Bus gets in 50 mins early, picks up 1 hour after finish."
bad,Amazon is not a carrier lots of work with low pay workers mean nothing to them they are machines when it comes to your health they don't care they will found a way to fire you no matter how good you are employee there are numbers all is matter is production management are young and have no clue with what they doing same to the Hr '''' work hard have fun make history ''''' you will never have fun long hours doing same thing over and over you will be lucky if you can drive back home . they make you work for money don't work unless you are in really need . you get two brake of 15 min and 30 min lunch that you waste half of them walking to the breakroom
bad,This company has replaced the whips used on slaves with there laptops. Constantly hounding workers about their rate twice a day. Workers walk eight hours a day nonstop. Management speaks about safety but its just all talk. Its all about your rate which must be 100 percent everyday. Workers break is from 10am to half ten yet you are pestered to start work before half ten for something called power rate. You get a warning if you are four minutes late although your break finishes at half ten. Management refuses to allow workers there half our break instead its down to 20 minutes. They stand as you enter the warehouse from the cafeteria yelling scan an item before half ten for your power rate.  This company treats workers like slaves teaching you one think on orenition day but have you breaking every rule that is taught as orientation is over. You can see the frustration and disgust on workers faces everyday. This company feeds on immigrants knowing that most of them dont have a choice and are afraid to speak out. Everyday there are new workers its a revolving door of employees. Very few people attended the company's bbq which was held on site and workers that chose to work on that day were not even allowed to attend the bbq during their half hour lunch. Management shoots their mouths of about customer quality but with very few brain cell they fail to realize if workers are unhappy the customer suffers. Its only a matter of time before a worker is seriously injured. Worst working experience.
bad,"Ce n'est pas du tout un travail intéressant, deux jours de travail, et j'ai reçu un avertissement injustifié ! La pause arrive au bout de 4h de travaux acharnés même si la pause n'en est pas vraiment une.."
bad,Sembra di essere tornata al tempo degli schiavi!!! Devi dire se vai in bagno!! Mi è sembrato di lavorare con dei robot. Non sembra di essere tra persone umane!! Inoltre fanno tanta scena sulla sicurezza ma se devi fare scatoloni di libri e metterli.su un bancale nessuno viene a dirti che non devi farlo.perche pesano troppo!! Ho.trovato solo.un paio di persone che sono state gentili.e disposte a spiegare bene il lavoro!
bad,"Hello, I see my job advertised exactly one month after they terminated employment for me and my colleagues, if you want a temp job (described as permanent) this is for you, wages are low, with teh promise of shares if you stay 2 years, however they will terminate you prior to you ever getting to 2 years because thats what the do churn them in , and spit them out, or burn them out."
bad,"This was a very productive place to work, and you meet a lot of new people. You walked for long periods of time but it was good exercise."
bad,They were mean and used their power to hurt people instead of be there for the employees. This was a very hard job to sit and watch the way Human resource department was ran.
bad,Bullying culture for minimum wage. Nothing is ever good enough and run with constant threats of disciplinary or sack. Drivers are made to be self employed and kept dangling daily as to whether they are a route.
bad,"hard and long"
bad,Wasn't really much to say i did what i needed to do for the 1w2hrs i was there stowing items. I did the best i could to get everything done
bad,This management staff is the worst you only get promoted through favoritism. The work load varies some jobs are worse than others but no matter where you are your day will drag on forever.
bad,the staff in the med care do not have a bed side manner and are very rude. The staff are expected to be more physical then marathon runners and when you get hurt you get barley any help.
bad,"Amazon's culture is the best way to the right place for you and your team and I will be able to get the best Wayne Rooney and a half years of age and the family 21st, but the only way we 3rd party in the morning 21st of the most of my favourite stores now I"
bad,"Worst job ever. I highly do not recommend this job to anyone. Complete and utter disregard for their staff and to add insult to injury, the high hours and low wages are totally ridiculous."
bad,"no recognition for a self motivated hard workers. pretty much about who you know and not what you know or what you can provide to the company as an individual. been there for over 2 years now, and its very rare to make it that long in this FC."
bad,Poor company puts being frugal before its employees. Breaks many labor laws one time worked 3 1/2 hours before getting a break for prime day. Also promised gifts to the hardest working associates and never fulfilled
bad,basically like slavery all hours on your feet to not even get paid on time was told i changed my bank details and was paid already like 3 times. ridiculous.
bad,treated like slaves. short breaks. long hours. get in trouble for going to toilet. not allowed to stop to talk to anyone. constantly working and the managers dont care if you are ill they will treat you like a dog   and have no respect.
bad,"Management, and Human Resources treats everyone like they have mental disabilities."
bad,"Horrible working conditions, coworkers and myself were constantly ill, goals were unrealistic. The company basically expects you to work until you bleed. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this place."
bad,It's not worth it for what you are required to do.  The company demands excellence but they do not provide you with the tools to be successful.
bad,Amazon is a terrible company and they don't care about the workers only getting the product out to the customers. I have nothing to say the job is good for people going through tough times trying to get through.
bad,I used to work for security at Amazon and their loss prevention system is a joke. Things were walking out all over the place and their own loss prevention team would not listen. As for Amazon workers their working conditions were very poor. They used to get two 15 minute breaks and 1 half hour. It could take them as much as 5 minutes to get from where they worked to the canteen not leaving much time for any break
bad,"I i like the online part about it but it as for working there not a good experience. job was not good. they had great benefits and it was very competitive, witch was a good thing no time for lacking."
bad,"My work experience with amazon was very good, Everyday was different with the packages we would deliver small and big packages. we delivery everything you can think of from baby items, household items, to game system to flat screen TV's. The company started to expand their items to fast food, liquor and grocery's which customer loved. Everyday I would deliver packages, food, liquor, and hot food item which had all the delivery drivers very busy. When picking up package we would have about 2 to 10 stops all over Chicago which we would have to get it done within 2 hrs. or less. This is call 1 to 2 hr. delivery. Our dispatch, Amazon supervisors, and also ill supervisor can see everything we doing just like the customer can see us come from the pick up stop to there door step. The pay was good and hours."
bad,"Breaks are suppose to be 15minutes, working at Amazon you must race to and from within 10 mins. Same goes for lunch. A lot favoritism, poor management, lack of communication and respect for their workers. Also, you are UNDER PAID, in the Hebron,KY area. Amazon requires too much, for all the hard work you do; while working at least a 10 hour shift. Find another place to work. My opinion."
bad,Always on customer side whether right wrong or just rude and disrespectful to their employees. It sucks!! Don't wrkhere. Training does not prepare you for what really goes on once you are on the phones
bad,"I would not advise anyone to work for this company. It will be the worst mistake of your life!!!! They don't care about there associates. Managers treat you like dirt. Very disrespectful. They refuse to take doctors excuses if you are out with the flu. Lord knows if you run out of time you will be automatically terminated. One day I was supposed to go in for work, but I called up there to let human resource know, I could not make it because my father couldn't breath. They told me that was there least concern that my father couldn't breath. I had to report to work. I felt like they were very inconsiderate. So I quit. You don't say things like that to your associate. We are the ones that are making your company richer and richer. Without us the company would be closed down due to lack of help. So please be advised, DO NOT!!!!! Work for this company. You will regret it...."
bad,Get ready to lift and carry heavy boxes! Most of the time you flex up and have to stay longer hours. People are mean they make fun of you. A lot of jealous managers; if you tend to work better than them then they will give you a hard time. Then they will use the workers to against you. They lie about the blue badges stating if you work after 90 days you will get a blue badge.
bad,Worst place to work and if you are working for an agency be prepared for some elementary mistakes and miscommunication. The place is a dive and you are treated like another number.
bad,"They have an extremely high consumer demand, so your quota is always being pushed higher. They do make you work long hours and give you a short amount of time for breaks. I'm sorry Amazon, I'm just being honest. "
bad,"The whole day is nothing but fast pace competitive."
bad,"A typical work day included meeting nearly impossible standards, bare minimum breaks and horrible treatment of employees. I quit because I was unable to receive reasonable accommodations for being pregnant."
bad,"On this one particular day a elderly woman called into Amazon with some concerns about an order she placed. In the midst of her telling me the issue. She mentioned her husband died. So, she was very frustrated about an item she ordered not being what she expected. She started talking about how she has been dealing with her grief. Being that my children father was killed. I could relate in the sense that we both lost the love of our life. Even after i assisted her with the return we continued to talk. We both ended up helping each other to get through the day. I was able should got me ""someone who can relate"". Even though i had to take a few minutes after the emotional call to get myself together. The customer was in a better place, because she had me to relate too. The hardest part of the job was when there was nothing i could do for the customer. But i had to obey Amazon policies. Which in turn did not make the customer happy. The most enjoyable part of the day was making the customers happy. Managing is a very fast paced job, and you are responsible for the employees under you."
bad,This place is awful they find the job that is the hardest for you to physically do and then torture you by making you do it constantly even though you are trained in other areas.
bad,"Where do I start...This place is modern day slavery. These people don't care about their employees at all. When you do good work there's no one on one acknowledgement. But let you not make your rate, management running around with their little laptops telling you you didnt make your rate or you had so many errors. When half the time the errors they said I did were wrong & I proved it. Also with the rate, you can make your rate but management can ""alter"" it and say you made something else. Therefore, a possibility of termination because ""they"" said you didnt make the rate. Once my rate showed up on my scanner as 207 but when I went on break they said it was 137..Yea, go figure. The pay IS NOT WORTH THE WORK THAT YOU DO THERE. This is a multi billion dollar business & all they can pay is is $11.00. A typical day is standing on your feet for 10 hrs excluding 30 min lunch break & two 10 min breaks that are suppose to be 15 mins. Pushing these heavy uboats around the warehouse looking for imaginary space to stow items. And the HR dept. Is really not needed because all they do is sit at the computer shopping online and on their cell phones, & dont ask them a question they act like its the end of the world. Managers are fake and do nothing but walk around with their laptops acting like they're doing something. If you just need this job until you can find something else then this may be the place for you if you're ok with physical work. Because this job is very physical. During work & when I get off I am so tired & just wanna lie down. If you have a family, you'll be too tired to do"
bad,"That's all I can say is it was very target driven and long hours. I got on with the temp workers, the team leaders and some of the other staff. I found that the agency staff were constantly on to me, I had three final warnings which didn't make sense a final warning is last warning so it shows that the management wasn't much good."
bad,"Amazon is just to help people pay their bills.. "
bad,If your young and uneducated then this is the place for you. If you have been fired from your good job and need a paycheck other than from the government then this is your place. If you don't like your family and want to work all the weird hours then Amazon has a place for you.
bad,"didnt like working there, bad wadge, didnt like the place at all, had to leave because i couldnt get there because they stopped the buses"
bad,"Do not work for this company,do not order products from this company.They treat employees really bad,unless your management.Then you can walk around all day with a laptop and threaten to write people up for their numbers not being 100%."
bad,They over work their employees and the breaks are from scan to scan so where you are in the building may be five minute away from the break room. With that being said 15 minute break are cut in half because you have to get back to your next scan within those 15 minutes. I would not recommend this job.
bad,"I was told that I had cancer and they felled to work with me and the let me go. The day was overall great, and some of the people that I dealt with were amazing. The HR portion or part of the company is what needs help."
bad,"The managers don't manage and aren't very bright. Their training is below standard, you're better off asking the people that work at the stores for help. They're big on hearsay and gossip. And they will talk about you behind your back. They fired a lot of people that didn't deserve it and will make up excuses to fire you. There is no organization in management and their skills and experience is very questionable. They have no Union so if you're smart do not work for Amazon in Santa Monica."
bad,"Scan Packages "
bad,"team leader's have no clue. 45min break's for a 12 hour shift. "
bad,did not like it there as the management was horrible most of the othere staff was horrible & didnt have respect for other workers inside the werehouse
bad,"Atypicall day was 10 hrs with a 30 min not paid break and two 15 mins breaks. Standing at station all day, not allowed to sit, toilet break 2 mins and often it would take longer to get to loo! If on picking orders then walking up to 10 k mtrs in a shift! constant messages on scanner move to other area etc after only just arriving in new area told to move again, and all lost time goes against you. Amazon direct employees in the main were good, but were not nice people under pressure! Management were just out of school and clearly did not know how to manage at all! "
bad,"Waste of time, don't waste yours. Life is short. So many other opportunities that pay better. If you just need an emergency job so be it, but remember reading this comment, I told you."
bad,"I was employed as an elf, sorry, 'associate'!, leading up to the 2015 Christmas period. The constant pressure to meet their ridiculous requirements, long hours, unreasonable pay and constant performance pressures and competition against everyone else to gain full employment and a 'Blue badge' is never ending and very unpleasant. Seriously the worst place I've ever worked at and the worst pays in my life! Forget statutory holidays such as Thanksgiving as they will require you to work as a slave regardless if it falls on your scheduled shift. You won't be paid any differently as a normal day but possibly given a piece of pumpkin pie for your efforts of sacrificing your rare time you should be spending with your family."
bad,not a good place to work they are slave drivers they will work you till you drop and work you more your never fast a nothe nor work hard a nothe they never have any thing positive to say about you
bad,if your working here during peak season and just need a couple paychecks this the job for you trying a career out of it find another place bad turnover rate
bad,"The role was very unsatisfying, the management team was not interested in assisting their associates. The job overall was just horrible"
bad,Worst job ive ever had. Waste of time. Currently been sat 3 hours to get my parcels and they probably will expect 120+ drops today. No breaks or toilet stops if you want to finish 30mins earlier. Bad admin staff. Late invoices if not at all. To top that off when you finish you have to drive back to the depo to debrief witch can take upto 10 or 30mins. 12p a mile you get back from your working day witch you have to be eco all day to be in pocket. £1000 excess on the rental van if you crash it + parts and labour. The routes are rediculous sometimes and hard to find witch wastes time. Route cuts witch mean you wont be going to work one day and be out of pocket 110 and you have to pay 168 pounds a week regardless. All in all ive given a bad review because its slavery and nobody hets looked after. Think if 50+ drivers have problems and only 1 or 2 supervisors no one has priorities. Supposed to be based in Sheffield permanently but keep getting sent to Normanton witch is an extra hours drive in the morning instead of my usual 5miles. You finish late and get no time to socialise and 3 hours to eat and relax before you have to sleep and do it all again. Very dangerous aswell being expected to drive all day with no brakes
bad,Amazon is the hands down worst job I've ever had. They have ridiculous conditions and have a warehouse so full of junk that it makes it hard to even do your job correctly.
bad,"I like to work with this company because I never see here discrimination and everybody is happy to work with smile ,I understand much more and I learn nearly everything in short time"
bad,"Sweating and being pushed to do more then your accustomed."
bad,Work you hard. Rate very hard to hit. They give you five chances to make rate or fired.  Management not very good. This job was not very enjoyable.
bad,"Es un entorno de trabajo que hay que ser rrapido y eficaz...  Conoci muchas personas"
bad,"A empresa é boa, mas as pessoas que administravam não são tão profissionais. Trocou de endereço e ficou uma confusão no novo local. Houve falta de planejamento."
bad,"Just really dissatisfied with the work experience. Management was rude to the employees and did not care if they hit rate. when i would try to help them, i was told it was basically a sink or swim part of working there."
bad,"You loose your life while working here. No family, friends or relationships of any kind. All you do is sleep and work. On top of that its physically and mentally demanding. You are constantly walking or lifting items for 60 hours a week. You loose your mental state from the lack of sleep, physical exhaustion and lack of social life."
bad,"I've been at amazon for 3 months now and I can say it's been 3 months too long. I have never heard a single person say they ""love their job"" or that they enjoy working there. Just people with the look of mourning on their face while they push through the day. The jobs there are very grueling with a very depressing vibe. It's ran like a concentration camp complete with the psychological games meant to keep you feeling less than human. "
bad,"poor from top to bottom, atomosphere is shocking, feels more like a punishment to work there, wouldn't recommend this job to anyone"
bad,"disgusting payrate, disgusting hours, horrible selfish staff, would rather be in jail. unbearable working conditions, very short breaks fact."
bad,"I would NOT recommend Amazon as a company to work for. The targets they set are totally unrealistic and unable to be reached without tweaking the figures. They have a three strikes and your out policy and some of the things you can get a ""point"" for is just silly."
bad,Taylorism for the 21st century.  Constant minute-by-minute monitoring of work rate.  Regularly raising production rates without raising wages.  Management treating employees like children.  Constant massive turnover rate.  Not a fun place to work at.  Not a good company to work for.
bad,"Horrible hours, 6 pm to 7 am about 6 days of the week, not to mention too strict on new employees and barely anytime to see family or sleep when you get home."
bad,"Horrible place to work for someone who whats to make 50,000 a year salary. Management needs to be retrained, and there are no minority's or diversity on a management level."
bad,The job expectations are very unrealistic with minimal resources. I learned that this company does not care about its employees. The entire management team is very inconsistent. They will hire anyone through a flawed recruiting system which forces you to interact with people who don't care about the position they hold. The hardest part about your job is the minimal amount of recognition that you receive for all of the hard work that you do on a daily basis. This job is not enjoyable.
bad,Amazon wanted it's workers to work all day without min time of task...working 10 hours a day walking 18-20 miles was tiresome and wasn't worth it especially with the pay.
bad,Overall a very poor place to work. Very disorganised and repetative robotic work. The hours were fair but the constant push to improve performance was not welcomed by all who worked there.  I feel that a company the size of Amazon could value their staff more by giving a bit more feedback in a positive manner.  They recruit via agencies to take unemployed people on as they receive incentives from the goverment.  They then push people to reach unrealistic targets which in turn has an affect on their well being and work/life balance.  You can be penalised for almost anything that does not take to their liking.  I would never recommend anyone to work there even if it was was upwards of £20 per hour.
bad,"I worked as a warehouse associate for two months. I enjoyed the actual work itself as it was as if I was getting paid to work out. The jobs is not for sissies and requires being on your feet and per Amazon, walking approx.10 miles a shift for part-time workers. I worked hard and enjoyed that my co-workers were from every culture. I was liked by everyone, but I'm not one to sit back day after day and watch every single rule they talk about at ""stand-up"" get broken the minute the employees feet hit the floor. I was let go because I was too verbal and spoke up. A large company like Amazon only wants a warm body on the floor to perform the essential job duties. They do NOT care if the job is performed right, they just want it done. I did the work, but did it correctly. Henceforth when I reported too many wrongs, I was set up and let go. I'm actually now pursuing this by having someone who just applied for and got a position at the BF15 plant so they can see and believe everything I reported to them is true. Then Amazon will be in the news, once again for poor business practices and will hit the news again."
bad,"this company need to focus more on its customers and making employees happy, lack of management wasn't taken serious at all, to be a place of bussiness."
bad,"Nightmare treatment. This is my personal experience. The agency people were extremely judgmental and rude from the start."
bad,"I was hired for the work from home customer reserve program at 10 dollars an hour. I got an email stating that I had up until 3 days before November 1, 2015 to complete my onboarding process. I completed everything in the beginning of October 2015 except the second portion of my I9, in which I had put in a request to get a seat in Huntington Wv, where I'm from and live. While I was waiting for my seat I got three more emails reminding me to complete my I9. then I got another email telling me that my position had been withdrawn for not completing my onboarding process that I had still had two more weeks to complete. The next day I get one more email from them saying they did not want to proceed with my application, after already being hired. I am very upset and I did reach out to the owner. Hopefully he got my emails so he can see what a poor job his staff are doing. DONT WORK FOR AMAZON THEY WILL MISTREAT YOU."
bad,Sweatshop with a sweatshop working environment.  No cell phones allowed to keep the ugly truth from being seen by the public.
bad,I will get straight to the point to amazon staff are ten a penny the turn over of staff is outrageous the agency staff get the worst deal as many of them are there to be worked in to the ground with a slandered 10 hour a day.Work targets that high that to meet them you have to damage your body while the stress put upon you by the leads to hit targets result's in worry over your job security. Compulsory overtime is a thing that they like to put on you anytime they feel like going as high as 60 hour's if you refuse as agency staff  to work this your gone an as permanent staff you are pushed out by being given the worst jobs in the factory. illness is another one if you are sick you have to call in every day failure to do so result's in point's getting added to you you get half a point if you go home ill 1 point if you call in an 3 points a day if you don't call in i have seen a member of staff get taken away in an ambulance after there appendix had burst and they still pointed him first for going early then for no call no show.i would advise to only consider working there if you have no other option.
bad,"polish staff member treats you like animals"
bad,"There is so much that needs to be improved in this place. The turnaround is there for a reason and they just don't seem to care. Scanners don't work properly half the time, you can't find people to help you and then when you do you get different answers so you never really know the right way to handle it the next time it comes up. They make you feel as though you have to rush rush rush all the time because that's more important than getting something done right. If they would really take the time and train, care, and listen you wouldn't have people walking out everyday. I would think that is a waste of people's time and company's money. When a company has to start offering thousand dollar bonuses to get people to stay there shouldn't they realize there is a problem!!!!"
bad,"The company wants 60 orders per hour packed, but I could only pack 40 to 45 and I requested to be moved to a department that I would be more suited for and was told that I had to be proficient in the department that I was in before I could be moved. I was fired for unable to meet production standards."
bad,this place was like a zoo total crazy If you were a temp u worked harder then anyone else I DO NOT TELL ANYONE TO GO TO WORK THERE
bad,"This company was horrible too work for, a typical day at amazon. would be clocking in doing pointless stretches "
bad,"Possibly one of the worst places I've ever worked in my working life."
bad,"Overall experience was poor, unstable team with undefined team responsibilities. Overall my team lacked the capability of identifying value in my internship project. Too unstable team hierarchy multiple managers resigned during my tenure. Final review was not satisfactory."
bad,Amazon is very unprofessional and do not care about their employees i got fired for an injury during an exercise they made me do.
bad,"We has co-workers weren't treated fairly such equal opportunity, we as co-workers needed follow the obligations that are strictly resectrtions held accountable."
bad,"When you have no other options of a place to work, and want decent pay and benefits, Amazon is a great place to start. Pretty much, no matter what, you can get hired here. You get good pay and benefits are okay."
bad,The hours are long and its super hot all the time. They preach about safety but so nothing about it. Management is rude on the rare chance you actually see them and the pay is terrible or how much work you do. Constantly on your feet with minimal and short breaks that always end up being cut even shorter by strict policies. By the time you get a chance to sit down your break is already over.
bad,"I took this job because I was moving into the area and well it was the first job that gave me an offer. Worst decision of my life. I enjoy working hard but there's just a point where it's like screw this. First, all the scanners are usually broken so you spend about 10 minutes actually looking for one to use while management yells at you to get to your assigned line.then you become a robot with the other robot workers and for 4 hours you pick up a box, and place the box on pallet. Simple, but yet lacking any type of reason to want to work hard. It would be nice if they would switch you around with other areas of need like they said but they don't. Your just a number to these people. No room for advancement, the managers have their favorites, and management just sucks they don't care about you they didn't even learn my name until 3 months in. My advice is keep looking there are a lot better warehouse, factory jobs out there if that's what your looking for. Good luck"
bad,Terrible place to work overworked and underpayed. They don't care about their employees just that you show up and do the job and everyone else's. There's barely anytime for breaks or lunch. If you want to have NO life at all and be tired all the time and expect to work overtime then sure take the job. Pay checks are a lot less then what they should be especially after taxes are taken out. Managers are lazy and people are irresponsible.
bad,"A typical work day consisted of the same thing, constantly, which made the job itself very boring. I learned how to stow at a fast pace. As for management, and co-workers, they were both not very helpful. The management was very rude, and not consistent, along with the coworkers. The hardest part of the job was the hours, and poor management. The most enjoyable was the pay"
bad,"This is thee worst company I ever worked for! It's probably as bad as working in the blood diamond mines in Africa! You are treated as such, a useless individual that is worked to death, and are ALWAYS expendable! Your hard work doesn't pay off. I wouldn't even recommend working here til you find that next job like another ex-employee has mentioned. They saw me limping, and they fired me because they viewed me as a ""future"" worker comp claim. I never complained about the injury because it didn't happen at work. Your breaks are short waiting behind others in line to clock out and the LONG trip to the break room makes your 15 min. break cut in half. Part of it consists of using the last 2 min. of it walking back to the time clock and waiting in line yet again! Run, don't walk, AS FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE AS YOU CAN! You've been warned...."
bad,"The company did not include its deaf and hard of hearing employees in the daily announcements. The initial process, the 3 day orientation, was the best part about the job. During this time, an interpreter was provided for me and it did help me understand about the job better. During the last day of orientation, there was no interpreter for me because management had been complaining about the cost to provide one. So I missed out on valuable information because the company is cheap. A typical day of work started with mini meetings in which information was shared, important information that they always leaved their deaf/hoh employees out of. Instead of taking the time to print off this information for us, we were left to depend on the patience of others to explain in detail what was said. When I wrote about the need for changes on the suggestion board, I was treated differently and with contempt."
bad,"Too many unqualified employees,too many lazy people who are only there to collect a check and the lack of inexperienced managers  doesn't help.Pay is less than other company's like them ."
bad,i have told al my friends and family about amazon the hardest part of my  job was makeing sure the itams were out on time. the most enjoyable part of my work was meeting new people. amazon is a really nice company to work for so a would say to people to go and give it a try
bad,"Working as a courier for Amazon logistics is dreadful. Working hours are long - and Amazon demand every single parcel 160-180 is attempted and above 15 returns demands a reattempt. Devices and software frequently malfunction, routing is frequently poor, demands are continually raised and constant process changes create dysfunction. In addition to that agencies frequently attempt to short change drivers on the payment front; quick practice is everywhere. Items are not scanned or counted by driver before delivery so if there is a warehouse team error the driver is often fired for that. Add in the constant threat of concessions, long hours and general sense of disorganisation and threat from Amazon. You have the worst working environment imaginable."
bad,very dirty environment and poor management within the facility i worked bad decisions resulting in high turnover and unpleasant and stressful positions from frontline and up
bad,"I worked for amazon as a Lead (PA) for almost 3 years. Employees are treated like cattle, herded into job positions and demanded to make rate. The pay/work load is so out of proportions it boggles the mind. I only suggest working here if you are desperate for a job. The only thing that can save amazon from its stubborn was is to unionize."
bad,Let's talk about feeling oppressed and wasting time.  No movement in terms of promotions.  Top performers are treated like trash and trashed for their efforts in front of the team.  All efforts to help and help others succeed are not appreciated by management.  Management is quick to retaliate if anything is brought to light. beware!
bad,the warehouse was super loud half of the time it smelled and we were always struggling for 20 to 30 minutes for parking and it takes forever to promote
bad,"When you first start they tell you that you have a chance to become permanent, in thr year that ive worked here only one time. they converted, anf it was 10 people out of 100s. there us no motavation to come to work and work hard to get done soon because if u get done soon you go home w/o pay, your guarenteed 18hrs but 20 is still more than 18. You get flexed up last minuet, i mean 5:59 n you get off at 6:00, no respect or care its either stay or get points/term. The management plays favorites, anybody thats an ambassador, or pa is a suck up and good friends with management so they walk around n do nothing the whole time while everybody works. They dont train newhires worth darn,  the pallets are built really bad because of newhires that were just walked around the building instead of trained how to fix and build pallets. They dont care about saftey, osha would have a field day, 7-8 ft stacks of boxes on a pallet unwraped and being stacked on is a hazzard, unloading trucks   standin on stools an reaching for boxes is unsafe, you get paid the same unloading trucks everyday, or sorting flat envelopes,  or sorting boxes. The site leader is a joke, you ask a serious question and he starts throwing big words at you as if hes explaining something in detail, but, in actuality its just a complecated way of saying ""i dont know"" or""eventually"" or  ""probly not"".this job needs union so bad its not funny. My advice, if your looking for a part time just for extra cash, it ok...dont come here to dfw8 and think your gonna be promoted, get a raise, be made permanent, treated with respect, or"
bad,"While working at Amazon it started out good like any job does, but as time went on there was no room for moving up within the warehouse. The actual managers there were from different places"
bad,"My experience as a Picker:"
bad,"FAIR WARNING, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!! SORRY EXCUSE FOR A COMPANY! SHORT BREAKS AND LOW PAY!!! By the time you clock out for lunch and walk even more to actually take your lunch, it's time to walk back and clock back in... sorry excuse for a company..."
bad,"I just dont like this company. supervisors just blame for no reason."
bad,"Extremely poor trainers.  Very rude management (to an extreme).  Company is unorganized and could not care less about employees."
bad,"I dont like this job, this wasnt for me. This was my first time and i did not care for this job. Theres no interactions with other people your alone and its very very boring."
bad,"Very stressful, abusive environment when working from home."
bad,"If you are an honest hard working individual without any alliances, employment will be difficult at this location. Many subcultures with their own politics involved, with the common ""PACK"" mentality. Everyone Groups up to do achieve less, too much micro- management, with baseline staff, having access to manipulate operating systems in dictating pick orders; product type, work location, and Quantity, key elements that are instrumental in accomplishing the required production rate to stay employed. Bottom line, if you're not affiliated and/or unknowingly become a potential threat, you're welcomed daily with purposely placed obstacles set by employees in unofficial management positions, later validated with vague disciplinary documentation with out-dated rates listed and no suggested solutions, accompanied by the obvious awareness of YOU ARE SET UP FOR FAILURE."
bad,"Training is inadequate, your duties can change multiple times during your 10 hour shift, advancement is stifled, compensation is minimal compared to the performance expectations."
bad,Great overall place to work if it is your first job or have been to an ivy league college or have an elected official as a family member.
bad,Its horrible. wont ever go back. You have to work 10 hours straight with 2 15 mins break and one 30 min break. You have max 30 seconds to collet each item
bad,"As a driver doing 140+ parcels a day and racking up 12/13 hour days then getting told bring back more then 6 parcels and ill be sacked, you get where im coming from. I could not find an address once so inputed that i could not, after also ringing the customer.  Just to have amazon ring me and tell me ro reattemted it. I explained to them (well there indian call centre) the situation,  but he persisted that i must go back. To them they just want it done regardless of time or reasons. I once got in trouble for bringing back multiple parcels for businesses.... on a sunday. Amazon did not accept places being closed on a Sunday as an reasonable excuse. STAY AWAY!!!!"
bad,"Working for Amazon delivery is a demoralising experience. "
bad,"Managers were not helpful in ways that they should have been, They were rude to there employees and not good customer service."
bad,The GSP1 plant shows more favoritism with in the management and leadership positions. This plant doesn't care about the safety of the employees when inclement weather is known about. This company classifies a warehouse associate in the same category as a cashier and basis the pay by a cashier's pay. This is the worst company to work for they treat you like you are in high school still.
bad,"Words fail to describe,how bad Amazon are.Just a shockingly bad place to work,with long hours,terrible pay.Amazon have no idea of how to treat people properly."
bad,"greedy company that could care less about their employees. You are not recognized for your hard work unless you are a 'favorite'. Any questions regarding your time, actual position, holiday hours, etc. no one seems to have an answer. (Management tells you to ask human resource, human resource tells you 'ask your manager'). Hourly quotas which some are seriously unrealistic. All Work stations have something wrong with them."
bad,worest place I have ever worked bad management no communication no trust would not recommend anybody work at amazon
bad,not enough pay for work and the decade we are living in. Made more money an hour in 1996
bad,AMAZON.com does not care about its employee's they are more worried about making 54.3 million dollars a day. They are not organized they don't tell you the truth about working there. They cycle through people every 5 months. THEY OVER WORK AND UNDER PAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  They are a very greedy company to work for. The employyes are timed while they go to the bathroom they time every minute of the work day. They are not a gay friendly company to work for!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I would not recomend AMAZON to anyone ever. A frind worked there with me for 5 months theywere fired for doing the job of 3 people but becasue they were not told by a manager to do the extra work. theywere  fired for going above and beyond......... The managers do nothing but walk arond all day with a laptop and if they are asked a question they do not know the answers to anything they say ill get back to you but blow you off and avoid you....
bad,"These guys hiring bar claims they hire better people every year but its just the opposite."
bad,"- von der ersten bis zur letzten Minute wird man beobachtet und kontolliert"
bad,i think this jobs is easy the people are respectful and helpful finding everything is easy
bad,"Very poor leadership, very disorganized, delay in paychecks and direct deposit."
bad,"war nur Aushilfe-schlechtes Klima der MA untereinander,eben Amazon"
bad,No advancement opportunities. No raises. If you was not in the in crowd then you were out. Told everyday that you can always be replaced. Made physically ill by all the stress. They want only temps. Was wrongfully terminated according to the Unemployment office.
bad,"I was under paid, not paid for holidays, There working conditions are the worst I have ever worked in. There breaks are terrible having to walk 10 minutes of your break and having to leave 5 minutes early to clock back in so your 30 minute break is really 15 minutes."
bad,Disgraceful place. Hated it. It's like being in a prison. They set you up to fail. The system doesn't enable you to work effectively nor efficiently. 3 strike system is inhuman and should be abolished. Put me off amazon full stop. Left there and told them where they could stick their trolley!
bad,"I've worked here for 1.5 years. There is a lot of favoritism. Unbelievable turnover."
bad,"Where do I begin?"
bad,I really enjoyed working there. Kindle is a cool device. The product is a good balance between open source and privately developed technology.
bad,"Once you walk through the doors at an Amazon Fulfillment Center you give up your rights as a human being and are forced to desperately fight for your job. EVERY DAY. If you manage to get a handle on the fast-paced, constantly monitored warehouse you should NOT try and give them any more than the bare minimum because once they find out you are a good worker they exploit you until your body begins to break down and you are forced to quit your job. Only the strongest people who are willing to be thrown around in the hopes of getting a promotion are able to survive in that abyss. They aren't flexible, HR is abysmal, they don't care about individual rights and will force a person to either loose their job or permanently damage their body trying to make rate. Employees are sad shells of the people they were before Amazon, that being said, they are some of the greatest people you will meet. The only reason I kept going to work was so that I could see my friends, they make it bearable. Amazon is not a decent job and it isn't worth trying to make a couple extra dollars an hour, trust me, I ended up giving them my ability to walk when I get old."
bad,Not a stable job always laying off. This would be a great job if they didn't do any layoffs. on a regular basis
bad,"Treated employees like cattle, no chance for advancement, managers had never done the job they were hired to manage and totally clueless, favoritism is rampant and obvious among employees."
bad,travailler pendant 3 mois mai j'ai du arreter car il a vraiment trop de cadance et quand sa va pas les manageur bouste encor plus
bad,"très mauvais entreprise je la déconseille a tous, aucune consideration, mauvaise rémuneration, ne pas avoir peur de marcher,"
bad,Poor treatment of associates. Overbearing with rates and production quotas. good opportunity for advancement.
bad,Don't work here unless you like being micro managed. The most enjoyable part of the job was leaving it at the end of the day. The hardest part of the job not hurting some of those managers.
bad,The expectations were not reachable. The management was poor.
bad,Worst job i ever had.  No respect for workers.  Too many flaws.
bad,i had a great time working in a bussiness with so much customer experience.
bad,I recently was fired by Amazon because I was injured on the job. They had video of the incident and I reported it right away. They denied my workers compensation and then fired me. I tore my rotator cuff. They have outrageous standards. They tell you before they train you that Amazon standard is X and then when they train you they expect you to ignore X and do Y. Which is negligence on their part. I could handle the hours even though it left me to drained to do anything else throughout the week. Management lies to you to get you to sign papers and never do they give you copies of write ups. Co-workers there are always trying to take credit for things they didn't do just to get a little recognition. I think the only enjoyable thing about working there is the fact that you do earn personal time off fairly quickly if you are a full time employee
bad,"well i am disabled and in a wheelchair, when told i use the bathroom to much and maybe this job wasnt for me after i was hired and them knowing im disabled"
bad,"travail très physique et peu reconnu, ambiance à l'américaine"
bad,They will lie to you and tell you it's such a great place to work and put on this great presentation.  But once you get inside it's just one step above slave labor.
bad,"There is no room to advance, or little. warehouse work isnt bad."
bad,"Its a great seasonal job around the holiday's , but that's it."
bad,"This was a very different  job then I am use to, It was also done on a seasonal basis. Everyone is pushed to work has fast has you can so a typical day there is work hard and fast, very quiet except for all of the machines running . Most of the Management was very helpful. You only see co-workers in passing or on breaks they are hard workers no one really gets to know anyone. The fast pace for 12hrs. is hard to get use to."
bad,your hard work gets rewarded with a lot more of it. but at least they pay you.
bad,The company focuses on productivity. There was not much motivation as being an employee of the compan. Be prepare to stand all day there is no sitting down at Amazon. The breaks are short where you get two 15 minutes break and one 30 minutes lunch. You cannot be a minute or you are up for termination. Leave your cell phones behind or you are terminated. Make productivity or your teminated. Make sure you make it to work on time or your terminated. Do not take to long using the bathroom or your terminated.
bad,A paycheck is the only thing anyone works there. They talked down about you and to you.
bad,"Role & Responsibilities:"
bad,short breaks demanding work no value of workers. easily fire people with no regards. you walk around all day doing the same thing while every manager consistently threat the worker for no reason to get them fire due to over hires
bad,"I truly hated this job from start to finish,you were treated like cattle,management were essentially bullies who set unrealistic targets.Your rota was changed without warning or consultation."
bad,"A typical day working for Amazon's grocery delivery service requires most people to be able to walk over 10 miles per day in low temperatures. "
bad,"Port de charges tres lourdes"
bad,"going in and picking item and packing."
bad,not a great work inviroment the company is a hard working place it is idle for having fun or talking management is ok the only good thing about amazon is the people you meet there very nice
bad,There your talked to any kind of way they don't appreciate their employees. you work like a slave and the brakes are to short. there is no enjoyable part of this job but the pay.
bad,"A truly terrible place to work,with more rules than the British army. This company does not ask for you to do overtime it tells you ,compulsory overtime and then it increased your day from 10.5 to 11.5 hours per day all for just above the minimum wage."
bad,"i Feet had blisters by my third day,management was rude an disrespectful"
bad,"The worst place i have worked in my life. Management are nowhere near flexible. The place is run on a point system which is bollocks."
bad,"A day working at Amazon is one of the most trying things that I have ever done. The fast paced environmental targets are not so unrealistic to reach like everyone in the workplace thinks. Because of there Friends and Family policy's on employment recruiting, they end up with Team Leaders and Ambassadors picked or elected for all the wrong reason's. It doesn't matter how hard people work or better  themselves. It's a strange Regime where if you try to complain to management about laziness and having to work so hard in order to keep a job you lose it. The best part of the job was listening to most of the workforce that I had the pleasure to work with on there gripes. It's a part of working in Amazon ED 14 if you are not a part of the ""Poorly Managed Place"" by the way of the lazy. Then you are out the door if you are not prepared to carry the lazy, and keep quiet about it.   ""WHAT A STRANGE PLACE TO WORK"". Must have been doing something write to have lasted 6 month's."
bad,the is good but management is not good they will treat as a dog like you have to die for it like they don't care what happens to you but you have to keep the company running
bad,"Is I would go to the pack house get our guns and trolleys and start scanning the shelves for items to place into a box and be put onto a belt to go to the packers."
bad,pt picker packer shipper work was hard but fun at the same time
bad,"here i was an order rebinner. i learned how the computer systems worked, how a customer would recieve their order and how the orders came in. "
bad,extremely stressful and low pay. Very stringent attendance policy.. many days with no work.
bad,"When I first started I LOVED this job. Most of the co-workers are awesome. Just under 7 months later, I absolutely hate my job. I wake up mad knowing that I have to go. This is when I finally noticed that you are not allowed to have teamwork. They tell you to work as a team but really they don't want you to. You are only to care about you, yourself and forget eveyone else. It is the first co-ed prison. Sadly, prisoners have more freedom than we do. God forbid you speak to one of your co-workers. The managers talk down to, belittle you and act as if you are beneath them. They don't focus on an associates strengths, they focus on their weaknesses, setting you up for failure. And watch out because if the higher ups see you as a threat (as in, taking their position) they will target you to get you out the door. You get wrote up for everything (helping a co-worker, missing rate, points, etc.). It's very hard, fast paced work which doesn't really bother me. What bothers me is the way associates are treated. Another example is that I had a family member pass away. 3 days later (haven't even had the funeral yet) I was being barked at about providing proof that there was a death in my family. No ""are you ok"", ""how you holding up"", ""is there anything we can or do you need anything"". All I heard was ""we need proof today or you're gonna get pointed for the days you missed"". The pay is very little for the work you do and the treatment you get. Breaks are 15 minutes (actually 10, you have to be back to your station before the first bell rings or you get written up) and lunch is only 30 min"
bad,"A days work is hard, face paced environment. I did not learn any thing that I did not know already. Management sucks they don't know what is going on half the time. The only good thing is my co-workers. The hardest part of the Job is everything they work you to death for no money at all. The most enjoyable part is my days off cause I am not there. They do not pay at all but want to work you to the bone literally. Anyone who says they like it, love it do not believe them at all. "
bad,i only worked at this company for a short period of time as it was only a temporary position for over the festive season. a typical day i was given a set amount of items to collect and return to the packing line where others would pack up the items and send them to the customer who had ordered it from the internet.
bad,"hard work,interesting and something different everyday. the people I work with are great."
bad,Great Money But Terrible In Letting Employees Know Things To Do
bad,hated it. treated like slaves. a guff job avoid if possible.
bad,"My son was diagnosed with a heart condition on January 21st and most of our time since then has consisted of doctor appointments and trips to Pittsburgh to see specialist, etc...."
bad,Management in Lab126 is heartless and absolutely pathetic.
bad,"Worst company I've ever worked for, long hours and shifts for bad pay. Your not allowed to talk to co-workers next to you. The management treat you like dirt. The hardest part of the job is standing static for 12 hours, there are no enjoyable things to mention about this job or company."
bad,"Terrible management, very unorganized company. Managers are less knowledgable than the associates."
bad,I been working for Amazon for long time it's easy place to work but managers and leader ship is week and unfair to the other workers co-workers were ok the most enjoyable part of the job was doing nothing all day long
bad,This company sucks and they discriminate! The workers are lazy and disrespectful. The most enjoyable part of this job is clocking out!
bad,i learned there how to work with team.manage the time. there is co-workers are very helpful.
bad,Typical day: Boring and predictable
bad,"I don't know how else to describe it other than a loser company. During the application process it was apparent. They don't take into consideration if you have a school schedule or have another job. They just dictate what hour and days you will work. They should take tips fro UPS, who offer scholarships and adjust work hours to accommodate school. This is obviously more humaine. The word is already spreading very rapidly that Amazon is an awful employer; before too long no one will want to work there and then we will see how they are able to process their orders. I am also looking for other places to shop on-line and will encourage others to do so as well."
bad,"Management is horrible. They consider you as a number. They say safety is their first priority but anything outside work is not to their concern, I was sick and in the hospital for 2 days and I called and informed them. They still put me down as a no call/no show. Do not work for them at all."
bad,"We did exercises before we started, as if we needed it! We exercised all day long, at least as a picker. Grab a scanner, walk as fast as possible to locations, pick items, hurry to next location, rush to next one, place totes on conveyor, grab more totes, try to get around workers to get to your locations, repeat, repeat...take short break, back to picking, walk from wherever you are at noon sharp, punch clock, go through security, go to locker, try to eat, go to restroom, and you better be back by 12:32pm, exercise again, more of the same, 15 min. break(more like 10 or less), continue picking until exactly 5:30pm sharp, punch out, back through security, locker, walk some more to your vehicle, fight traffic, go home, die, and do it all over again the next day! During your shift, you may be stopped by a supervisor(further destroying your already below their standards pick rates, God forbid you have to go to the restroom), given a pep talk, scolding, warning, points, etc."
bad,"Rugeley, Staffs - Working conditions are poor there is no air-con and in the summer people were passing out. The feedback if you make a mistake is to make you feel like you are walking on egg-shells and the money they pay you for the work you do is a joke ! ! !"
bad,"Working through a temp agency during the holiday season, not personally afraid of hard work however it seemed that the group of temps I was with where totally adrift. Most of the time when you had questions about procedure or times clock in clock out etc, you couldn't find supervisor whether it be Integrity or Amazon who knew. Integrity staff and Amazon staff did not communicate with each other."
bad,Wasn't a very nice enviorment to work for.
bad,My typical day at work was come in at 630 punch in and get into or huddles and get our report and were to go in the building for the day. Then we go to that part of the warehouse and start our job scanning products into the correct bins and shelves. Then we would take our 15 minute break at 10 then get our half hr at 12. then we would get another 15 at 3 then finsh the day at 5. I learned at amazon how to use pallet jacks and how to use hand held computer to scan stuff into the building. Managment in my eyes were really poor because if you asked them for help with something you didnt understand they really never helped you. It was like they didnt care they only bothered with you if you didnt make your goal times. Co-workers werent friendly either if you asked them for help they would just look at ya like your crazy. The hardest pasrt of the job was around college time t o make your goals putting away all the college books into there right shleves because there was no room for all the books. My most enjoyable part of my job getting my paycheck.
bad,3 Year tenure employee terminated for attendance and being late from breaks ranging from 30-52 seconds.
bad,"No heat in winter, no air in summer. Same product spread all over warehouse. Management was people that had never worker in production."
bad,At amazon I would go in stand on the same spot all day packing items.
bad,"Amazon will set you up to fail. Falsely accuse you of things when you were just doing your job. They harrass, bully and discriminate against there employees. This company like most has core values. But I was told that the core values (which more then likely were created by amazons founder Jeff Bazos) mean nothing and that all companies have them but no one follows them. Amazon also cheats the system, when it comes to cycle counts and following sorbainoxy/socs compliancy rules. If your boss (area manager) doesn't like you that person will do anything under the sun, including lying to get rid of you. Management needs to get into the same book, then work on getting on the same page. You do not learn alot at amazon because there training is very lacking, and once you do learn anything they change it and usually do not tell you so that you will fail. Concerning the protests in Seattle WA amazon is not installing air conditioning in its warehouses. Instead they are considered climate controll systems. All they are ment to do is try to keep the temp and humidity below 90 degrees. This way they do not have to give there employees an extended 5 minute break. The reason they are not considered air conditioning units, is that amazons warehouses are not insulated. Amazons main interest is to have only temporary employees rather then seasoned, trained, reliable and hard working amazon employees with benifits. Amazon in general is not a very people friendly place to work."
bad,"The working conditions alone were terrible. Management had no clue what they were doing, and that includes upper management."
bad,Place you will ever work in your life. If you're ready to be used and thrown away. Work for Amazon. The only ones who really survive all the kids. And that's the ones they promote. So So pucker up. Buttercup Because they are generally. Racist and culturally discriminant.
bad,"A massive company that it is up its own backside. Everybody hears of the way staff are treated badly but in reality the managers are treated worse. They are expected to be contactable 24hrs a day, the work life balance is poor. Good work is not recognised and rewarded."
bad,"This place is horribly ran and it starts at the top. They will overwork you due to the fact that multiple people call out daily. Everyday something went wrong, which you just get used to it being that way. You will be sore and experience a lot of aches and pains due to the company not providing proper equipment for the job at hand. This might be the worst job experience ever honestly..."
bad,You are not appreciated and are just a thing creating numbers for them. They don't reward the people who work hard.10 hours of work and it's never enough.
bad,"They promise the world and carnt deliver "
bad,"No cumplieron en nada las características del trabajo, un engaño total desde la entrevista grupal"
bad,Ambiente di lavoro non consono alle esigenze di vita
bad,Been on different teams and experienced almost identical alarming issues. Management gets chosen based upon timing and not skill set. Toxic culture is promoted and lower level voices are silenced. HR feigns empathy while figuring out a case against you to silence you. My manager assaulted someone multiple times and upper management never turned in paperwork. Was pushed out eventually.
bad,"No time to comprehend what you are doing, treated you as a machine.No training given, but excepted you to meet quota of scanned items, when the supervisor or team lead could not even meet quota."
bad,I've had the misfortune of working for this company for 2 years now. They over work you to death for peak. Ours went against company policy and lasted 2 months of non stop 55s hr weeks. They changed schedules and forced people to work days that were not in their contract and all for not because our shelves were to full for us to to place any more product. Yet we were forced to come in and work 2x the company standard peak time.
bad,High turnover rate of hire and firing. does not care about employees we are numbers to them. Will fire you for any reason. Poor management in the company.
bad,"like the title says, those who brown nose the managers get the best ords and no surprise always have the highest production rates. I would pick up and order early while we did our morning warm ups and it was always full of multiple duplicate item orders while the rest were single item pulls. in order to meet minimum production goals you have to essentially run down the aisles while mainlining caffeine. Pay is just barely above minimum wage. There is a reason they have such a high turn over rate."
bad,they treating you like a slaves and very easy to get fire from amazon no union nothing but great pay and benefits. you can try for yourself. so you know
bad,"Too many unqualified managers, way too many unattainable rules, ie* zero grace period regarding break schedules. They threaten termination if you’re ONE MINUTE LATE. They penalize you for not hitting your “scan rate” even though there might not be any product on the line to scan, you still get held accountable. HR is nonexistent and the associates they do have are highly incompetent."
bad,"travail avec stress, on vous lache sur le poste sans formation,instructors  qui jouent les coqs, qui se prennent également pour les PDG, pourboire comme salaire , surveiller sans cesse, rien de bon, vraiment ,entreprise a fuir!"
bad,You get paid you do your job and that s it. No easy job only the customer counts. Lots of motivation yes but only to drain more for you. Rules changes and you just have to adapt.
bad,"poor management & training, very unfriendly, quick to write up or penalize, not enough break time or time to go to the restroom or get water (like when your line is out of water all night long!) since you have to wait in line for everything, no clear instructions, too much mandatory OT when someone schedules their life around a 3-night work week; lied to; feels like a top heavy bureaucracy; no clear way to get in touch with managers or call with an issue; high pressure but no real training; can be brutal on the hard floor for 12 hours with not enough breaks or water and no one to relieve you for the restroom; not a happy, friendly place and you feel like you're going to get into trouble all of the time; told you're not working OT but then it is put on your schedule and you get points for missing; having to spend your already small amount of time off being on the computer for Amazon business...too many different programs that you have to sign into to communicate and you shouldn't have to use your own time to take care of Amazon business."
bad,They give a 15min break which takes 10mins to get to the break room. Also they time you if you take more than 5minutes to go to the toilet and come back.
bad,Work culture is very abusive and intimidating. Allergic to trade unionism. dishonest communication with junior employees. Harsh and difficult complaint process.
bad,Es wird erwartet 160 bis 200 Pakete am Tag zuzustellen. Also sind es 2 Minuten pro Paket in eine 8 Stunden Schicht. Jeden Tag Überstunden. Die Meisten davon werden nicht bezahlt.
bad,"Bad company , only hard physical work. I didn't like working there. They fired me even when I was doing hard and job well. The managers are bad."
bad,"Work extremely hard, you have NO LIFE. They only only concerned about numbers, safety is suppose to be important as they preach but they can careless. You walk in with no energy you leave with no energy. Management is thrown in positions with no sense of how to talk, or treat employees. You get hired for 4 days and they change it to 6 and you work 11 to 12 hour shifts and they treat you as if you HAVE NO LIFE OUTSIDE OF AMAZON"
bad,"do not work here especially seasonal you’re just another number to them they don’t care about you. the management is awful, and the conditions are awful."
bad,"absolute worst place to work at, management says team work is important, but then you get yelled at by team leaders saying you have a lot of ""idle time"" because you helped someone else to lift heavy boxes. If you explain to them why you have the idle time they just say you're talking bs. "
bad,"Crazy targets"
bad,"Worst work culture you can imagine"
bad,"My experience working at Amazon is the worst ever. I won't recommend others to work there as Manager or team lead they only want numbers and take credits. The HR also doesn't care how employees report of their absence. We are always marked for anything negative and not positive things. Long working hours and not enough breaks. All team leads need to be fire I would say. don't work there "
bad,"Pessima esperienza, i manager favoriscono quelli che sono nelle loro grazie"
bad,B E W A R E   very difficult work environment. No structure or real guidance at all…BEWARE...not a good work environment.  There is no guidance from most of the leadership/management.  You will work VERY hard.  You are responsible for your own growth with no direction.
bad,"Amazon as a whole is a very good company, however, depending on the location there are many flaws. I work at the ATL8 location and management isn't the greatest; there is a lot of miscommunication within the leadership team, a lot of micromanagement, and a lack of concern for the employees. The staff over emphasizes safety, which being in a warehouse, is understandable, but to the extent that staff isn't showing care for the employees. Employees also aren't very well informed of the working conditions, which include intensive operation of power industrial trucks that aren't always safe."
bad,It is not worth it. Don't even think about moving up because it won't happen from inside of the building unless you like kissing up to people. There is no work life balance and they certainly don't care about situations concerning children.
bad,"PLS read this, I’m trying to save you. This is the worst job I ever had. The building is a year old. All the management is new and they have NO idea what they’re doing. They say they care about you but they don’t. I talked to so many people there to get their opinions- everyone hates it there. There’s never enough scanners to go around. I asked countless times for assistance in something I was not trained for, they say “yeah of course I’ll get that for you” and they don’t. There are no interviews to get the job and that sounded great to me at first but then you realize this means you are surrounded by the laziest, most incompetent people you’ll ever come in contact with. If you’re a hard worker like me, you’re constantly (for 10 hours) working as fast as possible, not being able to go to the bathroom or take a second to breathe to make up for the fact that everyone around you is doing absolutely nothing, just standing there talking. Then things would get so backed up that management would come by and yell at us. Everything is so unorganized and crazy. There’s a reason they have new hires coming in every single week, because people quit every single day. Why? The place is absolute H E L L. The workers who are required to wrap my pallets are nowhere to be found. I have to do it myself. Save yourself from this job. It seems awesome, great benefits, great pay. Nope. I worked so hard every day and no one cared, it’s really sad. You couldn’t pay me all the money in the world to go back to that place. I sincerely hope this helps. Please don’t work at this location."
bad,"amazon, though it pays well, is a pitiful place to work. they don't call them ""packing quotas"" instead they are ""packing goals,"" based on the fastest packer. if you don't hit the same goal or more, during a specified amount of time, too many times, you are most likely going to get fired for being to slow."
bad,I don’t recommend this job the breaks are short and they don’t have an elevator for associates the mangers aren’t understandable you can’t take your phone on the floor even if you have kids to worry about
bad,"Management doesn't really acknowledge the staff who work for them, they want you to work fast and if you are a minute late you have 3 chances then you will be fired. Some warehouses are way out and took 4 busses (2.5 hours) to get to. I heard of people getting let go if they didn't meet targets but they didn't say anything to you if you worked hard and fast. They always ask who wants to go home early and only get paid for the hours completed or to use a holiday to leave as they don't have much work for people that day. They were strict on health and safety which was a good thing, they had people walking round watching how you picked up items to make sure you did it correctly. No appreciation or job satisfaction but on the positive if you work really hard and pick items to health and safety spec, nobody has any problems with you."
bad,"Typical day at work was suposed to be routine, but it was not ever."
bad,"I got an injury and it affected my ability to do my job. Amazon would not accommodate anything for me due to my injury. It was still expected of me to keep up to the standards of unpacking. There were no exceptions to be made no matter what. They told me I had the choice to take medical leave or continue working (which would then risk me losing my job because I couldn't work as fast I was required to work). Personally, I felt I was forced to take medical leave. I ended up quitting because Amazon decided that they had no place to put me that would accommodate my injury. And I didn't believe that. "
bad,"Es gab eine Ausbildung die nicht ausreichend war. Es wurde von einem mehr Verlangt als man physikalisch leisten konnte, für ein nicht existierendes Gehalt."
bad,"Work is repetitive. They monitor every single thing you do, from how productive you are to how many times you go toilet. It's absurd. "
bad,"At interview and induction and even before all that you are told of the 'great earnings' you can earn doing this job. But they fail to tell you about the weekly deductions they take off your pay. They take 200 a week for van rental, 50 a week towards the van 'deposit' which totals 1000 and 40 insurance. So basically 290 a week is gone from your weekly wage. They only pay 18p a mile for fuel aswel. Wish I'd never of started this job and it won't be long before I quit. Deliveries are not local what so ever. I've been working in Scarborough and the van uses half a tank of diesel in one day. Putting more money than I'm earning just to even do the job"
bad,Whatever you heard about Amazon is true. There will be moments where you’d experience a self-fulfilling prophecy and it’d be no surprise at all. Make your money and go home.
bad,amazon will fire you as quick as they hire you. they treat employees  unfair. made me feel like a robot instead of a living breathing human being. i will never work nor will i shop with this company again.
bad,"Disliked it, to the put I went each day thinking it would be a better day but no I ended up leaving it’s very stressful..............................."
bad,I must have spent most of my time going from one place or another instead of working in one spot. Always moved around no more then 20 minutes at a time when we'd move again. Be on one side of building and move to other. Took longer to get there when we'd move again.
bad,"Skarżyłem się na ból i zły stan zdrowia. Ignorowano mnie, po czym zabrano mnie łaskawie do lekarza. Gdy zemdlałem to dowiedziałem się że spałem i że mam wybór między dyscyplinarką albo za porozumieniem stron. Wymyślają jakieś chore normy. Jak nie wyrabiasz normy to zamęczą cb psychicznie. Jakieś idiotyczne kolczingi gdzie tylko stresują człowieka."
bad,"This is a horrible place to work.... people are treated like they are robots, management only cares about ‘being number 1 In the region’, they constantly talk about safety & rotation, it’s only talk.... the warehouse is filthy!!! They raised their minimum starting wage, but took away ALL OF THE Incentives and bonuses."
bad,"Good starting pay, but no room to move up, management sucks, no life balance."
bad,"Bad company, bad management. Modern day slavery. Avoid at all costs. The company treats you like a robot and not a human they don't care about you as long as they hit their targets."
bad,"Amazon has a high-stress work culture devoid of any human touch whatsoever."
bad,"Work is too hard for what they’re paying. Plus is benefits first day. Other than that, I hated every second of it. Supervisors never communicated with me, other than to tell me I did something wrong only being there literally not even a week."
bad,not Worth it .. don’t treat you like they say and always worry about rate that’s not right...............No time for family makes you work to hard for what they pay
bad,Really just don't. it seems ok but one way or the other you will regret it. For them people/employees are disposable all that matters is getting packages to customers.
bad,"It’s actually a contractor under Amazon called PLO Logistics, it sucks! Poor management and he steals your hours of pay! Amazon should look into the contractors they hire to represent their names! This company is all unorganized to be open for a year! I don’t see how they renewed his contract! Company doesn’t care about safety of employees as long as you get the packages out!"
bad,"I would NEVER tell anyone to work for this company. By far the worst company I have ever worked for. No structure,no management,confusing job duty instructions. Also people are not treated like people. They are treated like a production number and then that number dwindles or begins to fade from being over worked."
bad,"Salaire très faible pour un travail de nuit sachant qu’il n’y a aucun avantage, aucune prime, ils embauchent des gens pour les mettre en fin de mission 2 semaines ou un mois après."
bad,"Die Führungskräfte sind unfreundlich, der Druck gewaltig. Man wird behandelt wie ein Roboter."
bad,"Lifeless, stressed environment that sucks your creativity out the window. Managers have a fear of firing or they are just plain mean. Robots are appropriate for this work."
bad,"The worst place for a job. Even if you are employed as a permanent one, you may be sacked anytime for nothing. Long hours, to long for a working day,, even if you work only 4 days a week. This is good only for temporary job. If you look for a permanent one, Indeed will help you :-)"
bad,"Amazon is FULL of drama its very stressful for me this place is not worth the time or money, that you get paid there. And it can even be a VERY hostile environment"
bad,"I did a 1000+ packages a night, while others just sat around on there phones, so called ""ambassadors"" who got paid more! It was far. Took 1 hour 1/2 to get there"
bad,"Not a good place to work at all. I quit after two weeks. First of all, there is no public transportation or a employee bus. You have too walk for 10 hours straight, and if you don’t find a spot for a item you are scanning within 3 minutes the mangers will come and question you. If you call in sick, you’ll get 1.5 point. If you have 6 you get fired. Break time is really only 20-25 minutes. They have like 10 security guards there acting like it’s a airport If your on the 3rd or 4th floor you will likely miss some time of your break."
bad,"Managers who knows nothing about work explain you how to do it, Lying all the time about expected targets always rising the bar higher than it supposed be,  just to show how good they are while they are doing nothing just using their team leaders to work hard for them, associates are working under pressure all the time for little money, no good"
bad,Amazon is horrible you have to be certified to do everything there open doors change trash just to name a few I'm not working for Amazon I'm filling out a app for correction officer not Amazon have a nice day stupid app
bad,"I worked there for a month and everytime I tried to move up and work something different, the managment told me to wait, or that they didn't know when I could move up, or some other excuse. I got really fed up with the lack of comunication in the building, even though they are provided walkie-takies. Very Long and boring work days. I would see others moving up in the ranks that got hired weeks after me."
bad,This place was held to work for! Do not go their management is horrible. I was sexually harassed and they did nothing about it. You are forced to do 125% or more when you're picking items off of racks from one side of a warehouse to another side of a warehouse. You are monitor for bathroom breaks and they have GPS trackers on your scanner and questioned you constantly about everything. You will hurt your back you will hurt your feet and you will be in the worst pain ever this job is horrendous and they do not care about their employees because we are all replaceable and the pay really sucked when I work there now it went up some but they treated us like trash
bad,"I am working as delivery driver in there, we hane no brakes if you want to finish in 9 hours, we have 240-250+ parcels/day "
bad,"Amazon review was not the line of work I expected.  The work was very demanding with standing.  Was not allowed to move from the 5 feet of the line in which i worked.  Breaks was 10 minutes but break room was a 12 minutes walk so no way can make it to break room to even enjoy the break.  No food or drink allowed on the floor.  Everything to enter or leave the building was patted down by woman which was uncomfortable for me.  Felt almost like being a slave was not paid enough to be treated this way.  I have a medical condition that I need to eat or I have a drop in my sugar levels, this job would not allow me to eat even with my doctors note."
bad,Horrible place to work with ureasonable expectations with no work likfe balance. No care for workers only increase in peoduction daily. I would not recommend to anyone.
bad,Une entreprise qui ne roule que pour le profit au détriment de ses salariés. A fuir absolument
bad,"This was my first warehouse job and will be my last. I was there for 5 weeks. I got yelled at by other staff if I didn't move fast enough for them, and every week the manager threatened to fire me for not meeting productivity standards that were set before I was ever hired. To make it worse, my insurance cards didn't work. I paid money for an insurance I couldn't even use while I was working."
bad,"Contrary to popular opinion, Amazon is not the ideal place to work. Unless you enjoy working mandatory overtime on weekends and holidays. Most of the managers are hired straight out of college and have NO clue how to deal with people. Most of them couldn't manage their way out of a wet paper bag. and they don't care about you. All they care about is how much stuff is going out the door customers."
bad,"S L A V E R Y   H O U S E"
bad,"if you like to be out delivering over 150 stops a day and working til late night that job will be a perfect call,"
bad,"Even in slow days, if you don't make your quota you are reprimanded.  Breaks were pointless, as it took ten minutes to walk across the warehouse to get to the break area."
bad,"Amazon will eat you up and spit you out. The entry level jobs are treated like bodies to fill a quota. Entry level managers are teenagers fresh out of college who are ripped apart and quit within years. 1/10 might make it to the next level of the job, the rest find different things to pursue. "
bad,They have poor management skills you have manitory overtime every day you have to work can at a very fast pace and they are on you if u need to use the restroom
bad,"repetitive tasks for 10 hours non stop  mandatory overtime, long hours of walking or standing, squat, bending and scanning, at all bad place for work."
bad,I did not have a good work experience at Amazon. They are not invested in keeping and retaining individuals for employment. I do not recommend seeking employment at Amazon.
bad,"I was lucky enough to be privileged to quit my job but so many people there had no choice but to stay there and are constantly taken advantage of."
bad,"i worked here and injured my disk on my shoulder the day i reported to the infirmary i was fired. also ridiculous rule that every mistake you make you must stow 1k items correctly'while i was here i got a write up and challenged it since it was my 3rd one and i had been very careful and after an investigation they said the person who audits made the mistake, i was almost fired because they didnt bother to check before firing someone. i was supposedly fired because of that policy."
bad,"The pay was limited, and overtime was offered in the ad for the position, but not offered during employment in the quantity advertised."
bad,The place is not good to work everybody knows if u want a paycheck and want to get treated like   apply there u won't last very long I was discriminated I seen racism
bad,"10 hours of needing to scan 215 items per hour to make rate or a work area with no safety, limited access to coworkers for assistance and all boxes deemed too heavy for a single person to lift by Amazon's standards. In my time I literally had boxes fly off the conveyors because they were too heavy and cause other work hazards as well."
bad,was very excited to began working for this company always have loved Amazon and there products but I must say with all honesty this company cares nothing for there employees. you will never have just one assignment they move you around and around until they find something to have you do that they know you will fail and then as with me and numerous former hardworking and dedicated employees no matter how much you try or plead they just say we have to let you go your numbers are not 101% I had one day while training that I did not make the cut and the next week I along with 8 others were terminated then ask not to take it personal and that we could always apply again next year. Odds are you will be terminated before your 90 days.....good luck!!
bad,Worst employer I’ve ever worked for. Management has no clue. The only thing that matters are metrics. Welcome to the new world built by Amazon. Good luck.
bad,"Treated like a slave. All they do is pile more work and more work on you. Management are not interested in what you have to say. "
bad,Bad company to work for...they implement hostile work environments.....crazy managers.....their pay is a joke....the job is a joke.....you can make more somewhere else and work less....very stressful...
bad,"This company is horrible to work for, they treat people as one of the herd. Major favoritisms. Hard workers get treated poorly, while lazy people get ahead. They target and fire people with longevity, don’t offer any incentive to stick with the company. The way they handle time off, would sound freeing to most outsiders, until you realize how limited it truly is. You can bring up problems with management, and many people can bring up the same issues and nothing is ever done about anything. If you aren’t one of the favorites, you’ll never be heard. They don’t accept doctors notes, just an example as to why the time given isn’t so freeing, if you are sick, and don’t have time to cover being out, you either go to work regardless or lose your job. And explaining that in greater detail, so it’s understood, would take too much Soave here. Management assumes and treats all tier ones as if they are stupid. I could keep going but this review would get impossibly long. I’ll just add that I was harrassed and made fun of by a coworker for over a year and a half, went to HR about it at least 3 times, and nothing was ever done about it. They were a favorite, and I’m the opposite of favorite. The 15 minute breaks are really about 10 minutes long, because you are to be back at your work station, scanning by minute 15, and it takes at least 2 minutes each way walking, to get out of the building to break, and that is hustling. When you come back late, it starts a time off task timer, also included in this time off task, time, are any bathroom trips, during shift, or any reason that you might"
bad,"This workplace was terrible, long hours, short breaks, incompetent management with ever increasing and not achievable targets."
bad,"Bad tools, oppressive culture, cheap, lousy pay and benefits, small raises. I did meet some good people but didn’t compensate for how disappointing the work was."
bad,"If you are searching for a job, to improve your quality of life, provide for your families, hold your head up or be self independent. Dont work for Amazon as a Seasonal delivery driver. Why because they will use you until they get enough third party contractors to come in. I started with Amazon 11/18 as a Seasonal Delivery driver. Never called out, Never been late, Never got in a vehicle accident,My driving safety score was #1.Delivered all my packages up to 800, sometimes. Eventually we start hearing during our stand ups we should go work for the third party contractors making two dollars less for doing the same work, with the same intensity.  After 9 months of employment with Amazon,  Monday morning my entire crew was called into HR. and let go. Then the next cycle crew was called in to HR. and let go.  If this i sounds fare to you, work for Amazon"
bad,"Safety is supposed to be #1 but, safety is at the bottom of the list of functionality. Managers say to report ANY violations, NOTHING GETS FIXED! Don't trust anyone there, they will stab you in the back as soon as you walk away. Customers have no idea how their packages are treated before they get them. NEVER buy ANYTHING fragile from Amazon!"
bad,Working in Amazon warehouse is the worst job ever! I've work there few months and they treat the staff as a rubbish...................................
bad,I've worked at three Amazon warehouses and all of them are some of the worst places I have worked. Every warehouse has its goods and bads but Amazon hires new young people to be managers who never be a in a lead position before. They don't know how to treat people right. You ask them a question about the job and they say they will get back to you and it never happens. During the meeting someone will have an idea that has been said over and over again and management will say that's a great idea but nothing comes out of it. At the North East location is you are not a Picker you are treated like dirt.
bad,I’m a college educated individual with various experiences in various fields. It is very clicky at Amazon if you’re not friends with the right managers and supervisors there’s no way you can advance. Stay away horrible place work you like a slave
bad,Seriously! Don't work here! They're jackholes who don't care about your welfare at all! They run you ragged and 100% isn't nearly good enough for them. And when you can't keep up (it will happen) you're fired without warning!
bad,"This is a great place to work for if you do not want to feel appreciated. The managers are no good. How would you like to work somewhere for 10+ years just to have some 20 year old boss you around just because they got a degree? Pay gets maxed out, they took stock away. Breaks are 15 minutes but it takes 5 minutes to get to the break room and 5 minutes to go back. Lunch is 30 minutes but again, it takes 5 minutes to walk anywhere so basically you get a 20 minute lunch for working 10+ hours. Break rooms are always crowded so good luck if you have to heat your lunch up. When you get home from work you can barely stand from being on your feet all day. The pay and benefits are the only reason amazon still has employees. Who would turn down $212 a month for full medical, dental, vision, life, etc for a 5 person family?? That's the only reason."
bad,"Amazon is an often talked about place. Rumors of overworked associates, poor management, unfair practices, ect. Sadly, most of it is true. This is not a career job. They do provide assistance for college after a year (for select majors) so if you are young and need tuition assistance, it's a possibility. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and stay away. It's not worth it."
bad,All management cares about is getting packages delivered. They pack your van or car so full that it is dangerous to drive. You never get done at your scheduled time and they play favorites as far as who is going to get a rescue. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone that has a family.
bad,"Long hours in fluctuating conditions. Hot and cold vs freezing. Managers never say thank you, encourage you to do anything else and its hard to move from position to position. Not to include you are labor tracked as soon as you punch in so don't dare go to the bathroom or take an extra minute for lunch."
bad,"It's no mystery why Amazon is successful. Any company offering low cost shipping and bottom line prices on retail items with a massive reach will be successful. My pilot program was Highly successful, but it was still shut down after just one year. Amazon decided to contract an outside vendor in India and pays more for lower production, quality, and vastly inferior service. Just call customer service."
bad,"They will say they have 1000 jobs available but they probably rotate the same 300 positions 3 1/2 times according to their seasons. The floor managers speak down to you - they treat you like rats running on a wheel...10 min break and 1/2 hr lunch for a 10 hr shift - in the middle of the night."
bad,"They treated us like slaves, with no respect, and any opposition would result in termination. Very Long hours with little to no break time. Our time for bathroom breaks, lunches, and other necessary time was monitored and very limited."
bad,"A slave job.Period. All I will say. i DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS FOR ANYONE. Racist comments from sups. Not an american company,or i should say not for the average american citizen."
bad,Amazon is the devil you work long hours with few perks pregnant woman can't sit while working although it wouldn't impact their work. The company only allows one to excel if you are the type of person to Brown nose it's rarely based off of your true merit.
bad,"This job is extremely strenuous on the body. I was told that the hours were 8p-12a but we flexed up almost an hour every day which was a bummer. Getting off at 1am, have to wait for the shuttle and then drive home is too much when you have to be up at 6am for another job. The job is very robotic and I only recommend this job if you can't find anything else."
bad,"They treat you like slave,short breaks ,production rate is too high,i wont recomend anybody to work for them,bosses  disrespect you and push you to your limits"
bad,"STL4 is a horrible warehouse to work at. I was treated better at STL7. The night managers dont care about their employees and treat us like animals. We dont even have to right to our own voice here. We get a 10 min break, basically 20 minutes scan to scan."
bad,"Amazon is not a place to make your career, Unless you have a specific skill and background that they actually need.  Warehouse work is miserable, dirty and intolerable. There is no room for creativity or dissention.  If you question management's decisions you are marginalized and treated as an outcast.  Who wants to work for the richest man in the world only to see him flaunt his playboy lifestyle all over the media."
bad,"This is slavery."
bad,I've had a number of jobs throughout my life and being employed by Amazon as a warehouse worker was by far the worst job I've ever had. I have never in my life been as physically and emotionally drained as I was during the eight years I was employed there
bad,Worst place to work at! So much sexist and favoritism! You have 48 hours of paid time off for the whole 12 months and each shift is a 10-11 hours! Worst company ever
bad,Not much of a review their management sucks they work you like a slave and do not care about when you have personal issue arise at home they expect you to only miss four days of work the entire year
bad,"I would recommend never working for this company. They will train you for a part of inbound and never put you there. Then when they do put you there, you’re magically supposed to make rate. Your job lies in the processing assistant’s hands. If they do NOT feel like adjusting your rate, you’ll be written up. Then you’ll constantly be harassed about your rate. You’re also timed how long you took for a bathroom break."
bad,"Management and HR only cared about numbers nothing else."
bad,Lucky you if your manager has any idea about employment law or mgmt. And how about those Must Do things that aren't mandatory but are Heavily frowned upon? Smh..
bad,"Un management à la ramasse chez beaucoup, les managers se prennent pour des gens intouchables, j'en ai des pas mal à raconter sur cette boîte."
bad,"They hire mostly contractors, do not embolden diversity recruiting, create iron clad cliches of one denomination and race only but hide behind friendly key words, you have to use your own personal cell phone and don't get any reimbursement, out dated lap tops and after 9 months they might convert you to full time, reluctant to pay overtime but will overload your work days with a smile and several petty arguments over how you can do more with less, over sell and under deliver constantly, multiple hiring systems and 2,000 emails+ with all of your teams working remotely. Not the worst place but certainly not the best. Take it and keep on interviewing if you do come there. I could be wrong but honestly it was just disappointing."
bad,I'm a hard worker over looked by management now looking for fresh start. Management is organized and makes employees jobs more stressful. This company is not a good fit for someone interested in a career.
bad,"The worst company someone can imagine. Terrible work / life balance, no advancement. Young, unprepared 'managers' with shiny diploma but no morale or respect for others."
bad,"Amazon.com LLC is a company that I would honestly never work for again, regardless of what the pay is. Favoritism is running wild there, and if you are not one of the AM, or manager's favorites, you won't progress within the company. I've been there nearly two years, worked hard every night, and was never once offered a higher position."
bad,Don't make a career of working here. More work is required than what you are being paid. Very tiresome job and very very stressful. Don't waste your time.
bad,Horrible place to work...got sent home four times in one week after driving 40 min commute...just empty unless holidays..got hit by car in the parking lot..they were backing up as I was walking by...horrible how they handled that
bad,Management doesnt care about employees all they care about is the rates. If you dont stay at a pace you'll get wrote up. Management doesnt help out with problems. HR department always seems confused when you come to them with an issue or questions. I would not recommend anyone to this company. If you want to be belittled or walked on then this is the job for you.
bad,"Terrible place to work! Everyone looking out for themselves.  No one looks to coach, teach and mentor its employs.  The culture is toxic and that's why few people can tolerate working there any longer than two years.  The company knows it as well as that's how they structure your pay and incentives."
bad,Started out OK  Hours and work OK OK OK just overwork asking too much Would not recommend this place to anyone Shows a work with me but tender around and fired me for doing my job
bad,"You were always exhausted and the high demand with the quota on how many packages to fill. Not enough time on breaks, the extra overtime for no reason."
bad,"I worked at Amazon full-time for 2 years as a Field Engineer"
bad,"There are so many things that could be said besides, they suck.. Amazon does not care about anything but profits no matter what they offer in benefits. If they could operate without workers they probably would. Most of the managers rotate from city to city so they never really have a vested interest in their team. All in all, YUCK! Working there after awhile you understand why the turnover is so high. They work people thin and then justify giving them the boot because they aren't performing fast enough. That'll happen when you get used like a slave."
bad,per niente stimolante molto stressante e manager team lead incapaci e sopratutto chi veramente ci teneva al lavoro facendo dei sacrifici con produzione alta lo lasciavano a casa tenendosi solo extracomunitari raccomandati dai general manager
bad,"Everyday is about the same with little opportunity to grow. The work itself is not hard, but may be tiring. Poor management made it so a few people do most of the work while the rest relax or take it easy. In the end, Amazon does not care about you, so I advise people not to care about the company. They look at you like tools, and easily will even replace the best people. Where I worked, even HR was horrendous. They would not work with my school schedule and eventually I was fired due to schedule conflicts. If you like being treated as a slave, then you will love this job."
bad,"The worst workplace which I had in the last years.You have to work like a slave,to scan and to sort parcels,faster and faster untill you have no force.After 1-2 hours everything around is full of parcels and your is locked."
bad,Amazon is only for people who are only looking to make money in the short run. Micromanaging and questionable practices make working at Amazon unnecessarily difficult.
bad,"I have worked at this company for 2 years and during that time management at the warehouse level, plays favoritism, tells lies on staff when something goes wrong and is disrespectful in how they talk and relate to staff, they never take blame for their mistakes. Headquarters need to take a look into the work environment at these warehouses because if they do not managers are going cause them thousands in pay outs to employee in lawsuits. Amazon is a nice company to work for, I would assume mostly at the higher levels but down in the warehouse is not a good place to work. Your morale and rights as a worker will be trampled upon by direct supervisors."
bad,"You would think that $15 an hour wage would be enough to supplement your income. However, when they reduce your hours to 25 per week, you can't really make a living wage off of that. "
bad,"Job is no good.  Managers just go by the laptop. No consideration for employees.  Get the numbers, despite if you have to run over someone.  Breaks based on scanner, even if you are on the forklift across the warehouse, and have to park, and take off your gear."
bad,I was at Amazon for over a year and personally witnessed every bad stereotype of the company played out over and over. My goal at this point in my career is to never take a job with a company who has a culture even remotely similar to Amazon's.
bad,My son and I were both terminated from Amazon and they did not care. I’m currently living in my car because my badge was screwed up and the management did not take care of that so they don’t care what happens to you after you leave just so long as you’re gone
bad,"This is an awful place to work if you care about your development. The hierarchy in my group made zero sense. The three senior managers were not better than senior analysts. Zero people management and communication skills. Most of the managers were also pretty average. For the time I was there I didn’t see a single promotion but I saw lots of questionable hiring decisions. Most people are great at taking credit for your work if it’s good or back stabbing you if you make the smallest mistake. Most of the interesting work is done by outside service providers so the learning opportunities are very limited. Also, the company is hiring very heavily in India so most analysts and senior analysts have very low job security and will be outsourced soon. The pay is not great for the hours and stress people have to endure. The raises are symbolic and not enough to offset some of the bogus deductions Amazon seems to come up with every year. Stock price is done going up with the same pace so forget about all the get rich legends."
bad,"I have never worked for any company, in all my 50 years of job experience, that was so disjointed, unappreciative, and emotionally draing as this one. Right from the start I was given incorrect work hours, incorrect computer set up instructions, and absolutely no one who knew what was going on, nor was I provided any contact information to seek assistance. The first three days were a nightmare of confusion and frustration. It was downhill from there. Training modules were full of glitches and the expected pace to complete did not even allow for time to take notes. Six weeks of 8 hours a day watching training videos was not even enough time to comprehend and remember all the myriad hundreds (thousands) of different procedures, departments, and applications required to perform the job well. And then came Christmas and the accompanying onslaught of calls, mostly complaining about orders not delivered on time, orders missing, orders damaged, orders stolen by Amazon delivery driver (caught on home security camera). Customers SCREAMING, cussing, crying day after day. The closer to Christmas, the worse it got. By the way, this is the only job I've ever had to work in both Thanksgiving and Christmas. I think I spent 10 hours with my headset on, waiting for a call on Christmas day and only took four calls. Ridiculous. Then the post holiday enraged callers started. More crying, screaming, and cussing because the presents did not arrive before Christmas. And Heaven forbid your caller, after you've bent over backwards for them, apologized for whatever catastrophe occured, provided them"
bad,"Amazon refuses to promote within and hires kids straight out of college with no knowledge  of management, or amazon.. Employees get emotionally abused by Area Managers, and they are treated like robots and pieces of garbage instead of like human beings"
bad,You will only get full time hours your first two weeks of working. They over staff so they can send people home as soon as possible. Benefits suck as it costs more to use the health insurance than to just pay out of pocket.
bad,"When recruited you'll be promised the sky. Managers are in their 20's, for most this is their first job. They may know how to do their job, but certainly not how to manage people. Unless you start kissing bottoms, you'll end up doing the hardest work in the warehouse, while at the same time be labeled as non-compliant with the work, doesn't do the job or other malicious terms, you know why? Because management wants to promote their bottom-kissers, thus balancing their assessments by identifying the best employees (bottom-kissers) versus the worst employees (honest workers). Favoritism at its best!!! One example, they'll tell you not to make use of your cell phone at work and would write you up if they see you, but bottom-kissers can facetime while on the floor!!! Managers that are not involved in favoritism, are like they don't belong there. Don't engage and don't even care about promoting or motivating employees. If you think that by working honestly you'll advance in this work, you are living in a bubble and will only frustrate yourself and ruin your life. Managers here are evil at worst, and babies at best!"
bad,"Quite possibly the worst job I’ve ever had considering how much money amazon makes and how badly they treat employees and how awful the pay is . 15.00 an hour is not a lot considering amazon makes billions , the warehouse employees are the engine that run the company and also how amazon took away the stock / monthly bonus in the process. I worked overnights so shifts would start with 2-3 minutes of stretching and talking about numbers and then you get straight to it . It’s just 10 hours of silence , depression and misery with no fun and/ or social interaction. The break room is filled with silence , awkwardness and people second guessing what went wrong to end up at amazon .The people who work there are either brown nosers or just complete akward serial killer types . Management is usually 20-25 years old with a college degree and not a single day of real world job experience. Favoritism is not only real but it’s blantantly obvious and they don’t care. Either you’re an attractive girl or someone who’s cool with the manager for some reason and if you don’t have a degree that’s the only way to advance . Hard work at this place only gets you more hard work. Your life is gone working here because when you get home you sleep and go right back to it . Amazon doesn’t care about its employees. I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone even if your desperate, just go work somewhere else I promise it won’t be as bad . RUN DONT WALK"
bad,"Nobody cares about you ur just a number, i had my motoribikestolen from there care park and i worked nights and because i could not do one day due to busses and living 13 milesaway i was let go."
bad,"my manager was not always one to give us updates on how we were doing ,got computer writes that was told or shared with us to know about .people i work around we good. they treat u like a robot and forget humans make some arrors and when left go they tell u that the medical u payed into will stay in effect for  next few weeks till mext pay period but up and stop them 7 days before that ."
bad,Do not work there. One of the badest job I have ever done. They make you work like slave for very little money. Indian manager thinks this is like an India.
bad,"Out of the 7 managers I worked for, there was only one who treated me like a human being.  Managers are the only people who the company truly cares about and supports.  Everyone else is left waiting for the remaining scraps.  Managers would a rather save the company money than help us advance our careers.  I have a bachelors degree and many computer skills, but my manager still ignored my resume for 5 weeks.  There is no one to complain to, HR can not do anything, management only cares about their next promotion, and there is no Union to go to.  The work is mindless and empty, no matter what department.  I have never felt more empty and hopeless in my life, and sadly Amazon does not care, management does not care, HR has no power to help you.  Do NOT work here, unless you believe in the false propaganda on the walls.  There are better environments, better cultures, and better companies out there."
bad,"i had only worked at Amazon for a few weeks but in that time it was a horrible place to work, the managers had no respect for employees or team leaders, the job had no security whatsoever and they wouldn't allow persons to have time off due to family commitments"
bad,"Working at amazon was hard work as it was always busy, long hours nights, i didn't have such a good supervisor but i made good friends and gain really good experience."
bad,"Don't work here. Just don't. I was hired on before the Holiday season started and was told I would be a permanent employee following the probationary period. I received an email a week before my probationary period was completed telling me to please call HR as soon as possible before my next shift. HR has no sense of accountability and blocked my calls all weekend only to have me show up on my next work day to find out I've been laid off, and so was everyone else in my hiring group."
bad,horrible work environment where they run you like a dog and no matter what you do they always expect more. their ridiculous expectations wear you down and force you out. your nothing but a number and cheap labor and the will squeeze every bit of energy out of you and when you cant handle it anymore they find a way to get rid of you. it is a revolving door there and for good reason. most people dont stay long at this job. especially in the pick department.
bad,"I was a seasonal employee hired during the holiday season. After peak season ended we were given a chance to chose a different schedule to continue working there, so I did. Once you get offered to get trained in another area besides scanning and sorting packages, they can still let you go. I was trained in three other areas and they still randomly let me go. Also breaks aren’t really 15 minutes, they want you to take 2 and a half minutes to walk to the brake area and 2 and a half back to your work station so break is actually 10 minutes. They also can’t decide if to go for pace or “safety” unreal numbers they want employees to work at. It’s just a big company which hires like crazy than throws employees away right after they’re done using them."
bad,Dont do it.... they want you to be a machine... anything else is better... you will feel the greatest relief leaving there even without another job...
bad,"“Picking” sucks!"
bad,"They sweet talk to you with chance to get a permanent position, work is so repetitive and restricted, no music on the warehouse, get ready to bust your knees and foot, super short breaks and lunch, i got my locker on 1 side of the warehouse and where they send me is to the other side the ""15"" min break you use 5 to go and 5 to go back not enough, they only care about numbers, i think is only good for young people in vacation, or really need cash, because i don't see it as career, you can't make big money decisions with that wage, they look employees as slaves or robots."
bad,"Just started before Christmas 2018. No Organization, drivers management think that they can talk you like your a dog,you might get two days week and if you do ,its like they are (management)Throwing you a BONE . They text you between 21:00/00:00 saying text me with in 15 mins  if you want to work tomorrow ,(Throwing bone it you) .And then your still not Guaranteed work,Then your giving 150 to 235 Parcels to deliver, then constantly calling you pressuring you.It seem when they you work it's just enough to pay for your Van that not considering fuel £20-30 a day. and the self employed part is UTTER NONSENSE !!!"
bad,"amazon sucks. people are not friendly , job is too demanding , the pay is bad, and they will get rid of you as soon as they can. you will lose your health in there."
bad,"At Amazon, I did the same thing every day. I did have training but often got confused and was not sure where or how to ask questions. I did not work often because it was insanely boring."
bad,Low pay - not enough hours.   Not concerned about employees or problems within the company.   Bad to hire seasonal employees and not tell them they're not fulltime.
bad,"everyone is treated like a peon, a lot of favortisim , very high expections for a low wage,they think nothing of letting you go instead of cross training for an area that might be a better fit"
bad,"I hated working there, mostly because I felt unsafe on their ladders when I had to count and scan products. The breaks we did get started before we'd even left our stations, and ended sometimes before we'd even gotten outside to sit. It was rare to see daylight at all, and I was unhappy working there."
bad,The treat there staff like cattle. No respect and no security on the job front. A small toilet break can get you sacked.  Also the PMP Agency are absolute despicable human beings who delight in demeaning and degrading the workers. Constantly like to emphasis the authority over you and repeatedly told me that they can sack me when ever they like.
bad,"Ok, maybe the title is a bit much but when coworkers have to urinate in water bottles to avoid getting in trouble for using the bathroom, there’s a serious problem. The expectations are unrealistic for production and mandatory overtime is almost expected on a daily basis (especially during peak/holiday season). "
bad,working there is like beening watched liked your a prisoner and you are always being threaten about losing your job every day do not look for job security there and they will lie to you right in your face
bad,"Terrible place to work. You are given a cell block to scan products in all day for 10 hours a day, no music, no interaction. Heaven forbid if you make conversation with the person beside you. If you do your productivity will go down to less than %100 and you will be terminated. I would rather go to jail than go back to working for Amazon."
bad,"After being subjected to no running water in the Bathrooms nowhere to wash your  hands for the last 3 weeks  but in the break room sink, After half behind garbage training, After absent managers, supervisors, After High/ Drunk co-workers and After i complained that the  Music Blasting the N-word, Female Dogs and Vajayjay and Who's going to get Shot up shouldn't allowed to be played as the music is Racist, Sexist and Disrespectful. The next day they give me the axe or option to transfer"
bad,"Worst job I've ever had and so glad to be out"
bad,The company treats people as highly expendable. The stock award has a built-in plan to expect employee turnover within 2 years.  No appreciation or reward for working 14 hour days for months.
bad,The management like previously said treat you like dirt and without a permanent contract you are looked down on. The job leaves no time for anything social it's all work bad pay
bad,J’ai travailler 1 mois chez Amazon 1 mois ou on m’a pousser à bout l’es homme ne se prennent aucune remarque et les femmes qui font tout le travail très physique sans aide on leurs parle mal c’est inadmissible
bad,"If you really want to work in delivery, Amazon isn't a great idea. They'll keep you on and work you ragged for like a month before they stop calling you in for work. They're equipment is broken and the management doesn't really care about your well being."
bad,Employees nor managers last long here. Long hours on your feet. Not much room to grow. And if you try you better be prepared to work your butt off. You need points to move up. So if you want to move up learn as many different things as you can.  But I'm told they do have great benefits (I opt out)
bad,"The job was easy enough, but management made it harder. Requirements that shouldn't exist do, and work flow that should exist gets thrown out due to incompetent managers, and co-workers. If you have any work ethic at all, this is not the job for you; you will be over worked, and stuck watching everyone else walk around and talk, when you stop to go to the bathroom, you will get yelled at for not working, because the entire company runs on people like you... the 5%. Promotions at Amazon have nothing to do with how well of a worker you are, but in how well you can answer a few unrelated questions, and to even get that far, it is all about being ""buddy buddy"" with you area manager."
bad,"Hot stressful environment, the work was competitive and exhaustive. Very hostile environment. Very diverse culture. I hated the department I worked in which was very challenging. They fired people a lot. It was not a stable place of employment"
bad,"awful management awful workload awful attitudes awful working conditions awful hours awful pay awful accommodations awful company awful owner/ceo"
bad,"I worked there through PMP Recruitment last Christmas. I was coming back from lunch break when someone came running out of the aisle, round a blind corner & sent me crashing into the racking, which resulted in me seriously spraining my wrist. I reported it to the management, but they were only interested in whether i'd damaged any stock when i hit the racking. As i couldn't keep up with my targets due to my injury, i was given a warning that if my target figures didn't improve, i'd be ""let go'. I decided to quit the same day.Never, ever going to work for Amazon or through PMP again. No-one cares about your personal safety, all they care about is profit & making money off your hard graft. Absolutely disgusting attitude towards it's workers."
bad,"Work/life balance was never meet, even has to go doctors at one point but that didn't mater, not to amazon. To much was put onto you at all times, Im just thankful Im not there anymore."
bad,15 hr days on your feet the whole time. Job did not feel rewarding. Was consistently wanting managers to come up with improving the business without spending money. This was an impossible task since the equipment was out dated and would break down constantly. DID not get treated equally with other managers. I was not a go out and party with other managers type.
bad,"Never work for Amazon, ever. The management doesn't pay attention. Human resources couldn't care less about employees. You're over worked and under paid and they don't care about your opinions."
bad,"Management was a joke, not enough time given for breaks, hazardous to health, hours of working were ridiculous left next to no time to actually get home and sleep, Overall the worst place to work."
bad,judgmental and fast pace hard work with minimal pay and no organizational skills whatsoever to the company and its methods for job training and pay. Hard to speak to a ACTUAL PERSON if you have ANY AND ALL QUESTIONS.
bad,although the wage for a single teenager is great its not enough for someone with a family or a house to keep and the managers love to pick on you till your worn out but the staff at the bottom of the ladder temps and full time packers are lovely and always try and steer you right
bad,If you need work only.very cold sterile work place.Dont  go here.must hit the floor running at all  times.Miss a  quota get you butt fired!  i need work so went there. I quit over the  bs.
bad,Horrible management with a very stressful environment. Pretty much your modern day version of slavery. Just keep to yourself and avoid trying to make friends.
bad,"I like to hustle and work hard, but this delivery job with company van was abusive with van so stuffed you couldn't move in it. Cant take a break nor a lunch break in order to try to keep pace. They pretend to not know that breaks are federally mandated.  In order  to complete route I didnt eat nor drink for 10 hrs and didnt use a bathroom break. The gps is erratic and office dispatch calls to say pick up pace when you already have been busting your rear. I guarantee Amazon has been planting positive reviews on this site because the turnover rate on this job speaks to the vastly pervasive poor conditions."
bad,"Company is full of smart, dedicated employees working on exciting projects. "
bad,"Sortation facility is the last stop for the packages before they are set out for delivery. We receive a range of 33,000 to 42,000 packages on most nights. There are never enough employees at work because there is no physical way to call out of work besides putting in sick hours online and because many people quit on a daily basis. The work is fast-paced and you are expected to keep up or you can be written up and possibly fired. It takes a toll on your body especially back, feet, hands and wrists. There is very poor management and a strong lack of communication. The employees are not respected nor their schedules. Most days we have mandatory flex up which is when they add and extra half hour or hour onto our shift that we must stay for or we will be reprimanded. The 15 minute break is never 15 minutes because were rushed back before the 15 minutes is up. At the end of sorting and after lunch break which is 30 minutes exactly, we have to pick and stage. Picking consists of taking about 30 bags full of packages and over size packages and setting them up on bakers racks. Then we must stage the racks at the appropriate location which is always very far from the are where we pick. We are expected to only take 30 minutes per pick and complete 2 picks a night. Some people prefer to work with a partner or they have to due to physical restrictions and they are expected to complete 4 picks in an hour. The facility is always dusty and dirty. Overall the company is not run the way anyone would expect a billion dollar company to be run."
bad,"non vale la pena impegnarsi in questo lavoro, tanto ti tengono 3 mesi e poi a casa ! In oltre, ti massacri piedi e gambe facendo km e km a piedi, la pausa e' inesistente, lavoro molto faticoso e stressante .... cercate altro se potete ! PESSIMA ESPERIENZA"
bad,"New to Canada? Looking for a place to ""be"" vs. work? then Amazon Canada (brampton location) is the place for you."
bad,"This job, out of every job I've had was by far the worst of them all. I put blood, sweat, tears, and all my time into this job just to get screwed over by something as petty as a system error. I wouldn't recommend my worst enemy to work here, it's that bad."
bad,"No one can speak english there not even supervisors. if they do speak english it is the very minimum. not on top of their health and safety, i got injured the other day pretty badly and nothing was done. Pallets in wrong places, cages being pulled wrong, doing a 2 person job by yourself."
bad,"I worked for Amazon for about a year, I can't describe how bad it was. Managers were rude, racist and unprofessional. People could not use restroom for they had to keep scanning or else they'd get in trouble, many bottles of urine around the warehouse because of it. Managers would call employees monkeys, so far as to make that an ""official"" mascot for the warehouse."
bad,"Employees that put in the very least they can to get by, are coddled and catered to because they constantly complain.  Other employees I have watched work themselves to the point of physical exhaustion and receive no true appreciation or merit."
bad,"If you love to learn, are a hard worker, and also like to be appreciated for a job well done, then move along.  In order to learn anything new, you must be straight out of HS or college.  That is where they recruit management. The hours are long and hard. The rates are impossible to meet with the lackluster management dragging their feet to do any type of problem solving. The equipment breaks down, which will affect your rate, or there is no work, which will further reduce your rate.  Now that they are gearing up for the peak season, they are hiring, but don't worry, after peak, they will look for any and every reason to fire you. "
bad,"These people don't care if you're the best picker or the worst, but if they see that you have brain cells and CAN NOT manipulate you then they'll keep you around like a dog by the leash. They want to work you to the ground and when you don't cooperate they stick you in the cold your entire shift. No human being deserved to work for this garbage company, or at least the Fresh portion of Amazon. Wages are atrocious, scheduling is horrid, and the way the managers treat their employees is utterly disgusting. "
bad,I worked there and that was apart of my life I want to move on. The job was hot alot of walking. No good mangement and there was at least four new bosses in the years I worked at the company.
bad,"Advancement is hardly merit based, most promotions are handed to unqualified affirmative action beneficiaries some of whom cant even carry out their duties on a daily basis. Many employees are illiterate, can not speak english and are most likely not even legal citizens, but that does not stop them from getting promoted before you do."
bad,"On a typical day, is to come in early about 30 mins address what the day shift did, and all they did is cause a mess and not try to clean the area, i was my responsibility to clean and put away all items, reship out things that were pending and also fix any shipping orders as they came in, or pending from day shift. it was like that for a whole year and when peek started it got even worse."
bad,The job was bad. Environment was bad. Hours were bad. Opening boxes all day is mind numbing. Did not pay enough for how that place was. Honestly have nightmares about still working there.
bad,I couldn't tell you the name of my manager as I never met him/ her. The hours you sign up to work are never what you actually work. Voluntary OT is actually mandatory.
bad,They have unrealistic rates and want people to work like Robots!  And as soon as you don't make rate you are written up and threaten to be fired!  High turn over!!
bad,"The environment in the amazon warehouse is closely attributed to a sweat shop, especially during the spring and summer seasons, The work pace is undesirable and lacks efficient use of resources and employees. There is constant neglect of the employees during the shifts just so they reach their output goals. Management is always scattered and disorganized."
bad,This was not a place to work long term. You check in one night and not be needed. You could come back from lunch break to find out you are now working an 11 hours.
bad,False promises given. Managment team do nothing but walk around and do not support. Pay is an embarrasment for the work you do. No outside life what so ever.
bad,I put in my notice to leave and I am eligible for rehire yet I would NEVER go back to work for this company. All the negative comments on here are very true. You have been warned!
bad,I wouldn't recommend Amazon as a job to anyone who enjoys their life. Poor management and they don't care about employees. Very high turnover rate. Maybe a good temporary job.
bad,"Management is nonexistant. Typical day of work coming in, getting yelled at for no reason, dealing with very shady coworkers and then getting to work, where the pay is lackluster compared to other Amazon warehouses. Coworkers are all characters, most being extremely lazy or particularly odd. Hardest part of the job is everything. You are made to work hard, but at the same time are not supplied with the necessary items in order to succeed in your goal. The only thing that may make the job fun is that there will be some coworkers that you will be able to mingle with and relax with."
bad,"They churn out employees as much as they hire them. They don't care about the ""person"" at all. Even with all the morning slave chants and the brainwashed management talking about the benefits of Amazon when it was actually non-existant. "
bad,I liked being a picker.  If your supervisor liked you they would send you on good routes if they didn't like you they would give you hard routes.  My scores were up there but not like a 25 year old.  They discriminate against older workers.  I liked packing and I loved being a picker the hardest part was the shelf stockers getting in your way.  The supervisors and co-workers encouraged sloppy work and not accurate either didn't care if it was damaged or not.  We were supposed to be customer oriented but most of the time the kids did not care they just threw stuff in their buckets.  The work was fun.
bad,"Amazon nous fait des belles promesses qui aboutit à rien... j'ai un statut handicapé (surdité) et j'ai travaillé 6 mois là-bas et pour rien car ils ont promis d'embaucher les personnes handicapées en priorité... J'avais déménagé exprès pour leur prouver que je suis bien capable de travailler avec eux. Les instructions étaient laborieux. Un jour, sur le tableau qui m'indique que je dois travailler sur une zone et quand je suis arrivé sur place, le chef de zone me dit de retourner voir la chef d'équipe là ou j'ai vu le tableau. puis elle m'a renvoyé sur la zone soit disant que c'est résolu. je commence à travailler et puis 5 min le chef de zone me dit de retourner l'autre coté pour commencer ma journée... tout ça plus de 30 min perdus et on me dit que ma productivité est médiocre ce jour là. Croyez moi, c'était catastrophique et mon dos a souffert malgré leur ""formation de SMART"" (bien se positionner, charge pas plus 15 kilos...) . Il y a un moment, j'ai eu des articles qui faisait plus 20 kilos que j'avais laissé sur un chariot et mon chef me râlait dessus que ca fait une perte de temps pour les autres. je suis bien content d'être parti et j'ai trouvé une autre voie de métier."
bad,"They preach quality and safety, but push productivity to the point of high anxiety and exhaustion. It seems the mentality is push everyone to their limit, and if they break, replace them."
bad,I worked with numerous unqualified individuals as well as unrealistic and unconcerned managers. They tried to expand too quickly and as an employee I was seen as just another number of the masses. Every construct of the business model was intended to benefit Amazon and not the low level employees.
bad,"I fully agree that companies should have expectations of their associates. Amazon is less than forthcoming, until you've hit the floor. There's a definite feel of everyone being expendable, and they let you know quickly how little you matter. This is a direct contradiction to their sales pitch, and stated culture."
bad,"I worked in a wish fulfillment center, during the two days of training they didn’t teach me how the scanners work as there weren’t enough available. On my first day I was able to get 30 seconds of training with the scanners, it felt like I had done alright with scanning until finally told me what not to scan, the code above the pallet that I had been scanning for most of my trips. I really wish they had taught me that. The second day I was yelled at for not having scanned 150 packages an hour, yelled at again for scanning the code above the pallets so many times and then was told that they had too many workers show up so they were sending some people home, I had been on that list, that manager was nice and found someone else to take my spot on the list. After all that and the start time of 5:00AM I decided I’d had enough and quit on the 3rd or 4th day"
bad,"They do have an 'ethics line' but it doesn't work. HR do not respond to complaints or grievances. The place has a worryingly 'above the law' feel to how it operates. "
bad,"Use it as a place to learn how not to be a people manager, excellent opportunities provided to learn how to use all aspects of Excel, read reports and micro management."
bad,It’s ok for a second job.... management doesn’t seem to know what’s going on half the time.. a lot of lazy people walking around doing nothing. It’s a very unorganized environment easy to hurt yourself because the floor is never clean properly ..
bad,amazon is a compony there have no rules for employers very very work hard they count each and every second no job security i worked thier 2 years with good targets but if they want they release people for no reason.
bad,"Amazon warehouse in Middletown (aka PHL 7) is a Dickensian hellhole set up with multi-million dollar grant from Delaware/New Castle County."
bad,"This was a horrible place to work at. You spent long hours on your feet trying to reach unattainable goals with only the prospects of, at most a ten minute sit down to gather  yourself and start the nightmare all over again."
bad,"They are always ready to terminate employees for minimal reasons. Area Managers usually fail to follow through on most requests. There are better jobs and companies to work for. Don't waste your time with this negligent organization. You as an employee, don't mean anything to them. It is all about their numbers. They don't care about you."
bad,Management is terrible and unorganized. Pay sucks for the work you will be doing. Would not recommend anyone to work here. Management will lie about ANYTHING just to cover their own job even if it requires throwing you under the bus for something you had nothing to do with.
bad,"Not worth it. Break your back for no acknowledgement and little advancement opportunity. Associates can get fired if OPs do not like them, seen it happen."
bad,"Sortation hub is a boring and mind numbing job."
bad,"Not a good place to work in my opinion! Cut throat environment! They want A+ work, but pay C- wages! The only thing that is good about being employed there are the Benefits!"
bad,"Like i said its a horrible place for a driver. You HAVE TO complete a route sorted out by a bad system in the USA, you have to load 200+ parcels for less than 15 mins . You HAVE TO deliver/attempt every single parcel ! There are no brakes involved, working from around 07:00-10:00 until you finish, if you finish in less than 10 h. the next day you will have even more parcels. As a professional courier. I was FORCED to do 200+ STOPS with 250+ parcels every day, with 1  day off. If you will apply for a job as a delivery driver, DO NOT!"
bad,I was one of the first wave of people to help open CAE1. Management was horrible. Constantly monitored via laptops on your performance. Team work was non existent
bad,"at amazon it is hard job picking if you can not pick 2/3 items a minute which the items could be 2 floors away from each other or in another bit of the warehouse then they will give you strikes, if you have a toilet break they will come and talk to you asking why you were not working, the breaks are one 30 minute and 2 15 minutes which invloved walking to and from the end of the ware house which is 5 minutes of fast walking so it is 20 minutes and two 5 minutes overall the amazon staff and management where very nice but the agency where not nice or sympathetic, i had many problems with them from them giving me 2 strikes a one time  becuse they couldnt be bothered to find me and talk to me for a week about progress which they are meant to do, i hd to take it to amazon HR which where helpful and sorted out the angancy, the hours are so long and you are sometimes required to do overtime. they job is easy without the pressure of the 150 items minium per hour but it will drive you crazy being on your own walking all day on your feet for hours, my feet used to ache everyday coming home, if you have a family or bills to pay they will not be afraid to get rid of you in 3 weeks from any point while working there"
bad,".Bad. Did not like. Boring. Horrible. Dull. Richest company in american history and still pays works minimum wage, which is not enough to live off of."
bad,"don't follow on policy, put employees in danger on purpose, general managers don't have the balls to communicate with you when you have a concern.  One of the best employees they had but got pushed out"
bad,"If Amazon had better management who cared about their employees, the environment would be more productive.  All the management cared about were numbers."
bad,"I worked there for two months and they were the two worst months ever. I am not being dramatic as the hours are so long, 7:30am to 6pm four days in a row. Really do not advise you to work here unless you need to. Horrible place, horrible working conditions."
bad,"It want a good work environment. It’s extremely hot in the building, breaks aren’t long enough you end up only have about 5 minutes of break once you get to the breakroom."
bad,Amazon does not care about its employees. Hr is a joke. The management will play favorites. DO NOT WORK FOR THIS HORRIBLE COMPANY. They work you to death (literally for some people) and they do not compensate fairly.
bad,too short of a break considering amount of work allotted onto employees.  Management is stressful and do not accommodate you with a safe environment. .not fair and make you want to quit
bad,"I worked for Amazon for a short period of time and discovered that they came down pretty hard on employees for being a minute late back from their lunch break, yet could go on ""personal time"" for as long as they wanted without getting into trouble. They do not value their employees and only want what they can get out of them."
bad,"Every day we would all start at 7:30 A.M. and finish the day at 6:00 P.M. We'd spend 10 hours of the day on our feet constantly moving around a massive warehouse, By the end of the day my feet would usually be in a stupid amount of agony, sometimes they even bled. I was a picker, probably one of the most miserable jobs in the FC next to packing. I'd walk miles and miles trying to complete unrealistic targets. "
bad,"High pressure, stressful ,and physically exhausting job. The management is dishonest and over bearing. Pay does not compensate the work done. You are treated like dirt."
bad,"I did not meet my manager until 4 weeks into the job and that was only for 5 minutes. In my 4 months of working for Amazon, i might have talked to him 3 times. The training was also very bad. They train you for 4 hours and then make you start working, and if you make one mistake, it's a strike."
bad,"The typical day is 10 hours spent with extremely little movement of just the arms, reading small and inaccurate descriptions on an un-"
bad,"Do not go to work here, management and employees are at a turn rate based on performance. They also lack any career path to advance up in the company."
bad,The benefits are great but the job is very demanding because the standard work is defined but not followed. There are also unrealistic expectations in the work process.
bad,They think you are a machine and don't understand fatigue. They expect you to do 100% but are not willing to do the same work for 40-60 hours a week. All the good Managers get promoted and you get stuck with the trash.
bad,"Una empresa que siempre intenta dar una cara amigable,regalandote de vez en cuando un helado en el descanso,fingiendo que se preocupan por tu seguridad..."
bad,Got hurt and went to there medical staff did what he said what he said and then got wrote up for being slow. When I went back to there medical staff he told me he did say it but didn't put in in my file.
bad,There very unprofessional  I wouldn’t recommend working there the pay is good but I rather work somewhere where you have more benefits and where I could be a manager
bad,The job isn't all that its hyped up to be. Moving up is difficult and the work place is very political. I've been there for 3 years and the management seems to get worse and worse. They dispose of employees and recycle managers. They compare people to robots and hold them to the same expectations.
bad,"worst place to work for. they treat you like slaves and expect you to work 10-12 hour shifts tirelessly.  you are given two 30 minute breaks which are more like 10 minutes because it takes 10 minutes to walk from one side of the FC (warehouse) to the canteen and if you are so much as 2 minutes late to make your first scan then you are given a warning which puts your job at risk immediately. training is poor and if you don't talk to someone who has been there before or survived at least 3 weeks to learn the ins and outs of the FC then it's only a matter of time until your contract is terminated without warning. Management tamper with your stats to make it look like your underperforming and they don't listen to anything you have to say. If you're caught talking to someone you may know that's a warning if you are caught sitting down, that's a warning, in the mornings you are crammed on to a bus where I've seen people sitting on the floors, stairs and even where the free newspapers go and if you don't sleep on that bus, you are in for a terrible day. I have even seen people sleeping standing up because there's no space"
bad,"Worked for a company called 'Deliverwize' who were a courier network on behalf of amazon. "
bad,"I was let go with no notice after 5 months, management are useless as they hardily take notice of day to day staff unless it is to discipline. 85% of there work force are unhappy on a daily basis towards the way they get treated and spoke to.Overall i suggest Avoiding working at LBA1 in Doncaster as there Line managers especially on night shift while treat you like something they have just stepped in. They also terminate agency contracts on any given day with no notice so be aware that any day may be your last!!"
bad,I loved the hours i was working the exercise when we come in a all gettogether for that event. The talk i can have with anybody their at the job nice place to work
bad,people lie on you to get you fired.. they keep people that do nothing and those people are the ones who move up in the company.. and if its in hebron ky and you will get in trouble for everything..
bad,"Starts out good but they are always on at you to pack quicker and do more. "
bad,Very fast and hectic work environment. Never really felt like anyone cared about me as an employee individually but that may be due to the large number of employees working there. Overall no one cares its just your turn to work there its not a hard place to be replaced.
bad,"I can't understand why Amazon are proud of their rate of pay, it's a whopping £7.65 p/h. 15p over the living wage, The overtime rate is reasonable If  they give out overtime. when it suits them they introduce compulsory O/T you have to do it, but the other hand when they don't need you they will stop at very short and believe me flat net wage isn't much You will lucky to earn £1050 p/m."
bad,Good company but too much expected from staff with regard to targets. Also too many people watching over staff. Very tough on body with long periods of standing . Virtually no possibility of permanent work
bad,"Cut throat. Management wants you to do a job they have never done themselves and then doesn’t understand the problems that occur. Management doesn’t attempt to get to know you, you are just a number."
bad,"The working conditions are horrible, the pay is not worth the stress. During the ""peak"" season, more days than not, someone was leaving in an ambulance from heat exhaustion."
bad,It's a terrible place to work I wouldn't even recommend this job for anyone unless they want to stand for 12 hrs a day and you can't even sit. Also you be having a very short break
bad,"I'll preface this by saying I knew exactly what I was going into, I had heard the horror stories but still went as I wanted to work with the EC2 team within AWS as I'm a tech geek at heart and their tech at the time (2012) was bleeding edge. It was an amazing opportunity to see behind the curtains and see how it all works. I really liked the teams that I partnered with within EC2, but the Talent Acquisition organization under Rich Simon was sleazier than the most cut-throat agency you can imagine. The management was abhorrent, the worst I've ever seen, completely inept and incompetent and afraid to stand up to bullies in higher positions. I witnessed a TA manager (not my own) seriously scream at a Recruiting Coordinator for something that wasn't even that RC's fault. Your fellow recruiters were always looking for a way to steal your candidates, and you didn't have to worry about just the people sitting next to you, the recruiters in other locations would also be waiting for your 7 day tag to expire so that they could then tag them for themselves and snag credit should that person ultimately be hired anywhere within Amazon. You had to be available at all hours of the day or night, so if there was an issue with something at 3:00 am and you didn't respond to that email within a few short hours, you were berated. You were expected to have your device connected to the network so you were always reachable, and expected to be in the office by a certain time each day and were not to leave until much later. Drinking was rampant throughout the office, most of my peers who were full timers,"
bad,"i hated it. no air conditioning, no heat for winter. it felt like a child care center, many crazy people and foul language. it was run like a chicken with its head cut off."
bad,Turnover rate is high. You get in trouble for every mistake you do. Easier to leave Amazon and reapply to a higher position than to move up in the firm
bad,"No matter how hard you work to prove yourself, you are never appreciated. They don't care how exhausted you are, you must meet the rate, if you don't you get warning, the third warning ...termination, even if you are regular employee with full benefits, so don't take it for granted you are secure. They keep hiring and firing. There is no second chance for mistakes you make, you will just guided out of fc..thats AAMAZON"
bad,"BFI4 (Kent, WA)"
bad,"Expectations are too high and wage is too low...breaks should be 15min and lunch 45min...there's too much emphasis on making rate and it causes stress on employees also we voted in 4/10's shifts and there's MOT too often...I believe that if that was respected there wouldn't be a lack in productivity and quality...we are given UPT  and then when used we are warned or fired which makes no sense at all, the quality in management is poor, with a handful of exceptions, there is alot of favoritism and cross training with those not near being qualified, work ethics and safety are not a priority there it seems rate is more stressed there then quality employees..."
bad,"Very disorganized from the beginning. HR isn't very proficient with use of computer software. The ""typical"" answer when you have a question is I will get back to you... and they never do. If you are over 40 and white, you are treated differently."
bad,Was honestly one of the worst places i have ever had to work in. They don't tell you a lot of things about the workplace that you only find out after spending some time in there.
bad,"A very stressful place to work as intern especially when your projects kept getting scraped every 2 months. "
bad,extremely high turn over rate leads to a lack of stability. The pay is based on retail while the job function is more of a factory. Poor management in the senior ops and above leave the managers powerless to implememt positive change. I was dedicated for over a year and it nearlt destroyed my physical amd emotional well being
bad,Poor management poor hr work hard long hours not appreciated by company or management discrimination and racism towards African Americans favoritism showed to certain employees training process never followed correctly poor safety management not concerned with associates safety only concerned with work rates
bad,"Management showed favoritism lot of backstabbing."
bad,The work itself isn't the problem. The management is constantly changing and changing how production is done. They gave ambassadors a lot more responsibility for the same pay as everybody else and no other benefits. Instead of taking people aside to discuss issues they shouted at them in front of all associates. No respect at all. The pay seems good but they overwork you in the short amount of hours they give you. They keep assuring you that you can advance but never give any opportunity to do so.
bad,Don't make your numbers ? You get wrote up its ridiculous. They don't care if you need the job or not its all about rate and if you don't make rate by 3 weeks you are out. They talk about team work but can't even keep a team because all they do is replace people with new hires every month.
bad,"I wouldn't wish this job on my worst enemy. They spew ""safety first"" and that is never the case. The bar goes higher and higher ever week but the pay scale never reflects. The turnover rate for everyone is high and that goes for management and associate alike. Amazon.com has just become a terrible company to work for. They make sure you are WELL aware of how expendable you are to them. I could go on for pages about this company."
bad,"I was left for days without training, told me if i could not start with 2 days notice I couldn't start at all and the job itself is lonely and bland. Too much expectation for people with very little training. Free tea and coffee I guess..."
bad,"I worked for Prime for 6 months. Totally insidious management process. They deactivated me because a customer complained that i given the package to the receptionist instead of directly to her. The receptionist option was available, no notes warned me of an issue.  Although i had a similar complaint before, it too allowed for the option of choosing the receptionust. Amazon tried to reactivate me 4 days later after i appealed', without any resolution to the available option and lack of instructions. I declined. No one should acquiesce to this style of management. It is inhuman. Pox on Amazon."
bad,"Works you like slaves and could care less how you feel at the end of day. Constantly like a revolving door. Hardly any job security unless you are a ""favorite"""
bad,"No time for anything other then work, over worked, no options really to advance, your basically a number not an employee, turnover rate is way to high, minimal interaction with MGMT"
bad,"The pay is OK.The work is mindless,tedious,and monotonous! You have to keep up rates even under conditions which you have no control.They want robots."
bad,"This place wants robots for employees, not human-beings!"
bad,A typical day at Amazon is stand up in the morning a going to your assigned station. As far as management goes they are professional but Amazon hires from outside and not from within. The hardest part of working for Amazon is meeting Rate.
bad,"It's a job, they don't care much at all about the employees, only their own wallets, they will chew you up and then sit you out.  Worst place to work."
bad,"You are only a number as an Amazonian.  You are paid to do the job they assign.  If they do not like you, you will most likely be put in the worst job imaginable.  They retaliate, however, by putting you in departments that others fail easily.  Managers take full credit, all the time.  You WILL walk about 10-12 miles a day."
bad,You worked ten hour shifts at least four days a week and there was a lot of  mandatory overtime because lack of employees. Their compensation package was really good and started from day one.
bad,"I am an extremely hard worker:self motivated, diligent, punctual, who actually cared about doing a good job. I busted my butt daily while I watched more than 3/4 of the staff screwing off. It didn't matter...They don't care about their employees. Even when you are the only  one killing yourself for the company, when I injured myself on the job and asked to work another area until I was healed they demanded I work in the same area carrying packages that would not allow me to heal saying, ""you don't get to cherry pick your jobs here.""  What a joke....I can see now why so few people actually worked there but just collected a  pay check.I left on the spot that day. No job was worth my health and they surely could have cared less."
bad,I would only recommend Amazon to young people. Employees only last on average 9 months. It a cut throat atmosphere. I would not recommend it to friends or family.They constantly raise rates without improving equipment spend.
bad,"We have a manager at our facility DLA4 in Northridge, CA named after the King of the Nights of the round table.  And trust me when I say this guy thinks he's a King when he's really a Tyrant.  This idiot comes in every single night and right off the bat in his stand up, threatens to fire everyone or anyone who doesn't do exactly what he says (which by the way is just stupid request on a regular basis).  Not only is this guy an idiot he is a manager who should not be in that position what-so-ever.  He degrades employees, he's the most NEGATIVE person you've ever heard in your life and he's just downright inadequate and stupid.  "
bad,Ok so this company has a tendency not to pay you although you are working through an agency Plus the pay is terrible even on night shift. have had problems in the past with the management trying to force me to work overtime when I couldn't as I had  to use public transport. The work is extremely physically and mentally demanding. the other workers tend to either slack off or not do anything at all. I wouldn't advise taking a job here.
bad,"The company doesn't care about their associates and don't care about safety,The leadership cares about production only and they gwt rid of older associates"
bad,"I had been working there for almost 3 years and I'll tell you it's the worst job I've ever had. "
bad,"When you come into Amazon they make a lot of promises and tell you what you want to hear. But within the first 6 months those things will change. If you are work with agency, no problem if you are hardworker and you can hit the target up to 100% you will lost the job after 9 months. they don't care who is hard worker,they don't care who get only positive feedbacks etc... Just they promise everything after not happen anything. I won't go back to work there never!"
bad,Amazon does not value it's workers and treats everyone as if they are expendable. They hold unrealistic standards for their employees and threaten them with their jobs if they do not work to these standards.
bad,This job treats their employees like we were nothing. well at least the delivery drivers . All of us were overworked and underpaid. The keep bouncing and miss calculating checks and hours.
bad,Don't work here if you get tired of doing the samething every day.They ride you like a hawk over production you can't even go to the bathroom if your not on break..Terrible company
bad,Their Managers/Supervisors are extremely lazy and unmotivated. They DO NOT have what it takes to lead their employees. I was told by everyone under my supervision I was the BEST supervisor they had.
bad,The management let employees do what they want management unprofessional not enough upt time that's one reason they lost allot of great employees part-time bulding isn't worth it
bad,"If they don't like you, they set you up for failure.  Management helps whom ever they please.  It is stressful to think you are going to be written up."
bad,Amazon will hire mass amounts of people only to lay them off months later. I worked very hard and was layed off for no reason. They will literally work you to death and then just toss you out like a piece of trash when they're done with you. Horrible experience.
bad,"Long shifts, 12 plus hours, on your feet walking in a so called air conditioned warehouse. Hardly any chance of rising up in the ranks. I was injured on the job and they would not provide adequate medical care."
bad,"They will only notice you when you mess up. You can easily be fired for making one mistake that is easily fixable. this is no place to work. Dont Do IT. There are no excuses for mistakes even though you will have NO CONTROL over most of them. If a piece of product falls out of the tote later on the line? thats your fault. if someone in packing does not scan it or mistakes it as missing, you the picker is responsible. this place will work you to death and then wonder why you are under performing."
bad,"It is a cutthroat work environment.    Rate is stress over quality.  Employees  will fight over work to make rate.  Your fellow coworkers  won't  help you because they are afraid of getting written up for time off task. "
bad,The management definitely plays a lot of favoritism. Most days you do not get a route even if you just started and they know it will take you a while to get the hang of everything
bad,"Amazon is great to its customers but not its employees. Stay away.."
bad,"Amazon is one of the worst companies I ever worked for. In the beginning like any company you have high hopes  advancement and everything going smooth and having a really fun work experienced as said in many interviews and orientations. Amazon isn't that, Amazon is a pretty face with a terrible attitude with a turn over rate as low as 4 months they constantly hire and fire daily on any level. Management is fresh out of college with no hospitality, or associate commutation skills; 97% of ""leadership"" (management) this is their 1st job ever. They are less qualified than the average incoming associate and its said. You work at 10+ hour day get two 15 min brakes and one 30min lunch and your are not allowed to sit or even use the bathroom because of time off task (witch you can get fired for). The schedule is suppose to be 4 days on 3 days off but I've been working 5 days on 2 days off for 11 hours a day since i was hired 6 months ago, its just not worth it and the make you feel like your just a number than an actual person. Just stay away from amazon..... just waring you."
bad,Management and HR were never in the same page so disorganized. They didn't care for employees at all. Dirty picking area. Never got my full fifteen minute break.
bad,"Sink or swim while getting paid minimum wage. Be prepared to give lots of blood, sweat, and tears before moving to a more desirable position."
bad,The hours are very short only 4 hour increments which is horrible and besides that the security stays on Facebook and instagram all day while people are repeatedly breaking into cars and bashing out windows during all the shifts throughout the day no matter how close you parked to the building. I ended up leaving cause it just was not worth it at all.
bad,"This is THE WORST job I've ever had. mind numbing labor that monkeys could be trained to do. If you have a good work ethic and like to hustle don't work for them, the only reward your hard work gets you at this company is to be put in more demanding positions for the same pay. Try to learn as little as possible because the more functions you know how to do the harder they will work you. Rampant favoritism throughout the building. I had a new boss every 3 months and there were only a couple of them that ever helped out or did any real work. The rest of them sat at their desks on Facebook or YouTube and would quickly switch over to a work screen if an employee came up to them and then they would wonder why they didn't get all the items shipped out in time or why the lines were backed up. If a machine breaks down you can expect to wait 30+ minutes for facilities/maintence to arrive to fix it because they sat in their own little hidden corner of the building playing World of Warcraft the whole time and made everyone wait until they were done doing whatever quest or other nonsense in that game.  If you make a mistake or aren't working up to your normal standards you can expect to hear about it from 5 different bosses. I constantly performed at 150% rate or higher and the couple of weeks where I only made 110% rate they tried to write me up even though my rate was above 100%. Short breaks. Good benefits, that's it."
bad,"not a very good place to work at, they will fire you very easily for things they do not communicate with you on, their system is messed up and always have soo many problems with it and will always come up to you and say that you either have TOT (time off task while you are working or being labor tracked)"
bad,"Slavery is on the comeback, Amazon is the most unorganised place I have ever worked at, The managers or shift managers don't give a ""f"" if your feet or back is hurting for trying to walk 15-20miles to pick up from there shelves. especially the night shifts 10/hr. Nothing good to say about the place other than I hope it gets burnt down."
bad,"Leadership is very young and inexperienced, reactive, immature.  Culture is negative - coaching is conducted in front of peers. Private HR issues are made public knowledge. Summers and winter holidays are completely sacrificed to work here. Unrealistic production and quality goals are imposed."
bad,"Worst job I've ever had, ever will have. The first time in my life that I felt like just an able body opposed to an actual human being."
bad,Working at the Sheffield Amazon site was a nightmare   Amazon staff are bullying  other workers on site. You do not feel safe at work because there is no Cctv on site  and when you are trying to get on with your job  you have  Amazon staff stearing at you the whole day. There is really a bad culture at Sheffield dxs1 Amazon delivery station. To make a long story short I would not recommend Amazon as good work place..
bad,Worst company ever. Two of my family members work at a fulfilment center in WA state and have been bullied since day one. I know these two are hard workers and the way they are threatened on the job and treated is sickening. One family member was hurt on the job and then was written up for low production rates! I hope they get their behinds  sued.
bad,"I worked three hundred and thirty nine hours of overtime in the last three months of the year. when the rush was over, I was let go. believe me when I say, you don't want to work for this company."
bad,The management team is young and inexperienced. They don't listen to the employees for the most part. The company is very unorganized. The hours are long and standing for 11 hours 5 days a week is doing mandatory overtime is A ok with them.
bad,"Management is horrible. Co-workers in other depts are horrible. People will refuse transfers and will argue with you about the transfer even though the policy states they must take it.  There's too many people that have a ""I"" complex. Majority of depts are outsourced overseas so you can't move to that dept. You must have good metrics to transition from seasonal and metrics do count against you. The metric rating system is horrible and needs to be removed or upgraded. Retail employees are piled with more responsibility, but no increase in pay. They recently made changes to lessen the list dept responsibility and increase retail responsibility. Amazon is an okay place to start or get back in the workforce, but don't stay past the seasonal position if you can help it.  You have no paid time off, no sick leave, and you can only get insurance after 90 days. Seasonal employees are basically ""seasonal labor with no benefits"" you have unpaid time off that's it."
bad,"Typical shareholder driven company.  Does not care about its employees, shady contracts, drivers are penalized for dishonest customers and thieves in the neighborhood.  VERY disorganized with on the spot changes in policies.  Managers are inexperienced in logistics. Sit at a computer screen all day and operate using data.  No customer experience, poor employee relationship skills.  I would not recommend working for Amazon. Stay away!!"
bad,"I worked nearly a year to Amazon just because I was lucky not to have Polish, Lithuanians or Latvian managers. Otherwise, the work is hard, boring you feel and you are treated like a s..t."
bad,Working 10 hours with 2. 15. Minutes breaks dont dare go to bathroom they time you and if you take to long you get written up. Everyone that get hired with you starts to quit after one month before you know it there only two of you left .worst job ever.
bad,They employ nothing but kids fresh out of college to lead this billion dollar company it is very sad.  Never have i seen a more disorganized place to work.  The fact that there is not communication between the management is also a big dissapointment
bad,"Long hours in an extremely unsafe work environment. several co-workers getting sick from heat exhaustion. Other areas of the warehouse were freezing and employees were not allowed coats for fear of theft.  I was injured on the job when a bin containing 40 plus pounds of exercise equipment fell on my head. I was unconscious for several seconds, then told to go home. Before the incident I had voiced my concerns about the overhead conveyor system and things falling. after missing 3 days per doctors orders, I was fired for not showing up for work."
bad,"This is the worst job, I've had in my life!!! The pay is terrible, hours are long, and management is a joke....The robots constantly break down, the bins are over flowing, and yet these morons still expect you to make ""rate""....This is modern day slavery they treat you like a robot, and only care about the numbers....Plenty of good warehouse jobs out there don't waste your time on this one!!! There's a reason they have a temp agency on their site, turnover rate for this place is ridiculous..."
bad,I say underpaid because by the time you break it down its poor. 160-190 parcels a day 10 hours maybe more on the road and your expected to work into the night. No social life or family life even the routing makes no sense at all in one area then out then back again. It's like it's run by school kids who get stroppy if you question anything. Avoid like the plague
bad,"This place will chew the life out of you man. If you want to do the same task every day for 10 hours 5-6x a week this is the job for you. I took the job of a picker/packer over the peak season (fall/winter) while going to UCR. I was saving up for a trip out of the country. Anyway, this review is for my fellow colleagues/ students going to school."
bad,"You would be at your station for 8 hours a shift not being able to move much further unless going to the rest room and that was frownd upon, the same as speaking to work colleagues next to you. There were realistic targets set which were able to be met but the amount of pressure the team leaders would put on you would make some people uncomfortable. Only having 15 minutes break would just leave you rushing your food and sometimes not being able to go to the rest room in time."
bad,"10 hour shifts."
bad,"amazon doesn't care about its employees at all. i currently work here & have watched many employees lose jobs over racist views from management. it's literally like working at a slaveship. don't waste your time with this one. it's systematically set up for no growth to be obtained. do your research, before you die here. "
bad,"Job is very tiring and exhausting , not enough breaks and shifts are too long for that kind of job. All you do is walking. Wish they would pay more."
bad,"being stuck on shift work on nights for along time, no family life balance and the inability to call in. if you were sick, you were frowned upon. and honestly unless you drink the koolaid then you will never advance. You get promoted for making mistakes and it was the most backwards company I've ever worked for. a lot of wasted money and man hours for contracting out all of its technical work."
bad,"At the beginning of my tenure, a lot of promises were made in the interview. After 6 months I started seeing those promises dismissed. such as, mandatory weekend coverage, more hours to work, and an abrupt company atmosphere."
bad,typical day is rushing you to push 100x your limits when most the managers there don't know more then a new start temporary associate.
bad,While I work here I witnessed a lot of staff being blackmail and also lack of immaturity also workers and staff who are unprofessional. The overseers misuse their power of authority.
bad,If you enjoy being belittled after every effort and think it's fun to work for an employer who only cares about their own wealth then this is the job for you. Think you'll ever get to work less than 65 hours a week? Wrong.
bad,"The management is constantly being changed.  You can trust no one in authority, they offer no opportunity for advancement and only hire in management from those who recently graduated college with no practical experience or personnel skills.  They drive their employees to the point of exhaustion."
bad,"They never cared that I had classes to go to after work and forced me to stay late . I think my supervisors were uneducated and privileged and only got their job through ""connections"" . Many of my supervisors didn't even have any management experience. Overall, the pay was decent for NYC but I will never go back there. If you want a job that actually cares about you, look elsewhere."
bad,"My first day with Amazon was 11/25/2014. My last day there was 2/16/2016. I had enough time saved to put my two weeks notice in, and never go back. I was an electrical power production journeyman for the Airforce. I also worked as an aerospace ground equipment technician for the U.S. Air National guard. I applied several times times for their facilities level 1 tech position. I knew all the hiring managers, I also had great work ethic and a desire to learn more. But for some reason I never got the chance for the position. I worked my way up to ambassador, and was a seasonal tier 3 safety coordinator. I had high hopes with a career at Amazon, but it's bureaucracy prevented it from happening. Don't let Amazon take advantage of you if you're aspiring for a professional career."
bad,"Absolutely terrible. Get paid 100 per day plus 15p per mile (not enough) routes have 190 parcels a day, and send you round in circles, the wrong way up one way roads and to the wrong location. If you are not in the correct location when you scan the parcel you cannot deliver it. When phoning up to have the location reset i am accused of lying and / or stealing. Routes are supposed to take 10 hours (without breaks) but often take far more, even with support from other drivers (sweepers) thet make you unemployed to get past minimum wage and working time laws. My advice to anyone and everyone wanting to be a driver for amazon: Dont!"
bad,"The pay may be good for some, but it's DEFINITELY not worth the time. I told myself I'd work here at least a year...left after the third month. Management is horrible, communication was little to none, and the ""supervisors"" (if there were any) were regular associates who didn't know anything more than a new person. The entire establishment is a joke! Why do you think you see a ""Hiring Now"" sign for Amazon just about every day?"
bad,Worst place to work felt like was in prison. If you don't meet their culture or atmosphere your shown the door. Management was a joke people ether quite or kept moving around
bad,"Pure and utter chaos in the Fulfillment Centers. Unfair, discriminatory, and harassing work environment. The owner is so far out of touch with what's happening throughout that it's pathetic."
bad,"A typical day clock in, go to stand up meeting, stretch, scan your badge at a computer to let you know what station you will be working at that day. For 10 hours a day sorted items by scanning barcodes and putting them in designated slots.  Emphasis on quality but they only really care about speed."
bad,"Loved working with my temp co-workers and making jokes during mandatory break times since most of the work outside of break time was independent. Leadership is not very caring or understanding if you are injured. If they deem your injury so severe that you can't work, they find some other reason to fire you that is completely bogus. The work itself was easy, but the physical toll is not worth the pay. There is zero room for growth and no job security."
bad,"not a good company to work for, not good for your health."
bad,"Lots of management problems, highly competitive, untrustworthy, disloyal work environment, lots of backstabber and jerks....the worse employer I have ever worked for."
bad,"I would never work for amazon again! Staffing was very poor, expected you to meet targets every week and if you didn't hit targets every week they get rid! Two strikes and you're out! So you can expect for the agency to dispose of you within a few weeks."
bad,Management style is on level of third world country only thing missing was electrocuting you for not hitting the target...
bad,"A typical day would go along with mangers talking down to you and expecting more from you that exceeds your rate. While walking 15 miles a day and having to squat for every other item you have to grab isn't enough to kill you, the heat will surely kill you. The most enjoyable thing about this job is going home ( if you didn't have a heat stroke or heart attack.)"
bad,"I would rather like go to the moon without protective gear than work in a horrible company. 0% job security, 10-hour straight walking, Pick 138 items an hour and annoying managers (who even doesn't know how to run scanner properly). "
bad,"One of the worst places I have ever been employed! I saw many individuals get passed by for promotions, even though they were good at their job and this was simply due to upper management disliking the individual! Amazon has on several occasions had people fueled by trepidation so they work them selves in to an ambulance! the maximum wage for associates there is $12.25 I worked here for well over 2 years hoping for management to improve, but they did not!"
bad,"This place was terrible. Forget ever advancing, never going to happen and with the vast majority of their employees temp workers it is unlikely to ever really have a job for a long time. The point of these positions are to come in, make some money quickly and leave. If you work yourself very hard, they MAY keep you around for a little while longer but don't expect to become part of their team. They will let you work yourself dead tired and then throw you to the curb. Very bad place to work. Since working there, I refuse to buy any products from Amazon."
bad,"One of the worst companies to work for constantly being threatened with the sack, walking 15+ miles a day and talking is prohibited. This is one of those job which you should only apply for if your desperate. 20 min brakes but you spend 10 minutes of that break walking to the break area/smoking area. Every time you exit the shop floor you have to go through airport style security."
bad,"-Focus on task at hand"
bad,"It's hard work with little rewards.  Amazon makes excuses for not giving raises, (this year it was a 27 minute video) once you top out that's it no more raises, and most people top out in two years.  Yet upper management gets one every year.  If you excel in production you may get compensated, ha! ha!  Their compensation is a half hour UNPAID time off, and you get this only if the management team wants to give them out.  Or you can use the certificate to purchase Amazon swag.  Many associates get over 100% production and get nothing for it, so the morale there is stifling.   The unemployment department considers this a hostile work environment how sad is that."
bad,"I'm currently a seasonal employee and let me tell you, the work is not what I expected. I work in AFE (packing multiples) and the supervisors are super strict about time, talking to co-workers and you having any kind of say. You walk miles a day. Breaks are 15 minutes, one in the am and one in the pm. To get to the breakroom you walk about 1/4 mile each way. After walking you really only have about 7-8 minutes for break and do not be late by even a second or you will get written up. Lunches are 30 but again you have to take into account the distance to and from the breakroom, so you really only have about 20ish minutes. I feel like a number, like management doesn't care. They will not work with you with your schedule and they do not make exceptions (per  HR). The work is monotonous and the days are long. We started on 4/ 10 hour shifts and are now on 5/ 11 hour shifts. There is a lot of lifting (up to and sometimes more than 50 lbs), and tons of standing. I've developed plantar fasciitis due to the amount of standing. There is no sitting allowed unless on break or lunch.  You are expected to pack a minimum of 85 boxes per hour but the goal is 100 (you will be written up if you do not meet this goal). The warehouse is hot and very loud. I'm told this is a typical warehouse experience however I have never had a job in a warehouse so I can't say. Some people may like and thrive in physically demanding jobs, I do not. I miss working in an office."
bad,they treat you like rubbish and management so weak they don't have a clue on what they are doing
bad,"Many tasks are monotonous and too repetitive, which quickly leads to disinterest and burn-out, There is no opportunity for advancement and training in desired areas. Having to repeatedly ask management for fair opportunity to cross-train in requested departments is frustrating. Many ambassadors and some members of management are rude and act as if any question you ask them is a dumb question. I've seen some management members humiliate employees in front of everyone else in the department at stand-up if they make the smallest error instead of coming to that person directly to"
bad,"Its hot, no air flow, lots of favoritism within the Haslet FC organization. When you make rate they want you to work even faster. Its a do as I say, not as I do work place. Write ups if rate is not met for those not on the favorite list. VTO granted to slow producers, never to those who make rates. Favoritism to pregnant woman. No room for advancement if you are not a puppet to management."
bad,"It seems quite ungrateful to complain about the company that employed me. I'll start by saying that I am grateful for being employed at all and getting payed every week. It was only out of sheer desperation that I applied to work at Amazon - I worked part time on the 2.30pm-7.30pm shift; £150.00 per week. I packed boxes for 5 hours a day standing up, I was constantly being pushed to hit the ever increasing targets (70 boxes per hour - up to 120 boxes per hour) . It seemed that nearly no-one could hit the targets and we were always aware that not hitting targets could lead to dismissal - the environment was depressing, with the constant drone of the conveyor belt and the ear piercing alarms that constantly went off whenever a packer needed assistance with an item (this happened A LOT). After the first week of working there my hands were blistered and sore from hours of frantically packing cardboard boxes, I was sick of the repetitive nature of the work and the atmosphere of complete boredom and joylessness. The best part of the job was my co-workers, we all pretty much hated our work and had a great time talking about just how bored we were! (in the canteen before and after the shift - talking too much while packing can get you a disciplinary). The management were quite ruthless when it came to enforcing their point system - half a point if your even 1 second late at clocking in (yes this happened to me, clocked in at 2.30 and 1 second). 1 point for a sick day and 1 point for not hitting targets - 3 points and your out! I can't blame them as they were only following the harsh"
bad,"Amazon maybe the world leader in online shopping, but they are one of the worst companies to work for. The needs and opinions of the employees go vastly over looked."
bad,Amazon crushed the zappos culture.  The warehouse quickly went from one of the top places to work at in the area to one of the worst. Management teams have poor communication between departments as well as relaying information to employees. Job tops out at 12 dollars an hour.
bad,"An absolutely rubbish place to work.....I got disciplined for not being able to arrive on time when I clearly stated that I was going to be late on that particular day 2 weeks previously, and reminded the agency numerous times. I was promised work after xmas only to be told 2 days later that i wasn't needed anymore, about 10 minuted from the end of my shift....nice timing 4 day before xmas. Basically lied to me."
bad,"The atmosphere is terrible. Although the building is still new, leadership is extremely poor. It appears to be a bunch of people with degrees in field that have nothing to do with Manufacturing, Production and Operations running the place. The only upside to this company is the connections you make with fellow associates. 99% of the time I'm working my shift is spent complaining about the job to fellow co workers and finding another job ASAP. This should not be a daily conversation and all that one thinks about while on the job. I do not recommend anyone this job unless you have a degree or are able to obtain a Tier 3 position or higher."
bad,"Modern day slavery.  Pay is not enough for the amount of work you need to do, but the benefits package is decent."
bad,Horrible management and very poor employee relations. Company does not value their employees at all and make no effort to provide a pleasant work place.
bad,"good place to work."
bad,Been at amazon almost 3 yrs now and I do have to say that every yr that I have been here its gotten worse. The management changes every 6 months so no consistency there they change their core values every year and they get worse every yr. I come to work every day worried bout my Job security 
bad,more money/quota driven than consideration for their people
bad,hard job to keep you have to fight for your job every day working through an agency and you are treat like you are nothing at this job and on minimum wage.
bad,"For someone leaving the Military, Amazon was a good place to go. They aggressively recruit and find new talent. It made finding my job here very easy. The base salary is a good wage and if you plan on sticking around, the stocks and bonuses are very good. The company does grow every year so there are new opportunities elsewhere in the company if you are willing to move."
bad,"Constantly being timed, 10/12hrs per day walking taking orders on concrete floor. Mgmt is either college kids or ex military brats that put you through there intimidation, and boot camp to get things done with no compassion except for some of there snitches. They will fire ya in a minute because there is fresh meat through the temp svcs. There wasn't much good here...... gave ya a t shirt ""Work hard, Make history, Have fun"" well definitely no fun, and the other two were in threre best interest. Ending with no family life due to last minute overtime."
bad,"I worked here for just a couple of months, and it was horrible my mobile phone got stolen! And i nearly broke my back lifting a box which i shouldnt of been lifting on my own!!"
bad,I learned what factory work is like on a daily basis and it is very difficult.
bad,"No leadership, advancement, and requires dealing with a lot of people who try and get by without work ethic. Lots of drama and organization of roles lacks tremendously."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this to anyone that generally has a life worth living. If all employees care about are the wages, then that's certainly how they will get you. The conditions within the warehouse are appalling. Loud noises, and standing on your feet for roughly 10 hours a day, with incredibly strict break times. I can't believe this is what the working life has resorted to. Work somewhere less miserable and save yourself before it's too late. Money is not everything."
bad,Management don't know what they are doing and don't about nobody but themselves.. You ask to get off boarded and put in the system that you ask to get fired .Don't know what they are doing point blank.
bad,"They are only worried about unrealistic numbers and not about fixing the obstacles that prevent the numbers from happening, will not even let you change shifts due to child care issues"
bad,They say safety is there number 1 priority but they lie you need to be pulling 400 items a hour and in a rate of 7 secs per.You're basically just a number to them. If you need to get a job quick they hire you fast but be prepared for them to not treat you well at all.
bad,"Could be a safer environment in terms of working conditions for employees, but was not provider whilst working there. It could have helped if growth was available."
bad,Avoid at all cost. Make you travel from edinburgh to dunfermline just to put your badge on the door and find out you plus 20 other people have been sacked.
bad,"Always looking to send you home when you are an hour or 2 into shift. Rude managers, not really worried about the workers just the product. Treat workers like robots."
bad,"In case of emergency there is no system or phone to which you can relay that a shift wont be fulfilled even in case of emergency. They penalize you even if you give 4hrs notice which is illegal."
bad,"Brainless activities, no room for skills advancement. The team leaders don’t offer as much help as needed. You’re taken through a “training” for about two days, yet the training doesn’t reflect your overall job description."
bad,"bad place to work, get out when you can. don't treat people with respect people are underpaid for the work being done. time slots are bad. bet out as soon as possible"
bad,"If you work here expect to be underpaid, treated like a cog in a machine, and sustain some sort of injury trying to meet productivity goals. A common injury here are bulging discs. A permanent back injury"
bad,"It's easy to rack up ""ToT"" whether you have to use the bathroom OR their system malfunctions... either way, if you get up to 2 hours of ToT you'll be FIRED!"
bad,"Work you like a slave. You can’t even go to the restroom in peace. No job security. They only care about your rate and their money, they don’t care about your health. Break rooms are far away n by the time you take your break and start walking the break is almost over. Lockers are far away . No phone . It’s a prison in there"
bad,The workers are not being treated fairly there. The hours was too long and you could not even take a break there. also management is unfair there as well.
bad,"Definitely the worst place I have ever worked before in my life, they treat you like a robot, with bad policies and low salary, I wish everyone in that a warehouse could find something to leave that place as I rather be unemployed than getting peanuts and working like a robot, with no safety, working under hard circumstances like being in frozen picking up items for like two hours a day.They also threat you with losing the job the minimum your productivity goes down."
bad,"Not good atmosphere to work in. "
bad,"The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the required number of packages that need to go out each hour. Be prepared too be lifting Dog Food, Kitty litter, cases of water and energy drinks, furniture, car parts; continually for your whole shift!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A very immature work force!"
bad,"Amazon will hire anybody, which is great if you need a job, but frustrating when you are working alongside unqualified, slow, incompetent employees. Amazon will overwork you with little to no break, and often times the schedule is horrendous. Also, the warehouse I worked at was too small for the volume we were receiving and everything was all over the place."
bad,"No sense of teamwork. Everyone is constantly snaking and grassing about other workers to staff/ management to make themselves look better and to get other people in trouble. Everyone turns up to work boarderline depressed. Even the strongest willed people will find working here longer than short term difficult. Only good for fast money, not a career job at all"
bad,"Treated like a number rather than an individual. Rates are ridiculous!"
bad,What to tell they lie and use you during perk season then let you go like a piece of trash. If you don't have a blue badge be careful if they say u are a full time seasonal person u will be let go.
bad,Over work and under paid job culture is fast pace environment and restrictions remind you of something a work release program or prison .But promtions are great if you dont mind leaving the state and work somewhere else promotionsgreafpeople withough
bad,Ho lavorato circa un mese e mezzo in Amazon nello stabilimento di Passo Corese e mi è bastato per capire che è un ambiente pessimo... per loro devi fare sempre di più e tu con la speranza di essere preso a tempo indeterminato abbocchi e sgobbi come un disgraziato poi ti mandano via e chi s'è visto s'è visto...
bad,Does not care about the health of employees as well as work life home balance. Impossible to work for to five 12 hours shifts in a row. I fell asleep at the light multiple times due to the demand of work and mandatory extra 2 days of overtime in the row.
bad,Ich würde niemals wieder dorthin gehen und es auch niemandem empfehlen.
bad,"This place always says they care about your safety, but will make you work if you are sick. I work at a sort center in Wilmer, Texas and they are so disorganized."
bad,"The amount of work and stress wasn't worth the pay. You could be trained in multiple tasks and have different roles for jobs. However there wasn't a pay increase for the ""more important tasks."""
bad,The Job is hardwork with no acknowledgment. barely any breaks. awkward hours.     After working 2 weeks I wanted to leave. Never will I ever recommend this get-over job to anyone.
bad,"Worst company I’ve worked for. Pay is good and that’s it"
bad,Training crew and management do not communicate well and all will have different answers to your question. I learned everything from co workers because they knew more the management or trainers
bad,I will never be back at amazon the targets are impossible to hit and it is purposely meant so they do a lot of pay offs at Christmas time which i think is a joke. Always picking on the younger ones making them work harder to the point a few people collapsed.
bad,People are not treated equally . Agency staf get worst deal while permanent staff get easy ride. The nly way to progress is to suck up to managment.   If work was rotated evenly between the difficult jobs and easy jobs would be a much better place to work
bad,"Yes people that don’t mind taking abuse and hostility from Managers (Specifically Mark the bald one) can make it in this place."
bad,"I used to look forward to work every day at Amazon. I liked my colleagues, we did good work, and I felt like I had a future with the company. "
bad,They safety is their number 1 priority! It is not. They tell the managers to lie all the time! And they allow people to lie about others to get them fired. They do not like truth. For short term it is okay. But all news stories you hear are all true!
bad,Good for a first job. Terrible if you have a family. Low chance of advancement. Management has no clue what actually goes on or what to do. Company does not care if you are injured will push you to continue to work.
bad,"Horrible place to work, definitely do not recommend."
bad,Amazon is great when it comes to employees without families but if you have a family they are less willing to work with you. Most managers don’t treat everyone fairly.
bad,"Ayant été preparateur de commandes en intérim je  vous déconseille de perdre votre temps dans cette société qui a une politique incompréhensible, une ambiance de travail très mauvaise. Ce que je retiens c'est un contact très froid avec l'agence adecco, une remenuration très faible et des heures impayés pour tous et des  indemnités de fin de mission payés uniquement après douze mois et l'absence de paniers repas, le lieu de travail étant paris amazon recrute beaucoup d'intérimaires qui son pour la plus part "
bad,They do not take experience into consideration. You will be working well below your qualifications. Greedy company won't pay a living wage.  They make billions of dollars while their employees struggle to make ends meet. Unbelievably boring job.  Do not fall for the bull they try to brainwash you with.  They do not care.
bad,"A lot favouritism going around. They dont really place you in an area based on your personal attributes and abilities. There'll be people about 4ft to 5ft tall expected to place items on racks that stand 6ft to 7ft tall and lift up to double their own body wieght. Completely unorganized managers and ambassadors. Never actually caring or concerning themselves with their employees as long as packages are stored within packaging rate and time. To many lazy employees who spend their time pretending to work, chillin out in the breakroom couch for hours, making it harder on those that are their to work and advance."
bad,"Amazon does NOT screen hires besides a drug screening so production is a hot mess at best. The work is not hard at all and learning different areas is also easy. That is when your manager likes you enough to let you progress. The management is very ""good ol' boys club"" and if you're not literally kissing up (some managers are sleeping with their subordinates) or aren't liked you're not moving up. It's a very backstabbing culture that's very mentally, and emotionally breaking if you care about your job. Managers will kick you out of an important role to hand it to one of their friends. Amazon is not what they make themselves out to be, at least not in the warehouses which are like the red-headed step children of the company. HR doesn't help with any of those problems. If you're going to school they will make it more difficult than it's worth to take their tuition assistance program, even the GM walked out on the warehouse I was in to another location without saying a word and didn't resolve any employee issues. Management or the company doesn't care about you, just the productivity."
bad,Pay is decent. Health insurance is excellent which is why I still work there. Their maternity policy is also excellent if you’re lucky enough to take it advantage of it. But the rest of their benefits are horrible. It takes seven years before you get three weeks of vacation. Amazon does not care for its employees at all; uses and abuses and sucks the life out of its employees.  It boggles my mind how Amazon is so successful seeing the way there for film and center’s run.  If you have a rate they’re all over year but if you don’t they have no way to monitor employees their management is nonexistent.. and because Amazon is such a horrible place to work some of your employees are bottom of the barrel sometimes I think the hiring model will be Amazon is IQ less than 70 no problem come to Amazon
bad,"Prison inmates have better working environments, breaks are a joke if you want to do anything more then sit on a concrete floor, work expectations are over the top. If you want to feel valued as a member of a team then this is not for you, the pay is not enough for what you put up with, the only time you are noticed by any form of leadership is to tell you that you’re not doing it wrong. It’s a soul crushing environment, if I could picture working in slave labor camps it would be Amazon"
bad,"Ich war im Home Office beschäftigt. Wenn man bedenkt, dass Amazon ein Weltunternehmen ist, überrascht einen das absolute chaos in den Arbeitsabläufen. Die eine Hand weiß nicht was die andere tut, alle sind genervt und gestresst. Die Vorgesetzten überfordert und inkompetent. Ich wurde am Ende der Probezeit gekündigt, als ich einen Wegeunfall auf dem Weg zur Betriebsversammlung hatte (Knieschaden). Ich kann Amazon nicht weiterempfehlen. Bei kleinsten Verfehlungen wird man sofort gefeuert. Der Mitarbeiter wird ständig unter Druck gesetzt bis er verängstigt aufgibt."
bad,"Where do I begin?"
bad,I felt that they didn’t stress concern for their employers and had much appreciation I have a lot of personal medical issues that effected me in my line of work there
bad,"They don't treat people like people, you are a number,  a machine and that's all. if u take 10 min wc break, 30 SEC later 1 agency manager 2 supervises are right next to you to ask you why you stop working for 10 min and they will stay 1h in your back to see why you are unable to complete the 350 packages/H."
bad,"Leider war die Arbeitsanstellung nur auf zwei Monaten befristet, eine Auskunft über Weiterbeschäftigung erfolgte nicht. Eine Lebensplanung konnte nicht erfolgen. Für diese Unsicherheit war das Arbeitsumfeld sehr stressig."
bad,"Sweat shop, over work their employees, unorganized, don’t care about us employees, quick to want to get rid of people, have a high turnover rate, they suck"
bad,"The benefits are great but there are not many opportunities to advance in your career. Most management is hired externally. Working for such a huge company, they do not take much care in associate happiness or satisfaction with job."
bad,"You couldn't pay me enough to stay working for amazon. Hours are horrible,they will keep you out driving well past your shift."
bad,"I did not feel like anything I did mattered, all that they seemed to care about at Amazon was productivity. I did not feel like an employee with a name, just a number that filled boxes and in order to maintain the level of productivity that they wanted you really needed to go above and beyond a level of productivity that generated a culture where your work life balance did not matter nor did your physical limits. Would never recommend anyone work there unless they have a dire need for any job in order to make ends meet and even then when you were not working you were to burnt out to enjoy your family or social life. ."
bad,trust me you dont want me to review these parasites every worker speaks either romanian or polish and nobody speaks a word of english it should be illegal or their should atleast be something in place to prevent non english speaking workers from being let into the country let alone be given jobs ordering english people around in a language we have no intention of learning.
bad,"No experience I could transfer over. Bosses check bathroom breaks on all employees. Work is literally a revolving door of employees, positions and places to work change mostly every day. No guarantee you get to work on what you enjoy. Employees are treated as disposable."
bad,"If you are a young outgoing person you will do good. If you are older and do your job and do not buddy up to the Managers you will be stuck in the worst places even if you are trained in others. The new pretty girls get the easy jobs. AMAZON SUCKS, WORST PLACE EVER TO WORK."
bad,È un lavoro dove ti fanno contratti di 3 mesi perché in quei tre mesi ti spremono come delle arance e poi non rinnovano il contratto. Una vergogna! Schiavismo è quello non lavoro!
bad,"Bad Supervision! "
bad,"This is a hateful place to work.  Humans are despised and treated far worse than the machinery.  Also, you will be lied to and retaliated against if you suffer an injury and it turns into a Workers Compensation claim."
bad,Ready to work 13 hours days? and manage everything? only to find out that everything is driven by politics? and not actual performance? then Amazon Sort Center is for you!
bad,"moneys not bad, long days but you only work 4 days a week. not a bad short term stay but i would continue to look for another job. work is easy but tedious ran more like a production line then other picking packing jobs."
bad,"Benefits is great but the pay is not."
bad,"Poor leader and mangers. Very stressful and horrendous. Break time and lucnh time too short. They count ur walking time standing time drinking toilet time in seconds. Horrible, will keep coming with feedback with slightest mistake hard on u. "
bad,"Good candidates are pushed out quickly, there is a big bias in hiring people in recruiting or sales or technical fields. Wrong people are promoted. They need good leaders to lead these teams."
bad,"Normal working hours a day, payment "
bad,Amazon is nothing but a slave driving employer!! They really don't care about their employees! They treat you like you're disposable and do not value your hard work at all! They push you and try to hold you to UNREALISTIC expectations!
bad,Management is horrible and believe writing people up so when peak is over with they could use the write-ups to fire people and they don't like paying unemployment
bad,"My position was repetitive, which I expected, and completely mindless, which I did not, which made it very easy to become lost in thought.  The production rate demanded was nigh-unobtainable with little concern for the employees."
bad,No work/life balance. Long hours. Repetitive movements over long periods of time can cause a great deal of stress and wear and tear on one's body overtime. Several had already filed for WSIB claims. Employee morale is low. Fast turn-over of employees (they come and go).
bad,"It’s hard and it’s modern day slavery, id definitely wouldn’t recommend unless you need the money urgently."
bad,My experience at Amazon was not pleasant  the work hours were strenuous and stressful. Very hard to maintain a family life. Management showed favoritism. Just an overall bad experience.
bad,Sin demasiado exigente con el trabajo hacen muchas presión para el trabajo
bad,"Typical day was spent dealing with the teams discontentedness with each other. My manager who managed this team prior was in over his head as a manager, and handed me his created mess. He was only there and in that position off the backs of others attrition. He never had my back! It's not survival of the fittest but how much your willing to drink the swill. I learned a tremendous amount about myself, people, and Amazon.  Management within AWS Amazon was only concerned with climbing the outgoing bodies to show how aligned they were and then reflecting that data into massaged metrics to validate their role in the machine. They didn't actually listen to the people. All the management I worked with directly including my manager shared from day one how easy it was to be fired if you did not conform and comply to the party line. Amazon's AWS management expectations within this group are to say the least out of touch, and I was told many times, 60 to 70 hour weeks should be the norm for me as a manager. Hardest part of this job was dealing with the ever shifting expectations out of upper management that simply were clueless as to the details of our efforts. The most enjoyable part of my time with this company was the pay! I do not recommend Amazon as an employer, if your mid-management the nightmare is real once you accept the offer and start attempting to manage your team. Let me put it this way, if I had it to do over and know what I know now, they would have to pay me more than quadruple what they did, even to consider it. Other teams, other Amazon managers, I'm sure are better"
bad,You can't say what you really want to say about Amazon because it keeps telling you it's inappropriate language but you can take that in consideration and that will tell you what this company is all about slave driving
bad,"the work environment and conditions are very bad. you work in freezer and very hot place.the only thing they care about is how much u pick, talk about safety but they don't apply any of it."
bad,Worked too hard with not appreciation and the agency get better treated then amazon employees. The benefits you get are great but overall not a great place to work
bad,"If you're looking for a stepping stone to get a big name company on your resume, this will be a good move. But they will work you! No such thing as work life balance."
bad,"Hired as an intern (accounting major), won intern of the year 2017. They lied and all I ever did was answer phones. I had a weekly lie meeting to keep us there. I went 13 months told them to shove it. Shopping is okay although they are a monopoly and are ruining a choice in shopping. Sometimes I don't want to wait and go through shipping hassles but these people are closing stores everywhere. I would never work there again after that treatment. They are a monopoly or soon will be. It needs to be broken up!"
bad,"So decided to take a year off of college and work (burnt out). So i applied at the Perris/Ont-6 location and got hired as a Packer(put stuff in the boxes). The job was a super easy to do and actually not that unpleasant. "
bad,"Too many managers, not enough workers. No one fully knows protocol. Work 4 days straight, off 3 days straight. Easy to get hired. Lots of VTO if you ever want to go home early without getting a point."
bad,While I enjoy working with most of my co-workers. The environment is awful. There is no guarantee of hours you are pitted against your fellow employees to fight for shifts. Trying to talk to the manager is met with well there is no guarantee you will get a shift. Unless you like this ruthless type of environment I do not recommend this job for anyone who actually needs the income to survive as there is no guarantee you will work.
bad,"La mia esperienza presso lo ship dock in outboud di Amazon, in Torrazza Piemonte, mi ha permesso di comprendere quanto sia stata pensata bene quest'azienda a cui non servono grandi professionalità né tra i diretti né tra gli indiretti ma che è gestita in maniera ""mafiosa"" dai manager e lead. Questi preferiscono assegnare i lavori meno gravosi sempre alle stesse risorse che, normalmente, sono anche quelle più pratiche in quanto presenti in azienda da maggior tempo, svantaggiando il lavoro di tutto il gruppo e mettendo in difficoltà l'intero processo infatti, a mio avviso, sarebbe opportuno smistarli in tutte le postazioni dello ship affiancandogli i meno esperti."
bad,I just don’t get hours scheduled  I wish I did   They haven’t scheduled me any hours for months. There is no H.R. or anyone I can talk to at this company
bad,Lavoro creato per spremere le persone con un ricambio ciclico attenzione al limite della legalità.
bad,"Amaoz is a great place to work if you're not trying to make a career out of it. Without a degree you start off as an associate. Pays great and good benefits, but the managers do not care about the associates, they only care about your numbers which make them look better"
bad,"In the typical Amazon fashion - be prepared to start ""Day 1"" with a packet and your will to learn. The company is not a place for the faint at heart but you can make the most of it (if in the right group)."
bad,"You are just a number at amazon, and they will not hesitate to fire anyone over the smallest thing. I worked with an elderly lady in the receive department, and she was literally about to hit her 5 year milestone. She was told to help the pack department because nobody showed up (which happens often because nobody likes working there), and even though she was there to help and save the managers butts, the didnt even hesitate to terminate her for not making rate. Coincidence? Definitely not. They knew she was going to reap the extra benefits of hitting 5 years, so they did all they could to get her out the door. This kind of thing happens all the time at amazon. Its how they operate on a daily basis."
bad,The work is great the management is not. It's hard work but the time passes quickly. I would never be a picked there though they go through hard times and are always being yelled at or written up.
bad,"Worst job ever and I was full time,lockers on the floor,pathetic parking by staff even though managers ask the staff to reverse in!!!!"
bad,"Stay away from this facility. Poor Management, Health Safety concerns, inappropriate Management interactions. "
bad,"I was hired at Amazon as a Merchandise Packer on August 3rd, 2019.  I applied online and was hired on the spot, no interview, just told me to show up for work.  I'm a Bartender, Makeup Artist and Retail Sales trained, so I've never done this type of physical work before. We were all told in orientation that the 1st month is just for learning and will get faster and better as time goes on, many other coworkers in the same orientation heard this, as well as, we would would have 3 verbal warnings as to low productivity before we ever get 1 single write up. Well this was not true.. I was written up my 2nd week with No verbal warning at all, and even though I was improving every day, the write up was for the week before, that already passed."
bad,"The 1st 2 years I was there, it was one of the best places I had ever worked. We went through a few reorganization’s but made it through. Than in February of 2019 things went down hill fast. They began merging the fulfillment centers with the sort centers and it was like mixing oil and water.  They brought in leadership from operations to run maintenance and with no knowledge of what they were doing,  along decisions of the direction that maintenance should go.  Bad decision.   Down hill ever since."
bad,stressful environment with ridiculous standards.management was harsh and did not much care to hear the problems on the line. Also they will cheat you out of workmens comp even i its an open and shut case.
bad,"My day at work involved minimal communication with others, as cliques were already formed and people were not willing to involve or help me in any way, even when asked numerous times."
bad,Hard work was never acknowledge. Very political environment. Management barely helped out. Lack of guidance. Management frequently lied to associates promising opportunities that never unrealistic.
bad,"Delivered packages for Christmas season. Was very inconsistent, a real mess to get straight answers. Not a place I would work again. Just all around bad experience."
bad,"Amazon is a ""brutal and intense"" workplace environment. I do not recommend anyone working in their harsh working conditions, young or old.Their ongoing monitoring of employees is out of George Orwell's 1984 novel."
bad,"My review is honestly really low just because I feel that Amazon handled letting me go very unprofessionally. I worked perfectly fine, ramped up very quickly had meetings booked the next day. That afternoon I got a call saying I was getting my contract terminated with no reason given. I think there are better ways to handle this, for the individual to improve if it was their issue or if this issue was budget-related who knows."
bad,"Was there for 3 years and tried to advance my career and was shot down all the time. They find small reasons to let you go, there is little to no heating/air conditioning, management is beyond terrible, if you are good at your job you are punished, they took away our stock bonuses, you couldn't even use the bathroom in fear of losing your job."
bad,The most stressful sales associate job i’ve ever had. Management had little care for decent scheduling. Expect extreme burnout and an ever worse culture expecting you to be a workaholics.
bad,"First week is great."
bad,I worked extremely hard for Amazon only to be treated like my health doesn’t matter. Amazon has unfair practices. You can never get use to a manager because they all quit. The hours are long. Bathroom breaks are short due to write ups.
bad,"The job itself isn't hard however rates are a HUGE focus.   The management could have been better. Amazon would roll out a new work procedure that management couldn't figure out how to implement which would negatively impact the workers rates. Biggest issues for me was equipment being broken every week and downstack when lines went down. If you're hired as full-time the benefits make the job worth it. PTO, UPT, health and dental on DOH etc. BUT if you are anything less than full time I wouldn't recommend the headache."
bad,"Amazon laid off  our entire shift after 90 with out advance notice and Mangers has no accountability "
bad,"Before you even start with the company you are told it’s ‘compulsory overtime’ this is unlawful as in your contract you either opt in to do over a certain amount of hours or you opt out of working over a certain amount of hours. Very shady from the get go, the wages are ONLY for full time people who are taken on with amazon, NOT agency. Treated like a dog, enticing people who are from different countries with a high wage but know full well they’re going to be used. Unlawful agency, this is also a documentary on dispatches, this includes boohoo.com too. Be warned."
bad,"Hi..."
bad,Amazon pay is good but some people are lazy they don’t wanna do the work and want you to do it yourself mangers never help when you first start they don’t train you just expect you to jump right in
bad,"No comments"
bad,"In your first months in the company, you are mainly trained on the leadership principles, which feels like a total brainwash. After you ramp up, people expect you to put in crazy hours, even if you don't see value in what you're doing. If you start complaining too much, they will put you on a so-called ""coaching plan"" or ""personal improvement plan"", to make you feel like you are a total failure and they are only there to help you perform at your best. In reality, they are putting even more pressure on you and if you don't hit the targets, they will have a valid case to fire you."
bad,"The first day the supervisors let you know they dont care about you, all they want is for their numbers to look good. And the pace is relentless. Like I had supervisors call off lunch breaks to get packages sorted. Plus they will tell at you for not storing fast enough, as if anything is ever fast enough for them. Also, shift bonuses dont get added on until 2 years on the job, and you wont get off night shift for 3 years. This place isnt as good as they make it slynd."
bad,Favoritism is very alive at Amazon. Management is friendly but nothing changes. Everyone I know can not wait to leave Amazon. All past employees are happy they left.
bad,"It's like working on a plantation,.ridiculous quotas to meet.very hot environment in the summer.. & no reconition for the good work you do, they're so busy trying ti nic pic on what they expect from you they overlook or just don't reconize the good work you do. I Back, knees, & feet hurt everyday from working this job.. It's very disorganized & the Managers conflicts with their Ambassadors on how much our quotas suppoed to be.. I was given 3 different quotas by 3 different ppl in one day.. The manager & 2 ambassadors told me something different .. They're not on the same page at the same time.. The most disorganized place I've ever worked!!!"
bad,"Unless you are desperate to get benefits and do not care about getting paid a minimum wage then do not work here. Management is terrible and no respect is shown to the employees. Expect to get injured often on the job trying to meet the rates you need to keep your job. Cannot make the rates? Its okay, management will write you up for it. First time, stays on your record for 1 month, second time 2 months, third time you get fired and no sympathy is given. You want to work around others that get promoted before you because the managers like them more than you, work for Amazon, they will never promote you. Want to work somewhere where any complaints, problems or solutions stated to higher management gets ignored? Work for Amazon. If you want to feel like a slave again or love feeling like you are incarcerated, work for Amazon. If that did not win you over then just get hired and then quit. Leave after you see the truth of how Amazon treats their employees. Leave with no compensation or sympathy like every other ex-amazon worker and extreme hatred for a brand you once thought was great. If I could give Amazon 0 stars I would gladly do so."
bad,If you like being treated as a 5 year old this is the place for you. Indy is the worst. If you go to work and work beyond the limit people in charge will throw you under the bus and take all respect you had for yourself.
bad,Management does not care about their associates just the numbers. You do not get to sit down at all just the continuous motion of breaking down the boxes of returns and identifying what is resellable or not. Many immigrants are treated unfair and you would think that they would have all languages represented in the HR to help these people but they don't. I am really shocked that for such a big company they treat their worked very poorly. I would not recommend this to anyone but sadly a lot of people need the $15 an hour so they would take the abuse.
bad,When u apply to amazon warehouse  just know u don’t get to pick what department u work in they choose it for u and if u can’t pack 2600 packages a day then don’t bother so that’s 260 packages a hour u would need to do and if u are falling behind the managers walk around with tablets and stuff telling u u behind and where u need to be this job was dehumanizing and humiliating wouldn’t recommend
bad,"[They] sell you a bill of goods to work there and for your training period, it seems that way but once your done training and go out on your own, you get a VERY different picture on how it really works... I was there there when you were given stock but [they] took that away too."
bad,"You are essentially a human robot. The company doesn't care about the morale, well-being or work life balance of it's emoloyees. You are there to be a drone and hit your numbers, which are ever increasing. Management expects you to do more with less. Pay isn't worth the physical strain you put on your body. Insurance is good."
bad,Management has no control over department. People eat drink all in factory when it’s not allowed. People eat on forklifts while driving. Over worked and need new management.
bad,all of the bad things from america and none of the good. treated very badly and once the rush is over they short time you till you leave so not a long term job
bad,"The fast-pace environment seemed okay at first, but once holiday season comes around, the environment is shifted and the labor demand is ridiculous as well of the mandatory OT."
bad,"La empresa esta dirigida por crios elitistas inexpertos (AM) donde tratan a los trabajadores como herramientas prescindibles... mucho vender cultura amazon, mucho have fun pero la verdad que te  exprimen lo que pueden y cuando ya no te necesitan te despiden como un perro..."
bad,"Started working here 6 months after a back operation, told me they would work around my needs if I accept the position. Once there they didn't do anything they said they would. Managers always on your case to hit targets and even got team leaders to watch you if you was falling behind a little. They asked me to become an instructor after just 3 weeks of working there, they would take me off my station and ask me to instruct, then tell me I'm not hitting my targets so need to go back only to pull me back off 30 mins later. You get 2 30 min breaks, if you work on 4th floor and bring your own lunch by the time u get down to your locker then into the canteen you only actually have 15-20 mins as u have to be back on the floor you was working on by the time the bell rings. They do mandoratry overtime and sometimes tell you a day before, you have to have a good excuse and proof to not do the overtime. From beginning of november until end December i was working 55 hours over 5 days. The job is far too stressful."
bad,Horrible working environment. The only positive is the health coverage. Very stressful. 3 minutes to use restroom before possible write ups. 10 1/2 hours shifts turn into 12. No time for a family and the pay isn't so good due to being in a higher tax bracket. I made just as much when I was 13$ ph vs the 15$ ph
bad,"I don’t not recommend this job to people with family because it’s too time consuming, and to the people with weak health or problems with health because they will not care and will fire you because of rate."
bad,"I am currently a seasonal stower and working seasonal prime for about 2 months now. When I first applied, I figure it was a physically demanding job since it was a warehouse job after all but was not expecting everything else. Management micromanage and focus on stowing as fast as you can. They have a long list of safety rules to follow but to stow fast, it's really hard to follow them. The pod bins are ALWAYS 90% full, so if you have boxes or single items, good luck trying to fit them in. A lot of untrained water spiders who don't properly put things on your sled so you have to rearrange your sled every time they add new boxes which then affect your rate time. A LOT of favoritism for those who has low rates. Not sure how people are getting 5 to 8 sec rates when at my fastest I'm at 10 sec. "
bad,"Amazon is a high stress production based company,that looks to terminate an individual. Amazon is not a long term employer. an employee is constantly watched and bathroom breaks are timed and if producing it is time off task ""TOT"" and 25 min of TOT is a write up .Amazon focus's more on terminating a employee than helping good employees be successful."
bad,Not with my time. I do not refer anyone to work for this company.  The management in the company do not support the associates. Everyone takes care of themselves. This company is not a team.
bad,"Always changing ways to make the sort shift more challenging, this company cares about the customer's needs (even that in question sometimes) but for the employee well beings, we are the last to be acknowledged on how hard we work."
bad,It was a fast paced environment and you had to work  very hard I bid not like it I would not like to work for them......................................
bad,"Aucun respect pour les  chauffeurs livreurs. Certains ""petits"" responsables se croient arriver au sommet. Se targuant d'être chez eux en s'adressant à un chauffeur livreur sous traitant. Une véritable cité sous la couverture d'une entreprise. De véritables cas sociaux de part et d'autres. Une véritable volonté d'humilier des gens qui travaillent sous leurs ordres. Ignorance totale de la  notion du respect."
bad,Modern day slavery at the very best! No work life balance and be wary on all the incentives. It’s a way to trap people who are desperate and have no other options but to stay and suffer. Very unrealistic expectations from leadership and set up to fail on a daily basis. No help from HR either...they’re there to make your job even harder. If you don’t have a family and willing to grind it out until you don’t have anything left to offer...then this is a place for you. If you like backstabbing people and throw people under the bus.. then this is a place for you!  Not worth it!!! Be wary!!!
bad,"Managers need to be trained to handle a team because humans are not machines"
bad,The management that is there treats you horrible honestly. They talk down to you and expect you to just sit there and take it as if you’re a dog. Not a company I recommend people to go to
bad,It’s a very chaotic environment. If your productivity is not 100% you’re at risk for a write up. Managers suck and you will get a new one constantly. All jobs are repetitive.
bad,The management is terrible can listen to music just work you like slave everything is about a rate that’s all they care about you ask to go to bedroom they time you then write you up
bad,"Hired as seasonal with the possibility of being hired in as a regular after several months. Worked 40hrs a week but sometimes forced to pick up extra hours. If u don’t pick them up the extra hours, they will assign them to you. You have to watch your hours and time carefully, their computer system constantly messed up so make sure you try to login early. The amount of work and knowledge you have to know for the amount of pay you receive doesn’t match. Especially when you work for one of the richest me in the world. You could only gain unpaid time off. My team started with 40 and dropped to 6 when I left. High turnover rate as the company has no value for its employees."
bad,"I would not recommend Amazon to anyone with a family. If you are new in your career, work there for 4 years and get out. Amazon works you 60+ hours a week and they scoff at you if you want to work a little less. Your kid has a baseball game? Too Bad. Amazon is more important. I cannot stress enough how bad of a place it is to work."
bad,Dont ever work there. Its plain and simple the worst job ive ever had. And im 50 so that says it all. Corporate is a joke. Regional is a joke and the plant management an even bigger joke. Amazon policy for production is almost discriminatory.  You're set up to get fired from write ups from day one. No one should have to despise the company they work for
bad,"I loved this job, but Amazon outsourced work to DSP,. We come in stand around for hours.  Were hired as seasonal, so  not eligible for unemployment. Quality of life is seriously negatively affected because you never no when Amazon will let you go. The moral is low at the station. Most  us are surprise Amazon  doesn't care about their dedicated drivers.care"
bad,What a horrible place to work they paid us late lied to us about our pay took perks away from top drivers because the owner wanted more money horrible equipment broken vans missing mirrors broken GPS
bad,"You will feel like a robot while working at  Amazon."
bad,"To be honest , I have lost my respect for Amazon because of my experience and the toxic culture. "
bad,Not a good company to work at Amazon only care about production not the health conditions of the employees mandatory overtime only a 30 minute lunch break for a 7pm to 5am shift
bad,"MANAGEMENT AND THEIR ABILITY COMPANY WIDE TO DELEGATE OVERTIME IS HORRIBLE! Overtime is mandatory when they require it but night shift will get ""voluntary time off"" because day shift busts their butt and vice versa. I quit after struggling with their HR for A MONTH because I had to file for leave and apparently filed for medical leave when I needed personal and WAS DENIED because I switched the type of leave/needed a different type of leave as I wasn't intending on seeking paid leave! So, they denied me for wanting unpaid leave and then denied me AGAIN because they didn't see it as medical and then AGAIN because the leave was filed after the matter because I was attempting to change the type of leave IGNORING that I had filed the original on the date I was absent! After ALL of that nonsense, I went into negative time, meaning I'd be fired if I showed up. To top things off, their expectations of me were to process 15 items an hour, but all of their ""experienced"" staff ""cherry picks"", meaning I got all of the awful items that took more time to process, no matter what I did, causing my numbers to always be low as I was having to discard things that were ABSOLUTELY disgusting, including but not limited to a Keurig that had COCKROACHES in it.. Mind you, someone I knew who got hired in at the same time as me cherry picked incessantly (taking all of the items that were easy to process- i.e. lightweight, brand new sellable, etc.) and ended up being a manager in the same period of time I was there...which would've been fine if the person hadn't been hitting on management and somehow"
bad,this was a stressful place lots of changes different rules everyday poor management communication to associates did not work with you on swapping days
bad,"The workplace that I work is was very terrible. Breaks for my shift are nonexistent. The pay would be nice if the hours were there. The managers at the site are terrible and they abused their power everyday. The managers use favoritism for the people they liked and disliked, this lead into employees shafting one another to get favored. If the employee was a good looking female, she was looked at and harrassed on an everyday basis. Good looking females got the hours and was allowed to take breaks most of the time where the rest of the employees were not allowed. All the managers used a ""clique"" group to determine who was favored and abused those who not favored to do extra if not all the work.Management did make it hard for 95% of the staff. When accidents happened they were not willing to say anything or even get help for the people unless that person stop working. Most of the time managers would come by just to antagonize the employees that they did not like. Most of time people just left to go back home instead of dealing with managers or their assistants. I can only speak about the site that I am at, and reason being is that everytime I wanted to transfer to a better site that has hours they stopped the transfer or would try to threaten or fire me before the transfer could go through. The air during processing was not something anyone should breath in. When a person is in the trucks unloading, processing boxes through the ""sort slide"" it would make people cough and make breathing very labored. The company states that the air quality is fine, they only said that when the building"
bad,"It has good pay, but they have random drug test as well as pre employment drug test. You will fail if you smoke marijuana or have it in your system even if it is legal in your state. Its just weird some people will not get a job for smoking marijuana, but it as legal in massachusetts as alcohol and cigarettes. If you are not testing for those 2 dangerous drugs, then why are you denying jobs for people who smoke marijuana?"
bad,I had the worst experience working at Amazon - I do not recommend this company to anyone. While there are great teams and solid folks in the organization - leadership and common sense is lacking in a big way.
bad,"No job security, racism within staff, very poor management.  managers don't care about workers. Vans were often fully loaded, making working hours long and stressful. Lots of favouritism going on at Amazon. The company needs to employ managers who genuinely care about the well being of their staff. Lots of people coming and then leaving very quickly. Money does look good at the start but then the management somehow find a way to take money of your wages due to ""some damage"" seen on the vans when they were clearly caused by the people who used to load and unload vans but were unfairly blamed on the delivery drivers. When I talk about Amazon, I am talking about the delivery warehouse and depots."
bad,"Work is fast paced, but seem to me if they want you to scan 250 per hour than you should not have to scan box and route each time.  Something is definitely missing from a logistics stand point.  Management in Baton Rouge, Louisiana sucks.  No communication except yelling about  keeping up numbers on scanning.  All of the bad management goes away when they need you to stay because things weren't covered.  But because of how they speak to Individuals, guess what, no dice we are out the door.  You get more being good and fair than being nasty with a bad attitude."
bad,"A meat grinder that will grind you up and spit you out when it is done with you, zero concern for any medical condition. Will refuse any doctors note and will fire you without notice if you do not meet their standard. Amazon is the equivelant of a dystopia."
bad,if you never work in a warehouse this job is not for you this job will make you lose your mind and $15-17 an hour was a joke they deduct so much taxes the management team swear they were there for you in reality they don't care. they expect way to much i started losing my mind and my sanity
bad,Working at amazon you have to be ok with working in a location that is very competitive. Its like working in a college frat house you work for managers that don't have manager experience.
bad,i was working for tl transportation and that is the worst company to work the supervisor and the dispatcher and team leader are sucks they think they having slave they giving u 14 or 19 route about 300 stop a day when u not even finish at 7PM and u came come back when the dispatcher calling you is about 8 or 9pm they dont care if u call them to let them know u have to many stop to finish the route they told u dont take decision here they are and keep working till they call you. this place is in Henrietta ny .i am not recommended to any body to work for delivery driver THE PEOPLE WORKING FOR AMAZON NOT BAD THANKS I HOPE THEY FIXED THIS PROBLEM WITH THE CONTRACT COMPANY FOR DELIVERY
bad,Strict work environment with constantly changing goals making it more and more difficult to keep up with the work load. No medical staff at all on night shoft with strong favoritism towards day shift. Rude managers and HR reps making work much more difficult due to lack of respect and effort on their parts to help amd aid employees.
bad,They treat their employees poorly. The working conditions are extremely hot. they do not get back to employees in a timely manner when assistant is needed.
bad,"I thought I would be able to work my way up. I currently have a engineering degree. As a teir 1 employee advancements are very difficult to achieve. There is a lot of favoritism within the network. What they ask you not to do in the orientation videos happens often. Longevity at Amazon doesn't happen often. This job is geared toward the youth and temporary employment. If your a college student in need of some quick money for tuition, books, car, or spending, this is the job for you. If your a hard worker looking for a career, keep seeking other employment. I was very disappointed to find how they treat their teir 1 employee's. My hope is that Amazon is forced to make changes in how their advancements are structured. Maybe the EEOC needs to step in and take a look at how things operate from a longevity perspective. If you read this review in it's entirety. Thank you."
bad,"Mind numbing work and horrible management. You were not a person, just the number of boxes you packed per hour. The work environment reminded me of high school. If you weren't best friends with management then your chances of even the smallest promotion was non exsistent."
bad,It was just a temporary job. it is very hard to get a job through the company. I was let go just after peak ended. I need job security something amazon was not giving me.
bad,Amazons lunch area needs some work and the bathrooms need to be better cleaning. The managers need better people skills training on how to treat and to talk to employees like people not inmates in a prison camp or on your back for using the bathroom.
bad,"company where the manager turnover rate is higher than employee turnover. They bring in new managers to lead 100+ associate departments that are fresh out of college, no experience what so ever. Most managers dont know the job they are leading, but they do know how to find you if your rate is low according to their laptop screen. They dont care about what you have done for them in the past or any projects you have done for them. You are just a number and you are replaced before you even make it to the parking lot on your last day. Would never work here again."
bad,"Hours were ridiculous, the pay was ok if you counted RSU's which they dubbed their ""Golden Leash."" Upper management looked out for itself and no one else. There was absolutely no accountability among peers or senior management. Broken promises and idealistic goals are the foundation of Amazon."
bad,"Being an amazon driver sucks it’s just a pay check. They switch our routes every day. So when you go In you never know where you will be. They will give you a rural route with 150+ stops usually more with a lot of stops grouped  together.  Most of those stops will be 6 mins apart with some as much as 15 mins apart. The require you to take at least a 30 minute lunch which is impossible with the amount of work they give you. The faster you work the more stops they will ad on you. In Charlotte we are only making $15 an hour and that is with delivery experience which is highway robbery. We were told when we were hired by our sap that we would get paid for 10 hours no matter if we finished earlier. That changed when he changed his mind we only get paid for the hours we work. They monitor everything you do inside of the amazon vans (seatbelt clicks, phone calls, speeding, braking, Turning) EVERYTHING.  Some many crazy rules in station we can’t go to the bathroom in station once we load our vans we have to go to the gas station down the street.  There are so many more bad things I could say but I will leave stop it right here."
bad,"Driving for amazon was awful, we were given ridiculous amounts of stops (170+) per day. If we took too long we were in trouble and to make good time I had to run up to doors and back to my van. I ended up straining myself to much and was put out of work for a week.  I was even helping other drivers deliver from time to time. I had called out sick once and was messaged by my managaer to return my badge and vest the next day. Needless to say ZERO job security. If you work for Amazon you're just another tool to them."
bad,Horrible management. Fun coworkers. Slave driver environment. They don’t care about their employees one bit. No way to advance. No pay increase for skills obtained to better the company. Lies on top of lies.
bad,"I was employed at the BOS7 Fall River facility since it opened as a basic Tier 1 employee and was promoted to Tier 3 Outbound Shipping Clerk within the first month or two. Most Tier 1 associates have rates to hit or else they risk being fired. Tier 3 associates are expected to show up early and stay late, as well as skipping the 2 paid breaks. I regularly was unable to take lunch on time due to responsibilities, which leads to others complaining to management. "
bad,The people where promised a good safe environment but the only thing held to the promise was the pay and safe work place other then that it was favoritism and no one really caring about the job it was always left for someone else to take care of
bad,"As soon as you get to the station to load up your van your being rushed to load it up as fast as you can by 30 minutes. It’s not that easy with 15+ other drivers doing the same thing with amazon employees getting your way and all the empty racks in your way. Then the always give you around 150-230 stops but it’s actually more then that since they like to group your stops, for instance if you get to apartments they’ll group 1 stop, so it would be 1 stop but with 6 different  address and it normally takes about 30 minutes to deliver that and that’s just one stop. You don’t have time to take lunch or breaks or you’ll be put  behind and half to be rescued  Which makes you look bad. It’s hard to use the bath room cus it’s a waste of time driving 10 minutes out to go to a bathroom so you half to resort to peeing in bottles in the back of the van. Overall it’s a stress full job, it wouldn’t it be so bad if they didn’t group your stops or give you so many packages. It’s 250+ packages you need to deliver on the daily."
bad,"I believe I am above average when it comes to work ethics and ability to work hard. Amazon will beat their tier one employees into the ground. Rarely did I leave the building after a full shift without major pain. Turnover rate is high because they write people up if they do not meet unrealistic expectations for quality and speed. They have so many rules that it was common to see all new faces each week as they terminate for ridiculous and petty reasons. "
bad,"Suicide metrics, garbage management, breaks and lunch are a joke. Of the things the company wanted, i told my supervisor to take thier standards and shove it."
bad,Ich würde nicht noch einmal freiwillig dort arbeiten wollen.
bad,"Amazon is truly one of the worst companies I've worked for because they time every little thing you do. It's micromanaging to the next level. Plus it should be illegal to have a person use an order picker for 10 hours a day. Standing in one spot all day with mind numbing work."
bad,Management straight out of college. No people skills and they don't train them for it either. Everything is about the numbers. You are not a person there. HR was a joke and so was the so called medics on site. They believe any injury can be fixed with Biofreeze.
bad,"My first day there in the afternoon a manager said my count was down at 54. Huh? She said I need to improve. The next day in the morning she said I was at 67. Huh? That afternoon they moved me to a station with a slow computer terminal. She came by and said 45. I asked what she meant. She said I had to have an average of 120 scans an hour. Lol. Do the job with little training, broken bar codes and 4 to 5 different bar codes per box. Guess which one actually works and if they do not page a manager. But you still need to do 120. Lazy Amazon employees who won't pick up big boxes. I moved to a different section and boy did that manager stare at me. My work out put increased a lot then other things happened. They changed my schedule with out posting it. Changed my group ID with telling me. I went in on what I thought was my overtime time day and wasn't told it changed. I could go on. Like I said, managers have their targets. I left the company after 2 weeks and went to a different job. Oh the horror stories you read about in business News is true. Especially the peeing part. I saw that first hand. No talking. One person asked another employee what time it was and got yelled at. All this if you were hired through the local agency. Real Amazon employees get a more relaxed atmosphere. A lot of people quit in my 2 weeks."
bad,"They work you like a slave, managers don’t show interest all the care about are the numbers. always on your feet for over 10 hours if you stop and talk for more than 3 mins you get written up! People are scared to go to the bathroom because of how far it is from the mods"
bad,"I have never worked for a company that had so many issues.  Very political and cutthroat, your judged not by performance but by who high up you buddy up with.  Not a good place to collaborate, engage and enjoy the work experience.  Interview process is a joke. Over 50% of technical employees leave after 2 years , due to extreme stress and non existent work/life balance.  If your looking to get your first engineering or development job, good place to start and put on your resume...and then go find a company that actually cares about their employees"
bad,"there was a complete lack of human compassion.The management couldn't see past the monitor on their laptops.  The culture was one of lemmings.  They hire the poorest people and barrage them with passive aggressive threats regularly in order to maintain in human numbers.  There is no compensation for them burning out an individual.  to them you are nothing more than collateral damage as a cost of doing business,"
bad,This job was supposed to be a means to an end.  There were advertisements for job advancement and then they were withdrawn. I was not going to stay in an entry level position for another year hoping I will be provided with opportunists to advance out of a very boring job.
bad,"The San Marcos FC was supposed to be a culmination of all they've learned from their previous FCs. They set several conveyors on fire during ""Peak"" season. They didn't have enough equipment for everyone when they filled the building. They demanded 60 hours during the holidays and the day after Christmas started sending people home with VTO, voluntary time off. When I was initially hired they took weeks to get back to me with my next steps and then they had processed my information incorrectly. When I arrived at my orientation they wanted me to confirm my schedule, it was wrong, they told me I had to go home and reapply and start the process over again. In the process they told me that the schedule I had originally signed up for was unavailable. It was a very frustrating position that rewarded speed over quality."
bad,"they were the worst ever in my eyes unorganized and very unprofessional"
bad,"too many parcels,insane loading time,concessions,have to deliver all parcels in any weather.only left with little money after diesel and van cost. to many to mention."
bad,Don’t work there! They work you to death. Management is a joke! All they care about is numbers. Get written up for numbers when there isn’t any work coming in.
bad,"Working at the Chesapeake location was okay during the holidays, since we were able to work any hours needed to get by (what with Peak season); but after the holidays we were constantly flexing down, the amount of routes lessened, and the people starting early everyday cut into the other associates' time/money. Also, a good portion of the remaining associates are still considered seasonal with no benefits, and management continuously dodges our questions about conversion."
bad,"Management primarily consisted of kids that just graduated college. There is no way to directly contact your hub, you are directed to an 800 line in India. If you were sick you had to use a vacation day. Poor communication between management and employees. Hazardous work environment."
bad,"HR department lacks diversity and inclusion. Almost everyone is female. Forget about leadership principles, they only promote you if they like you as a person."
bad,used a seasonal employee missed all family activities of Christmas season to be let go in the middle of January.  Used to take high volume high stress calls during Christmas season and then let go.
bad,"Don’t trust DIN2 in Gary, Indiana! They hire delivery drivers as seasonal workers, but they eligible to become blue badge, they laid you off without notice. They run the seasonal hire scam to get you to risk your safety delivering for them. DIN2 management can careless about drivers safety, drivers get bite by dogs, guns pull on them, and sliding into ditches when the weather is bad. They only care about delivering packages even if it costs your life. I worked in 2 fulfillment centers which were cutthroat, but at least we had better job security. Run it’s better options out here."
bad,"My experience with Amazon is they have a unique culture of work hard and play hard. Everybody that gets an interview automatically gets a temporary job offer. I took on average 35-40 calls over an 8 hour shift. Management is incredibly strict that even one bad call will get you written up. I did not like Amazon, they do not value or recognize their employees hard work and friendly relations with customers over the phone."
bad,"If you ever get offered a job here, just don't! its the worse place i have ever worked, Management treat you so bad and when HR is approached to resolve the situation they just don't care."
bad,"Typical day at work is your manager finds an area where they know you struggle and attempt to get their worker fired because they don't need you after Christmas. Managers play favorite and HR is a joke. The people who get hurt and do workmans comp are continually harassed into quitting before the claim goes through. Luckily for me I never got hurt and was enjoying the job for about 5-6 months before managment changed and the new managers didn't like me and about 6-7 other workers, out of 10 total. Since then there's only 2 people (including me) who haven't been fired or quit from their harassment. I don't know what's keeping me here but obviously I'm on indeed so clearly im not trying to stay"
bad,"if you are looking to advance in the company good luck, unless you are flirting with managers you are not moving up or changing positions. Also the force you to work overtime you will never have time for your family. My son was killed while I was employed with Amazon they only gave me 3 days off because I was a holiday worker. Then after I was let go because I asked for more time off."
bad,"If you're looking for a place where leadership is defensive, in-the-box, and full of the Amazonian cool aid that keeps employees indentured to the oddest set of values I've seen in my entire 20 year career, come here and try to last 12 months."
bad,"I was harassed daily by management, we were severely overworked, And I even went into a state of depression while working there, but since it pays my bills I had no choice but to suffer."
bad,Cutthroat work culture every person for themselves. Co-workers will trip you up to get an advance before you do. Bad attitudes and immature behavior. Management unorganized and lacking leadership character.
bad,working 10 hours every single minute very stressful. managers are do not care about people in a human way. we work like robots with sit time to eating. target very high. the system very strict. it's very hard to improve. managers control improvement. compulsory over time
bad,"If you are a Picker they will get rid of you after two years unless you are in a diverse minority group. I was told that by employees being reprimanded and terminated out of their jobs when I hired on. I refused to believe it; assured that my work ethic and speed would secure my position. I was wrong. As I approached that 2 year mark working through breaks, not going to the bathroom and rarely stopping to drink water could save me. I was moving so fast the light sensors often failed to detect me forcing me to work in the dark.  Still, I could no longer make rate. It didn't make sense. I was being reprimanded out my job and my managers were asking me if I needed to be retrained. It was humiliating. I did figure it out before I was terminated for not making rate. Management contends the 'pick paths' (the routes your handheld scanner directs you to take which could be good, fair or bad) are determined by algorithms relayed by the home office in Bombay...or wherever. Not so. There are different levels of the same pick path and managers and assistants delegate these through laptop computers. I caught them red-handed and furthermore, I contend that should be illegal. Here's why: 1.) Amazon is creating the situation whereby you cannot make rate. 2.)  Amazon will then terminate your employment. 3.) Amazon will then deny your unemployment benefits because you did not make rate. Why 2 years? Our stocks are maturing then and most of us sell them then in a futile bid to save our jobs. I did in vain. Maybe Amazon fears repetitive stress injuries after that time span. I do not know. I do"
bad,"Hired anyone they could. People that didn't want to be there and just stood around for a paycheck. Management wasn't held responsible for making hires work. Lied to the workers about shipments coming in. Would flex down/let people go for the evening and then have 3 trucks arrive, ""without notification""."
bad,"First is not for woman beacuse the first  thing  they tell you, there is no bathrooms  and to look 4 one you can lose the track of delivery. For  man to P they do it  in bottles for us woman is different, with the black Amazon vans you could P inside but with  the rentals nope  they are clear all over also you got 2 have between  160 to 200 stops daily so you really got 2 run cause is not even in order it takes back an fore for the delivery they tell you you do 10 hours and you have time not true. You go in the Morning  get the van key then go get where they parked come back wait 4 your turn you loose between 1hr 2 1and half the with all those stops you got 2 b back by 8:30 or 9:00 pm is heavy  specially on holidays dont b on time they could fired you for that. 4 my opinion is horrible worst experience  ever good luck 2 anyone."
bad,They had very little training and didn't care if you got hurt or not. Very faced paced environment. Took and watched your every move..people were coming and going
bad,"Amazon Peterborough is the worst place one can ever work at. "
bad,They are poorly managed the managers constantly lie they dont like to transfer people to other facilities and tend to write you up if you put in a transfer and it's always about numbers I think they care more about numbers then quality
bad,It’s the only place I’ve ever worked for they try to control you by fear. I had False accusation said  against me. I was told when I was written up even though they said I was a hard workerAccording to them that I was too nice and help to many people are you kidding me what kind of culture is that. The rates Stupid how could you be read it on something that there are so many tangents affecting your rate never work for the post office won’t work here
bad,"Management sucks, favoritism, very unprofessional, dont work here people just want to fire you... Specially if you work harder then them and if the operators like you.. They hate it.. Because they think your going take they're job... To much stress.  I hated them and gave them a piece of theyre own medicine."
bad,"That quote was what I was told in my first week. Should of been a warning. I am a hard worker. After my first month my rate was always 115%-125%. Instead of them saying good job was always told ""100% plus is just the minimum , good workers do 150% and over consistently "". That's impossible!! No and I mean NO bathroom breaks. You either choose to waste your lunch using the bathroom or do the disgusting thing like others did and urinate in bottles. The one day I worked my butt off and did 130%, at one point I sat to twist/crack my back towards the end of my shift (took 15 seconds) and the next day I was notified I was written up for unauthorized break for doing that. Everytime they make a change production suffers and instead of either keeping it the same or giving workers time to learn and adapt they just give out mass writeups. Its such a revolving door of employees. Most last 6 months or less. This one black guy was an all star. ALWAYS was at 140%+, great personality,  helped when needed. He was ran out by a supervisor that didnt like him.  When he went to upper management with his proof of production and like 50 letters from all of us he was told ""thank you for your time with Amazon but your supervisor said you socialize too much and your 140% could and should of been 160%"". Eventually everyone leaves and they could care less."
bad,Amazon Web Services a company of Amazon.com have 99% white managers at AWS. All managers are hired because of color of their skin. Incompetent leaders
bad,"From start of shift to finish on feet no sitting besides timed breaks which not enough to even get to locker toilet an eat nicely."
bad,"it was fun but not fun at the same time it was just to hard work work to do."
bad,Ridiculously long hours with one 30 minute and one 20 minute break. You are not allowed your phone. Shifts are from 6am-5:30pm. Not able to check on my kids
bad,Amazon will fire you at any given time for non sense reasons. After peak season is up almost everyone in the stow area is on edge about possibly getting laid off for one of the many reasons you can be fired unjustly.
bad,"If you need some quick money untill you find your next job by all means... sign up. but at the same time, you will get sucked into the system and will be at their mercy, by the time you get out of work, you are too exhausted to search or do anything else. They have great benefits though."
bad,Hired full-time but most often not allowed to work full shift.  Sent home frequently due to lack of work.  Unstable income for supporting a family.  Do not recommend.
bad,"very poorly run, stressful environment, working 10 to 12 hours a day no advancement.  Way too many people at peek time.  no markings in parking lot and poor lighting."
bad,"Told you would have 4 hour shift and possibly flex up to 5 hours. With a 15 minute break.  Then repeatedly shift is ended at 3 hours and they look for volunteers to work up to another hour ( 3 plus 1=4) with no break. They tell you "" at shift end keep scanning no break""."
bad,"I have nothing really good to say.  We were overworked, made to work overtime, instead of asked to work it.  It felt like I was only home to sleep and eat, then rite back into the sweatshop."
bad,"Only friendliness there was between workers, I only got to know agency workers, Over 200 were taken in the first couple of days I was there. "
bad,"it was a culture of chewing people up and discarding them like garbage when it fits the company "
bad,"Oohh modern slavery camp - gave the job a go because of the weekly pay I heard. After the screening  & training, placed on the picking department. You got to stand 10 solid hours with rottweilers watching you for targets. Within 2 days on your 10 hours shift you are told you got to achieve 250 items per hour to be picked from the pods onto the totes. What a joke"
bad,"I went through Amazon's mass hiring process, selected my shift based upon my life needs, passed background check, etc and then received a letter stating I was hired and would start at the New Hire Orientation. I showed up as scheduled and was sent home because they were over-booked. Meanwhile, they are trying to make me take a night shift--which I can't work because of obligations, and I had resigned my prior job based upon the confirmation letter to begin working at Amazon. Now, I am unable to pay my bills and keep being told, ""sorry for the inconvenience."" When I call in now they keep telling me I will be scheduled shortly based upon labor needs."
bad,"The rumors you've likely heard are mostly true. Amazon cares about money, not about its employees. Even if you're looking for seasonal or temporary work, don't apply here."
bad,"Worse place to work, treat employees awful, they fire for stupid stuff that's personal and off the clock, they only keep u a bit..if u go to be they blame the situation in u without explanation, huge turn around always"
bad,"Even though I set records and won awards for my production in 3 department, I never felt valued or appreciated. No matter how much you do it never seems to be enough. Managers seem to have a very short tenure. Pay is below iindustry standards. I was there for 6 yrs. Taking the buy out made me happier than I had been in a long time !!!!"
bad,"Very Frugal Business"
bad,"About as bad as everyone says it is. Head managers sit on their a*s and don't know how to do any of the hard work. Run by morons. Constantly underpaid and expected to provide top quality work. Unrealistic expectations AND no bathroom breaks (Time Off Task) provided to ""help"" the workers."
bad,"No work life balance. Payments in an amount that you can´t change or move. Everything cheap as possible. Management without a clue or training - Everything is escalated without answers or in the opposite direction forced downwards without a sense of logic."
bad,"Started as a temp then got made permanent stayed for 2 years then left. The agency staff talk to the temp employees like absolute rubbish and if you happen to go to the toilet more then once you get interrogated by management. Break times are way too short. By the time you got to the canteen it was almost time to head back. Staff need to learn to communicate in English as well, as instructions aren’t always clear. Wouldn’t go back regardless of what was on offer."
bad,I had a very bad experience at Amazon it was very long hours on my feet I asked for a special accommodation of extra two 15-minute breaks per shift they told me to get a doctor's note 2 have a special accommodation okay so I got a doctor's note I brought in the note and immediately they took me out of work telling me I was unable to perform the job I was out of work for a total of a month . With no income I finally was called to go back into work after the holiday Rush was gone all the overtime pay was gone I got back to work and they constantly harass me about my production and told me if I wasn't up to par they would get rid of me too much stress for me I went back to my old job at a different company
bad,"A typical workday consisted of a meeting for 10-15 minutes before starting at the conveyor belts. I learned a lot about the mailing industries. Management didn't really seem professional at all, they would date their employees or hook up with them on a daily basis and everything was just rushed. You were overworked for bad pay. The best part about the job was that my best friend and I applied around the same time so we were both able to work together in a way and encourage each other throughout the shift."
bad,"Long hours and weekend work is expected. At the end of the day, you do not dare to stand up and go home from the office. Workplace culture is built on fear and retaliation. Turnover is huge. You constantly feel that you are not enough. Management constantly test you how much (more) you are able to handle. Unexpected changes happen all the time. You are expected to cope as a good amazonian."
bad,Do not work there. If you get hurt they will kick you out. They do not care about you. Hard had work not worth the pay. Pay is under average for warehouse work.
bad,"Craziness "
bad,"Terrible place to work, High school level gossip, favoritism, Managers and HR fired associates with little to no reason or evidence, high turn over rate, Managers constantly violated safety rules and regulations, little opportunity for advancement."
bad,"Amazons people and co-workers are usually great people. It's the management that needs help in that company. Most of them are very cutthroat, and the only thing they care about is the numbers. They didn't even care that a pregnant woman was in pain bending over to do their counting, they compared it to someone complaining about a sore ankle. Management there lacks any human compassion for anything."
bad,it was a really great place to work but there was no leadership it was no direction every day was crazy trying to get trucks loaded and then get them out on time routes were totally mixed up and when you would try to say something they would get really mad and cut hours or simply let you go
bad,"While working at amazon every day was a stressful and painful day. A typical day (night for me) was always long and hard, my feet, back, and neck would ache due to all the stress it would put on my body and I'm only 19. The only thing i learned about Amazon was how shady they are. Management is a joke because they always hired people who had no idea what on earth they were doing half the time. The workplace was very welcoming. The hardest part of the job was the hours, working nightshift is really tough because the only thing you do all week is sleep and go right back to work. Overall the only thing i really loved about amazon were my coworkers who soon became my friends ."
bad,"Not even worth typing out. Worst job ever. Working FOR and WITH braindead idiots. ""Trainers"" have 1 week of experience. Work habits are dumbed for the worst idiots out there."
bad,"When I first started working here I was excited, but things change quickly. The hours are disgusting. 12 hrs on your feet is down right unbearable. Your back will kill you also. I've been here 10 months I can't count the amount of employees that got fired or quit. Every week you always see 1st day employees walking around. Since I've started I probably saw about 5 ppl leave in an ambulance and that's just on my shift alone. The workload is horrible, managers just walk around with a laptop for 12hrs looking at what is beyond me. They also have PA I guess they are asst managers and every time I see my PAs one is playing with a bouncy ball and the other a rubix cube. What a joke!! Breaks are way too short on a 12hrs shift. Pay is not enough unless you have another job to pay your bills. The workload honestly I really feel like they try to burn you out or collapse on your feet so you quit. I mean they have a amcare which is like a urgent care in the real world but they do nothing except give you Advil or bag of ice. If that's not enough they will call an ambulance for you cause they are not real nurses. The stock is a joke because you have to be here 2 yrs in order to receive that and I'm sure 99% of ppl not get anything. They also have a monthly bonus called VCp which is another joke cause the last 4 months I've received less then $25 and sometimes $0. So that being said do yourself a favor don't work for Amazon you'll regret it. I've seen it first hand. Ppl go to lunch and never come back cause they are smart im one of the dumb one that lasted this long. So unless you literally"
bad,"From ever increasing rate on the floor, to being denied promotion due to lack of technical skills that you have used daily to complete the tasks of the job that you were applying for, Amazon is a global corporation that lacks actual good leadership, training, and overall job satisfaction. I would not recommend working for Amazon unless you have no other choice."
bad,"Practically no work/life balance due to long shifts, 55 hour weeks in the winter, ridiculously hard to meet targets, on your feet for the entire 10 hours with the exception of your two half hour breaks (just enough time to get some food, eat it, then go back to your station). Didn't even want to give one star, but since it's the minimum that I can give..."
bad,"The job has little to no advancement, you are stuck there and have virtually no life and the pay sucks, I asked for days they gave me grave yard, I was given a ""promotion"" to a PG, with no extra pay but was in charge of people, horrible place to work"
bad,"It is an unprofessional site, they treat the employee as a slave, you are only a number for the management, plus 55 hours of work and the pay is bad. You are just a robot for work. nor my worst enemy I wish him to work there"
bad,"You will work! It’s very unorganized! LONG HOURS! Pay is not enough and favoritism is highly stressed here. Break rooms are far from work areas leading to shorter breaks. Parking is limited. Management is hard, no sympathy here. Advancements are few. Very strict rules, written up over everything! Must pick 400-500 items per hour. Must build a pallet in under 4 minuets! Break room food limited and expensive. Warehouse is very dirty, run down and air conditioning is timed! Many “hot spots”! No sitting at all, continuously standing, stooping, lifting and bending for a minimum of 10 hours. Lots of walking, 4 flights of stairs (elevator use) NOT ALLOWED. Would not recommend this job at all to anyone."
bad,"A typical day consisted of rushing to meeting, doing stretches, rushing to work station and working feverishly to achieve the various metrics set forth by the company until quitting time. Workers are strictly out for themselves. Don't trust anyone.  once they begin referring to what's left of your group as ""old employees"" (usually 3 months in), begin looking for another job."
bad,The warehouse in which you work in is normally hot with no cool air ventilation or anything.  They can change your schedule at the last minute so there's no regard to work/life balance.  The management there talks down to you like you have absolutely no education at all and they are on the biggest power trip.  And practically everyone that I spoke to out on the floor was pretty miserable.  Overall it is not a good place to work.
bad,"although I worded hard for 6 years I was never promoted, left where I was cause I was great at it. saying that if your good at your job you'll be left on the bottom. people came way less competent and mored up only so they wouldn't be fired.smh , that was the culture there way too often, not saying always but to often..."
bad,"Consider the turnover rate. There is a reason it is so high. It's not just teenagers working here for their first job. People who have been working since they were kids can't stand this job. The management is poor, the benefits are a scam, and there is little to no room for advancement. The raise you get is $0.25 every 6 months, and you cap out at $13.50."
bad,"Over worked and under paid as seems to be the common theme of Amazon. You get a 30 minute lunch and two 15 minute breaks for a 10 hour shift, and the time it takes to get fro your station to the break area takes up most of that 15 minutes you get."
bad,Amazon in Texas has a horrible confrontation additude.I was threatened harassed called vulgar names this was the culture and none of these associates where ever fired. Worked long hours with no extra breaks.i transferred from Reno Nevada so I never received any of my raises due because I was already over the pay rate in Texas
bad,"Did not like it all. There was a bit to many distractions', the facility itself was very unpredictable as far as the employees', and the way security was in place maid individuals feel vey un-comfortable to come to work."
bad,"The hardest part about the job was the hours and not being able to sleep properly."
bad,not allowed to sit in warehouse for 10 to 12  hours shifts.  The two 15 minute breaks are in reality only 3 minute breaks for the 10 hour shifts. No on-site subsidized cafeteria. only 30 min lunch break not enough time to eat and rest.
bad,"Terrible place to work, felt like I was unappreciated and driven like a slave. Worked as hard as I could and that was still not good enough. Asked to be put in another position and they would not do it."
bad,"In addition to really poor management, there’s  a culture of bullying at Amazon that goes unchecked. HR also let’s unsavory characters get away with harassment of all sorts. It’s like an old boys club in the warehouses."
bad,"Management didn't know what they were doing and often times wasted time and money by not listening to staff on matters they knew more about."
bad,"I worked at one of the largest Amazon warehouses in the country for about seven months, and I found my time there very unfulfilling. The workplace environment was high-stress, which isn't a bad thing, but combined with the low stakes, mediocre pay and generally toxic culture it was not a healthy place for almost anyone working there. There was a lot of turnover on every level (I had five managers in the span of less than a year, and this was never clearly communicated by the upper levels); there is room for quick advancement, though. I moved up to an assistant to the area manager in the span of a couple months, but the increase in responsibility and stress only corresponded to a .25 cent raise. It's a fine short-term job if you don't mind being in a warehouse, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a job to stay in for more than a few months."
bad,"Treated like a Slave - Managers Pathetic most are unable to speak English - Slave Camp working conditions providing work mainly for Foreigners based in UK - English cannot live on salary and would not want to work at this place -  In need of Spartacus"
bad,"Worked here from October to December 2017. You learn within days that temporary workers are disposable items and if the unachievable targets are not met, you're out the door. "
bad,This is a very challenging place to work and the turn over rate is unbelievable. The salary is is not commensurate to the work that is required. The CEO needs to revisit a number of issues about the work environment and the balance of management as it relates tows to ethnicity.
bad,"Poor working conditions, very stressful environment, poor management, no flexibility in schedule, scheduled breaks (15 minutes long; 10 minutes are just walking in and out of the main warehouse facility), and an overall inhumane experience."
bad,"A truly terrible place to work. Very little pay, long hours, unreasonable production demands and poor management. Good for a quick paycheck but should be avoided at all costs"
bad,Terrible place to work will cut you if you don't meet standards with out a second thought. Managers aren't really there for you Some Supervisors are nice its a hit or miss.
bad,"Find a better job, even if its less pay. This place drains your soul. Management makes a ridiculous amount to stand around with laptops, only moving and engaging with people when instructed to by the operations or due productivity alerts on the laptops."
bad,"Upper management plays favorites. They believe the associates over the managers. HR is in everything you do. They find ways to fire you if your not one of there favorites. Over 60 hour work weeks. Your in charge of your own learning, no help from supervisors. I have over 25 years in management, worst experience ever!"
bad,"ive been there for 8 months and got fired. A manager was trying to get me fired. Managers dont help or do anything, they play favorites, and are sexist. they pay little for what you have to do and put up with long hours."
bad,"Will never recommend Amazon for a job. Fast paced, part of your breaks includes the time it takes to walk to and from break. Lunch is to short for the amount of time you work, 45 minute lunch would be perfect, you cannot rest enough in just thirty minutes."
bad,"Modern day sweat shop.  Work people until they drop then get a new one. Management is only worried about the numbers, so they can get bonuses while everyone else gets nothing in return."
bad,"Frustrating, complicated procedures that can change without notifying employees, incompetent managers, incompetent procedures, no employee/ employer loyalty,  when you get to max pay your days are numbered, they offer you up to $5000 every February to quit."
bad,"Amazon used to be a great place to work with a lot of autonomy and teamwork.  Groups were proud of what they were doing and they were recognized for it.  You felt you were making impact and saw opportunity to grow.  "
bad,Absolutely no job security.   I was at work like any other normal day and before the end of day work  I and some of my colleague told that our job is ended with immediate effect.
bad,You are worried like a dog and management has a high turnover so you are constantly getting new management fresh out of college and no experience in how to deal with their employees
bad,The company culture rewards those that could execute and do as they're told.  Strategic leadership is poor and collaborative behavior is minimal as others are looking to protect themselves.
bad,"They hire kids right of college with zero work experience and people skills and expect them to be efficient managers. No one is held accountable for their actions except maintenance. The maintenance guys are always blamed for whatever goes wrong. "
bad,"Work culture - management treats you like a number in this Sortation center...you are only as good as your Scan Rate.  There are no raises, no advancement...you can become a lead, but you do not get paid more money.  The flex up is not occasional, but almost every day.  There is a variety of shifts, but good luck trying to get some help from HR.   Either no one in HR either knows what they are doing, or they just tell you what ever because they don't care.  Amazon talks about being a company of inclusion and diversity, but 90% of management here are white men.  I would not recommend this job to anyone i know...I thought it would be better than working retail... I was wrong. Finally found some other place to work ...grateful I am finally leaving."
bad,"No music, no emotion, no help, no compassion, nothing worth doing which is why the job centres have to force people to work there. Maybe they should pay some taxes, maybe they should just rot in Valhalla or hire prisoners .. Most miserable work environment ever."
bad,"Terrible place to work, tons of injuries, company doesn't care, stressful and poor management. Unrealistic performance metrics which end up pushing people too hard and employees end up injured."
bad,"Work harder"
bad,"Amazon only wants to hire seasonal people and pluck them back out just before they can vest their stocks. It is cut-throat to work for Amazon, impossible to excel, and the work environment is very toxic. "
bad,"If you want fast money in exchange for laborious hard work, then this is the place for you. The main problem is with the PMP agency they have a culture of harassment a subterfuge to produce results."
bad,"really bad place, treats you as dog!"
bad,"Productive, on your feet the whole time you are at work. must meet producation, only two 30 mins one is for lunch and one is for break. How to pack packages. Very strict maanagement. Make customers happy by getting their packages out on time. Standing on your feet for 10 hours. When you get to sit down for lunch and break. Pack merchandise in boxes. Pack merchandise in envelopes. Back-end catch merchandise to make sure it is sdaled properly, if not sealed we remove the item from the assembly line and seal them. Pack multiple merchandises in boxes."
bad,I was a new mother and need to use the mother's room 3 times a day. My rate was 90% that was low to them you had to be 100% or more but because I was not on the floor the full ten hours my rate was low and they didn't care that I was in the mother's room for my kid. So I  got let go for my rate. the rates changed very often. 401k sucks you only get match 2% and you can't get that for 3 years that you been there. Stock suck you can't get that til 2 years and even long if you are out for medical.  The make sure you will not get those benefits with all the dumb rule  to make you fell and get fired. Wouldn't tell anyone about this job.  Getting rich off the backs of the hard worker trying to keep their jobs.
bad,"Interviewed for a full-time job position in a new marketing project, got the job, went through tiring poorly planned training, and then was given part-time hours (if that) doing warehouse work. They completely lied about the job description and I left quickly after being verbally harassed by managers."
bad,"If you want to live just for your job, this is your job!"
bad,"the primary problem with Amazon is how unwilling they are to give a single concession when it came to pay. the only thing I heard about a raise, was the possibility of one happening in June. which would be a year of work in my case with no raise or other compensation."
bad,"Still working there. "
bad,"I had a bad experience working in this place because of a horrible work plan schedule. Wasting the time waiting for parcels to deliver, spending minimum 2 hours before taking my parcels to the van."
bad,When i applied there didn't know which line was the correct one to fill out my application. Once applied and went to the room to fill out some personal papers but I didn't know if I had a job or not. Once hired I didn't know what was going to be my job. Once working Many times i didn't know where i was going to be working.  Sometimes supervisors passed by to ask if I wanted to go home. I didn't know if it was a good thing or not but i stayed because i wanted to stay busy. People I started working with kept disappearing. didn't know if they were being let go or they were just leaving.
bad,the company is a warehouse setting. fast paced ok environment. i felt as though i couldn't find a career there. its better than a lot of jobs i might have
bad,"Poor management. Favoritism. They will give you trash jobs if you don't know how to complain with the management.  Process assistants (PA) give the lightest jobs to their friends. This job is too hard or difficult for women. Your feet will hurt for too long standing hours and you need to achieve your unbelievable rate everyday if not you will get a written warning for 3 times, then, they will fire you.  Low pay."
bad,it bad company to work for they have to job turnovers because push the employees to rush rush they watch every move you make it was not real safe atmosphere you don't really have a changed very stressful
bad,"completed 3 weeks via an agency as a night picker "
bad,"Un timo. Así definiría a esta empresa. Para empezar tienes que hacer un par de actividades grupales con Adecco, haciendo pruebas ridículas sin ni siquiera preguntarte tu experiencia laboral en ningún momento ni haciendo a nadie una entrevista personalizada."
bad,"HR actively looks for ways as to why they should not pay you. First day of work several employees on site were denied pay simply because for the first part of the shift HR needed to print badges several times for some employees. Those employees were not paid for that time because they were ""not working"" according to HR. That was last year when I was hired. About 2 weeks ago HR said they discovered a ""glitch"" in their accounting system which was paying us all more than we should have been paid. Weekly paychecks went from $250 to $120! What glitch? Amazon is a international multi-billion dollar tech company with robot warehouse workers and retail stores that bill customers based on sensors detecting who picked what product off the shelf and those sensors can tell if the customer put the product back. Also people at work have had to talk to HR, me included, marking us as ""no show"" when that was clearly not the case."
bad,at first it was a great job. but the longer you are there the more the work you like a dog....I worked 60+ hour weeks with little pay and my grandmother died and wouldn't give me the time off quick enough that she died without me being able to see her....so yea I would say amazon sucks to work for
bad,"I would not recommend working at Amazon if you are over 30.They do not value experience, and only promote very young people. They work the older people extremely hard in inappropriate roles to try and get them to quit. The managers are inexperienced and have no people skills."
bad,"Ambiente despiadado donde las máquinas son mejor tratadas que las personas."
bad,The job it self isn't bad but the managers and pay is bull... and they only work you 4 hours a day. It's a waste of time and gas... they get paid weekly but your check barely hit 150 dollars... The managers have they pick and chooses and they wasn't trained correctly so the store isn't running like it should... avoid if possible... they take time from you if you are a min late... they do not except doctor notes... They are the worst to work for...
bad,"Avoid. The woefully incompetent management are the worst. Every tier of supervision is worse than the next. "
bad,Your working for the big man upstairs. Don't make the cut your out of there. They don't even let you use the restroom with out asking where you've been.
bad,Management was horrible.  They really don't care about their employees.  Benefits could be a lot better considering the money the company makes. Sucky
bad,Horrible company to work for dont recommend to anybodyrude staff unfair pay never felt like I was trained the correct way always seem to change how stuff was suppose to be done inconsistent
bad,hours are good but other than that it is a awful place to work. they treat their employees like robots and they are just a number. no one cares about you all they care about is you making rate.
bad,This job is very horrible you have people monitoring your every move you can go to the bathroom without someone cut throating you asking you where were you in last 5 min your TOT breaks seem like their 5 min breaks work environment uncomfortable hate for a manager to stand and watch you working it’s no choice in calling out if you don’t have time either you come to work or you’re fired they only giv you 10 hr pto for the yr but you accumulate every pay check but still place sucks won’t recommend
bad,"Amazon warehouse positions are, from my experience very unpleasant. The expectation is that the person functions like a machine doing tasks that are as arduous as they are boring. I was a stower, this is a person that stands in front of a shelf and places items on the shelves. There are rules pertaining to size and shape that may cause problems for stowers if they aren't careful. There's also frequent problems with packages, mislabeling, broken scanners, malfunctioning monitors, all of which hurt your numbers and none of which are the stower's fault. Managers know this but conveniently ignore these facts while consistently prattle on and condensed about numbers."
bad,"poor management skills and everyone mico manages. "
bad,"Employees are stack ranked, top 10% are the only ones that are given any opportunities, and that is influenced by competition and sabotage from other employees that already know the game. Mandatory overtime required."
bad,Management and HR do nothing to help anybody but run them around in circles. They don't listen to their staff. The food they made us pay for to have for lunch was not good quality.
bad,"no matter how hard you work they don't care"
bad,"Your breaks weren't the duration they were suppose to be. Both 15 minute breaks end up being only 10, you also had to leave your work station at the break start time. Which wasn't fair because we'd stll have to walk to the break room. Overall very tiring.."
bad,"Die Arbeitsplatzkultur ist wie sie überall beschrieben wird: von der totalen Überwachung bis zu inkompetenten und uninteressierten Managementtypen ist alles zu finden."
bad,"Extremely poorly trained/experienced management. Practically all of them are straight out of school with unrelated degrees."
bad,Horrible management and no room for advancement like they promise. Demanding work schedule and ridiculous overtime expected. No time for anything else but working at Amazon.
bad,"Different to anything else you may have done in ENGINEERING"
bad,"Worked there for almost 2yrs.management was horrible, HR had bad attitudes, breaks were inconsistent they kept getting shorter and shorter. Coworkers were lazy and the building was unorganized."
bad,"typical day at work is standing for 9 1/2 hours"
bad,I was never given opportunities that were provide to less educated and newer employees as time progressed. I had a stellar work ethic and no performance issues. Wouldn't recommend working for an Amazon facility.
bad,"travail respetitif, contrôle en permanence, ambiance très moyenne"
bad,"This place is a joke. I quit my other job i have had for years in hopes of making life i want. Just to sit here and possibly be out of a job because i cant make my rate. I am a packer with that being said you have to pack items the rate they require you to fulfill is impossible especailly when they want you to be consistent for 10 hours its impossible. "
bad,"Ho lavorato da Amazon tre mesi al pack singolo e multi, solo turno notturno. Lavoro monotono  ripetitivo non puoi fermarti nemmeno un secondo che immediatamente ti trovi il manager dietro con il tuo rendimento. Un consiglio che utilizzano i più (scaltri) guarda i tote e scegli quelli con i pezzi piccoli mettili di lato cosi aumenti la produttività se proprio vuoi restare."
bad,Expect to be a robot or they will let you go.  Managers definitely have their favorites.  No one is never satisfied with your work there. Lots of chiefs very little Indians.
bad,"I worked there for a month. I enjoyed working there and really liked my co-workers. The company hired too many people, and looked for reasons to fire some of them. I've never been fired before. I'm so sad, hurt, disappointed, and humiliated. I got fired for something I didn't even know I could be fired for. Their HR department is cold and heartless. The department only cares about the company and not the people."
bad,"bad work conditions "
bad,"Your asked to give up all weekends, the managers are never any where to be found, if you make an error thats the only thing the manager focuses on. There is no motivation at all. You work 12 hour shifts with a 30 min lunch and 15 min break. Not a good place at all."
bad,"Standing up, 12 hour shifts plus overtime, which is pretty crazy. I worked on Thursday, Friday, Saturday and overtime pay was Wednesday. It is just insane."
bad,"iniziato da 10 gg e obbligato a fare il facchino con un articolo preso in una zona, poi cambio zona e subito dopo si torna alla zone precedente con lunghe camminate. Invece di ottimizzare il lavoro lo peggiorano. Manager che si credono dei in terra e pretendono la perfezione anche ai nuovi arrivati, spie all'interno che mettono cattive voci e ti fanno richiamare per cose inesistenti. Sono a andato a un funerale e hanno messo assenza ingiustificata nonostante avessi avvertito. Pausa di mezzora che si riduce a 20 min e molta disorganizzazione in giro anche da parte di chi dovrebbe sapere le cose a memoria... provate e vedrete... oppure non provate e tentate altro....suggerito"
bad,"No appreciation of agency staff."
bad,"Very little chance for advancement.  Hiring practices ensure that young, unskilled, and unmotivated workers will be your teammates.  Poor planning in day to day work assignments."
bad,This company does not listen to the employees concerns and very poor management. Also they do not hire employee that are quantified for position just employee they like not the ones that  have the experience. Don't understand how outsiders come in and get positions when there are qualified employees already working there not have the opportunities to be interviewed. Not bringing in the trucks with work for us to process for fours or plus. Making us work for three or less a day which is unacceptable if hired to work four or more.
bad,too much favoritism and backstabbing hardworkers get looked over never positive enforcement dont know how to talk to people very rude and no one listens when its hot outside over 100 degrees no air when its cold they turn air condition on
bad,"very hhard to get quotas there.  items mislabeled, scanner errors. timed at picking items but when scanner is not working you lose time and thats what gets you in hot water,"
bad,"A typical day at work included a culture of younger ppl doing as they pleased as the older ppl provided higher work standards yet they were over looked for the younger ppl. A great deal of fraternization went on btwn managers of all levels and younger females. Many younger females and males were promoted while older, more productive employees were over looked. No career advancement for most ppl over 45."
bad,"As a PA, (Asst. Mgr.) you will walk 12-14 miles per day on concrete. You will work with managers (fresh from college, no experience). No standard work rule between shifts causing undue frustration and added work load for PA's in general. Stated standards such as timely breaks, no food and drinks on floor, cell phone use on the floor, one-piece flow work, etc., are not addressed by AM's. "
bad,"Easy to find ways to write you up. Lot of times lacking work a struggle to make 40 hours. unorganized, managers lost, PA have to run everything, did not give PA credit deserved"
bad,When I first started I thought it was a great job but after a while I was verbally abused and made to feel like I was small within the company by managers and the HR team who didn't want to help anybody with any complaints. My girlfriend who worked there with me was sexually assaulted by one of the managers and they brushed it under the rug and told not to say anything to anybody and keep our mouth shut. Hope the place burns down.
bad,this job was good for temporary but not really a career. integrity is a temp agency and they are really organized and neither is Amazon. They do not care much about there employees. I had 65 employees get let go after a project they did very good at. Will no explanation and integrity after firing the said they have to wait up to 6 to 9 months to return
bad,"I cannot attest to working at corporate, but working in the distribution center is absolutely awful. Incompetent management, training for those who are favored, no advancement opportunities unless you are in good with hiring managers."
bad,The ONLY pro to this job is the pay. Everything else is horrible about this job. The company claims there is a 30-day probation period this is a lie. The management is lacking at this site and employees are constantly off task with no disciplinary actions taken.
bad,The job with Amazon was not what I initially expected but I am thrilled to be working in a contract environment and it is easy work.  It is a very new experience.
bad,I applied to work 4 10hr days and in the time I was there only had an opportunity to do that once. Their expectations for workload and accuracy are near impossible to meet
bad,"lo sfruttamento è alla base di questo impiego."
bad,"Sucky place to work for, it's cold and robotic. They make you feel small and insignificant. They make it known that you are just another number on a spreadsheet."
bad,"Amazon has set schedules and a good benefit package. They lack in PTO/Vacation days as most of the culture revolves around Peak and Prime Day. Mandatory overtime is called extremely often even if it is unnecessary. Also the turnover rate for management is very high so there is a lack of communication, spontaneous change, and a lot confusion as a result."
bad,"Firma de recrutare a facut dintr-un job ok si relaxant, o adevarata harababura"
bad,Training is inconsistent.  Treatment of employees is dependent of on whose personal favorite you can become.  Getting answers to questions is impossibe as peopple in management or human resource roles are not well trained and cannot provide reliable information.
bad,"Te puedes tirar 14 meses siendo de ett trabajando de miércoles a domingo de 15:30 a 23:45 (por lo que no ves a nadie) y no puedes pedir ni un día libre, ni cambio de turno, solo cambia quien pelotea a los lean, tienes que andar mirando siempre la nomina pues las ETT pagan mal menudo, y das por perdido ese dinero... si hay que hacer horas te las ponen como flexibilidad y así no te las pagan y son obligatorias... se supone que te las pagan al acabar el contrato pero como te renuevan a las semanas muchas veces se pierden dichas horas..."
bad,"It's rarely talked about except when you are on the inside, but Amazon is a terrible place to work as a woman unless you are an engineer. It's a good ole boys club and I've seen many exceptional women get passed over for no apparent reason. "
bad,"really nothing more than a train wreck of a job, tiresome, horrible management, faced the darkest times of my life at amazon, including depression and high anxiety"
bad,"The work environment sucks the warehouse was about 90 degrees  every night i worked they have little fans to help but it felt like it was blowing hot air the whole time.And i was treated like a number, HR was not easy to contact and when i got ahold of them it seemed like they didn't know what they were talking about, LACK OF COMMUTATION between managers and employees."
bad,"Amazon has terrible leadership in Customer Service. I had 3 managers in less than a year, each less competent than the last. "
bad,"Pay does not compensate for the work you do . walk 15 to 20 miles a night as a picker.  you do not stop. if you are idle for more than 10 minutes ,they call you down to desk wanting to know why. They do not seem to care that the employees keep blisters on their feet as they race to meet their daily rate."
bad,"nul les manager sont des ignorants et pas du tout a la hauteur juste travaillent labas piston et de l'expoitation pour les interimaire "
bad,"Each day was long and tiring, nothing exciting. Managers pressured and wrote up employees over the smallest things. Loud conveyor belts and equipment. Short breaks with long walks to break area. Facility operations run by someone in a different state and not there to see first hand what is really needed."
bad,"Amazon is full of managers fresh out of college who have absolutely no communication or leadership skills. Employees were treated like high school students; breaks were closely monitored (making sure not to exceed 15 minutes to the second or you'd get written up), there are cameras EVERYWHERE watching your every move (understandable due to theft, but being a woman I felt thoroughly creeped out knowing any security guard could be staring down my shirt), and we were constantly slammed with overtime while never being a given a reason as to why we were on it."
bad,A modern day slave operation where you are only useful as long as you are profitable.Statistics on large TV screens monitoring your performance. Internal `points`punishment system.
bad,"This is not good company to work for, The management is very unhelpful and at some point - unskilled."
bad,In the beginning it was FUN! But the culture quickly charged. The place is filled with managers that are very condescending and most of them lack the knowledge of their everyday duties. In some departments you are confined to a station for 10/11 and the ONLY time you really see you manager is when they are coming to write you UP. I met a ton of great people that work for the company that I will continue to be friends with once I move on. And the benefits are pretty good. But the work environment is VERY Stressful !
bad,At Amazon management operations are terrible. There is no room for advancement. All of leadership shows favoritism to certain employees. Workers are treated very badly.
bad,"If you really want to spend your days locked in a loud, hot server room drilling hard drives all day be my guest. You will learn no skills in this career and come home physically exhausted. It is a grand waste of time, that's why they offer you $20-25/hr. To some, that's all they want to make their entire life. My coworker had said to me ""I want to get paid for doing nothing at all"". And it is true, you don't do anything here, as much of the job is waiting around doing nothing. Some days they would work us 6 hours straight doing physical labor, such as laying mats down for the 200 lb server racks we would have to push around the building. No water or food allowed inside the pods, so I hope you had a big breakfast. Overall, would not recommend. Boring day job."
bad,management doesn't handle pressure very well taking it out on employees.  communication with associates lacks among mangers saving them for last minute changes with no way to work around it
bad,"Inexperienced, arrogant Campus -Hire Managers. Constant intimidation by Human Resources, write-ups for the most minor infractions. Constant complaining by Associates."
bad,Worst job I've ever had. All they care about is getting the job done and if you don't make rate you are harassed. No room for advancement unless management likes you.
bad,Work here for a year treat me like dirt slaves and that all I have to say about that place except the Good benefits but that's besides that point my life isn't worth giving to that place anymore. Tired
bad,The only thing that was actually true at time of hire was the pay. I signed on for one location and was transferred to another before first day. Then was informed after training that all they had was graveyard shift. They are constantly pitting employees against each other for meaningless prizes.
bad,"The average day at Amazon is 10 hours, a day that after the utter exhaustion of being in a building with constant noises, coworkers who barely feel human at least you have the three day weekend to look forward to. Except nope! Expect to spend HALF the year on five 10 hour days (5 11s come peak season). Amazon had to bribe people with giftcards this spring just to get people to come to work. I guess it's better than raising the wages to actually get quality people who stay and show up for work in the building. Third shift basically ensures you won't have any life outside of Amazon, but day shift managers are stricter, and the quality of employees is also worse."
bad,Worse place I have ever work for! Never ever waking here..save yourself and don't even apply here at all. Bad HR and managers are terrible! Bad communication!
bad,"I just finished a 5 month stint at Amazon fullfiment in Ruskin, the turnover is insane, even managers don't last. They work you till your ready to drop, every second of every day consists of someone watching that you make rate as they call it. Even when you make rate it's not enough, they accuse you of things and write you up without you even giving you a chance to defend yourself. And that 4 day work week they hook you with ... quickly turns into 5 or 6 10-12 hour shifts. If you have no other options, take the job while you look for something better, just don't expect to make a career out of it."
bad,A very bad place to work they will count your rate as bad even if the equipment is down and not your fault. pay is ok but keep an eye out to make sure they don't shave your time.
bad,"Do not work for Amazon if you can avoid it. The worklace culture and management is toxic, they treat you like a robot and not a person, the management is terrible and all the managers change departments every few months. The only one to get up the chain in this place is to brown nose your way up to the managers, hark work gets you nowhere."
bad,"Employees are treated horribly and everything is based on favoritism. The whole job is tiring and mentally draining. When working for this company you are a number, not a person."
bad,If it's not numbers it doesn't matter at all.  At Amazon you will get wrote up for any and everything. I would not advise working here if you have children and want to spend time with them.
bad,High turn over rate. Management complained about the job all day to subordinates. Young management who have never been in charge of anyone before did not know how to speak to people.
bad,"Sounds good on paper until you realize mandatory overtime is a weekly occurrence. The poor management and ridiculous incentives do not help. Its considered a privilege to wear the companies clothing, yet for them its an investment in free advertisement while you are their walking billboard. VCP (variable compensation) is either low or completely absent on a month by month basis. Your chances at moving up in this company from an entry level position are slim at best, and once you do its a small bump in pay. They failed to evacuate or even let staff know about a bomb threat in 2014 until after the fact. The GM was ""fired"" after preaching false stories demonizing unions. The truth is the associates would greatly benefit from a union and have yet to receive fair representation. Overall I regret working for them, and I should have stayed where I was. VERY DISAPPOINTING."
bad,"Physically Demanding"
bad,Don't work for Amazon they want you to give your life with pennies in return with a very dim chance at ever advancing. Its easier for a college grad with no experience to get a management position than a person who has worked for them for years who got a college degree while working there. They don't reward their employees and don't care about what you accomplish. They won't even help with tuition reimbursement for bachelor degrees only associates degrees.
bad,Micro Management in every part of the warehouse with inexperienced Managers. More drama than a reality television show. Very demanding hours that make having a life hard to live.
bad,"Amazon says that they hire all these people for full time but really it does become only seasonal . Not a up front company."
bad,"productive, highly stressful job some days are fun, it depends on who the manager is for the day, you have a different one everyday if you work weekend shift"
bad,"Upper management at Amazon has NO regard for any of their employees, they DO NOT care about your wellbeing no matter how much they say they do, they have unrealistic standards, no way to move up in the company unless you are a butt kisser, THEY OVER WORK ALL THEIR EMPLOYEES! You NEVER know if you can lose your job today or tomorrow. NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING, EVERYBODY GIVES YOU THE RUN AROUND!"
bad,a typical day of work at amazon its not something you wood like som much beacuse its very strssful  you wake un in the morning and you don t now when are you camming back home too many parcels to delyver and not to much money .....
bad,"They treat you like dogs. At this location, we are so under paid. We work so hard but yet the managers never see it. It's not worth it at all. Don't waste your time here."
bad,never will work here again. staff are rude. breaks are a joke. systeme dosent work. targets are impossible. ok if you live local. nightmare if you dont
bad,"This job was the worst job I've ever held. Management was awful, fellow employees were awful and working in the middle of the night in a giant cement box in the dead of wibter was awful. 0 out of 10 for amazon and how they treat their employees."
bad,"Found the managers very fair people and the money was good when there was overtime."
bad,would not recommend it to anyone.Too hectic and complicated they run you ragged.The bosses expect too much from thye workforce and are not sympethic at all.
bad,"Fun place , enjoying work there .we always working as a team .the managers and the team leads always there to help us and provide with new knowledges."
bad,"Not a healthy environment"
bad,"they promise you everything but they do not deliver on this"
bad,"Amazon have no clue how to treat employees. They expect you to work like robots and accept being treated like dirt. "
bad,"it suck, the pay is ok but the hours are long and they dont care about you . they want you to act like a robot and if you dont do what they say then its the boot for you."
bad,"There was only one Amazon employee in the building, even the security are contracted."
bad,"Worked here as a driver for a few weeks, got to say that the culture at Amazon is pretty awful, I've also been to their HQ in London and seen why this is probably so - it's run by bits of kids, running round like headless chickens from mindless meeting to meeting."
bad,"not a good place unless you can get out of tier 1 to tier 3"
bad,Horrible job didn't like the rules and regulations no cell phone policy's break rules are poor and job sucks the life out of you
bad,The facility is very high intensity and strong customer service oriented. The emphasis on critical times is strong and many associates not in leadership need encouragement in order to feel successful. Pay is nothing like the initial interview says.
bad,"A guy jumped off the Apollo building due to work-related issues.  Barely made the news. Company didn't even provide a direct response."
bad,"An average day is horrible. Always having to keep up the packing or shipping rates, which in my opinion are too much. I learned nothing at Amazon. Management are cruel and don't care about anyone, but themselves. Co-workers are similar to depressed robots. The hardest part of the job was the amount of work needed to keep your job. The only enjoyable part of the job was leaving it."
bad,Very poorly managed overall. Lack of skill from upper management which created a lack of training for the employee's with the ultimate end result of procrastination among everyone's productivity rates which they expect you to make-up for even if it kill's you literally!
bad,"BFI4 - If you're young enough not to care how much damage you do to your body and are satisfied with making a but better than minimum wage, They'll love you. If you have enough previous experience in the corporate world you're likely going to be very frustrated. There are some GOOD people there. Unfortunately they're outnumbered by dishonest,  ignorant and arrogant managers who spend their shifts trying to cover up poor performance and abysmal personnel skills."
bad,its very tiring and they care much more about productive number than there employees they expect you do over time with no warning management doesn't' really train you wait and no job advancement. The scanners are old and don't always work right. they don't even mail you pay stubs to make sure your money got direct deposit. everyone goes on break at the same time so there's no room really by the time you get up stairs to the break you barely for your drink.
bad,"Let's just say Amazon leadership looks out for leadership. Who cares about the little guys. The place is a dog eat dog world. You basically have to be a suck up and not ask questions if you want to make it there. They are really strict about being time off task, you cant even use the bathroom to long without leadership breathing down your neck."
bad,Poor management no job security highschool environment I don't care what color you are they literally put that wip to your back short breaks poor parking
bad,"Amazon treat you like a slave making younhit un realistic targets with very short break times considering the distance you have to walk to get anything to eat or drink, most of the staff are eastern european and hard to understand and talk to, the place is very dirty and disorganised."
bad,"You are not allowed to talk or use the restroom without getting written up. If you get hurt they fire you.They say there is a raise period, but lies never received a raise the 2 years i worked there said there was a freeze on it that they didn't inform the employees about.You can't promote from a tier 1 to a tier 4 without a college degree and lucky to get to a tier 3 without a degree. Overall a terrible company."
bad,The warehouse was run by a bunch of kids that couldn't manage their way out of a wet paper bag. The kids that worked there were lazy and management looked the other way. Pushed all the work to those that did work. The hr ppl are bullies. Hear say and rumors are treated as fact. Just not a good place to work do to  the ppl and management. Avoid if at all possible.
bad,"Some people to immature to have certain positions at Amazon,they don't understand that things happen in life with your family.DAY HR should look at it"
bad,Work environment is hostile and management turns their heads to bad events happening.  Female employees are not protected from harassment.  Instead they are terminated.
bad,"Amazon's focus on the customer has totally alienated it's focus on its workforce. You are constantly reminded of how expendable you are. Your performance is determined by how high your rate is: no matter what department you may be in. "
bad,"I enjoyed  working  there, was fired  due  to not meeting  rate, which I wasn't  informed  of a rate system  being that I never worked  in wherehouse before, they should  inform new hires of the productivity  requirement,  which they don't, so they will know what to expect, they make everything sound  good at orientation, meanwhile  never telling  new hires what is expected  of them in order to keep your jobs, there  more harder on pickers than packers, that company  is not fair to all there employees, a lot of favoritism. They are a very unfair  company  to work for, I couldn't  even appeal my termination, they made a mistake  and I wasn't  employed for 90 full days, so I can't appeal there  decision, totally  unfair, so I could never work for  them again. Wow  what an incentive for being  fired  you guys suck to the fullest."
bad,"Stay away from this company.  it's a horrible place to work.  They have one bathroom for 1200 employees to use.  When happens, is you're picking a mile away from the bathroom.  They do not like one to be off the scanner and what happens is you get written up for too much time of your scanner and 6 points your gone"
bad,"Here, you might as well get used to being degraded on the phone every day. That is all that happens.  The other employees were great, but the job itself was just horrible."
bad,"You cannot get full time work.  Management seems disorganized. No explanation of what a PA's job actually is so they appear to be doing nothing but staring at computer screens.  Same with management. Staring at computer screens.   High turnover rate.   No promotions, no raises.   Option to become ambassador and take on more responsibility without more pay. Training was a joke.   Weird clapping and chanting at beginning of shift. All about increasing productivity without any rewards."
bad,"typical days starts with a briefing from your area or shift manager or lead, generally telling you how much work needs to be done. "
bad,"I would not recommend Amazon to anyone. I stood in one place all day long. I am used to being on my feet for ten hours a day, but not in those conditions. No tour on our orientation, just the stops were there was training exercises."
bad,"Straight into orientation the staff was already talking about adult toys and how people would take them to the bathroom use them then restock them. Every new person that addressed us on orientation talked non stop about adult toys and telling stories. Strike 1 for me."
bad,You have to be on the A list to advance with this company.  They will lie to you instead of telling you the truth. They have pick people that they want to succeed in their compnay.
bad,you cant talk to managers you get fired if you report harassment. the pay is ok but not great. ive learned how to be a better inspector
bad,"Sfruttamento, sfruttamento, sfruttamento. Ambiente di lavoro incentrato sul rendere il più cinici possibile. Del tutto diverso da come si presenta inizialmente. Lavoratori sfruttati all'osso, disparità tra personale assunto, e lavoratori assunti in periodi di prova. favoreggiamenti."
bad,"a typical day at work involved a briefing in the morning followed by an 11 hour day. "
bad,I hated working at amazon. it was a lot of disrespectful people there. Some of the people that where the green vest was so rude when you ask them things.
bad,Amazon is great for entry level professionals however it's inappropriate for Managers and above as  HR is available only to please associates and not to support Operations.
bad,"management gives special preference to liked employees and others get treated horribly.a typical day was hoping you do not get walked out of the building and fired, because of this treatment i learned to be stronger mentally not let myself be taken advantage of, most of my co workers agreed so as a whole everyone got along.the job itself is not hard, being able to handle being treated like garbage is he hardest part of the job.the most enjoyable part is punching out on your last work day knowing you have 3 days off to reset your mind and body"
bad,"This company is the most terrible company I have ever worked for and this is keeping in mind I worked as a coach/supervisor."
bad,"I cant say this clearly enough. "
bad,I feel that they can offer better wages and have better HR and management skills.. Co workers are great but to much favoritism from pa's and management.  its not what you know its who ur close with
bad,"a typical day was a day of stress and being treated like a number....I learned to never work for a place with the same structure, management what a joke, great co-workers, hardest part was going in everyday I mean I struggled, break time was the most enjoyable part"
bad,"You are seen as a number of productivity, and not a person."
bad,"hard, not to work for them aver again, do not care about you,lazy,showing to start the day,at the end of the day when i leave to go home"
bad,I worked as a driver was told it was permanent then after xmas was laid off due to no routes but other drivers had over 150  parcels so in other words was just for xmas rush shocking how they treat people it was for lewtas logistics   i advise every 1 to stay away
bad,"I have never experienced mind games and bullying more in my entire life than I did in my three months at Amazon. I had a manager who was under budget restrictions who needed to get rid of one person on the team, and I was very quickly labeled as the person that needed to go. I was being actively sabotaged by members of my own team, struggled to find support and help in doing things I had never done before, and by the time I left, I was having daily panic attacks and was severely depressed (neither were pre-existing conditions). The pay was fairly high for the area that I was working in, but all that got me was a guarantee of having to move back into my parent's house after resigning. They also offer generous relocation and a signing bonus. Don't be fooled. I am now contractually obligated to pay every cent of that back because I lasted for less than a year. I hope this is the worst employment experience I ever have because I can't imagine anything worse."
bad,"I was hired by their staffing agency Integrity Staffing Solutions. I'd show up, clock in, grab a scanner, and go to the center of the warehouse for the pre-shift warm-up. Then I'd grab a cart and a tote and get to work picking orders. I'd walk between 15 and 30 miles a day."
bad,"management treats you unfairly, they need a class in people skills and attitudes.  you don't make any money and no room to advance"
bad,Rude and bad behaviour from management.... follow you and their point system....you r just a number... management is so rude..... make u feel u owe them....
bad,"I am not happy with this job, because of the very low salary. Also workng from home gets lonely. A typical day involves typing, data entry, proofreading, performing internet searches and taking surveys for corporations."
bad,"Benefits and compensation are good. Other employees range from good to bad but typically everyone gets along. Work is not hard but you dont get rotated so after 10 hours of doing the same thing it gets boring and dreadful (so then people start to fake injuries to get out of the job function). Management in the Fulfillment Center sucks so bad!  they dont care about the associates only to make you think they care so you can shut up and work hard for them. Management talks bad about the associates behind their backs and if they dont like you they will put you in a horrible job function and not let you leave that area. Management plays favorites. they track your every movement. you have to tell them you need to go to the bathroom. if you dont they pull up time reports and say you were stealing company time by going to the bathroom. in some cases they pull video camera footage to track your movements to make sure you are going where you say you are going. I have seen a manager yell at a employee for making a mistake and the same manager told another employee they would punch them in the face, but yet this manager is still working at amazon and the employees got written up/fired. Basically working in a amazon fulfillment center is modern day slavery, so please stay away!"
bad,"You will be on your feet your whole shift. You will rush to breaks and lunch more like run because the building is big and you have to navigate throh security and then if your lucky you'll have about five minutes ."
bad,"horrible, unorganized company, Management just plays around in their computers flirting with other girls.  Too many lazy people working yet they have the blue batch and managers dont tell them anything. All of amazon employees are lazy just wondering around and smx people working hard getting all the hard work; us girls get to carry heavy boxes while the mens are carring tiny boxes . It's ridiculous and not worth it."
bad,picking orders and packing them. I learned that amazon cares more about their customers than they do about their employees. the management there was not very inclined to listen to employees to fix certain problems and sometimes made the job more difficult. the hardest part of the job is having to deal with incompetent managers on a daily bases. the most enjoyable part of the day is seeing some of your fellow employees.
bad,Worst management ever ever ever... It was a disaster. these people liked to beat us down... they were never satisfied.. I think they miserable.. I;ve heard other locations were better. not sure.. .
bad,"Low balance, low manager interest and team engagement, low moral with goal setting, lack of team collaboration, low investment of strategic initiatives from senior leaders. NO DIVERSITY"
bad,"0 hours workplace,order picking if you picked 7000 units one week the next week they would want 7500 and so on.I started on 16 hours which is what i wanted but after a few months was told i had to work 40 hours no choice.East european workers were idle and ignorant our  first aider was polish and did not speak english. The hardest part of this job was the distance you walked every day between 10 to 15 miles. The most enjoyable part of the job was going home."
bad,"The Co-workers were the hardest to leave.  The managers we only have for a year normally, we had one for 2 years.  I learned that you are replaceable with a robot (in other facilities), and that since the managers were younger and younger each time unless you wanted to ""go clubbing"" you were weren't going to get anywhere.  The hardest part of the job was working with people who didn't have to perform to keep their job.  I on the other hand had to work extremely hard every day to try to ""prove"" I was worthy of having a job to begin with.  There was no respect from the management.    The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers that I built lasting relationships with."
bad,"Horrible company to work for! There is basically no positive thing I can say about this place besides the fact that it was a paycheck. You get sucked into this place thinking its going to be great but then you start work and realize how horrible the management is and if you're not a favorite, they will do everything in their power to fire you."
bad,"Peter-principal management."
bad,people everywhere exploding into beast mode doing various tasks...while managers point fingers and just watch.my co-workers were great. Hardest part of the job was working as managers watched doing nothing. I learned that I can do more than what I thought I could. Great break rooms. Overall ...I still miss it.
bad,"its all about he company, increasing its volume, better for amazon never the workers, only gave 4 hours a work day."
bad,It feels like you're just a number to the company and they do not seem to care about you
bad,I worked very hard and was on my feet all day long. They expected you to work like a robot.
bad,"Your job duties vary depending on where you are assigned to work.  I learned how to sort products and palletize boxes.  Management is a joke.  Especially AMs.  Favortism is rampant.  They LOVE associates who are lazy and unproductive.  They get away with anything!  If you are one of their favorites and you happen to have a low rate, they can adjust your rate for you.  Time and time again I see associates who don't make ""rate"" still employed at Amazon."
bad,"Amazon does pay decently and has decent benefits but everyone is falsely happy. You are taught to be empathetic to  customers, trust the customer, befriend the customer, but when it comes to you as an employee, you don't get empathy. They expect you to be glued to your phone and computer for ten hours a day aside from a small break and your lunch. You have to meet weekly to discuss your performance and even if you do  everything you're told, you still get told to do better. You have to send out a survey to every customer you speak to and all it says is "" Did I solve your problem yes or no"" and that is how they rate you. If you get a mean customer or a person who wants you to do something you're not allowed to you can get a no and if you get enough no's it will put you in the bottom 15% and you will be put on performance plan which is nothing but extra meetings to discuss your performance and if you don't get more 'yes' surveys you will be fired."
bad,"Overall, Amazon does not take care of their employees. They are very busy focusing on the ""Customer"" they fail to take care of the people that make it happen."
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"Faltou com a verdade, me enganou, me fez pedir a conta do meu emprego, não me pagou e ainda me demitiu depois de implantar todos os vigilantes na amazonas energia e realizar todas as análises de riscos dos postos."
bad,"Reunião com equipes repassando e conscientizando sobre objetivos das metas estabelecidas e feed backs de setores sobre andamento dos processos diários."
bad,I wouldn't recommend anyone with to the company. They don't care about the employees they only care about the work they can produce.
bad,A typical day at work would be working like a slave. i would walk miles a day and i would be so exhausted
bad,Each person that works for amazon is kept on a timer - to many cheifs
bad,"Management is incompetent and does not inspire employees to achieve. Management has little regard for well-being/happiness of employees. "
bad,Very poor management would huff and puff when asked for help all had a terrible attitude even when there was a few of us who had just started. The other staff there were very unfriendly and unhelpful ! People travel miles to get there like my self half 5 in the morning to get sent home!  Without PAY!!! They dont care that people have rent to pay! I would advise people dont bother working there its the worst place I have ever worked and ended up leaving I couldn't handle it and was nearly in tears most days thanks to bullying from the manager who made it too obvious he didnt like me! You also get a 30 minuet break but it takes 5 minuets to walk the canteen so thats 20 minuets left to try eat up dinner 
bad,"No room for advancement within the company. Amazon employs an in-house temp service, therefore you're reminded everyday that you can easily be replaced. This causes a drop in morale and motivation among the employees."
bad,"I learned how to pack and receive orders. My co-workers weren't too bad except a lot would not except new people into their groups. The management didn't care about individual employees. The hardest part of the job was the whole job. It was so physically demanding I have a joint pains from only 3 months of work. The most enjoyable part was a paycheck. A typical day I would wake up and have to get ready for work, leave within an hour, drive an hour to work to arrive early to be prepared and check my assignments. Then I would work for 3 hours straight get a 15 minute break. Work another 3 hours and then had 30 minute lunch, Work another 3 hours with a 15 minute break and then 2 more hours. Then drive home for an hour then sleep and start all over."
bad,"If you are working as a warehouse employee, not sure, but if you are considering working in Seattle's headquarters beware!!!"
bad,The only good thing about working here are the people you meet.
bad,"Very Demanding job that pays easy money. They run you all over the warehouse, just to pick different items. I've learned that it's the perfect job, if you trying to lose weight!"
bad,"I learned a few new skills at Amazon, i learned how to process returned goods, i learned how to drive a tug truck. I learned how to stow and i learned how to use scanner guns. Management gave us before and after shift briefs on targets. I got on very well with all the co-wokers that i worked alongside. I cannot pin point anytime of the day as being most enjoyable."
bad,"Amazon has the most unrealistic measurable ""rates"" (read: quotas) I have ever seen. If you have a certain number of items to be packed, sorted or pulled they want no excuses. example - - if you are required to process/sort , say, 500 items per hour but spend over half that time waiting for items to be brought to you they don't care, you are still expected to process 500 items in an hour. This is most often physically impossible. Likewise if you are packing orders they expect 60 (later 80) items packed per hour (including enclosures and outside labels) but do not allow for changing tape dispenser, problems with the air pillow machine, conveyor stoppage or lack of cartons needed to pack the items they don't want to hear about it.. Also for packing your work station changes from day to day, with different locations for tape dispenser, air pillow machine and cartons at each location. This makes improving on your rate nearly impossible."
bad,"Ten hour shifts, fifteen minute ""breaks"" were actually five minute breaks and the 30 minute ""lunch"" was actually 20 minutes at best.. You are your production rate - nothing more and nothing less. Firing seasonal employees for not meeting their rates yet totally ignoring safety issues. The work was exhausting but I have a new appreciation for the ""permanent"" employees who work the long shifts."
bad,"Just bad management that doesn’t care. Your out in the horrible roads during winter, risking your life trying to hurry. If you don’t you will be out on the roads and in dangerous neighborhoods all for 13 hours the way the routes are. They don’t give you proper equipment for the long days you have, vans are not gassed up, vans packed top to bottom. Just not a good place stay away they do not care about you ."
bad,"intérim, intérim et intérim c'est tout."
bad,"The HR department in the building I worked in was awful. Completely unreliable, not helpful, and they were very unapproachable with extremely negative attitudes. Any issue associates had HR was the only department that could help, they would take a note of your name and login and what your issue was say they will help and offer a solution but never follow through. I would have to report the same issues 3/4 times (to the same person a majority of the time) until HR would actually do what they said they would. Management was terrible. No communication or information from leadership was ever given. Area mangers would disappear and new one would show up and never introduce themselves nor would old area mangers inform you they are leaving. You never knew who to report to in the department you work in because people were swapped out so frequently with no heads-up beforehand. 30 plus groups of new associates were constantly being hired weekly with no proper training. Very very unsafe work space. Lanes of boxes completely backed up and piled high with boxes or every shape and weight falling everywhere making it hard to not trip over boxes, and pallets build unsafe and constantly falling over with management and the safety department watching and doing nothing about it. I have worked in many many different warehouses but Amazon was by far the absolute worst work environment I have ever been in."
bad,"Put very simply you are nothing but a number to this company, and they will function in any way they please to achieve their own agenda. Really not a health place for most."
bad,"Arrêté de prendre les salariés pour des esclaves."
bad,"F**k you around with your money and hold it back, then try charge you the world for repairs and with hold all your money and say it goes towards the repairs absolute scammers"
bad,Working in AFE pack for a few years and if you don't go by what the managers want from you then you will NEVER get ahead in this company...so when asked to move to another station or to Robin or induct and if you reject them or speak your opinion then just know that you will never learn or move up in this company they will hold you back and give you BS reason of why you are not able to learn other aspects of the compnay
bad,While working for this company It was very strenuous to meet out target goals as they kept updating the demand to be faster to meet the client demands. Overall the environment is what is expected with warehousing and the pay was very well.
bad,"Only good for people transitioning until they get a good job. They force you to work overtime without pay by giving you more than you have to do for the hours you are suppose to work. They only care about their packages being delivered. Whatever happen to you after that is your problem not theirs. Retaliation is very high. No holiday pay, you know that you are off the route after making it to work."
bad,"workplace culture is childish high school culture"
bad,When i started they told me i'd be working full time but then cut my hours down to one day a week which was unlivable. Would nott recommend anyone to work there.
bad,They don’t care about safety nor being outside in freezing temperatures till your hands are numb which is unacceptable.  There is a lot of sarcasms. And favoritisms as well as if your not cool you don’t get a blue badge
bad,The warehouses are shut out from the outside world. There is no sense of the passage of time. You are a number to the company and worth is only as much as how fast you work. You will stand for dozens of hours to do the most minimal of tasks. It is isolating and hopeless.
bad,"amazon is probably the worst job you could ever decide to work at. the managers do not care about you at all, all they care about is if you meet their rates. they will find any reason to fire you. DONT WORK HERE"
bad,"The company sells a lot of promises but pay is the best thing about the promises of the positive work environment & hours are certainly not guaranteed, 1 out 5 of our location managers could actually be deemed respectful"
bad,"No music allowed  Work is very tedious      You have to flex up every day, or u get time deducted    One break for five hours of standing   Break for ten minutes  Very difficult, and when u get home, you are exhausted   You have to do specified number count each hour  Swag bucks are good   Sometimes u get a small snack"
bad,"It is a horrible work environment and folks in leadership positions that do know what they are doing. They place people in key positions without any  practical business experience outside Amazon. It is a very pollical environment, and if you are not well received or considered a favorite then you are targeted and removed without any considerations. Being promoted to an L6 or L7 is the highest you will ever go. If you like being considered a number and being used rather than appreciated and considered an asset then this is the place for you. They tempt you with decent pay and RSU's, but be careful this is not a 4 year commitment or guarantee, they can eliminate you at any moment and all future RSU's are lost. They are like the serpent in the Garden of Eden, be aware of their allure, diversity and fame. They are a million strong and could care less about you!"
bad,"Extremely stressful and physically demanding.  Everyone is obsessed abt their rate, quality, and productivity... if ur not 100% to plan, will be letgo"
bad,I feel that majority of the supervisors play favorites. We're told things that never happened. And the amcare staff is a joke. Fellow employee passes out hits head and ther response time was13 mins. And had no med gear with them to assist injured with injury.
bad,"At Amazon you're literally a number, theyll work you to death till you cant meet rate then find a reason to fire you 2 ankle surgeries later im gone.."
bad,"its not a very good place to work as amazon driver because they don’t care what happens to you on  the road. They don't care if you get a traffic ticket, they just want their deliver."
bad,"Entreprise qui te fait croire que la sécurité compte beaucoup et puis au bout de 3 semaines 1 mois pense qu'à la prod, constamment surveillé via un scanner, j'ai fait du pick 2 mois (marcher pendant 8h avec un chariot) , jamais été formé autre-part, alors que j'ai toujours fait ma prod, les lead qui se prennent pour des PDG qui te font une remarque pour UNE minute de retard après la pause alors qu'ils sont constamment assis devant leur écrans d'ordinateurs, pause d'ailleurs de 15 mins (le temps de traverser le site) communication médiocre, avec la boite d'interim (choisissez plutôt Addeco que Partnaire), les musiques qui passent en boucles chaque jours, car toujours la même playlist, bref mauvaise expérience."
bad,"Horrible place where to work.. Need to lick someones dark hole to work there longer or get a full time contracts. If you ready to do that, and don’t have your own opinion, go for it. 😎"
bad,"A frequent problem delivering for Amazon Flex is lack of fair pay. A 3-hour block might take double that time, and nearly always, the e-mail-only help center people in India deny excess block adjustments."
bad,"It's consent squatting and going up and down a ladder for over 10 hours, not to mention that your in a cage alone which drives you insane. No life at all"
bad,They go through people like cheap dishrags. Search YouTube for videos from several sources citing the accident rates and long term damage to your body. They put everyone through safety training for legal purposes then push a speed where safety cannot be maintained.
bad,"Wouldnt reccomend anyone working here. No training, no communication, no team work. Management is childish, and to many cheifs and not enough Indians."
bad,"Not enough training"
bad,je n'ai pas aimer travailler cher Amazon des horaires qui ne me convenait pas avec un stress permanent durant le temp de travail.
bad,"I hated every second of being here and dreaded returning. There is no movement upwards if no one likes you. Everyone was incredibly homophobic, I had a good friend I made there but everyone thought we were a couple and treated us with amazing disrespect. If you work here,  keep your head down and dont expect anything good just get your rate and collect your money. Its almost cult like how people enjoy it, they are only in tonite for the pay."
bad,"Persone che non ti fanno lavorare,ti vedono in difficoltà e chiedono di lasciarti a casa"
bad,Management at this facility is poor. With their job status there’s a sense of they feel they are better than their employees. Constant walking around heckling their employees and showing massive favoritism to friends and liking of certain individuals. Meanwhile there are workers who are doing double if not triple the amount of work. Not the place to go
bad,Lack of breaks. Poor PTO system. Poor management. Lack of respect for employment. Amazon needs a new work place system that appeals to employees. Employees quit because of short breaks and being harrassed while working.
bad,Long hours.. not long enough breaks. Pack orders would you have to pack fast enough in order to keep your rate up in order to be a successful in job position
bad,You never k ew your schedule until the end of the week. You also were told that you might work some weekends then lie and day you work every weekend. Job sucks
bad,"You work 4 days a week most time they will just schedule you a 5th.. no benefits no paid holidays ... no room for advancement . Your just stuck doing a very repetitive job. "
bad,"It's the ultimate dead end job. If you're looking for advancement, look else where. This is literally just to get a $15 an hour paycheck with having to fight for hours. Management has a high hiring rate so you constantly have to race to get an hours for the week. It's pretty disgusting."
bad,"Good Morning,  I'd never in my life work there again, Constantly Micro manage, 30 minute breaks where really 20, barely any  Interaction with employees when working, no music or talking, managment was absolutely no good @ all, the pay was good & so where the benefits, if you need something quick & fast an you can past a back ground and drug test you'll get hired on the spot, hiring process is very easy.... was a st"
bad,All work no play  short breaks and discipline if you mess up even being new. People are rude and self centered. Management and HR are senseless and don’t care about their employees.
bad,"The only positive that I can take from working for Amazon is that the jobs pays well, however because they pay so much your pretty much expected to burn yourself out just to keep your job."
bad,lack proper training. trainer unable to converse in full english sentences.  meeting expectations are too high vs. the training received. Two and half days will not suffice the volume wadis required.
bad,"The hours were reasonable but besides that the job itself felt like hard labor, it pays well but I left work everyday exhausted and ready for a nap. It's hard work."
bad,"too much politics, nepotism, favouritism. The management should ensure there is a level playing field. Should work towards improving on transparency of ratings and overall performance indicators."
bad,"Associates did majority of physical work with heavy lifting and pulling of at least 80 lbs.  Benefits sounds good however warehouse attendance is very strict and can be let go without an initial warning or sufficient grace period of clocking in for shift and lunch, 3-5 minutes"
bad,I never was late or took UPT nor vacation was in the top 10 % every week for quality never was written up but delaware is a right to work right to fire . They say you get an appeal I never got one . It's high school all over again little clicks different type of racism . Not worth the ulcur . Miracle I lasted 3 years mandatory 60 hours during chrismas. Money good .
bad,"They don’t care about you in this company at all they barely take time to learn your name, you are legit a small grain of rice in this huge organization in which you’re not apart of, I was just known as van 6, the job is physically demanding as it is but when people call out you’re slammed with the responsibilities of more packages when you’re already wondering how you were going to finish your own"
bad,The money seems nice at first but really isn't worth the stress. Being seasonal they care little about you. Actually they care little about people in general. They constantly stress about staying hydrated but only give 30 of being able to use the bathroom.(mind you the bathroom is at minimum 10 minutes away.) Lockers are doubles assigned meaning someone  else  could have it and take your personal items  (you have to lock away your phone)  so far no action has been made to correct their mistakes by hr.
bad,"Just exploitation, if you don't accept to work hard in night shift you'll not get the job. If you are not able to run and be stressed you couldn't work. It's well paid of course, but does not mean is a good place."
bad,"Whether you will love or hate Amazon will depend on your manager. "
bad,very physically demanding wasn't ideal for me because I am currently studying at university so it isn't a suitable job for someone who is currently studying
bad,"Amazon is the WORST place to work. So many promises that have never been fulfilled, something as simple as a water bottle or a locker. No rewards for hard work. No flexibility with schedules. No consideration for emergencies or other job related obligations. These people DO NOT care about you or family or your life outside of the warehouse. Not allowed to SIT (will get written up) even though you are working a 10+ hour shift. No phones. No WINDOWS!!!! No music. 30 minute breaks are in reality 20 because you have to include your walk time to and from your station. Only allowed to speak with HR during your break time, so you waste all of your break waiting to MAYBE speak with someone. And unless you’re dying, you are not relevant. One plus side is there are opportunities to leave early but they don’t ask everyone only a select few."
bad,"The hiring process is a joke I went in business professional for my ""interview"" most came in with tattered shirts and pants... No one from the hiring team really gave an interview they asked questions so to file information to process I-9's and W4's only asked for prof of identity and to submit a drug test. Work and life balance is non-existing during the months of July-Aug"
bad,Liked working there didn’t care for the people I worked for . I felt used and unappreciated. Managers were not helpful.  Would not recommend working for this company.
bad,"Very smart people works there,  "
bad,"A typical day at work is standing in front of a wall and being told to pick 360 items per hour, in the meantime you're told to watch your other employees and ensure they don't steal anything whilst you're watched constantly by the 1,000s of cameras littered around the place."
bad,"Los fines de semana dejan de existir. Tienes que fichar 10 min antes y 10 min después. Mucho y muy monótono trabajo. Acabas robotizado en todos los sentidos. La ""bolsa de horas flexibles"" es vergonzosa: trabajas horas extras cuando ellos quieren sin cobrarlas y te las devuelven cuando les da la gana."
bad,"legal modern slavery"
bad,"The culture working at Amazon was fast and impersonal. I enjoyed the people I worked with although, there was little time for most any relations. When you approached a manager they were always too busy or stressed out. If you wanted to say hello to an associate there was too much talk or down time and you would get into trouble. It was odd how they picked and choose certain individuals for advancement over others that were well and much better suited for the positions. It was a lot like nepotism."
bad,"A company that makes sure you know you are nothing to them, they are constantly looking for reasons to fire and replace you as soon as you get hired and the HR department is tyrannical and cruel to the managers and associates that work there, treating them as sub-human. "
bad,While the work isn't backbreaking most of the time it is very dehumanizing. You can tell every position will be replaced by a robot the second the technology is there to do so. Also the Head of the Entire Warehouse could barely get through a PowerPoint presentation so don't expect much from the management. You're a number not a person.
bad,It's very monotonous and tedious pays well but managers are always on your backs for nothing it's full of jobs worths that just want blue badges and there are more snakes in amazon than there are in the amazon rainforest! It's okay for a temporary job and decent money but wouldn't recommend it unless you had nothing else in the pipeline.
bad,"Worked one month at DAE3, and the managers are always hard to find when you need them. Most of the managers, including the guy running the building, hardly talk to any of the associates unless you are one of the people that licks their boots. The job is about productivity and less about how you are doing today or if the devices are working at all. I have taken overtime every week and maxed at 30 hours because they don't want to give you benefits right away. You get two 15 minute breaks and one 30 minute break so you can't use the bathroom because the bathroom is minutes away from the break room. To be honest, the job is paid slave labor, and they do it in the most convenient way possible. Amazon needs to fix everything and stop hiding behind forced positivity."
bad,No work/life balance. Mandatory overtime - 12 hour shifts with no breaks. Will promote from within however more often than not they will higher retired military. Unrealistic goals that need to be met.
bad,Working at Amazon is physically exhausting. You have mediocre breaks and are standing 99.9% of the time. They dont give you proper training and there is rarely a manager available to help when you need it. Would not recommend to anyone.
bad,"Good pay but not worth the mundane tasks carried out 10hrs a day. Very difficult to move up because of favortism. There is a possibility you may get injured, but Amazon will tell you to continue and 'power through' the pain."
bad,"I’ve never seen anything like it, I literally quit after day 1. Your break time is pretty much just a 15 minute jog around the warehouse, you won’t have time to eat. You are worked like a donkey for 10 hours + whilst managers just sit in chairs with a coffee and just watch you. By the end of the day you can barely walk as your feet hurt from standing for 10 hours straight. It’s basically like slavery and the gym all mixed into one. Bizarre and generally not a good move, go elsewhere, you’ve been warned."
bad,"good experience to work but the wages are low,if you want to learn about working in the ware house this is the place to be if you live near the warehouse."
bad,"A perfect way to kill your social life. Other staff look drained. Great place to work if you need extra hours and to pay off debt...as you will have no need to spend the fairly handy pay packet as you will be asleep or be working. Training was good tbf but the terrible monotony of the job, terrible catering, extremely poor employee mentoring, and tight job controls make what I see could be made healthy happy place of work your life a lifeless prison for between 10-14 hours of your life! your choice :)"
bad,"le travail demandé est tres dur physiquement (colis, charges...) et mentalement (horaires décalés..)"
bad,"Amazon, up close, has just become a large network of greedy, dog-eat-dog, good ol' boy (females too-though few) bullies. "
bad,"This job is for someone who has no kids or a life outside of work. Training was very poor. Management was never to be found, breaks are only 30 mins but by the time you get down stairs if your on 3rd or 4th floor half your break is taken. Then when I went to get my last check they missed a whole day on it and told me I had to wait another 2 weeks. Very unorganized"
bad,"If you like working in an environment where there's no training, direction common sense business management with little or work life balance then this is the company for you.  I worked at one of the delivery stations and from day one I knew I made the worst career decision ever. Horrible culture, no high level leadership unless you were willing to sell your soul to the devil."
bad,"If you want a stable long term job THEN THIS IS NOT IT. This job is constantly hiring for a reason. Yes the benefits are great the pay is decent and you get paid time off, unpaid time, and vacation time. But guess what if you're late from lunch or getting to work a few minutes their taking a hour of your time before you know it you can get walked out by going into a negative balance. Easily get fired here unrealistic"
bad,"Amazon is an easy job for the most part, just a lot of constant walking. I’m leaving soon due to the work environment, I started getting sick every time I went in due to the dust and dirty atmosphere and heat. I wouldn’t  know much about Management since I never had a single conversation with one that they initiated and they are barely able to be found after stand up meetings. I had to find a manager to address an issue only to find a manager to address an issue only to find out I had been doing my job incorrectly for months, no manager approached me about it or even tried to correct the problem. Not to mention you cant even go to the bathroom without stacking up TOT and getting in trouble. The only good part about working at Amazon is the co-workers/people you meet, I’ve definitely made lifelong friends."
bad,"Some of the manager treat the workers like slave, the working condition is not good enough, standing for several hours like slaves. The management policy are not really good. The only thing I liked is the health insurance is good."
bad,This job isn't for everybody. Management is not well and unsure of ability to move up in the company. No air conditioning in hot environment. Breaks not long enough.
bad,"Teammates only focused on advancing their own careers, were condescending, and only helpful if it made them look good on paper. Management was lacking"
bad,Management were all fresh out of  College pushing their weight around and treating the employees like pure trash. They would use a bull horn to shout how many minutes we’re on the clock  so you can speed up the picking process of the merchandise purchased online
bad,Immature processes. Forced attrition of good employees. Management promoted beyond their capabilities. Unwillingness to utilize any technology not created there that would aid the business. Avoid at all costs
bad,"Managers are very disrespectful, petty, manipulative, and sneaky. They lie, gossip about employees to managers and others; not including having certain warehouse associates spy/watch other associates whereabouts as they work, favoritism between employees, and follow you around, and watch your every move. Overall, a very hostile environment where so called “management” will intentionally provoke you to try and force you to quit."
bad,I was constantly verbally abused by their Canadian customers and the managers wouldn't allow me to transfer to another department and it caused me to go on medical leave then laid off after I was diagnosed with PTSD.
bad,"I was hired as a full time warehouse worker, in Portland OR. Most of us worked 4 days a week, 10 hour shifts. The job itself was tolerable, if physically demanding. The quotas placed on employees were not. The stowers were expected to stow, on average, 1 item every 11 seconds. This involved bending, reaching, stopping, and climbing a ladder. After a couple months of working at the fulfillment center, it was obvious people were getting hurt on the job multiple times per week. To address this, they told us we would have to work 5 days a week, still at 10 hour shifts; to make up for lost work. This was mandatory overtime. It did mean  more money but obviously, people got hurt more. To address that, they decided it would now be 12 hour shifts, 5 days a week. I left shortly after."
bad,"terrible. emailed manager about my absence for 2 days and the manager didn't view my email due to his own week of absence ""due to illness"" and  I subsequently got fired because of it (by the manager),  completely inhumane treatment and no job security."
bad,"Arrive on time, 2/3 hrs before you're on the road.  Management don't know what they're about. Start route late, GPS problems, Route problems, packaging problems, etc. Can improve w proper training for management & assistants. Amazon is all about the customer and zero about the employee."
bad,"HR doesn’t follow up with complaints, they’re not confidential with private information. The training is too short in result to new associates mostly quitting due to lack of knowledge. They change up their process a lot without a word to associates. You only walk through security on your way out. In Jeff Bezos’s book, his statement is truly what amazon follows, bring them in, burn them out, replace them."
bad,At Amazon You have to race against their rating computer the entire shift in order to keep your job there. The rating is you must have a 100% productivity every shift you are there if you do not they will write you up 3 times before you are terminated which happens very quickly and often to people that worked there.
bad,Filled with a whole bunch of people who just complain about having to do their jobs. Not much help when it came down to HR Help. They aren't really understanding with other's life schedule
bad,"Unless you move up quickly, the deterioration of your body will limit how long you can work here. You will also have to deal with high expectations for productivity despite there never being enough room to work efficiently."
bad,When they decide to get rid of you it takes them only 15 minutes to take your badge and you vest back from you and throw you in street like you nothig
bad,Loved it at start up. Hated it later..Hr was the down fall.. did not like . Management went bad. Ran off all the good people.  Put in for one job didn't matter got put in other departments anyway.
bad,"They added more pay but you work less hours. So the pay still sucks. They hire too many people, you’ll be lucky to work 3 days a week for 4-5 hours a day. So 15 an hour still sucks. If you work the overnight shift, your pay is still 15 an hour. This job only pays for gas. If you have bills and any kind of life, this is Not the job for you"
bad,"Busy, busy, busy. Always something to do and to keep busy.  Team spirited company. Customer obsessed and busy with meeting customer expectations. Customer focused."
bad,"Very bad workplace culture. You just have to execute, you are not asked to think. I had to work on Christmas."
bad,"I had no work experience before Amazon. I was hired shortly before the winter holiday boom. At that point in time they were hiring any living body basically. They just wanted temporary manpower and it seemed obvious. I would see people one day and not the next, the turn over rate was really fast. I stayed long enough to afford Christmas presents and then left. It was a very boring job and each day just sucked the joy in life away."
bad,"They work you as much as you can as your only viewed as a statistic. Any time to yourself, your rushing to make the most of it. Enormous warehouse where your travel time counts in your small break."
bad,"Amazon is hive and the workers don't matter, you can and will be replaced. I watched a lady collapse and we were expected to keep working. It took about 20 minutes for them to get her help."
bad,The benefits are great. The company tell you they hired you at one rate but when you get there the pay rate is much lower then what they told you. They don't appreciate you even when they know you doing a good job.  If you need a job go work there the first chance you get go find another one job.
bad,"I worked my fanny off as everyone does there. They dont care, they dont appreciate it. managers just want there bonuses, but they took our bonuses away, so they drive you hard and get rid of everyone, whos not way over performing. On the insurance, you have to literally fight to get your pay."
bad,I was there 9 months quit and when it came tax time I didn't get a w-2 most of management is young and dont know anything when is peak season they want you to work 60 hours a week but not one minute over or your fired
bad,"The hiring process is a complete joke. No wonder they have a revolving door of employees and braindead managers. Plus, during the summer, it gets to almost 110 degrees,  which is NOT healthy for anyone. The company makes enough to install air conditioning, just shows they don't care about their employees. Had to leave due to migranes caused by the excessive heat. My health is not worth terrible pay. "
bad,"The culture at Amazon is absolutely toxic. Productivity and Quality are of paramount importance. Your mental and physical health are the least of their concern, regardless of what smiling management/HR may tell you. Rates continue to increase as more and more people just looking to get by get slapped down on the chopping block. You are treated as disposable yet they toss around buzzwords and phrases like “you own your own employment. Implying that we are in control of whether or not we get promoted, etc."
bad,El trato al empleado no era muy bueno y nos hacían levantar peso sin parar toda la jornada.
bad,Not enough work during off-peak time to maintain the rate that was expected. Therefore frequent writeups after 5 writeups they fire you. Average worker last 3 months.
bad,"I do not suggest for anyone with mental health problems. The workload and expectations were absolutely ridiculous. HR on site had zero care for employees, I would suggest the ERC. During peak I worked over 60 hours a week, overnight shifts so 6pm to 7am, back to back for almost two months with one day off a week. It was horrible. The job is mindless and easy but expect to feel 10 years older by the time you leave. Yes benefits were amazing, and so is the pay, but it's not worth it at all."
bad,Wasn't the best experience i have had but it may work for others.
bad,"as an employee at amazon, i have almost zero personal life. i hardly ever have any time to even clean my house or take a shower some days. all i do is sleep, shower, work. repeat. there is very little to no career advancement. i was supposed to get training on a new truck and i wanted to apply to be learning ambassador. 6 to 7 months later never heard nothing back. you give it your all and I am one of the best pickers in the entire building yet they want more. nothing is ever good enough at amazon. I have never got burnt out with a job so quick."
bad,"Extremely hot in the summer and cold in the winter. "
bad,"I worked at 2 different locations Teterboro, Avenel, New Jersey "
bad,Hated every second I worked here! The conditions of the building were horrible! I was constantly sick and passed out at my station at least twice due to the heat! Never will I go into slave labor again!
bad,Everything is too fast paced and you get in trouble if your a minutes late from brake even though you have a 200% productivity rate. So why bother work your butt off for that high production rate if you get yield at for being a little late might as well do the bare minimum. Management is also a big issue and they change often making it hard to keep up with the new changes that come with them. Lastly can get fired or written warnings very easily.
bad,It is kinda of wrist twisting job. Their policy is horrible. Their management is a disaster. Their ratings system need to changing and improving to meet employees standards. They like to firing people which is violating federal law. We need to do something to stop their illegal operation.
bad,"They simply want you to get stuff out as fast as possible. 10-12 hour shifts with two 15 minute break, it takes 3-5 minutes of walking to and back from the break room. So really you might have  less than 10. Than you get a 30 minute lunch which is fine. But during the 12 hour shift they only add 5 minutes to your 15 minute break. They want you back on the floor as quick as possible. Some days they will throw you into another section of the warehouse and you wouldn't even know what to do. Management was okay. My supervisor didn't even know how to handle any sort of confrontations. Benefits were a plus. On two occasion  I may have missed the boxes per hour by 3-5 and would get a warning bout how if I keep on missing I can get written up. Everyone seems so depressed here as well. You'll get those few people who are energetic but not many. Also if you ever get hurt the AM Care, which is pretty much as useful as a elementary school nurse's office, will give you aspirin and either a cold pack/hot pack. Even though most a EMTs of some-sorts they are limited on what they can do. End of the day Amazon doesn't care about its employees just its numbers."
bad,"Amazon fulfillment and operations has a strong culture with a lot of intelligent leaders ready to learn but everyone has an expiration date here, long hours/hard work/not enough money."
bad,After waiting for a whole month during the application process and orientation I finally was able to pick up shifts to train. Two weeks into the job I am paid for two days only. Following week I pick up multiple shifts and given a faulty badge from my supervisor. The terminal fails to read my badge and gives me a terrible report in the system. I email and try to make contact with my supervisor but he rejects employees messages and continues to hide to avoid work. I contact the HR and they do the same with lies. I was never paid and they still refuse to pay me for multiple days that I worked with multiple witnesses. I turned into a victim working for Amazon and suggest you to avoid working for Amazon.
bad,Terrible hours. most hiring is done thru praying for a temp agency conversion. Micro management galore and mandatory overtime. do yourself a favor and better yourself to achieve a better job.
bad,"Horrible place to work at. You are basically a robot ( might as well be a pod on the AR floor at Amazon ) everything is timed and it’s very easily to make a mistake and get in trouble for it.  Task time has to be 7 seconds or less. You have to pick 400 items in an hour. One 30 min break and two 15 minute breaks that end up being 10 mins each because it takes at least 5 minutes to get to your station from the bathroom or breakrooms. If you are not at your station in time after your break you get in trouble. This job really takes a toll on your body . Constantly in pain during work and when you arrive home. This is a sweatshop like job. I feel horrible for what slaves went through because this job is tiring and horrible. Can’t eat properly for breaks because you’re constantly in the rush to get back to your station in time. I had to eat very quickly in 5 minutes and then as im picking I go to the bathroom to vomit. They tax your paycheck atleast 200 dollars. No wonder why they have amcare within the facility and vending machines with ibuprofen in it, Amazon knows this jobs is tough. I would not recommend this job to absolutely no one. Thank God I’m in school to further my career. I have only been working at Amazon for less than a month, start date was May 10th."
bad,"In my experience, Amazon has significant problems with preventing fraud, seller abuse, counterfeiting, and other nefarious activities on their marketplace. I worked incredibly hard to identify these issues and develop strategies for combating them. However I came to the realization that Amazon had little interest in making the necessary improvements or investing sufficient resources towards stopping these problems because they're perceived as too costly. Any updates to policy, operations, and even internal systems are painfully sluggish, largely due to poor communications and coordination between management and shareholders. Projects are picked up and abandoned without consideration for the work that's been put in, and there's an overall sense that no one really knows what they're doing. Overall a very chaotic company that I am surprised has managed to stay in business, let alone maintain a global presence."
bad,"People you meet can be great,,,,,however favouritism from upper management to teie 1 associates gets okd fast. When you want help you nevwr get it ,if your stuck in a certain area they dont move you ,no rotation, saftey is a joke ,the only time saftey is serious is when they want it to be .,,,,,, and theyll tell yiu you need to hold nehativity in for 10 hrs a day or more so you can take it home and take it out on your family or go in in and stab some one at work"
bad,"I had personal issues outside and inside of work that I always communicated. My managers constantly belittled my issues, and made fun of me. I even was accused of ""mismanagement of time"" despite medical emergencies."
bad,Really stressful environment a lot of pressure they don’t care for people anything about target and always the they will find excuses to sack you but they pay good money though.
bad,"Working as a fulfillment associate you are on your feet for 10 hrs. The benefits are great but why wouldn't they be, they want you healthy and able to take the bodily beating the next day. If you go to amcare (They have an onsite mini triage) they ask you if it was a job-related injury or was it previous and if it was previous did the job make it worse. If you say it was made worse or it was job related by working at Amazon they want to do an investigation involve your manager and treat you like a suspect. There was an incident where a male associate slipped on water and did a complete split. He was quickly escorted to Amcare but at amcare was told not to call an ambulance and if he thought about going to the ER come to them first. Hmmmm I wonder why, trying to avoid a lawsuit much? (Underhanded practices that need to change) You only get a two fifteen minute breaks and one thirty minute break.  It takes 2-3 min to walk to the break room so your 15 is really  11-9 min. The 30 min break is really 26-24 min. And for 10 hours that's absolutely crazy. So you only get a total of 37-33 min for the WHOLE 10 HOURS. I have been with the company for about 6 months and my body is still not used to the physical strain. My feet hurt on my days off when I'm laying down. I can barely take care of my family or stand and cook a meal on the weekends because my feet hurt so bad. Mind you i'm not overweight.  My first week there I was falling asleep in my car from exhaustion in the parking lot at work and in front of my house when I got home. During the peak in december, I can't tell you how many"
bad,"Short and simple"
bad,"It’s a big company and they also suck big time. From recruitment to management, their statements are contradicting so it confuses every employees. Their rules in other sites may or not apply depending on their mood which is completely unfair. On site, their policies changes every single time, like from a wave of trainees to another, they follow different rules which makes it unfair to others."
bad,"This place is a meat grinder. If you can take abuse from managers and customers, you'll do great as long as you can jump through the ridiculous standards they have. Coworkers really try to give the best customer service they can get but weird rules, the NNR/how youre judged in your job, and the constant pressure from your Coaches/managers, crush so many awesome people. If you can get into management, then you're golden. All they do is backstab each other, play random games (that are suppose to boost morale/team building), listen to calls."
bad,"Poor management culture, team leaders are just messengers for managers no authority. Canteen decent but nothing special. Warehouses are monitored all day for 10 hours if you're not hitting at least 100% then you get warned. Compulsory o/t between November and January and holiday embargo. One bad week there and it could be curtains for you!"
bad,"Like most companies these days, you can NOT rely on long-term employment with this company.  It could be good as a secondary job.  "
bad,"They set rated standards in place for associates to meet, but are unclear in their communication about the rated tasks. They often times take disciplinary action against an associate with a condition that was never described and the senior training staff are often not even aware of. A member of leadership will say something to an associate that will later be contradicted by a different member of leadership. All safety rules and established guidelines can be overlooked by the term ""Business Needs"". And this need is often based on the mood of the leadership."
bad,Worst company to work for in the HR department. Management doesn’t understand and cares about anything. You sit in a dusty place inside a warehouse with noise of conveyor belts making you deaf. Long working hours and you are forced to do overtime all the time.
bad,"It is an extremely repetitive job in most positions and that makes working days very long. Pay is bad even if your a supervisor, a trainer, or just a Fullfillment associate the hourly wages are capped ."
bad,"Very poor care for workers. They care more about the bottom line than for the people working for them.  Their motto is to be customer centric, but they should be more employee centric."
bad,"Feverishly paced work environment. Zero tolerance to meet deadlines. Constantly “coached” for every task. Very easy to get fired for not meeting impossible quotas. If you looked up the word sweatshop you’d find a picture of any amazon warehouse. Don’t recommend working here unless you absolutely need a job or fresh out of high school and need help paying for college. Only pros about working there were the coworkers, free Gatorade and health benefits. HR department was horrible, not helpful at all. Major attitude with any request. Especially night shift."
bad,They do not care about their employees. It is all about the rate! Very physically demanding. There are barely any employees that are not in pain daily! The only thing good about the place is the insurance benefits.
bad,"Usual zero hour contract, not guaranteed work, call you last minute to come in. Send you home when not busy so lose out on money. "
bad,"When you come at work you don't wanna stay there"
bad,Don't bother applying here your wasting your time. The management was poor the work was back breaking the pay was poor lunches too short there is no reason why you would ever want to work here.
bad,"You are treated like a machine with a number, not a person. While you are well compensated, you will make no friend, have little time to breathe, and be paid no special attention. You are a cog. When you break, you are replaced."
bad,The work was just about the easiest just repetitive if anything but for the work the pay was good considering how easy it was Management on the other hand is just about the worst they’re just about clueless and unorganized and greedy if anything and I say this you will not go no where in amazon if you don’t throw away your dignity if that’s ok with you hey amazon sounds like your place if you care who you are then amazon definitely isn’t worth the time
bad,I have been working for amazon for about a year.. Some of the managers there are not bad and are not on your case like others.. The rates are ridiculous. The time off task is ridiculous too if you need to use the restroom.. The breaks are extremely short you can't even enjoy your meals and sit down to stretch your legs.. I understand that the work needs to be sent out and can not be sitting there for a while.. But honestly employees should not be harassed about their rates.. Its a very high demand work place because yes productivity is important.. But when it has to come to managers being all in your case and harassing you or threat your job they have no problem in doing so.. They feel like doing that to the amazon employees will encourage them or motivate them to get higher rates.. SMH... The majority of the managers are young some come straight out of college.. They basically train the managers to harass their employees about rates just about any little thing.. You can be replaced in a blink of an eye without a care in the world.. Some managers don't really care for you and some do and will work with you.. If you work with a good manager  then you are lucky!... The benefits are ok the paid time off (pto) is good just sucks that it ends in may SMH.. Vacation time as well is good unpaid time off good (upt)... Just wish they would give the employees instead of upt sick days but that is only offered to the part time employees because they don't have the benefits that we have.. What this company also is good for is favoritisms. In any job they have their group of people and those
bad,"Some recruiting leaders are shameless and lazy and super click-ish.  You have to wonder how some of these ""leaders"" ever even became managers.  The nepotism at Amazon Lab126 in recruiting is disgusting and rampant."
bad,"Only work here if you need the money not if you're looking at being happy when you go to work. "
bad,"Managers need to learn to respect associate, it is not all about forcing people to achieve goals that are manipulated by the managers themselves. They typical focus on them and not about the associate family."
bad,Good. Its  a good company to work for. Can work on work life balance. Lot of stress on employees to deliver. Sometimes timelines are too aggressive.Great learning experience.
bad,"Pay is good, but management and work/life balance are very poor. They like to change schedules without notice which drastically changes your schedule. Management is disconnected from"
bad,it's an exploitative environment they violate labor laws pay poorly force overtime limit breaks understaffed inhuman there no air conditioning or heating for weather extremes there's 6 managers and 12 employees on the floor
bad,the managers were blind to the people who do the job. one of thier policies was NO cell phones on the floor I lost count on how many people I saw using thier phones! or were just standing around talking to each other while I and people like me did the work. for some reason they didnt see that
bad,"Amazon pays less per hour than most companies requiring the same work environment. Management was okay as people but handcuffed by corporate policy and often left in the dark by their superiors in regards to what was going on to their employees. I had three manager, at least, and none of them knew why I was let go or that I had even been let go until one of them texted me the next week."
bad,Managers messed up and didnt VTO properly and made my time go negative which put my job in jeopardy and then they denied my transfer stating no reason
bad,"A normal day starts about an hour and a half before your shift employees start, you write a detailed plan daily as the GM/Finance and Senior Ops on the shift before will consistently lack planning and adjust your volume with no notice.  You will have your first meeting 30 minutes before your 2nd meeting with your team.  Shift will start normal with a bad handoff if you are a night manager, day managers usually get a good handoff as the nigh shifts focus on wok and not making the GM happy with massive meetings.  Also the weak managers tend to be on days for oversight.  You will have 2 more meetings and then end the day writing a detailed overview."
bad,"Application process pretends to be streamlined oh don't be misled. Upon arrival (basically for a drug test) as you look around the room you will get a DARK clue why there is a high turnover. "
bad,The lack of effort the management puts into people treating them like expendable scabs. Unrealistic production goals with unrealistic methods to obtain those goals.
bad,"Urata experienta. Targeturile cresc de la o luna la alta, dia socoteala team managerului pt fiecare minute de mers la toaleta sau de baut apa, sunt grupuri prefertae de catre team manageri alaturi de care barfesc si pe care ii lasa in ritmul lor lent, iar pe ceillalti pun biciul. Unui manageri nu saluta, in intalniri 1 to 1 iti vorbesc urart  te jignesc si iti dau de inteles ca daca nu maresti pasul, te da afara. E o clica ieftna in care nu v-as recomnada sa intrati vreodata"
bad,Poor management and impossible work standards too much work with too little time and you are pushed to do their speed or you won’t be working there very long
bad,"Poor management, but good pay. "
bad,"management is clueless or obnoxious and the work is not worth the pay. very petty and cliquish high school-like workplace culture. people here in their 30s and 60s acting like 15 year olds with their petty nonsense. at first you wonder why they're working a job like this at their age, then you know."
bad,"Amazon is like a giant legal sweat shop. And the only reason people really stay there is because they are either jobless, uneducated, or need the benefits. Amazon provides really good cheap benefits and that's why it's so hard to leave for some people because they have family's. The company is just greedy and they want things moved faster,pushed faster, flown faster, arriving faster. And they let you know that whale they give you your $12.00  an hour  paycheck. And your ranking system above is flawed. Because the problem with working at amazon is the pay if they payed like Uline 17-18 dollars an hour starting I could see their expectations deserving to be met and able to push you the way they do. But you say compensation/benefits their benefits are no doubt good but the pay is horrid."
bad,They recently gave a company-wide raise to all employees. While they gave that they also got rid of the RSU's and monthly bonuses so you were making the same amount of money as you were before but they also made it impossible to get bi-annual raises for the next three years. They have impossibly high standards they expect you to keep and an overturn rate of 2% each week. They do offer benefits but you're not likely going to stay there long enough to take advantage of. They're hostile towards worker's unions and hardly listen to workers' complaints. The work environment is very hot and very uncomfortable. Overall very bad workplace.
bad,"Worst job I’ve ever had. Management treat you as numbers, 30 min lunch on a 10 hour day, one 15 min break spent walking to the break room sitting for a moment then up walking back to your station, very repetitive and hard on the body even if you follow the safety guidelines, Could barley walk at the end of my 3rd day, was getting hassled by management to go faster on my 1st day (was still in training) will get a right up of your not preforming to the desired speed. The mats they provide for you might as well be considered concrete. You spend your entire day in a semi dark station scanning a product and putting in a bin scanning bin and repeat. I had 5-7 people behind me in line to do the paperwork for resigning."
bad,Middle management at the location harmed the site the most.  2 out of 3 general managers were pretty good leaders.  But middle management refused to listen to the general managers. Problems with payment.  Slow payment and payment error causing late and short deposits. Many employees were harmed financially. Little to no opportunity for promotion.
bad,"They treat you like a robot/dog. The job is disrespectful to human intelligence. I was assigned as a picker. In this job you are left in a warehouse with nothing but your thoughts for ten hours a day. Slowly, the image of burning the warehouse down will begin to creep into your head. Around the two week mark these thoughts will be impossible to ignore. Each of your nights will be haunted by the sound of your scanner, and sleep will lose all joy."
bad,Being former military this job was worse than anything I've ever done in the military. Managers do not care about the employees. Pay is awful and promotions are slim to none.
bad,"The managers would give an order to do a task a certain way and then when you did the task the way they want they get mad and say you are not working efficiently. When you ask management for feedback, they just tell you to get back to work."
bad,"Yes the company has “increased the wages” but they have taken away benefits, cut hours, and removed holiday bonuses. There is an extreme lack of training, and employees are yelled at for not making numbers. I personally know two people that have been fired, one who had to miss work due to having to go to the hospital and not putting in a leave of absence request properly (this is at the Englewood location where the is no in person HR; you have to call a number that has you on hold forever and then makes you call other numbers to fulfill all requests), and another who locked his keys in his car, and was fired for “breaking into his own car” after proving it was his car and having the Amazon Security gaurd help him get it open. This job is literally modern day slavery where the company shoves the idea of safety down your throat but continues to tell you to work harder and faster, causing it to feel uncomfortable to even leave to use the restroom because your dinking around. They have a list with all employees names and a computerized system that calculates how much time you are spent not working. The one good thing about this company was networking with other employees. Would not recommend."
bad,It was very quick paced and long hours. My days off I was in a haze and too sore and tired to really take advantage of them. The management is very disjointed and it feels like you are just a faceless cog in the machine.
bad,"There is nothing good I can say about this company.  The management was awful, the work environment was awful.  The only thing you are to them is a number."
bad,"An awful company to work for, getting hours is a chore with over a hundred employees vying for measly 10-slot shifts, and anyone that complained was waved off."
bad,"I worked for this company 12 years ago when it was not so big. It was a great place to be. As of starting work their 3 weeks ago, I am regretting turning down the other interviews I had. 12 years ago the pay was $13.50 hr and they were not that big and they are just now getting to $15 hr and it is run like a sweat shop. Most of the the process assistants on the floors had bad attitudes and everyone is not treated equal. It is a shame but I have been a prime customer for years and really am thinking about not buying from Amazon at all. I am very disappointed at what they have become in the warehouse. Some of the investors in this company need to be an undercover employee to see how things are really going."
bad,"You are treated like you are in prison. Management, HR, etc, they don't care what you are going through. If you don't meet their expectations you're fired. The manager that I have can't keep our sleds full of work, and you basically have to stow 700 units a day. If you make one error then you need to stow at least 1000 units to cover that error, but if you don't have the workload to cover it then you are written up. If you get three writeups for quality then you are fired!"
bad,"Amazon does not care about their employees and try to hide behind the facade of being the earth’s most “customer centric” environment, when they forget to pay attention to the most important customers, the internal customers (employees). However I have a learnt a lot here and appreciate the opportunities that I have been given."
bad,"poor management, extreme work conditions, come and go as you please results in harder work environments for others. It is physically exhausting and the shifts are scheduled awkwardly and with terrible hours"
bad,"I have been working at the LBA2 for 1 week. In that time I have been approached by management every day about something I didn't do that I should or something I did which I didn't do."
bad,"You will never get a hold of the HR department. They do not answer phones. The managers will tell you you're not allowed to do something but ""can you read between the lines"". The pace is a joke, the breaks aren't long enough to even use the restroom."
bad,Been working here for 3 days. On my first day no one was there to let me in I had to figure things out on my own. So whatever that email says about being greeted by an amazon worker they should rewrite that and say figure that out on your own. The training was horrible that lasted for about 30 minutes. Which wasn’t even on the job training more like common sense safety training. So make sure you watch those online new orientation videos because that training was more successful than your actual training. Second since the training is terrible you have to figure everything out in your own. It’s not rocket science but I’ve never worked at a place where you just follow what everyone else is doing. Which by the way the poeple there are mute they don’t speak which is super awkward. Also they have no sense of direction you just walk around acting like you’re busy doing god who knows what? They also don’t know you by name. They Have these meaningless stretches to make it seem like the managers actually care about their employees and ask about safety tips when in actuality all they care about is getting those shipments out to fulfill their credibility. They don’t actually care about you guys they walk around in their carts on their high horse the women managers are unapproachable they always look mad looks like they hate the place. When it’s time to bring the carts out to the drivers it’s just a big whole mess they have no system or organization how to bring carts out you just bring them out. Workers just stand there like idiots waiting to bring carts in and out and of course you have
bad,"Working in a fulfillment center is the polar opposite of working at Amazon Corporate in Seattle.  Even though the salary is increasing to $15 an hour it is hardly enough for the cost of living and the job is designed for someone under 21 who is living at home and just needs some extra ""pocket money"""
bad,This company views its employees as nothing but numbers. Horrible work environment. They follow you to your breaks and lunches to make sure you come back on time. Safety is ignored to the highest extent there.
bad,"Very structured and driven company.  General laborer employees are treated like robots and many leave the company to either distress or ""on the job"" medical conditions.  There are a lot of OSHA discrepancies.  Schedules are not flexible.  If you want to work there, you take what is available."
bad,Choose life dont work here .  Boring and lonely.  Your feet will know about it . Its not worth the money . They look at you asif u have just shat in the microwave. No time to rest after a short dinner break . Wanna be brown noses allover . Deppressing environment.  It will break you .
bad,A typical day at Amazon is very tiring we are over worked and under paid. The environment is very harsh you are expected not to talk even while working. Management will seperate you if you do so and you get written you for every little thing. When you approach managers about a problem it never gets resolved. I've learned not to give so much of myself to a company that doesn't care about me and my well being. The hardest part of my job is repetition on my body and the most enjoyable is my coworkers as I have worked side by side them for 9 years.
bad,"Exhausting, grunt work, with no empathy or compassion. In thousands of dollars of debt, due to an injury and poor health coverage. Can't even afford to receive the care I need so I'm not in pain.  Every minute they cant track your productivity is questioned and scrutinized."
bad,"Smart people but moral crushing culture. Backstabbing and politics is rampant. Managers are forced to stack rank. There is a facade of company caring about their employees but the managers will throw you under the bus if need be. I am here only for salary and brand name - Stay away if you can: I have seen atleast 5 people who were exceptional at their work but were shoved out based  on ""performance issues"" when in reality they were just layoffs (company has to force people out since it is bad PR if they layoff)."
bad,"Nessuna possibilità di carriera e turni durissimi, si è trattati come macchine e non persone, se stai malato ti lasciano a casa, e anche se lavori sodo comunque primo o poi vieni scartato per far posto a qualcun altro, infatti i dipendenti cambiano sempre."
bad,"I will start this off by if your looking for reliable finance and your needing money for crimbo from this job, I would say yes it is but you have to sign devils contract first."
bad,"While the pay is high for an entry level job, the company is harsh and their policies are unforgiving. The physical toll on your body is like nothing you will ever have imagined and the money is certainly not worth the injury."
bad,Its a dog eat dog world out there. Sometimes the management can be extremely ruthless. The quality of work is good but a lot of people lose steam. Sometimes the reason people stick on is only because of the pay and the RSUs.
bad,"horrible leadership, horrible training if you get training at all, hire more from outside the company than they promote from within, always want more but dont want to compensate you for it, mandatory overtime, high attrition rates for associates and managers because all their systems and structure they talk about being so great  actually isnt"
bad,"Tasks are injurious to the human body and mind, long work hours on your feet, heavy lifting, no career progress in sight. There is a visible lot of nepotism, racism and favoritism at Amazon, you'd have to look, speak or act certain way to advance."
bad,"Not friendly, slave driven, managers know nothing they are all about being on their phones, managers don't treat everyone equal."
bad,"Don't bother. You either stand and pack boxes or walk 12 miles a day. Mandatory over-time happens Black Friday - Christmas."
bad,"If you like being treated like garbage then Amazon is the job for you. They do their wage surveys based upon the lowest paid companies in the state that you work in  so, they can justify not giving you a raise or even a decent raise if you are lucky to get 1."
bad,"Horrible place, poor Hr aND management "
bad,the selection process isn't consistent. they don't accomodate for anyone. it's either do what they want or get out. the money they pay you isn't enough
bad,"Amazon is a good place to work for a short period of time.  The hours are long and the leaders unappreciative of the effort contributed. The bar is set at an unreachable level and kept consistently out of reach as to keep people to constantly trying to achieve it."
bad,Management really doesn't like to listen to any problems. A lot of high school cliques at work as well who like to gang up on other employees who are doing better than they are and try to get them fired. Many managers get annoyed if you have to ask them a question aside from the main managers who work in HR.
bad,"This place sucks the soul out of anyone who actually has one. It is a terrible company run by terrible people, and terrible behavior is rewarded. Working there tool away a part of me that I'll never fully get back."
bad,They treat you well until they need you once there isn't much work they wont shift you to some other department. They assure you of job safety and the next day they start firing people in front of you and still keep saying everything is fine.
bad,"The absolute ONLY thing that was good here was the benefits. If you can stand the 10hr + days doing the exact same thing, such as just pushing a button then turning around and pushing another one, then this is the job for you. Management gives absolute no feelings towards their employees. Oh and if you work you're butt off enough to be depended on by management to run the department when they're busy, don't expect to be promoted. Actually, expect them to step all over you,  ask you to train other people the job you already do, then promote them instead. Management is a joke in this place and its all about favorites, nothing with skill and hard work. Its all about meeting those numbers and they bulldoze anyone out who cant make it. Trust me, dont take the easy hire. It will suck the life out of you."
bad,Corporation lifestyle carousel work you till your dead tired and get next people to come in... they care very little about hours you work and they do a lot of illegal stuff when it comes to HR related.
bad,"I️t was a fun work place the management was poor , hours wasn’t good , and the pay was nothing maybe 400 a week and that’s no money when you have bills to pay"
bad,"Long hours. Very hotnoj. Building, management is very young. The pay is 13.25. It is ten hour shifts with three days off. Giant breakrooms. Have to hit rates."
bad,"This company cannot give accommodation to physical disabilities regardless of doctor's verification. Everyone is expected to work VERY hard and will have supervisors ride you for not meeting ""RATE"" at which cannot always be met because of HEAVY loads and no teamwork."
bad,"During my work at Amazon in KYC, initially the work was very challenging and interesting, but gradually the meaning of  it disappeared, together with the work recognition"
bad,"Pay is good, but when an emergency at home comes up they don’t give you time off. This place goes by a points system. The breaks are super short and lunch is only 30 minutes. You are on your feet your entire shift and should get longer breaks!"
bad,"I was hired for safety rep/ forklift trainer and they made me hand stack boxes at the end of the line. they lied just to get us to quit our jobs and work for lower money I was making $14.75 hr. and they promised me $17 hr to start with a rise in 60 days Moved me picking and when we would meet rate they would  higher the rate  for the next week they did this every week to all pickers and then they would fire them after peek season was over, manage they kept changing my days and hours for 8hr days to 10 hr. days. they moved me to picker and when we would make are rate they would raise it. for all pickers. management would pick on us and harass us until we quit. it was he worst place to work ever!"
bad,"Job is brutal, if you can handle the long walks and management treating you like children; then go for it. I am an adult, so I want to do better for myself.."
bad,"Amazon is terrible. Only apply there as a last resort. You're just a body,  nothing more. Someone with a degree will be picked over you so little to no room for advancement unlike they claim. Pay is capped after 3 years. There's a lot of childish, cliquey lazy employees that need to be let go of like yesterday. Management might as well not exist you can never find them and they never do their jobs.  It's just a stepping stone to them and it shows. No appreciation for the hard workers, only brown nosers. So glad I left"
bad,"The only best part of the job working at Amazon is around Christmas time when they draw names if your name is drawn you win some great prices like tv's, game consols other great prices."
bad,"Long days, cattle call mentality, trainers and ambassadors do not know the exact metrics by which you are evaluated. Long lines at time clock for punching in and or out. Management lack interpersonal skills when addressing staff."
bad,the process of putting items away was not organized. There is no specific place for anything. It was stressful and the rates that were needed were laughable.
bad,Not enough training to do the job you are assigned. Management only worries about numbers not the people. The hardest part of the job not being sure if you do something wrong if it will get you fired or have to be retrained the guidelines are not clear and they change them to suit the situation as needed.
bad,"the entire interview was just a bunch of lies. once i got in i found out the hard way. their system is entirely set up to hurt you, you don't have any time to yourself because you're working 60-70 hrs. a week, and they will do anything to your UPT and PPT to screw you over. i had 24 hours of PPT and i used it on a 10 hour shift because i had court and they not only took all my PPT but also UPT, a collected 32 hours they took for a court case that only lasted 10hrs"
bad,"It's all about manager whom you working, there will be no clarity it's sugar cane. There will be no clarity in work management all US work culture from North guys will be admiting this culture. not who worked  on normal cultural."
bad,"Sehr stressiger Arbeitsplatz. Zu zu viel Aufgaben für ein Teamleiter und einfach kein Spass auf der Arbeit (work hard, have a fun and make a history) kein ""fun"". Zu starke Fluktuation, auf der monatlichen Base ein Paar Mitarbeiter kommen/gehen und es ist sehr schwierig für Teamleiter. Managment ist oft frech und unehrlich."
bad,"The first thing they tell you when you get there is how much opportunity there is to advance, but it's not telling the whole truth. The whole truth is you only get to advance if you know someone, or get them to like you. It doesn't matter if you're better suited for the task than someone else, or if you have an excellent work ethic or not, it's based on entirely on who you're friends with. Same goes for your day to day, if you're not friends with one of the water spiders, expect to be loading all the heavy things all night. Excellent pay though, and benefits. Just wish it was a little less chaotic."
bad,The expectation of staff in Amazon is for 120% of effort which is typically not enough to satisfy the demands of management who in many cases have only ever worked for that company. Unrealistic. Ethically I would also question many of their business practices.
bad,"Job is too stressful, too many accidents occur in environment & management does not care about employees safety. I would not recommend working here if you have children, not going to a gym everyday, etc."
bad,"All in all,Amazon is a fun place to work,but they let alot of good workers go for no good reasons,the work load can be hard at times and managers dont care,they still want you to work"
bad,"Disorganizzazione, turni massacranti e nessuna possibilità di carriera. Esperienza molto negativa."
bad,"I love to work hard and I was taken back by how hard the pushed other people. I had an idea what is was getting into but be aware when you sign up read the hand book you can be fired for some weard litle things. No matter how hard you work, there is no saving you. Be ready to grind and if you do that you will last a year or so at the most. Go to school..."
bad,"Very monotonous job, a lot of mandatory OT without proper notice, quality of management was poor with lack of knowledge of what they were managing.  Very simple job tasks, not at all mentally challenging.  The physical work environment was extremely dirty with clouds of dust int he air, & extremely loud, partly due to machinery & also the employees has a tendency to scream throughout the entire shift.  Overall, a frustrating place to work."
bad,"wasn't a place for me. busted my butt working and was never given a promotion. I get that customers make you money, but you need workers to help with that. Amazon doesn't really care about their employees and their families"
bad,"day was pretty stressful . my day would start on the production floor, and from there I never knew what my assignment would be for the day. I liked the job and people but management was constantly changing."
bad,This is not a great job. Everyone that works there hates it and is miserable. Management usually has no idea as to what’s going on. The atmosphere is depressing and it’s all about quantity not quality.
bad,"amazon is a great work field , once you get the hang of unloading the boxes & loading it’s a great fit.  "
bad,"Hardest part was pushing the carts cause depending how tall how small, and everything else you are compared to someone who is tall or can lift more it was hard an tedious pushing it around a Huge warehouse all day. But I kept busy genuinely enjoyed it most the time ! Management was good, (funny) and very supportive and understanding, a typical day at work is fun cause there is this huge ware house with everyone you meet at orientation an you become kind of family at work you let loose an are comfortable with your Co workers"
bad,NIEMALS wieder in diesem Ausbeuterbetrieb. Der weg zum Pausenraum ca 15min wird von der Pausenzeit abgezogen. Kein Essen und Trinken am Arbeitsplatz und kontrolle der Mitarbeiter wie am Flughafen. Beschuldigungen durch Teamleiter einer Straftat
bad,Amazon just treats their employees like numbers. If you can't keep up to rate then your just gonna get fired or your just going to have to quite. Their rates are a joke and they expect you to have unlimited energy. I ended up getting a severe case of tendentious in my knees from the pick positions rate requirements and Amazon took zero responsibility for it. Amazon just hires in the masses and only keeps A small fraction of those people. They just use - abusive - replace.
bad,These people have no balls when telling the company which policies are wrong and unethical.  They will tell people that will do anything too keep them.  But as soon as your manger takes vacation.  His fill in will fire all under performing people regardless of the reason or knowledge of unfair practices
bad,The management was the worst part. The inconsistency of “criticism” in your work. Very high expectations! Not worth it. I wouldn’t waste my time here.
bad,"we were expected to do every job in the building to keep it running, but were only paid for our jobs. if you were friends with management you could slack off and cut corners or ignore safety procedures and requirements."
bad,"Senior/Executive management was not supportive of lower levels of management and the meetings were usually filled with yelling and cursing.  Long hours and working every weekend became exhausting.  You are not appreciated and you are ""never enough,"" no matter how hard you work."
bad,"If I could give those job a 0 star rating I would. Management is very poor considering they hire right out of colleg. They treat you like garbage and don’t really do anything about it. The pay is not worth 10 hours a day, considering on where it is located. The advancement opportunities takes 4 years unless you’ve have a college degree. Don’t work at amazon"
bad,"It you have ever seen the movie “The Hunger Games”.....Then you should know exactly what it is like to be an Area Manager with this company. Every manager is competing for the next level position that may not even exist. The building I work at currently has re-launched three times. Each manager is back stabbing the next and the evaluations, no matter what corporate says, is based upon how popular you are with your peers and manager. Not with your performance. If you are looking to age beyond your years, never see your family, always be stressed out, and never feel secure in your job, work for Amazon."
bad,The overall feel of the place was similar to slave labor. The production expectation was very cut throat. Management was cold rude and uncaring. Not worth the wear and tear on your body.
bad,"Working with Amazon doesn't really have any benefits other than working from your home office. You expect to be working directly with customers, but they could swap you to another department without much notice, or even another team manager within a weeks time."
bad,"Amazon is a joke! It is a rapidly growing company that treat their employee like a number. Because of this mentality, I don't believe they value their employee that have been there was years (4-5yrs). Growth within the company is slim to none - it really boils down to who you know."
bad,Harrassed employees during their breaks. changed policies and rules on the fly. Human Resources is a joke! They are in kahoots with the young management staff their! They lie to your face all the time!
bad,"These were the worst days I worked for DCH2 Morton Grove Amazon."
bad,worsst place to work for. the magement was not the best and played favorites. the people i worked with was amazing and returns was not hard work. the computer system was the worst it froze alot
bad,"Well i dont have anything good to say about amazon unfortunately... they dont care for productive and great individuals. Ive managed team of 35 from which only around 5 were retained( laziest ones!)"
bad,amazon was a very fun and enjoyable place to work when i first started then management changed and it all changed when all of the managers got there and the old ones left
bad,The title says it all its really hard and only gets harder with no pay increase or Atleast a significant increase and they cut corners in every little thing possible you could have 1 person doing 3 jobs at the same time and thats a normal thing there if you feel like you like you have more value this isn’t the place for you cause youll only be a number at Amazon
bad,"Be prepared to work crazy hours under crazy expectations. Compensation is amazing, however the culture is pretty cut throat. The New York Times article was very accurate when describing the environment."
bad,"I would never recommend that anyone get a job here unless for quick money because you won't be there for long. They run you to death,  constantly pushing you, and if you don't make rate (items picked per hour) they will write you up. The problem with that is, you're not in control of how many items you pick, the hand scanner you use is... You could pick one item on the first floor,  then you have 10 seconds to find your next item that's 200 isles away that are all clogged with people from srowing who don't move out of your way (like they're supposed to). Naturally,  you spend every day worrying about how you're going to pay the bills if you get fired which is very possible there. 3 write ups for not making rate and you're fired. Thank God I found work elsewhere first!  When you get home, you can't sleep or walk because your feet feel like they're on fire from running to make rate and your nerves are shot from worry. I wouldn't recommend this job to my worst enemy."
bad,"Management is terrible. If you need help, they will tell you they will be right back, and then leave for hours at time. One manager told an associate that they couldn't help because "" I have more important issues, I can't find my laptop"", and just walked away. We are under paid and under appreciated. They expect one person to do the work of 3 people. Management is more worried about rates instead of the well being of the associates. If you don't make rate, you go on probation. If you still cant make rate, you get fired. They don't care about helping you get better as an employee. If you ask to go to AmCare, they will act like its a big inconvenience for them. Management will also play favorites. You can train for a certain roll for months and they will give it to someone else who has never done the job, only because that person is their favorite."
bad,"Chaotic management, no regard for work quality. Work life balance is non existent, company does not respect its employees. Go somewhere else if you want to be a decent human being."
bad,"Personnel come and go so frequently, you will rise to the top of the stack if you can stick it out for a few years. Lots to learn but you will have competing priorities which make self development difficult."
bad,"If you are in your early 20's and this is your first job out of school and you are hungry for work hours, this is the place to work! If you have a family, you won't see them!"
bad,"Long hour days, hard work, fast pace, takes a toll on your body, no incentives, lousy pay, and way to much favoritism, and I think it's very unprofessional that people are allowed to fratinise and date when they work together"
bad,"Constantly changed the rules and didn't communicate to all shifts. Wrote ee's up without telling them until weeks later."
bad,"Amazon gets the attention of people by their benefit package,the pay is o.k. the young managers they hire straight out of college has NO PEOPLE Skills.there were hard dedicated committed people there but a lot of us left, because of how they/we were treated."
bad,Forced to work long hours even when there isn't work to do. They don't care about you being sick you are still expected to work.They also give a few hours of paid time off which is good. Forced to work 55 hour work weeks.
bad,"Without a doubt in my mind one of the worst jobs that I have ever had. A bunch of recent college graduates ran management and thought they ruled the entire facility. I have honestly never met a more idiotic group of people in my entire life. Not gonna lie yes you do start off with some PTO & UPT benifets but that’s about it. I would honestly not even wish that job onto my worst enemy. Every manager there treated every other employee like trash but I suppose that’s what happens when a bunch of immature recent graduates run a facility. No respect, no morals, and absolutely no class whatsoever."
bad,Stress full day and lack of management skills the hardest part is working hard for a little bit of pay and only ting is that the co-work are nice that's all
bad,"Structured to make each individual feel like a cog in a massive machine, no interaction, very boring, no cell phones allowed so you could not listen to music or anything, metal detectors made you feel like you were in a government facility"
bad,"I was hired as a full time immediate hire for Amazon. At first the job seemed pretty straightforward and simple but that quickly turned out to not be the case. As a stower you're expected to scan or ""stock"" a certain amount of items without errors. Supposedly they lower the rate once the holidays start, if they did, it certainly didn't seem like it. The managers weren't the best at communicating with each other and some of them you could tell had no idea what they were doing. So everyday you come in and work yourself down to the bone for managers who have barely been there longer than you have ( I was there for 2 months, my manager was there for 3) to reach their unrealistic expectations. And once they no longer need all of the people they've hired, they start raising rates so they have a valid reason to fire people. Sure benefits on Day 1 seems nice, but it won't make up for the lackluster management and fickle HR department."
bad,"Mi experiencia en esta empresa ha sido nefasta, primero una wntrevista con manpower o Adecco,en la que te dicen de todo menos la verdad, primero que vas a rotar de turno, luego que los días de libranza tambien seran rotativos , que es un empleo estable, que allí no eres un numero mas si no un asociado, al que luego resultan despedir sin argumentos, en tandas de 20 en 20 y como a puñeteros borregos...etc etc "
bad,"Level means everything"
bad,Amazon is always looking to cut people. It's part of their obsession with metrics. No one trusts anyone. Management is incompetent and too busy to help you even if they had the desire. Overtime is called last minute (almost always the day before).
bad,"It's low wages, factory work. You are a number. Worst job I've ever had. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless sheer desperation was your case for employment. I have never met anyone who liked working for Amazon.  I hope I never have to do it again."
bad,"Horrible place to work. Lowest pay in my area for a warehouse associate. One of most valuable companies to date and they cant pay their employees a livable wage. Also the equipment they use breaks down constantly leaving you stranded in an aisle elevated for at least 45 minutes before help arrives. benefits are decent, but moat of what you'll read on a job posting from Amazon is a lie. management is 97% fresh out of college with little to no experience but the pay gap between management and Associate is staggering."
bad,"short breaks. poor management. all under one title unless your some form of management, which makes you disposable and leaves no real structure to your day to day tasks"
bad,"Working at Amazon is a great way to stay fit with all the running around they make you do for 10 hours a day. Don't expect to have a life because you will be forced to work mandatory overtime all the time. Then on top of that you are disposable and constantly reminded of that by your managers on an hourly, day to day basis."
bad,"management does not care about employees, a lot of gossip, uncomfortable work environment, management cherry picks, safety regulations are not safe at all, really needs to be inspected. myself, along with many new hires did not get trained properly. there is no consistency what so ever, no sense of direction, VERY unprofessional, we were told we are all replaceable."
bad,It was fun in the beginning but towards the end everything was the same everyday. I needed something more to keep me excited about coming into work everyday and now they really don't have work
bad,"-I worked Oct-Dec, the worst workplace I ever worked in. Workers are treated like slaves who can’t make any human errors. "
bad,The warehouse is huge and when you are a picker you are assigned to what they call a mod (warehouse) almost have to run to pick the items to make rate
bad,"Long hours"
bad,"Fast paced, demanded rate is insane.  Pay does not compensate for the previous statement.   They claim that we get a bonus every month if our FC does a certain amount of productivity.   I have only received that bonus once, in the years I've been there.   Very Very Tough environment to thrive in."
bad,"amazon does not care about its employees despite what the public thinks. its ran like a prison and management wouldn't allow us to talk if it were legal. they hire management right out of college which leads to little to no people skills for the most part. the upper management has no active role in the every day work life of its employees. the lunch should definitely be a hour long seeing as how we work a 10.5 hour shift. instead, 30 minutes is the accepted norm. without the vast amount of employees that amazon hires, the head honcho wouldn't be where he is today. I hardly ever feel appreciated at work. I would NEVER recommend this job to a friend. I would never recommend it to an enemy either. the turnover rate at amazon is astronomical and for good reason!!! the only reason amazon gets one star is because they have great benefits! that's it and that's all!!"
bad,"Texas employees paid $3.00 less an hour than all other amazon locations. Starting pay $15/hr in Texas $10.55-12/hr. At times they give less than 24hrs notice for mandatory overtime. Benefits are the best thing about the job, tho you have benefits you can barely afford to bill your bills!"
bad,"There wasn't a consistent day at wok. One day your being told by the supervisors the day of one thing, and by next week that could all change again. There is a extreme bias there. They fail to mention the entire contract you sign when you get hired, so I HIGHLY recommend checking that before agreeing to sign."
bad,"I worked for DCS recruitments for a short time. The amount of drops you are expected to do is ridiculous, I was on the road for nearly 12 hours a day attempting to deliver customers parcels. There isn't really time to get a break either so you're working this many hours without a break. The managers weren't much help either and your lists were often not ready when your wave was supposed to go out. There was also several problems with the handheld device as mine kept turning off and on again during the day. Had to hire a van for £200 a week and the van I hired was low on fuel so had to fill up before I could even start."
bad,"Unfortunately, Amazon takes a very Darwinian approach to staff retention, doing everything they can to make life as hard as possible; targets are down to the second and are monitored electronically, breaks are short, discipline is harsh, shifts are long and you are expected to perform 110% at any given point. "
bad,poor communication amongst employees.  lack of follow through and communication about what was going on.  Lots of bickering amongst management.  zero leadership about functions for day and/or week.
bad,"As a seasonal sortation associate, a typical day was frustrating. You would start in one place, but by the time you ended up sorting half of the boxes on one line, management would place you on another line. Management would not care if you were the only one on your line with plenty of packages to sort. They would only look the other way and hope you would get through the packages before the line stopped. Management would not answer any questions. Three quarters of your fellow associates would just walk around doing nothing. To get someone to help you, you had to ask at least 3 managers and then find someone to help yourself. Most associates would go where they pleased rather than where they were assigned to making the entire process of sorting packages very difficult. I would not return under any circumstance."
bad,"Working in a sortation center is way diferent than in a fulfillment center where I have worked before, it almost feels like a diferent company; first, some of the PAs really don’t care about properly train associates in new assignments which is a big no no given you can get seriously injured by heavy machinery and moving objects all around, second, about 70% of the work force are seasonal employees, including people from the learning department which creates a lot chaos and mixed information, third, communication is a struggle Specially when you are in a new assignment and barely knows what to do or need more tools, very often you find yourself wandering the warehouse looking for help."
bad,"They have no consideration for  age"
bad,"Will fire you when the job lands you in the hospital. They will refuse to pay you for the time you worked too, and swear up and down you were never there even though you have copies of paperwork you signed there that day. HR is an absolute joke. You are overworked long hours for a ""meh"" paycheck.   Not worth your health or the headache.  Plenty of jobs out there that pay more at starting level, and value you as a worker."
bad,I would not recommend this job except to my worst enemies or people who need a surprisingly good paying job with good benefits for a monotonous and overall poor work experience.
bad,Typical day at Amazon is nobody really knowing what they are doing while trying to lead other associates. I did learn a lot from a few people who actually came from another facility. Management is the worst and so is HR you have the rare few managers who actually care and others don't want to hear anything and they do not care. Hardest part is peak hours and fast paced picking..
bad,"sometimes you show up to work and are told to go home because there is no work. sometimes you are required to work over your shift because there is too much work. there is little communication between you and tour supervisor and when you do try to talk to one, often you are spoken to like a child."
bad,"Rampant sexism, racism, and favoritism. "
bad,Inexperienced staff are given supervisory responsiblity and are ill-equipped and insensitive. Management treats all staff as robots. Staff turnover is breath-taking.
bad,They have a bad system.They dont care too much about their employees.They will work you like your in a plantation.The breaks are really short.They are always looking for new ways to write up people on productivity or even when you take a bathroom break or as they like to call it time off task.Amazon is a by far the worst place you could ever work.The only positive thing that I can say about amazon is the provide a shuttle bus to people who are not driving.
bad,You go as fast and as hard as you can and it's never good enough! It's ridiculous! I didn't even know who my manager was until I looked it up on the computer at home. When you speak with a manager they act like you are bothering them.
bad,"Overall, there is a lot Amazon needs to do in order to change the ""culture"" in which they have established in many of their buildings. The name AMAZON has a reputation separate from what the actual warehouse environment carries."
bad,"This job is better suited for young, hard driven, first job seeker folks. Older adults will find the policies belittling and nearly impossible to reach. Not for the faint of heart."
bad,"I hated working here, the agency was very unhelpful and the Amazon management staff were very rude. The co workers were very nasty and judgmental which made it very uncomfortable. I was harassed on a daily basis and often felt isolated. While I was there I got a call from the vet, my dog was dying and they didn't even let me go to comfort him on his death bed. I think this is a horrible place to work and the way they treat people is unbelievable, I absolutely do not recommend this company."
bad,"paga notturna maggiorata solo del 15%,pausa che diventa di venti minuti effettiva,ragazze belle e straniere che solo sapendo fare un processo avanzano miracolosamente di carriera..................un intero reparto concepito per castigo per non abbassare la produzione dei manager,regole assurde!l'unico modo per sopravvivere tre mesi è fregarsene di queste regole e andare al propio passo sapendo comunque che a fine contratto si viene scaricati,tolte le loro raccomandazioni su produttività il lavoro è uguale a qualsiasi altro ! unico lato positivo :la azienda è ai vertici per quanto riguarda la sicurezza sul lavoro e fornisce sempre i dpi necessari,inoltre c'è un distributore automatico che da giubbetti,taglierini,porta badge,guanti"
bad,All about numbers. Care about the customer and care less about employees.  Management is a joke. They don’t want you to advance. The rules change daily and are always made at the upper management level from people who sit at desks.  Stay away!
bad,"Did not work with me on hours and I had tried all options, went numerous times to the supervisor for help and never received anything AT ALL! They do compensate their employees well with paid time off."
bad,"A needlessly stressful, cutthroat environment. People are considered a means to an end. 10-hour shifts. Sitting not allowed. The role of management is to simply tell people to work faster."
bad,not worth it long hours that suck and hourly cap is very low. All about numbers and no care about employee health and well being. Iwould never work there sgsin
bad,"Your put in a cut-throat environment without adequate supervision with overtly high expectations working on you feet for  10.5 hours daily with minimal break. Effectively, you are deprived of  a break when you travel 7 minutes to and 7 minutes from the break roomfor a 15-min break. Same obtains for the 30 minute lunch break."
bad,"The more hours you worked the more they would pick apart your ability and performance.  They begged for you to give them overtime, but if you did volunteer to give more of yourself and submit the extra, you would tend to get criticised more for errors you would not have made had you not been working a 14-hour shift."
bad,"Horrible place to work, management only driven for you to reach target, they seem they don't care about anything else. Only day 2 of working at Amazon and only one-half a day of training I had staff and management coming up to my station saying I haven't reached targets or was making mistakes even though it was day 2 of starting. I felt like wasn't good enough for them. Would only recommend working here if you don't mind factory work, long hours and are driven to targets. Otherwise, don't bother it not worth it."
bad,"be on your ps & qs, noone is your friend. Management is ready to fire you at any moment. Everyone has a highschool mentality and i HATE THAT PLACE. SLAVESHIP MENTALITY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,Its a shame how a CEO as wealthy as this one who owns Amazon would have a sweat shop type of fullfiment center that I work in. The employees are worked to the minute.  The workshift are constantly changing.  With increasingly high volume of work but only pay minimum wages even after you're been there for 6mos no raise. Some of the people they hire are very unprofessional lots of cursing and vulgar speech. Some are confrontational and I fear for my safety working there. I am currently looking for new employment.
bad,"Managers are unqualified, condescending, have terrible communication skills and no concept of the work we do, as they have never done it themselves. Employees are forced to work in extreme heat in the summer at an incredibly fast pace. Training is mostly non existent; you will have to be self motivated to learn how to properly do things. Hard work will get you nowhere, as promotions are based solely on favortism. No full time shifts for anyone except management, so the chances of having a respectable career here are slim to none. Turnover is incredibly high, as well. I would recommend passing on working here as it will sour your opinion of the company as a whole."
bad,"they want people to scan like 300 packages per hour, its difficult considering you also have to put the packages on the palette aswell. They don't adjust that number towards your age, as they should for older people working there. be prepared to break a few sweats ...seriously."
bad,You do the same thing everyday no matter how long you have been there and the rate of work expectation is unreal given there are many things out of your control that can get you fired.
bad,working for amazon is a job but not steady work.The pay is not consistent.its ok for a summer job but not more than that. Amazon is playing with the checks.some hrs be missing
bad,"stay part time, good luck on advancing. Very boring job. You literally do the same thing everyday, you start to feel like a robot. I could not imagine doing that for a full 8 hours."
bad,"Amazon Has great pay but that is about all the have. Once you start to get hire up in the company the worse they treat you. If you are going to work for Amazon just do not!"
bad,"The amount of work you have to do is a lot which is expected for a warehouse, but the speeds and rates at which you're expected to work are not worth how much you get paid. As well, the flexible schedule they require means you'll basically never know if you're going to have overtime until lunch of the previous day which ruins your ability to plan anything for your days off. As well, you'll behaving overtime more often than not which can stack up to 6 day work weeks continuously."
bad,"It's a place to learn but not a place to stay."
bad,"Working for Amazon has been a bane to say the least, it has left me physically and mentally in pain. The job has me on my feet for 10 hours at the start (which they promised us), however after I was hired they went into 11 hour days ""till the further notice"". It has killed my social life since I can't see friends anymore seeing as they keep having me work a 5th day. After working 55 hour weeks in extreme heat for over a month now its been a pain to wanna recommend this company to anyone unless they are in dire need of a temporary job."
bad,"During the holiday season it's mandatory overtime for over a month, unrealistic standards and goals. I never took unscheduled bathroom breaks and worked continuously and only made rate once or twice. People who make rate are shoving things and cutting corners. All they do is make other people's jobs harder who have to come behind them."
bad,"Management at Amazon warehouse facilities is non-existent between associate and manager.  All written documentation for performance coaching is done digitally and often NOT passed on to associates when entered.  Work hours are long with few breaks to allow associates time to recharge, then mandatory overtime keeps associates at work virtually non-stop for months on end despite a lack of work involved.  "
bad,"Things change everyday. One person will tell u to do things one way,then someone else will yell at you,and tell u to do it their way. Nobody really knows what is going on."
bad,"The pay was great but the management and work environment was horrible.  They expected you to work 70 hour weeks and when you injured yourself because of their horrible work conditions/expectations, you got written up for it.  Never again."
bad,get to work on overtime access everything find out what job position i will be station to work make sure i have all my safety equipment ready on my person to start work
bad,the managers spend to much time on there cell phones and they pick people that they want to like and dis like they all play favoritism i used to think it was a great place to work at till i started to hear the stories from the other employees and to see it its not worth being judged
bad,Amazon is a great company if your management. The lower end employees are treated unfairly and are given the knowledge that they can be replaced at a moments noticed. Amazon only cares about the rate of which their employees perform despite any physical limitations.
bad,"Very long hours standing. You get to sit down for your 30 min break, but that is it. Very repetitious and robotic movements for the whole 12 hours. They hire a lot of people because it is a continuous revolving door. It is very rare to find anyone who has worked with Amazon longer than 2 years and there is a very good reason. Your home life is practically nonexistent because they require so much mandatory overtime. Pay is super low in comparison to other  facilities around here."
bad,"Learned the ins and outs of scanning product, for the most part did the same thing everyday. Relaxed environment with low overtime possibility, good for part time job."
bad,"$12 an hour if you work nights. $11.50 for day shift. (Unless they're changed it.) Probably one of the worst places to work. Ever. And definitely the worst place I've ever worked. No one is happy here. Transferring to days if you're stuck on nights is impossible. HR plays favorites and twist the rules to make sure day shifts go to the people they want to work days. Management is idiotic. The ""Safety Team"" spends their days making everyone else's job a nightmare. Will (proudly) fire any employee for the most outrageous reasons because of ""safety"" concerns, and good luck appealing your termination. They will have already hired someone to replace you."
bad,You are schedule 10 hour shifts with mandatory overtime every week that they tell you about the day before. Dont waste your time. You feel like a robot. Managers are rude.
bad,"Working there is torture for the mind and body. The management is incompetent. You walk at least 10 miles a day and are constantly lifting heavy objects. This will wreak havoc on your body. It is loud, dirty, and dusty. HR is only there to protect the company, not the people. They constantly make mistakes with your time and hours. They will throw overtime on you last minute. They violate their own company policy about overtime with technical loopholes. Working there will absolutely make you go crazy because you can't really talk to anybody, there's no music, and you can't keep your phone with you on the floor."
bad,"Working at Amazon I found it to be the worst type of work there ever could be. The atmosphere was always dull and gloomy, hardly anyone would ever communicate with each other due to language barriers. Management didn't care much about proper staff since they were agencies, they would only offer advancements to people they knew"
bad,"The culture varies organization by organization. Generally it is expected to ""work hard"", maybe at least 50 hours a week (just work hard, even if what you do does not sound right to you). In my experience, I did not have any option to apply my ideas. Things were dictated to me by my manager in a very detailed manner. New ideas were ignored (not even criticized). Same with my career promotion process, in which I did not have any input."
bad,"Amazon is the most toxic organization I have ever worked at. The systematically work to tear people down so they can rebuild them as the people they want. As a result they have extremely high turnover and significant leadership churn,"
bad,The have unrealistic expectations for their employees - especially when they want to replace a full time employee with a temporary employee who will not receive benefits.
bad,I would not suggest this as a good place to work for any American citizen.  The workplace culture is juvenile and emphasis is not placed on employee knowledge but rather on management's quotas.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up with ever changing management employees.  The most enjoyable part of working for Amazon was the day I was layed off even though I did my best to offer a great experience for the customer who needed help.
bad,"This place works you like slaves and expects you to move like a robot. Overtime your body starts to wear down and you might develop physical problems. If you get hurt all they would do is sit you down for a few then expect you to go right back to work, if its bad enough they'll send you home but you will have to use your unpayed time or personal time.  The management team doesn't care about their employees all they care about are numbers. They will randomly call for mandatory overtime and not care if you have other obligations, and if you don't come in they will take it out of your personal time. The breaks are short as ever and you have to be there for 11 and a half hrs. Worse place I ever worked!!!!"
bad,"Good job for someone who cannot get a job elsewhere. I am happy about health insurance. Management has much to be desired. When you park and walk up to the doors to enter the building you can feel the life being sucked out of your body, after entering the building you are fully zombified."
bad,"En Amazon, da igual lo que trabajes, mucho o poco, todo lo que ellos valoran es lo que de manera hipocrita llaman la Actitud, la cual se reduce a caerle bien a el de el chalequito azul de turno. Para ser mas objetivos, si eres una niña bonita de bella sonrisa, o un pelota chivato y desleal, los lid y manager, de manera totalmente vergonzosa y descarada, te ayudan a conseguir buenos numeros en cuanto a productividad, en un ejercicio favoritista a la vista de todos realmente insultante. Claro esta, oir, ver y callar, no te atrevas a denunciarlo, pues los lid y manager intentaran callarte con argumentos tales como ""tienes que apretar mas"" o ""todos teneis la misma oportunidad de cara a producir"", y por descontado, ya que les has dicho lo que hay, al Domingo siguiente cuenta con que los de Adecco te diran que no estas renovado. Este ambiente agonico, de favoritismo hacia algunos, con productividad alta por ser ayudados, y productividad baja por los que son ignorados, que por mucho que trabajes ves que no llegas, crea una competencia desleal entre compañeros, a la vez que accidentes laborales, los cuales se producen a pesar de la rigurosa politica en cuanto a seguridad en el trabajo tienen. Despues de 7 meses, no me han renovado, ""por falta de actitud"", y la verdad es que me alegro¡¡ un ciclo de trabajo para olvidar."
bad,"do not recommend anybody to this job. amazon is a slave job. management sucks, every 6 month pay raise is fine, oppurtunities to climb the ladder is always available."
bad,"Amazon is an okay ish place to work for if you can handle repetitiveness empty promises and long working hours."
bad,"I do not want to return to Amazon, targeting manager and it is not a peaceful workplace to work. There is employee benefits but when a employee is not happy working in a place, what is the use of benefits."
bad,"been here 19 months."
bad,"lavoro molto monotono retribuito bene,ma fattibile solo senza vita privata."
bad,"The managers shout at you, give impossible deadlines, end up having meetings over the weekends, national holidays, late in the nights or early in the mornings, doesn't allow you to work on your own and you are always benchmarking against other locales. hr is a dummy, doesn't support you. not a conducive environment to work in."
bad,"The job as a picker is easy enough, but working there is horrible. The social environment sort of felt like going back to high school, from management down to packer there wasn't much maturity and felt like a cliquish unwelcoming environment. It's tolerable to work as a temp but working there permanently must be stressful based on my experience. I wouldn't recommend it except as a temporary means to supplement income."
bad,"Amazon is the most difficult work from home job I've ever had. The shifts are long, and there is little flexibility until after peak season. Once you feel as though the job is getting easier, metrics take over and make it even more difficult to handle. Amazon is ALL about metrics. Their standards seem almost impossible to meet."
bad,Managers have no clue what theyre doin majority have never even been in a warehouse unreasonable production goals for 12 dollars a hour i dont normally see people last longer than 5-7 weeks i personally have been here for 6 months and unfortunatley will have to stick it out another 5 until my schooling is over much much better options out there than amazon
bad,"One of the worst places I have worked. They want you to make ridiculous rates and if you can't you are gone. When I first started it was only 600 units an hour and then it became 1,200 for the same time. Just a horrible place to work."
bad,No room for growth.  Management is weak because they do not make decisions.  Management asks associates for feedback and disregards there opinions on the process.
bad,"Amazon will work you into the ground. You get few breaks and the management will constantly harrass you. They DO NOT care about their employees and will offer you money to leave the company. Except for the benefits, there is nothing good about working for Amazon."
bad,A typical day at work is very long with your break time always seeming too short.  I have learned that amazon is a great company for a consumer but not so much as an employer.  Our management really pushed time lines which is fine but definitely favored certain employees more than others.  Overall it was a hard place to wake up and go to work because no one really seemed to be happy to be there whether they were a manager or non manager position.
bad,"I cannot recommend Amazon, in particular Amazon Go, for employment. Amazon uses hidden agendas and masks their intentions using ""corporate secrecy"". I was approached by Amazon with promises that quickly were realized as mis-truths. You will find them extremely arrogant in their self-image. This leads to high turn-over. You may act on good faith but do not expect Amazon too."
bad,"True enough pay is good, however they try to milk out every single dime paid through very unrealistic targets. Pickers suffer it the most. Really long hours per shift and one can be sacked for being off sick. The only good thing at work is the really lovely co worker's (not the management). The agency managers only care about people hitting targets nothing more."
bad,"Terrible management, unreachable and unrealistic expectations and targets that you must hit or you get points which means you get terminated, without any warning."
bad,"I am doing 13 hour per day! Coming in after along days work back into the warehouse to be told that i am doing it to much by the book and need to take shortcuts. Also being sent home after being told to come in saying there is not enough routes available giving me the bill of £180 pound to pay for a van."
bad,"There is nothing good about working here."
bad,"Does not hire many employees that are focused on the importance of the process"
bad,"Rating system is very poor."
bad,"Everything about this place reminds of prison, from the orange vest they make you wear, to the safety line you have to walk in, to the constantly working on your feet. Your not being paid to think just work. Supervisors always on your back, similar to a Corrections Officer. Your hard work gets unnoticed so don't try and give 110%, try 65% instead. Work is extremely easy but boring. It's hard to get fired, you pretty much fire yourself by constantly being late or not showing up for work"
bad,Long hours short breaks no life if your on night shift can send you home if it's quiet even if you have no way of getting home till public transport starts. they just don't care
bad,"Don't treat British people nice , rude,nasty attitude have no respect when it comes to their employees where I suffered from anxiety and it isn't a nice place to work where they were pressuring people to keep to speed with targets and productivity which is a form of bullying and punishing the sick people too money too bad"
bad,Bad experience overall. Its all about the management and making themselves look good overall. Employees dont matter.
bad,Working for Amazon is a stressful job if you cannot keep up with their rates then you are terminated in the middle of the night I was on disability and was terminated at almost the end of my shift I worked from 6:30 to 5 I was terminated at 3 o'clock in the morning for not making rate
bad,"I worked for Amazon for almost a year and really did the best job I could do. However, I was forced to resign or be fired due to their strict ""rate"" guidelines. This company micro manages you on EVERY thing you do down to the minute. It drives you crazy! They have a super high turnover. It is really a glorified sweat shop. I HATED working at Amazon. You have people that dont do hardly anything all day and get promoted. Others who work hard get fired. Managment constantly comes and goes. You are just another number to them. All Amazon cares about is money, not people. They grind you down mentally and physically. Make it next to impossible to survive long term with them. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
bad,"Okay as a temp job. No room for advancement. Managers and PA just sits around. Sending people home early and then, flexing for one hour. always understaffed"
bad,"Good to start, but drags on. If you don't need it avoid it. Read the anti Amazon websites for the truth.  Just a sample, 99% is a failure in their eyes."
bad,"The company offers great benefits, but the management doesn't allow you to grow. Favoritism is definitely a thing that takes place at the facilities."
bad,il n'y a pas de pause c'est de l'esclavage mais sauf que l'on est payé à faire cela demandez à  qui vous voulez les pauses ne sont pas de réelles pauses.
bad,"You will walk ten miles during each ten-hour shift.  If you are injured on the job, or have an illness, you are instructed to return to the floor to work for the rest of your shift.  The warehouse is very hot and has concrete floors. Amazon does not care about employees, but they say they do."
bad,"This place was very difficult to work at. There was no organization management. The management team didn't know who was working for them. The benefits were good, but they treated employees like children."
bad,"As a recruitment coordinator, you just spend time time organising managers'agendas."
bad,"Une entreprise qui performe, au détriment d'une culture d'entreprise agréable"
bad,"It is a very busy, stressful job on an every day bases with long hours and must be very flexible with work life balance and working hours"
bad,"Do not hire on Amazon like a multidrop driver It will be a nightmare , why ? A loot of parcels to deliver per day , they don't care about the driver only to stay on the route 10-12 hours ..."
bad,"I wasn't able to work a constant schedule, the work there was hard at time when you could do it. not a good permanent job to have"
bad,Its a good place to work if you are in operations and looking for some corporate experience. This employer has a high amount of politics and bureaucracy within its organizational culture. It is set up similarly to GE and can be archaic.
bad,"I started during peak and they had music playing and had all kinds of prizes for us to try to win. Now that that's over they are very strict and are always adding to the list of thing we need to do and complaining that we are not doing something. They make it really hard to advance, I have a degree and I was supposed to be able to apply for a promotion but the slots got filled before I learned how to apply. Information does not get circulated in an effective way. They have stand ups at the beginning and middle of shift but if you are right on time you will miss stand up and some possibly important information."
bad,"Truly the worst place I can imagine working. I had to wear shorts and tee shirts all winter because for some unknown reason they had the heat blasting. The second and third floors were nauseatingly hot. The building manager just told everyone to wear layers because it is colder outside."
bad,"This place is nothing more then a dating service for the young kids they bring in. I have never seen so much childish drama in my life. They don't care who they bring it because at the end of the day we are all slaves. They treat there employees like they are nothing, the hr. department is full of caddy women who think they are on a high horse so they treat everyone like nothing. This place is just a big Amistad slave ship. You have to ask to go to the bathroom or you will get written up, you don't get your full breaks which is against the law! We don't have a union and if we even think about trying to get one they will fire you. They don't want to pay you when you go on leave do to an injure at there company. They ill find ever way to not pay you. All in all the money is ok if your a single parent like myself, but the treatment is truly poor. you guys have seen the news about amazon being unfair for workers....ITS TRUE"
bad,"I worked seasonal for this job for 3 months(Oct.-Dec.) to make some extra cash. First off the half train you. Everything is about numbers and how fast you can go. Im telling you now, if you think for a second that this job is easy then dont bother coming here. They will work you to death! The position i was doing was called ""Stowe"". They put you on one side of the warehouse and give you a U-Boat and it has 9 bins, and you have to put whatever products in them on a shelf. Sounds easy? No! You have to walk up and down ailes to find open spots to put each and ever item in the bin in. One bin may be full of salt shakers, little toy soilders and lets just say, playing cards. Ever item has a certain section it has to be in. For instance, little stuff like batteries and books cant be together. You have to put things that are the same size together. Some people walk about for hours trying to find a spot to put their items.  You get graded, i think weekly on your performance. Even though you may be seasonal you get treated like a real worker which means you can get fired. If you are slow putting up items a manager will come find you and write you up. You use a gun to scan items and put them up. After you get three write ups, they fire you. After thanksgiving you go into blackout season. Nobody can request a day off. I would come home and sleep for 10hours. On my day off. My advice is if you're going to work here, only come there as a part time associate. I hope this was somewhat helpful."
bad,I hated going to work everyday busting my hump just to know that i did not have a chance in the world for advancement in my position and its hard knowing that a company you are working to the bone for does not value you as an associate.
bad,"Management do not care about how your feeling, if your ill or over tired. "
bad,"Everyday started with a meeting in which the same thing you heard on the first day is repeated every day you work that week, but none of the actual changes were discussed. You weren't treated as an actual person, you were a number that had other numbers tied to. All red tape and politics, with a very visible glass ceiling for all hourly employees."
bad,"started good but didnt work out in the end too many rule changes and expecting you to do mirricles on a day to day basis "
bad,"Amazon could be a great company to work for if you don't get injured,  take away the unprofessionalism, Some people are too focused on playing around with each other instead of working, Miscommunication among management."
bad,"average working envrionment, no job security. No valuable experienced gained whatsoever. very long hours. only take this job as a last resort"
bad,TO many high Standards impossible requirements and no permanent breaks they use you only to ketch up on there back orders then when there cought up they get rid of you.
bad,"It was a job, that is just what it was. This is not a career based placed. I did not feel as though I had a chance for advancement. I was hired to work the peak season , so maybe they were not looking for people among the thousands they hired to be permanent. I felt that they let go of some very promising applicant and kept those that were not."
bad,"long hours, to much parcel, if u thinking to work for Amazon delivery driver fine but by agency f..k it don't even think about it"
bad,"not a pleasant work environment, very stressful with little management support, managers are quick to blame associates for there short comings."
bad,"it was a normal working day . never learned very much working under amazon . management were not very good . my co-workers were ok . hardest part of job was needing get items under there time ,the most enjoyable part of job was on way home"
bad,Days are long. There not a lot of good I can say about this place everybody here hates it and everybody is looking for a new job.
bad,"Currently work at amazon....worst experience ever, they promised opportunities for advancement but it's a lie, all the associates are miserable,  written up if you forget your phone in your pocket, no one can hit rate because there's no room yo stow items, managers show too much favoritism (protect there friends from write ups). I needed to transfer facilities because of childcare issues and been denied twice for no reason.... close to being fired for missing work or coming late due to childcare yet they refuse to let me transfer to another shift/facility. I left my last job for ""better opportunities"", biggest mistake in my life, they'll sugarcoat everything and it'll sound awesome but STAY AWAY!!! Hopefully I can get transfer before I run out of hours and get fired!!!"
bad,So busy noone will take the time to show you anything because they are on rate too.
bad,"Very little training and harsh learning curve, especially for new starting employees."
bad,"All they care about is how fast you work."
bad,The hours are long and hard at Amazon especially during Peak season where an area manager can be required to work anywhere from 12 to 16 hrs a day 6 days a week.  The associates are treated much better than the managers are and the operations managers do not take the time to develop their managers for the next level up but pile on more of their work on the area managers while taking the credit for work done.  While the leadership principles are good in thought they don't apply nor live by them.  Maybe the company would be able to retain their managers if they didn't work them so hard or had a clue how they are treated by their site leaders/operations managers.  The compensation is good and if your able to stick it out for 2 years to obtain your sign on bonus then the 2 years may be worth it.
bad,"Overworked,"
bad,"A rush is the only way to explain a typical day.  I learnt i'm target driven, quite fit and that gel inner soles are fantastic.  I dont know about the ""upstairs"" management but the guys we had running our department where the nicest guys, that being the managers on ""non con"" I met some interesting people, from published authors, female Engineers to artists.  The hardest part of the job, was getting used to working nights and putting up with co-workers who were lazy in doing what was necessary for all to get the job done.  There wasn't really any enjoyable part of the job except to see the friendly faces of co-workers"
bad,"If you need money and don't plan on living (both socially and in terms of life expectancy) then this is a place for you. You work hard, work long, and work consistently. That is, until you become less cost efficient than the constantly cycling brigade of temp workers. You'll hurt, feel neglected, feel used, and quickly lose a sense of identity. If you like struggling and feeling absolutely helpless, apply now; the turnover rates is so remarkable that they can find a spot for you, no problem!"
bad,"Everyday clock in, go to stand up and look at the board to see where you are. Stand up last about 10 mins with stretches. The AM puts their favorites on the easy jobs. they cut breaks short and pop mandatory overtime up on you. they only care about numbers. they make you work holidays. pay tops out in 2 yrs. dead end job. no advancement."
bad,I learned how to be a indepedent worker to go in do my job and always look for a better oppurtunity
bad,"Amazon on the surface would seem like a great company to work for. But the facility I worked in was like a third world sweat shop. 10 hour days in extreme conditions, (dirt, dust, areas over 112 degrees in summer, freezing in winter). Mangement constantly held production numbers over your head, threatening and distributing write ups followed by termination. They treated their employees like commodities."
bad,"Amazons work conditions were poor, working 8 hours, some overtime, with one half hour break in that time, management were arrogant and agency staff were disrespectful, angency was Randstad Recruitment"
bad,"hard work on an typical,you can learn each day and i'am here at amazon untile i can get back to driving truck"
bad,E stata all'inizio bella come esperienza ma poi o capito che ti usano e basta non ti facevano mai riposare non lo consiglio a nessuno
bad,"I reported to no less than 6 managers in my division and none of them could make a decision without the input of every other manager and their boss(es). Nothing was ever resolved and god help you if you made a mistake, because they expect you to 100% personally own the mistake, despite the plan being signed off on by 6 managers and multiple higher-ups along the way. There is no work-life balance. There is no one to speak with if you are paid incorrectly or your benefits are messed up because the benefits are farmed out to 3rd party call centers. The turn-over is astronomical."
bad,This is a company that's worth BILLIONS of dollars that has centers with antiquated tech that they expect associates to hit they're production quota..
bad,"Nie polecam tej firmy. Totalny mobing, nietaktowne traktowanie pracowników. Nieadekwatne wynagrodzenie do tak ciężkiej pracy. Jeśli nie jesteś silny fizycznie, nie masz mocnych nerwów nigdy tu nie przychodz. Nie licz na stałe zatrudnienie. Polityka firmy zakłada przemielic 17000 pracowników. Nawet jak będziesz dobry w tym co będziesz robił kopną Cię w tyłek."
bad,"They treat people as slaves, they only need a whip."
bad,Only good thing is pay and benefits  the management are very rude no help and makes it obvious they care nothing about the workers under them. if you need money work there and for benefits but the respect is not there.
bad,Amazon's only quality is the benefits and full time hours if you get a full time position.  They very much underpay and overwork.  Extremely judgmental if you don't have a Bachelors degree.  Literally... it was an all around mental nightmare.
bad,"Amazon is a decent job to pay the bills. That's it. You will be worked and worked hard, mind you, to get that paycheck when it's the busy season. Management is cliquish and self adsorbed. They either have no supplies available or don't know where they are. There is a lot of delegation but not enough teamwork. There's favoritism and many underhanded attempts to get rid of employees once the busy period has passed. Breaks begin while you're on the work floor and ends when you're back and working. So in reality a 15 minute break really means 7 to 5 minutes of actually sitting down. You also cannot bring your phone into the break rooms (unless its the northside). HR can be helpful at times but most of the time many employees find them not only unhelpful but also unwelcoming."
bad,There's so much I would love to say but I'm going to keep it to myself and let others decide how it is on their own. Been working with them for 5 years.
bad,We had good benefits the pay was ok but I think that they worked us hard talk all the time about safety however the work load and rate made it hard to meet safety needs but there benefits package was most rewarding
bad,"most stressful job with  managers who don’t care about you only worries about parcels, mileage paid 0,18 pence wich it’s not enough for what you spend per round.When is pick time recruiting many drivers and after kicks them off. 150 stops with 200 parcels and more. Many times route are planning really bad, you need to reattempt stops if not delivered and is not paid."
bad,"Some Management care, but Higher level Management don't."
bad,Management is very bad and rude. Hr and manager lie to empolyee. No support. The only ones that get recognized  are the the lazy ones.If you report something bad you get in trouble. Ind8
bad,Alot of pressure to hit rates per hour than the job safety. Fast paste very on going steady work sometimes slow great benefits but job challenges you .
bad,Worst place to be employed.Not worth your time money or pay.Absolutely ridiculous you are nothing more than just a number and you are worked as if you are a dog
bad,"2 years of stress. discrimination. managers are minor narcissistic bullies  Hr is core to all problems . only gain is benefits..reach max at three years of employment  "
bad,"- Very boring with little to no training."
bad,"Low pay rate "
bad,"No communication "
bad,They make you feel like you work in a sweatshop. Very little pay expect you to work 12 hours with 1 break always have management on you to move faster yet they just stand a talk to each other never imagined this company to treat their workers like that!!!!!
bad,"bad management, unsafe work conditions, high turn over rate. extremely hot temperatures, inconsistent work hours, weird shifts. no benefits for part time workers"
bad,"You clock in and start getting busy, if you’re fit enough, they throw you to do more things that are physically demanding. You’re there for at least 10 hours, and they’ll let you go for so many reasons. They will literally remind you everyday if you’re falling short."
bad,I'll start with the good is that you get paid well especially if you only work weekends.That's where it ends. They're constantly on your back with a whip to go faster.I started in one area and they forced me into something else that everyone hates.The area you're in keeps you standing on concrete for 10-13 hours straight.You ask them to move you and you're told only when they train someone which will nevet happen.
bad,I was harrassed by a manager and then suspended when I wrote a complaint. They kept me suspended for almost a month. Poor management skills. They lie to protect themselves from lawsuits. It isnandead end job that pays well. Management will bend rules to protect themselves and throw its employees under the bus.
bad,Overall experience is not worth work ethic. Modern day slavery. Minimum breaks. No company phone to contact personal family. Limited time of days off unless you have the time.
bad,"Even though the rate of pay is excellent for working nights it doesn't outweigh the tiredness and having no life outside work as you are constantly tired, fast paced and very hard work! If you want a life avoid!!!!"
bad,Amazon will work u like a labor mill and spit u out like tommorows thrash. U work long hrs with management telling u to use this bathroom save time wtf.
bad,"I worked at ATL7 in Union City, Georgia.  During my 5 years there I was promoted 3 times.  My work ethic, knowledge base, and relationship with peers and direct reports were always rated highest at the facility.  Unfortunately, the upper management team was garbage.  They bullied, hoarded knowledge, and threw you under the bus daily and because HR was inapt they went unchecked. The place was so toxic, myself and many associates had to arrive early everyday to sit in our cars to pray and/or give ourselves a pep talk to become motivated enough to go in. I was lucky to work with an amazing team (best part of the job was the people) overnight where we were shielded from the mind games most of the time.  We were like a family and I am proud to say at least 12 of my direct reports were promoted to higher positions in house, at other locations, or other companies. I haven't worked for Amazon in 6 months and people still come to me for resume help/ interview prep and are getting promoted.  Personally, I think Amazon is a great company and I still order from them but they have a long way to go when it comes to inclusion, diversity, the benefits of focusing on employee happiness, actually responding to associate complaints instead of sending someone in to focus on what the manager says and nothing changes,"
bad,"Good teach every time to my manager  .."
bad,Working environment is horrible they work  you like a slave .  They want you to be a robot they want you to work work with barely any breaks & when do get a break it’s over & have to get back go work
bad,not allowed to even be idle for few seconds and they dont like you going on toilet breaks. Agency always putting pressure on you and keep chasing you so morale is always low.
bad,"Flexible schedule, decent pay (other warehouses pay more&offer actual benefits), great co-workers- that's as good as it gets. I don't know how managers got their positions because they can't manage a team. It is a mess. If you ever need help or have a question, good luck trying to reach HR. HR is a JOKE. Don't ever accept voluntary time off because they will lie and screw you over and terminate you. They will not admit to their mistakes"
bad,"the benefits are good but thats it. You cant call off when your sick. You have to use your time. And if you use it all your fired. The work is like SLAVE work. It breaks your body down. No music , or windows. Its just like jail. Its HORRIBLE. Including mandatory over time which is fine every now and again but every week. You literally have no life because ur days off are spent sleeping."
bad,"The job isn’t horrible but the labor is pretty rough. 15 minute breaks are not enough time to do anything at all. TOT is easy to get, you can’t even go for a bathroom break without getting TOT."
bad,"If your looking to move up in the company, Amazon is not the place to go unless you like to kiss butt. The work at Amazon is very easy. Management don't care about their workers at all. HR AND MANAGEMENT have their favorites who they will look out for while the other get treated like nothing. HR AND THE MANAGEMENT TEAM WILL ALWAYS COVER UP FOR EACH OTHER. So basically, if you had a problem with a manager and tried to go to HR about it, their going to cover up for the manager and take the manager side."
bad,Stressful work environment. Very long hours without much appreciation from higher management. Typical day during Diwali or any major sales event starts at 7 and last till after midnight.
bad,From what I've experienced from working Amazon. There's always favoritism and you got to make friends at the right places. Like they work you like a dog till you hurt yourself and then send you to people who barely can do anything to help you. Managers aren't really the motivation giving type. All this at mdw2. Sad
bad,"Spent 4 years for this company and enough was enough. They give you a shift bid every three months and claim you get the shift you work hard for to never happen. You’ll work dumb shifts like Wednesday thru Sunday, 11-9. You accrue vacation each week that you never get to use and there’s no leadership what so ever. Lack of training, lack of support all you do is get paid to stress for 8 hours."
bad,No respect after 1.8 years there poor training many mistakes after.All the time new people with poor English and stress on the night shifts transport with no heat in the winter they don’t come on time usually pass early.Maybe wrong site and wrong time for Me just remember the time when I started in 2017 LCY 2 I was so happy and excited
bad,"They kept getting my paperwork wrong, the work conditions are harsh but the pay is great. They have benefits, but I never received mines. It was a terrible experience. Don't knock it til YOU try it though."
bad,"Amazon should be penalized for how they treat their workers. Bathroom breaks are closely monitored and if you exceed 7 minutes for a bathroom break including the time to walk across the entire building and back, you are at risk for termination. Mind you that’s a 10 hour shift where the employee can’t even properly take care of their bodies natural functions. The work was also closely monitored and timed. I lost 50 pounds in less than a month because of how much I was forced to exert my body physically. I also became extremely ill after many of my shifts because of the extreme demands."
bad,"You are watched like hawks for bathroom, talking to others, getting water, and anything that’s not work related. and if you aren’t wearing a vest, opinion doesn’t really matter. They are not detailed about rules and when you break a rule, that’s when you find out what’s allowed and that’s when it’s too late. They will tell you about changes but never in detail. Unless you enjoy being lied to, working alone and not talking, please find somewhere else to happily spend your time"
bad,"As a person of labor working in amazon warehouse factory, you are required a 12 hour shift without any breaks to sit down except for a 30 minute lunch with takes around 10 minutes to walk to the break areas and 10 mins to walk back. Management will write you up for a number of reasons. Even if you are in training. One day I was told I had the shortest time in the floor and then the next minute a new member came up to me and said I have the fastest time of today. But I still received a write up for it. "
bad,Il ne respecte pas la charte de l'entreprise  faire respecter les consignes de sécurité entre salariés
bad,"I applied and got hired I been waiting for a month for this job, forget this job I would never recommend. It is false advertising and expect you to wait to work with them and not work anywhere else 🙎. They Changed my start date 3x then back to the 2nd date just for me to call and confirm and a operator tell me there is no available shifts for that day yet and call in afternoon.I am tired of the empty promise thumbs down to this company I will never recommend this place I will tell people to stay leery."
bad,"People are treated like robots due to the nature of the business."
bad,"Sono stata lasciata a casa  dopo una settimana perchè al manager non andavo bene. Il problema è che il menager non l'ho neanche mai visto, si è presentato a tutto il gruppo tranne che me."
bad,They get you into to get you out. No help. And the other employees to try stress you out to get fired. Not worth it. The pay is really good tho. They have medical and all that. Just dont waste upt time
bad,"I suggest you apply for a company that will treat you with respect, unlike Amazon. The managment does does not care about any of your problems, they will say sorry there is nothing I can do. Right now Amazon is America's largest company and yet they could'nt care less about employees. SHAME ON AMAZON!"
bad,Hired in with a group of 5. 1 from the start avoided work. Management always told us to work faster. If they would of addressed the slackers we would of been ok. Grade school mentality
bad,"The benefits are nice, Personal/Paid time off. Don't hit negatives in your UPT(unpaid time) It was an okay experience, I think morning shift is better."
bad,As an associate you are expendable.. they use you and spit you out.. good pay.. great benefits.. just don't get comfortable.. over worked and under appreciated..
bad,"Amazon Fiume Veneto Cerca lavoratori."
bad,"Management is a joke."
bad,Hard to work here poor expectations of the employees. Long work days not convient location for Wisconsin’s biggest city residence Milwaukee. As it’s all the way in Kenosha.
bad,I was one of the first hired at the new location in North Randall Ohio and we worked 10 hours 4 days a week which was ok until peak season then it was 12 hours 5 days a week and they never complained about numbers until peak was over then at least 10 ppl per day were let go. You never knew when you would be fired. I got wrote up every week saying I was not packing enough  per hour which was impossible
bad,"In the beginning I was excited. I would go above and beyond to deliver all my packages. For the 3 months I did. I even went over my schedule blocks. For instance I had a block from 9am -1pm with 40 packages to deliver. There was no parking nothing but tow away zones. I didn't finish until 5:15pm. Amazon never advised of how to claim my adjusted pay after I worked passed nor did they pay me for any extra tome I woked"
bad,"Terrible working conditions. You are expected to give 100% for 10 hours with nothing but 2 10 minute breaks & a 30min lunch. The only thing alright about this jobs was the pay, but that could’ve been better! The UPT policy is so stupid and causes you to lose your job really for NO reason. I think they should get rid of it ASAP!"
bad,"Unfortunately the manager decision is not fair for there employees, terminating employee without cause is irrelevant.Hopefully the management will take action with this so that the company will grown successfully."
bad,"Amazon is an organization of total confusion in most facilities! The opportunity for upward mobility is not recognized by your credentials or experience, but by excessive brown nosing. Very ""clicky"" and most of management are recent college students with mostly no WORK experience, let'alone any management experience!"
bad,"Not bad for temp work. But if you plan on full time, start watching your back. They care about numbers not people. Will tell you anything with a smile while holding a knife behind their back."
bad,"That's why they are able to keep so many of us in oppression, cause we need the benefits... horrible culture, management, and overall way of life during working hours.  I didn't last too long... You ever watch the movie Antz, just like that... if you never watched it, please do and you'll understand when you watch it with an open mind."
bad,"Company has its place. Sell products as cheap as possible. That is as far as it goes. The managers that you would work for are Ghosts... Never around, horrible training for the expectations they have of you. no type of retraining assistance, no expectation development. Basically they hire you...  show you the warehouse...   Tell you to get to it....   Then tell you you failed to meet the requirements and fire you...   Sweet huh???"
bad,"Everywhere you looked in there, everyone was dreadful and hated their lives, there is NO work/life balance. They expect WAY too much of employees.They will work you to the bone and not care about how you are physically. They expect so much of everyone that most people can't live up too. If you ever find yourself interested in Amazon, please turn away, while yes, the pay IS good, but it's not worth it."
bad,It's  very Stressful  and what you do for work should be paid more money. They have all ages that work there I like that. There is a lot of favoritism  to certain employees. The warehouse isn't  runned proper it could be from managers that opened the warehouse and trained them when it first opened. You have good managers. But IF YOU WANT TO BE STRESSED OUT WORK HERE.
bad,Modern day Slavery! Where is Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King when they are needed most! It is run by backstabbing children strait out of college. People with no talent. The Slaves have to train the inept leaders. Where is the justice?
bad,"My experience at amazon was bad. I was the top shipper for 3 months, and it's great I was able to quit when I did. The pay is the only thing that will keep u motivated to have u come back. The hours are ridiculous and the management never truly want to help u wit anything. Music is trash and a constant distraction, while most employees are weird & immature like high school kids. Constant gossip wit low work ethics, not to mention the bad commute to get to work everyday. It may start off normal but u'll get tired of it rather quickly. If u need a quick come up then get on board, it's just not somewhere meant to be long term whether it's your discretion or getting fired for a petty reason. After quitting through a temp agency at a shift I didnt enjoy, I then returned seasonally through the company at a different shift, only to be turned away after a few days because I wasn't fully placed back into the system. It can get you back on your feet financially but it's only a matter of time before you're sick of it."
bad,"Starts off pretty easy, but as they lure you into a false sense of security they increase productivity out of nowhere and expect you to reach them without an issue. Hours will throw off your internal clock with ridiculous work times and unexpected mandatory overtime while also having vacation requests potentially cancelled due to said mandatory hours. Place is toxic in terms of favoritism taking place of potential growth instead of actual skills being considered. Don't work with Amazon, it's not worth it."
bad,I had a poor experience at amazon from onboarding to the termination of my employment  with them. Onboarding was unclear and difficult with no support for several months. When I switched departments the negative culture still prevailed where associates and low-level managers are over worked and burdened with virtually no support from senior leaders.
bad,If you have to rent a van from Amazon then I would stay well away!! They rob you. You are basically working to just pay the van. They charge you nearly £1000 A MONTH for the van then £100 a week for the fuel. However if you do have your own van then your fine but the longer you work there the more and more parcels they give you but at no extra cost. Although the management will help you most of the time if you have any queries they are very much out for themselves so as long as their parcels are delivered and they hit their target then stuff how your thinking or feeling.
bad,"A typical day at work was disturbing. No one wanted to come into work, and the management was poor. There was always something, and the fall back was always on my shift instead of managers and ambassadors actually doing their job to lead their shift to do better."
bad,"Horrible job. They corral you in there with high pay and then they work you to death. You can't just walk around in there you have to walk with purpose which means fast walk as FAST as you can to where you're going because it takes a lot of time to get anywhere as big as the place is. It's hot and the LED lighting is not that bright making you tired for your 10 hour shift. During the holidays it's horrible. So many people hired in and you just cannot move. No sitting down ever unless you're at break. Break takes forever to get to unless you're one of the lucky ones that has a break room close. If you're on the third floor mod forget it. Your legs hurt so bad and by the time you get home your body is DONE! Getting your quota is key and buddy if you don't you will eventually get fired. You have to be very careful entering in your info when you stow. Scanning everything and logging your boxes. If you have to go to the bathroom you log out and it times you so you're not gone too long and if you are you're in trouble!! But you know they have a few bathrooms on each side of the building, it only takes 5 minutes of super fast walking to get there. It's uptight. Managers are horrible and all scared they're going to lose their jobs. They smile and whiz by but you can see them breaking down inside. No phones on the floor. They scan you in and out like it's a prison and they treat you like everyone steals. It's a horrible place! Never again!"
bad,"Health, dental, vision benefits are good from day one. Very High levels of physical labor and 10 hour shifts at the Fulfillment Center was a new experience for me."
bad,"I got fired for something  I didn't  do and than they didn't  even show me the cameras  where they said I did this such thing, than told me I eligible  for rehire a year later than I went for it and than said  I wasn't eligible to work there AT ALL ANYMORE!!!!! Thier  racist  , always choosing their  picks. And this is for CAE3"
bad,This job reminds me of slavery. I'd never go back you are worked to the bone till you drop working every second. They have timers on you from their computer watching your rate. They tell you to drink water but if you stop your rate falls down then a manger will write you up for not meeting rate. It's like you are squeezed out of energy everyday and they expect you to come to work the next day giving 100% of yourself with sore feet to the point your limping... extremely fast pace environment it's a big sweat shop and you're under paid as if you're a cashier... when you apply it say you will get 14hour but when you arrive they tell you they pay 13hour.
bad,"Whatever your level of experience, the stress and manipulation attached to an Amazon job isn't worth the compensation. You'll probably be replaced by a robot anyways."
bad,"10 hr days in Las Vegas heat and LAS 2 has no AC.   "
bad,no air condition have to walk up 4 flights of stairs have fan at some stations and some don't  a few mangers care but have to do what there told ship dock you have to do a lot of different jobs the manager ask would you go to ship dock  I said I wanted to only stow she said just for 2 weeks the first week my feet swole  up were my doctor made me stay home for a week when I got back they called me back and it happen again my fit bit said 26300 steps  so when I told them I didnt want to do that they said you do it or go home you have to make rate its a lot of people sowllen feet and wrist they don't want to lose there benefits you have 15 min for break you have 2 and a half min to get from 4th floor to break room 10 min break and 2 and a half min to get back if your late you get point cant sit at station for break you have to stand no sitting at stations  its a mess
bad,"I had bad experience not what I thought it would be working "
bad,They dont let you go to the bath room. They talk about safey but dont care if you are sick I would give them a 0 stars if that was the option. PLEASE DON'T WORK HERE...
bad,"I hate this place, there is no communication , HR is very lazy . They changed my manager 3 times and I only worked there for 2 months . It’s very dirty there . Bugs every where . The only thing good is the pay and benefits . But the hrs suck. They are tooo long and not ideal ."
bad,"Work hard and have fun."
bad,"Stop believing all the hype that surronds Amazon!!!!! Yes Jeff Bezo was first to offer his employees $15 an hour, but it came with a price. He took away our monthly bonuses, stocks other incentives. The management team are awful the work culture is horrific, if you are between the ages of 18-25. Amazon is definitely for you! Over 30 with a family/small kids yeah don't do it. Amazon does not care at all! Amazon is a very fast paced business and all about numbers. Rate, rates and rates arecwhat kerpbtheir doors revolving, turn over is very high. And if you can not meet rate you will be terminated. I loved my job when I first started, however within 6-12 month's I literally hated that place."
bad,"Now sure what I can say without violating my contract. So I will keep is simple. You work for 10 hours, with 2 breaks. And during that time you are required to keep up with productivity demands. However, they are not always physically possible. A bathroom break could ruin your rates."
bad,Everyday something new thing happens that we have to try and then 3/5 managers say we are keeping it and 2/5 managers with more say we aren't keeping it. Literally barely ever get told to do anything without it being explained different or not explained at all. They say safety is a priority but you can't go to the bathroom without finishing what you are doing. They say they are a trans friendly company but it takes up to two weeks to be able to print a badge that changes the name on it so you don't out yourself to upwards of 30-40 people for no reason. It's such a website of confusion that I can't even find out my call out/late show instances when asking a manager.
bad,This place is horrible I'm am leaving ASAP THEY HAVE MANY GOOD OFFERS but they are fair for all employees they are lie about all things here and there management or all in charge TALK  BAD ABOUT ThE GOOD PEOPLE WHO WORK THERE BUTTS OFF in thus place wow really can't wait to leave this very bad place to work I hope Jeff bezo is happy with this mess
bad,"The warehouse needs to have Windows and it's way too hot."
bad,"I worked as a picker in Calgary location. It’s a continuous walking job. You get two half an hour break, but it’s not enough for this tough job. If you are not up to the speed, manager will come and question you. Very tiring and boring job. Will not recommended Amazon to anyone to work for."
bad,L esclavage moderne est bien présent en europe ...
bad,Dont get hurt while on the job otherwise they will prevent you fron working for them again.  Management and the temp agency are awful to work for or with.
bad,"Improper working vehicles, 0 respect from Amazon warehouse employees, drivers are not allowed to use Amazon break room even though you work for Amazon. You work in all weather no matter the strength of the hurricane. They don’t care about anything except getting those packs out. 200+ stops 280+ packages and lets not forget the oversize boxes. All of this has to be done in 10 hrs oh yeah no break either, even though it’s mandatory"
bad,Treat you like slaves then you get just and they don’t even compensate you! I paid my own medical bill they didn’t even bother to help me at all or check back on me
bad,Working 10 hour shifts a day with odd days off was very problematic for me. There was no work life balance at all. the safety culture with this job was not something that was respected until 4 or 5 injuries would occur.
bad,Amazon is a ruthless company that will stop at nothing to be ahead of the game through productivity. Even sacrifice the well being of the employees. Productivity rates began to be unobtainable the longer you worked there. Management was a joke and didn't know what was going on majority of the time and would talk nonsense. If you asked questions or put management on the spot you were definitely made an example of.
bad,"A typical day as an order picker you walk around in circles for 10 hours straight, grabbing things off shelves for orders. The atmosphere is oppressive, there is little time allowed to socialize with anyone, I worked there for years and felt like I still barely knew anyone. The other employees were all miserable so morale was abysmal, which brings you down with it. They treat you like criminals, metal detectors and security checking you between every break, not even allowing you to bring in a cellphone or iPod to listen to music, which makes the extremely monotonous nature of the job even more soul-crushing. It's the only job I've ever had that literally made me feel like I was going to have a nervous breakdown out of sheer monotony. Not only that, but their quotas are pretty high, which many people struggle with. For what they pay, hard pass."
bad,"The rates are too high! They are always raising them. Too many young adults! (18-21). Huge turnover rate! You are dispensible at any time! Management sucks! Too many chiefs not enough indians! Huge favortism! You slave ur butt off, & they don't care!!!"
bad,"The metrics established for timing of the physical labor with regard to sitting, etc are beyond intolerable and unachievable."
bad,They say they are there to work with you but once you get hurt or report one of the mangers they make it harder on you working there. But they were caring when I lost my dad.
bad,I started as a seasonal employee and eventually became part-time. My ultimate goal was full-time. However; that was not meant to be. I started as scanner and then went to small sorts went back to scanning and then I was terminated.
bad,"They simple run people into the ground and hire someone else, there needs to be a union, HR is there to protect Amazon not employees . Greater things have failed , Greed"
bad,Schedules are always hit or miss.  Communication is non existent amongst any of the management or associates.  Amazon is more concerned with daily metrics than the well being of its associates.
bad,"The problem I had with Amazon was not the people. Management was great the associates were nice, but the goals were unrealistic and no matter how fast your are you can never get ahead of the work load because it is infinite."
bad,"People only stay at amazon based on stock and sign on bonuses. There is no work life balance, don’t accept a salaried position low level employees have the power due to the company not being unionized"
bad,If you want to move up plan to kiss a lot of butt or you better be one of the cool kids it is very strenuous work on some positions and they work you in the same job until you break and if you ask to rest from that and do something else you are required to file a accommodation which can cause you to not be able to work for days even months instead of just rotating positions
bad,I was homeless working at walmart I lost a my youngest son I requested additional time off they denied it less than a week after i returned they harassed me about numbers a week later security harrassed me the following week i was terminated thos company is the devil right along with Wal-Mart
bad,"Pay is okay you work so much that u can't enjoy your benefits you don't get to seat down for the whole shift except when on break which is short bathroom and exit are far from you manager are always rushing u ready to write you up let's just say they are fast and happy to hire you and fast and happy to let you go  it's hard work which doesn't pay off u can work hard and no one care they just "
bad,"management was very disorganized, they were very understaffed and started changing my work schedule shift even though i had a second job and told them these are the only hours i could work with them..it was over all a very unprofessional experience at this location specifically..."
bad,"Podczas mojej pracy w Amazonie, miewałam problem z plecami podczas pracy na AFE."
bad,"Amazon being a big company you would except HR in every site but unfortunately HR department is in some Corner of the country and employees are left to defend themselves from Racism and sexism. A very bad work environment and work ethics - Everybody is for themselves which leads of some people being bullied. "
bad,"All amazon DSPs are the same they dont care about your safety sketchy areas, bad weather,long work hours,changes every other week mostly amazon fault."
bad,"If you're willing to throw away your entire life for a company that, quite frankly, doesn't care if you drop dead because of them, then this is the place for you. They claim that ""safety"" is their #1 priority and then turn a blind eye on everything safety related so they can make their volume goals. They will call you in for 6 days a week (20 hours being overtime) at the blink of an eye and not give a darn about your work life balance. They will ""help you advance your career with the career choice program"" and then not give you any time off to go to school and earn your degree so you can get the heck out of their toxic work environment. It's almost impossible to move up in the company unless you come in with a bachelor's degree. We hire our managers straight out of college which means they know next to nothing about running a warehouse. Amazon is a trainwreck. We have a phrase about Amazon in our warehouse: ""Amazon makes dollars, not sense"".  Truly, they lost a darn good employee by screwing me over and I just want to warn other people about this torturous work environment before they waste their time applying."
bad,"The management at amazon will expect to work you're butt off every single day, if you slack in the slightest they will try to rip you a new one, expect to be dogged and they have what is known as ""golden boys"" where to as if they don't even meet there quota they won't get repremanded. Also expect frequent layoffs here"
bad,"You don't matter here. You are just a number in a spreadsheet and you're 100% replaceable to management's eyes. They will work you to the bone and when you beg for help they will just shrug. "
bad,"I spent nearly three years there and seeing how well the company is doing, the amount of pressure they give you to make sure customer orders are out on time can be taxing on even seasoned workers. Positions are always changing and department heads change pretty much every year. No consistency in safety rules or network wide policies. At times, weeks and weeks on 60hrs with no end become incredibly hard, especially for night shift. I'd recommend avoiding this company at all costs."
bad,"The people are what make it a good work place. Besides that I wouldn’t recommend anyone who is a temp to work here. We are not aloud to cross train, We are not aloud to go to their events, We are not even aloud to have a snack if they are free, We are also not aloud to ask if we can cross train and learn something new. We are basically a nobody in this company."
bad,Lavoro buono solo per periodi brevi in mancanza di meglio
bad,Trust me you don't wanna work there I thought it was cool too at first till I got in the building and started noticing thing every week and new faces every day
bad,"This is a good place to get paid, or go get physically fit. The job is physically demanding, but ultimately boring. "
bad,"Pros"
bad,"Amazon is so clueless.  The first thing I was shocked about was the online training was full of spelling and grammatical errors. It was as if a third-grader created it. The customers called you every name in the book and made up new names for you. You were put under pressure to keep your metrics up, if you couldn't keep them up, you were fired.  As a seasonal employee, they don't have to give you warning if you're about to be canned. After every bad call (where the customer is first sent to a chat agent who's likely Asian and doesn't know the language, then sent to another agent, and then finally sent to us), we were required to send out a ""did we solve your issue?""   Well, of course not! Because the customer was calling because their package/parcel never made it (most likely because the driver stole it). So if the customer said ""no"", then the customer service agent would be disciplined.  Drivers would call us and tell us they signed for the customer's package.  Numerous liquor deliveries went missing over Christmas, I wonder where they went. One customer in the UK called and said he took pictures of the driver urinating in his driveway (because they have a certain time to get the job done).  Everyone in the SDS department was under pressure.  I got called the ""C"" word when I couldn't explain where the customer's parcel went. The team leaders were useless.   I tried to transfer into another department, it never happened, so I quit.  It wasn't worth the money, even working at home."
bad,"The management was inconsistent and inexperienced. No empathy or work life balance. The store I worked for was supposed to be permanent,  then with no warning they began terminating employees, threatening managers to write employees up and suddenly they closed all our stores. Terrible company to work for no room for growth, the stock options were misleading and nothing good except the benefits. Upper management and HR were heavily in kahoots...it was tons of unethical situations constantly with no penalty."
bad,"Management is unaware of how the process works and will constantly make decisions that impede productivity. Such as repeatedly cutting corners to make things more efficient, but actually slow everything down. Because of that we frequently had to work overtime. Instead of taking responsibility for their mistakes they blamed employees. The most common excuse was we left for breaks a few seconds early. As if less than 10 minutes of production loss by a small percentage of the employees is the reason we only did 2/3 of our goal, and not because everything was shut down for several hours due to equipment being overloaded and breaking. Safety is swept aside in order to be more productive. Such as putting one person in a position that requires 2 or more people. Putting boxes on the line that weight significantly more than the maximum limit. Setting production goals that are more than double what the equipment is rated for. The lines get so overloaded that boxes and totes get smashed together causing products falling out, sometimes from 10-15 feet in the air. All of these issues I brought up several times and more often than not nothing was done about it. Plus they play favorite and treat others unfairly. I was sent to crosstrain in other departments several times, but very few others had to do it even once. Some rules only applied to a few employees, but not others. I've seen employees get fired for something inconsequential as nudging a pallet with a pallet jack and get fired, where others have hit people with forklifts and kept their jobs."
bad,"if you can't make your quota you get terminated, if you get hurt they don't really care. If you do get hurt and you go to a doctor, don't fudge on the form or you will get terminated. There are a lot of lazy people there that seem to get all the promotions. I loved being an ambassador and training new people."
bad,"At Amazon, you stay physically active. You always have to be on alert because the entire warehouse is all automated with robots and conveyors above you."
bad,"I was working in the AFE department and everyone know how hectic it is working in any department AFE was no exception. "
bad,"It’s sad that being in America and American you treat the other culture better than your own!  I am a hard worker and not afraid of work, I was yelled at, watched people leave there stall for over half hr before breaks, if I did what they do I would of been walked out.  They use stand up time and talk about issues instead of correcting the behavior, I would not work for a company like this again!"
bad,Favouritism is disgusting. Management is disgusting. Would not recommend . The do not reward long term employment so it s more of a temporary job option
bad,"It's a great job but be wary if you get a very unproffessional manager. They hire straight from college and the managers like to think that they know everything, tend to not follow policy, blindly enforce it, and favorite the people who suck up or that's how it is at CHA2."
bad,"I was hired to work in the Sortation area. You are trained how to scan the packages and build a stable pallet. However, some managers would come up to workers and tell them they should do something different than they were trained to do. Very inconsistent. They seemed more concerned with your scanning rate rather than the stability of the pallet, but would complain if the pallet was a mess. I would start my shift with the last shifts mess and be told off. My scam rate was low as I was constantly rebuilding the pallet. I would see many fellow employees just going from one lane to another scanning packages and tossing them on the pallet just to keep their rate high. "
bad,"Worked in man3 from day 1 didn't get along with second manager he is not good to certain people so he won't help u at all.He give u cold shoulder whenever he sees u need help."
bad,Amazon is not a good company to work manager are inexperienced don’t know what there doing and they make up there own rules as they go I would not recommend this place to anyone
bad,They treat you horrible high turn over no one knows what they are doing changing rules as they go along have to do two jobs for price of one  high pack rates
bad,"This may be a good starting point for someone transitioning from the fast food industry, but not a good fit for experienced employees. It is a igh stress job and I witnessed two people have heart attacks while there from the stress."
bad,Its just bad company to work for and doesn't recognize employees hard work especially if you are in warehouse management. The work culture at Corporate is no different heard lot of people complaining about it too.
bad,"W amazon ani żadnym innym polskim magazynie nigdy nie byłem, ale pracowałem dłużej w południowych Niemczech m.in. na magazynie z żywnością eko (bezpośrednio pod firmą, bez żadnych złodziejskich agencji pracy). Po tym co tutaj czytam i w ogóle obserwuję rozmawiając z Polakami jestem przerażony do jakiego zezwierzęcenia doprowadzono ten jeszcze nie tak dawno wielki naród. Tam hala obejmująca art. suche, nabiał oraz warzywa i owoce miała przed rozbudową ok. 4000 m2 pow. (jednopoziomowa).  Komisjonerzy pakowali produkty nie na palety, a na rolki pchane siłą mięśni, ale za to normę wyrabiał każdy kto tylko chciał pracować - 100 picków/h. Nie było podziału, że każdy jest przypisany do danego działu, wszyscy działali wszędzie w zależności jakie zamówienie wylosował im komputer. Najszybsi, którzy mieli normy po 150 picków/h (nieraz więcej) samej premii miesięcznej dostawali od 300 do 500 euro średnio (zdarzało się także po 700 dla gościa który losował niemal sam nabiał i miał mnóstwo drobnicy ułożonej koło siebie). Każdy pracował sam, wiedział co ma robić, nikt z batem nie pilnował. Team leader był 1 (SŁOWNIE JEDEN) I odpowiadał WYŁĄCZNIE za to, żeby wszystko łącznie z załadunkiem tirów płynnie szło. Skoro szło, klient zapłacił, to nawet goście którzy mieli normę nieco poniżej 100 picków/h mogli robić swoim tempem i nikt się nad nimi nie pastwił, tyle że nie dostali premii. 27 dni płatnego urlopu na początek, a wszystkie nadgodziny (pracowało się aż do zwycięstwa w zależności od ilości zleceń) powyżej 8 godzin dziennie można było wypłacić lub zamienić na 100% płatny urlop (niektórzy"
bad,"They don’t appreciate their employees it’s all about the numbers to them you’re easily replaceable. Fast is never fast enough and good is never good enough. Constantly written up for things like time off task, “quality”, productivity, defects ect. There are first second and third write ups, each with a longer and longer expiration date. To switch departments you must be “in good standing” which is very rare. I was talked to because my productivity for one week was at a 98.7% apparently that’s not good enough they expect  “100% or higher” every week which means you have to be putting “units” away every 10 seconds (not exaggerating) for 10 hours a day, 40 hours a week. I put away 5,200 units in one day my time was less then 8 seconds the entire day and I was let go without notice the next week. I didn’t recive a call prior to work the next day it wasn’t till my badge didn’t let me in the building that I realized I was “terminated”  They’re constantly firing the people at the bottom 20%. No one should feel secure with this job."
bad,"Amazon sorting center is possibly the worst idea you could ever make. The managers will watch you work and do nothing but yet state in meetings that ‘WE ARE ALL IN A TEAM’, if you plan to work at the warehouse YOU ARE NOT in a team, remember that and confide in NO ONE."
bad,"Worked like a robot.everybody was negative because they were so miserable in their job.This place needs to have a fun environment to work at,not to use and abuse temporary members of staff."
bad,Bad management they don't accept doctor notes that's why I don't currently work there no more security major issue.I don't recommend it need more control and fix there doctor note policy maybe they can keep some workers
bad,"Yikes, where to begin.....there is no training here.  You show up and have no idea what to do or how to do it.. when you ask a manager they act offended that you asked.  Truly a bizarre place to work.  After a week of that you decide not to care either. Other employees have said that the fulfillment centers are not this disorganized.   The turn over here is probably unreal.  All the horror stories of working at Amazon are true. Thankfully, Im only here to pay off debt.  Only positive thing about this job is I see young people questioning their choice to not attend college.  Faced with a life of being an Amazon employee is scaring them straight."
bad,"Fast paced, slave-like treatment from management, no flexibility, extremely stressful work environment, no job security, will write you up just because of a rate of 99 units per hour or less"
bad,"Only care about numbers, not so much how the work is done. You are only a computer that produces numbers, nothing else is factored in. The answer will always be: work faster."
bad,"Worked there for six months and was the worse job experience I've ever had with a company. The work is very mindless but intense with quotas that must be met. Overall, a good experience what I never want to do as a career."
bad,It's kinda a stepping stone kind of job. If you need money bad then it's a great place to work as they are one of the highest paying jobs with little to no experience.
bad,Terrible place to work for. Management and HR aren’t on the same page. Telling employees they can go in on overtime days and then fired for it even though the manager says he approved. Waste of time and happiness
bad,work was extremely physical for little pay. Wage was not livable. breaks were a 4 min. walk to and back from station and only had 215 min. break per 10 your shift.
bad,"Management is poor"

I tried discussing w/HRBP, Ethics in Seattle, his VP of Ops. All it got me was on a ""program"" which is a way to steer non-believers out the door. I refused to drink the Kool-Aid & refused to treat my people the way I was being treated. "
bad,"This place will kill your back i had no problems with my back after 1 week I had back pains and now have damaged my back.. The managers don' t seem to care and indirectly give your the hint you will be no longer required there. Long hours will be on your feet for a long time, very short breaks, takes you 5 mins to get out and get back in from break and if 1 sec late the managers and leads on your back like hound dogs. the rates are ridiculous and if your in picking (which I was) then ""God help ya"". That's where I damaged my back even more. The only good pros is the money but whats the point of having more money when u cant walk or move."
bad,"Over work hard to make rate. Not enough pay, its not worth 15.00 overtime is too much or not enough work they hire to fire cant keep enough of staff!!"

bad,Here at acy5. I had an episode. I have bipolar disorder and needed commadation. I filled out paperwork and was denied. These managers had no idea on my disorder. It is sometimes hard for me to be so close to people working next to me. Specially if they cant do the job. All my jobs I was places byself because my disorder. Acy5 was told this. Amazon was told this. This place also favors certain employees. They are always in same job or moved to operator. Safety sucks. Plain disregard to hard workers. Dont work for Amazon. Acy5 sucks. Hr sucks
bad,They treat there employees like trash. Do not work here it is now fun to work here at all the management sucks and you get treated very poorly I would not recomend
bad,"pay is good, management is lack luster at best. If you are not a favorite it is hard to move up in the company and tenured and non tenured associates make the same pay."
bad,"Not going to work there anymore that's it "
bad,"Overworked and under paid, the only thing that matters at Amazon is volume and high numbers. I got hurt on the job on Dec.18,2018 and now it's almost the middle of Feb. 2019 and I still have not received a workman's comp check yet. To much pressure and stress working at Amazon. This is a job for some one fresh out of high school or a person looking to supplement their income."
bad,The  new management didn’t what to do. It’s was like training them and there supposed to be management. Amazon was a fun place to work until the got new manager sometime I felt like I had to train them with all the question and things they didn’t know. And parking was crazy when it was peek season. But I did like peek season with all the insensitive to work hard and games and prizes.
bad,"Management is horrible, nobody knows your name unless they're reading it off a computer. You aren't allowed a bathroom break or it'll lower your hourly rate. It's also disheartening to work 11-12 hour shifts during peak. Their ideal employee is a machine. "
bad,The rates to go a job is ridiculous. Amazon keeps raising it not thinking about the others. Maybe one or two people might go over. Than they expected others to do it too everyone is different. Amazon don't care about the people just numbers.
bad,"picking can damage people feet, and health. I think they need to consider people health. Also its labor. Pay is great, but if you scared of heights don't try to do this job at this branch. Also"

Only pays 3000 a year when most community colleges cost that much a SEMESTER. Also, the program is extremely limited as for what classes you can take. Obviously in an effort to not have to pay for you at all. For such a big company, very small benefits"

bad,"RECRUITMENT PROCESS"
bad,"Amazon makes itself out to be very friendly and helpful, but they work you too hard to balance life and work simply making it about serving amazon. Although working 4 days in a row and being off three sound balanced, you work to hard to be able to do much on your days off - especially during peek season or if you become management."
bad,"We can't meet the quota demands that are put out to us if the ""water spiders"" (as they call them) do not do their jobs and are not held to a standard. We stand to lose our jobs because someone else is not doing their job. To top that off, women are never given a chance to be on the water spider team because it is assumed that they can not meet the demands of that job, yet the males that are on that team are already failing at their jobs. For the shifts we are given which are 3/12's we were only given 10 hours of unpaid vacation and 4 hours of paid time off until the next quarter.  If you go below your 10 unpaid time off you get fired. That goes quick if you have a life and things happen. That barley covers one day. Walmart at the very least allows unpaid time off if needed with out the threat of getting fired. Your just a body to them. Remember that. Their 10% discount is pathetic by the way."
bad,"Awful place to work.  Stressful.  They change things constantly and don't inform anyone but expect you to know the changes.  Wouldn't recommend.  Noone obeys the safety rules but management drills into constantly, with no backup action."
bad,"Manager frequently came into the area making negative comments not based on factual information. PA's are prima-donna's and do not support the staff nor the Area Managers."
bad,I have worked for Amazon for 2 years and in that time have not ever been interviewed or talked to about Career development.  I have been through 9 different managers and must start from scratch with everyone.
bad,"Very high decibels in equipment and machines. Very load environment. Ear plugs are highly suggested. If your sick, you better have a doctors note every time or it will dock your pay and hurt your overall scoring."
bad,Horrible to place to work rude staff with no respect for anyone and most of them are foreign so they all speak in their language to each other which is rude.
bad,"The compensation and benefits are the only good thing about working for this company.  The amtosphere there is cut throat and poor management skills.  NO MORALS, NO VALUES, DISRESPECTFUL, They expect each employee to be at a 100% but there mangement skills are at a 25%.  Poor management skills=poor employees."
bad,"Amazon was a great place to grow your career, have fun, develop new skills, and make an impact through autonomy....but this WAS the case years ago...."
bad,"the job overall is good, i liked the fast paced nature of the job. But management and other employees is what is wrong with this place. They don't care that an employee has lied countless times, they still pull you off the floor to investigate  a false claim and nothing is done to the other person. I know this happened years ago, but i know people who work here now and they say its still the same way."
bad,"Amazon started off as a comfy job for the first few months working there. I believe it got worst after the holiday rush. For starters, hours started to become shorter than management was handing write-up "
bad,"spend most of your time at amazon. on off days trying to catch your breath and get body back to being able to take the physical abuse. "
bad,"My experience at Amazon was not a good one. I had to file 2 police reports for harassment, I was harassed attacked plotted on and threatened. My orders were deliberately hacked and set up. The employees were great to work with for the most part. The managers and staff on the other hand were something else. I learned that hard work isnt enough to survive there if they have it out for you.They deleted all my orders that I did and did everything they could to try to make me leave.I tried to transfer to a different location but they did everything they could to make sure that never happened. I want to say this was the worse unprofessional job experience I ever had in my life."
bad,"Personal relationships with managers open up way more opportunities to move up than your work ethic. You are held accountable to make your hourly rate which directly relies on other associates providing the work for you to do. Managers/Supervisors will know that you have no work therefore can't make your rate but will still write you up.No reasonable explanation will suffice. Not sure how you can make rate when you have no work to do so but they don't care about basic logic. Your not a human being there, you could be excelling and packing over 115% but still be coached because you weren't packing for 3 minutes in a 10 hour shift(yes that happens often)."
bad,"I work a flex schedule. Since they hired so many people it's nearly impossible to get any shifts. Once the shifts get posted online they are taken in a matter of seconds. There isn't enough work to go around. Management is no help. They basically tell you ""Oh well. Try again next time"". Not a good place to work if you actually want to make a living."
bad,They like to pretend they care about there employees butbthe truth is its a slave shop. They litteraly hire anyone to work in warehouses that includes many people who cant get work elsewhere. Unfortunately this allows for them to treat there employees like animals. You work 10 and half hours day on the off season and 11 sometimes 12 hours during peak season. You are given two 15 min breaks and half hour lunch...which if u work in the back of the warehouse good luck getting to use a microwave and eat your food all in half hour. If you are one min late to your station they dock an hour of your paid time off. You could be going as fast as possible and the management will still come and rush you and make you feel as though your job in in jeopardy. They expect 2 to 3 boxes paked in 30 seconds (this is not an exaggeration) it doesnt matter the size of the items or how many items need to be packed if you are not producing 6 boxes in a minute they are at your station complaining. Your 1st week there your body will be in agony so be prepared.  Good luck
bad,"I was a transfer from another facility before I transfer if I was able to see on there Hub what the qualification was for that particular Department I would have known immediately whether I could perform that job. Since there was no way to see I have been written up three times in these three months now my job is on the line I'm not a robot I cannot meet their speed qualification Therefore I may be walked out the door this is the holidays I had such hope and aspiration to succeed with this company but they do not care I have a heart I am a human I'm not a robot... what I find amazing about Amazon that it's a trillion-dollar company is the fact that it does not run off of heart and soul of its employees it runs off grease, oil,and hydraulic fuel for their robots...."
bad,"very hard targets to achieve."
bad,"A lot of favoritism is shown by management, management is not there for support. Many cliques and overall rude people. Not worth the money or hours that must be accommodated."
bad,Good to get yourself on your feet. Very fast paced. Wouldnt recommend unless you were able to get on a cherry picker or something of that nature. Decent pay.
bad,this company will work you and take everything they can from you with little in return. you work 60+ hours a week as an exempt leader with little recognition. Results are driven by fear
bad,"Stressful and bad management, Do not work here. I literally have nothing else to say about this company simply b/c its all bad and mama said if you have nothing nice to say dont say anything at all."
bad,"Not the culture I want to be associated with.  I was lured into the opportunity with the generous signing bonus and stock options.  After becoming more entrenched in the culture, I saw the true face of Amazon which i did not want to be a part of."
bad,If the consumers and prime members really KNEW how Amazon employees were treated I think they would boycott. You will never advance here unless you are a single parent (woman) with 2+ kids because they know you will take the low paying money amd it will boost your self esteem that you have a leaders role. The people that they select as P.A.’s lack leadership and people skills. But hey what do you expect when the company competitive pay is $2 more than working at Papa Johns.
bad,"Amazon has a figure it out as you go culture which sets you up for failure! The lack of training and development is ridiculous. a typical work day is me working 16 hours a day, no break!"
bad,"I don't even know where to begin!  If you like working in a high-stress work camp, then an Amazon warehouse is definitely for you."
bad,"Amazon is a terrible place to work if you desire any chance of advancement. They require you to go above and beyond but only offer a select few associates the opportunity for these chances. That way when you go to interview for higher positions you are left struggling with stories to tell them of your accomplishments. It is a way to limit who can advance while showing the rest of the company that the opportunities exist."
bad,"All Amazon fulfillment centers should hire and have district/regional managers to look at the ups and downs on the warehouses. The work culture is extremely difficult having young inexperienced managers micromanaging long term veterans. Micromanagers can only speak out about 1/4th of the companies work policies and it's all about the productivity statistics. Area managers disregard other important work standards such as: work safety, employee communication, signs of urgency on associates' assistance and questions & concerns. "
bad,A typical day at Amazon's Warehouse was stressful. I dreaded going into the toxic environment and working ten hours on a overnight shift and not being compensated for much especially in a field I don't admire.
bad,"No OT offered. Constantly being asked to take voluntary unpaid time off due to lack of work. The new minimum wage benefit only benefits new associates or those making under 15 an hour. Anyone who has been with the company for 2 years or more, lost a lot of their yearly pay check.  Lackadaisical management. Promotions are based on a dog eat dog environment. New programs that are supposed to be an improvement for processes are riddled with errors which cause constant write ups for associates. The goal oriented monthly vcp bonus is now gone, leaving nothing to strive for. The disinterested associate now makes equal to associates who go above and beyond for customer experience."
bad,"Tout ce qui intéresse AMAZON c'est la rentabilité de ses employés. Travail à la chaine. Management qui fait la ""police"""
bad,Hr are kids that have no degrees so it shouldn’t be called HR and you never know who your manager is it’s very fast paced I loved the mez sorting and packing honestly amazon is how I would run my company if I had one it’s just management and the ppl act like little kids in jr high so it gets annoying sometimes but I low key loved working there for the 3 days off just not the long hours
bad,"Employee are treated as a slave or as a robot.  No respect. Rasism and discrimination. Amazon trainee temporar employee, but not permanent employee.  It doesn't want to keep people. First is productivity, then quality and 3rh health and safety. The worst management i ever met in my life. Dirty place, lots dust. The food is horrible and expired.  Materials and tools are broken, damaged. Amazon wants lots work, fastes, no matter how or with what tools. Amazon doesnt respect breaktime (too much to walk inside to get food or a cigarette).  If you want to have an easy job there you should be friend, mother, sister of one manager,  not to work hard. Too many gods in same place, starting with cleaning employee, continued with security,  managers, leadership, procces guide, problem solve,  collegues, even 3 months employee who didn't know the process very well. All this are happening in Amazon Rugeley. I dont recomand!"
bad,"Apply if you like working in a fast paced environment. Keep your numbers well above goal, so you can let them slip when you need to take a potty break."
bad,"My experience working in FC as a stower the first week went great, but then beginning of second week your on your own and if you don't do well you can lose your job. Only the experienced workers that start there can make it, and it is not friendly at all mostly its who you know will be in your favor. Not a work place for older employees unless you already worked for years with Amazon. Amazon tracks your every move and time and you are based on it for your employment. I wish they just go 100% robotic."
bad,"Would not recommend this job to anyone!"
bad,"The first two weeks was excellent at the production line until new managers and team leaders turned up with no people skills in communication and no sense of knowledge about other work related to the company."
bad,not a fun place to work  changes to everyday job description  priorities not consistent   management very conflicting  i would not recommend this job for anyone i know  bad thing is i dont know if it was just sdf8 or amazon as a whole
bad,I was hired and advised them of my health condition and they totally overlooked it and lied about it . I had to file an formal complaint against them.
bad,"Amazon stated and provided a page while applying for you to pick your shifts because they claim they are a flexible company to work for. I selected that I wanted to work a third shift position (1:30 am to 6:30 am) part-time, which was stated as 20-29 hours per week. Great! Day one at the warehouse, myself and 12 other employees that had picked this particular shift are told that the shift is now Friday, Saturday and Sunday from 1200 am to 1200 pm. What?! This is now a full time job position with long, unwanted hours. When I brought this situation up to the HR at my warehouse site, they could have cared less. This company is deceitful and untrustworthy. They make people promises of flexible hours and the ability to pick your availability, then on your first day, they turn around and try to maneuver you into working 12 hour shifts back to back. I believe they do this to ""weed people out"". This job is probably great for single people with no other obligations or even robots, but not for families or people with lives. Be wary."
bad,"Intérimaire peu d évolution sauf pour les faux,aucune reconnaissances professionnel,personnel "
bad,"To fast paced and very unsafe, people are having accidents because of rushing around so fast for the correct numbers. I have learned how to work in a team environment and became very knowledgeable with the SAP system for a warehouse picker."
bad,Horrible place to work for. I would not recommend it to anyone. Over worked and under paid. Terrible Management. Long hours on your feet with limited ability to take a break.
bad,"It's basically a sweatshop. Aside form that, a typical day is arriving early because your badge to enter the building won't work most of the time so you need to hope somebody will be there to open the door for you."
bad,They need better management and more hours for the employees . Better communication from management. They should feed the employees that work for them.
bad,"Very fast paced so time goes by quickly.  The warehouse is extremely hot during the summer, especially if you're off-loading trucks.  They don't offer full-time at all locations.  The benefits for part-time (blue badge) employees are for employee only, and not family too.  The benefits include dental, vision and life ( no medical).  Employees are not eligible for tuition assistance until they have worked for 12 months as a regular part-time Associate."
bad,"The job itself was easy enough to do, but the speed in which it was required to do was crazy! As a picker, you had to go up and down metal open stairs to 3 different floor levels, but had to get from one item on one end of the huge building to the other, and each level, in about 3 minutes, so had to be in a constant frenzy, as your work performance was based on your ""pick count""/minute, whether you had a 15 minute walk/run from first to second item or not. The building is not insulated, so freezing in winter and stifling and hot/humid in summer, but you had to still run, so people were literally leaving in rescue squads, sometimes several / day, esp in the summer. Every few weeks, the ""expected count/minute"" to KEEP your job was being increased as upper management wanted more and more work/employee accomplished in less and less time."
bad,"Working at Amazon is a chore. When they're not depriving workers of bathrooms, they are requiring them to stand for upwards of 3-4 hours at a time, with no respite, with the constant threat of pay cut or termination lingering over your head if you aren't fast enough to meet their demanding schedule."
bad,The job kill you your body is not build to work like that for that long that do not promoted old worker they use you until some one young come along not better worker younger and they do not hire to many ...
bad,Easy work but no communication from management and hr was terrible. Hours we employees had to fight for every thursday. 20hrs per week pay doesnt compete with living expenses
bad,"Amazon internally does not care for its employees. Little attempt is made to make someone feel like they are welcomed on the team, which leads to low productivity, and in turn, causes the employees to be terminated."
bad,Want you to do alot but not everyone is putting the same effort. Also managers play favorites alot which changes the mood in alot of the worker. The managers dont even work only just talk with other managers
bad,Not enough done with safety. It's all about getting it out as quick as possible. Many people overlooked safety issues because of time constraints. I am glad to be out of there.
bad,"management never cared about warehouse employees. overworked. would not recommend unless you want to be worked like a robot, pay was good and kept you healthy but your pretty much a robot."
bad,"When I worked there, the managers favorites got all the choice jobs, never got in trouble, talked instead of worked. They never had to do hard jobs, were trained on better jobs.management could less less about you and only of you stay on task. When I first started it was a great place to work, then it became hostile."
bad,i have nothing aggenst amazon i think they are a great company but this building TPA1 is in need of some serious care and some good management that Last longer then a few weeks
bad,Enter a your own risk . Many great things about Amazon but there are also many of the stories told that are true.  My story ended after 4 years. I would go back to another division of Amazon but not Amazon Fresh. The culture is toxic.
bad,"Amazon views workers as disposable, even if you are in a management position you still dont have any power to make decisions, you're just the fall guy."
bad,"They raised the pick rate so they could get rid of people who couldnt keep up, and gave us a manager who had no clue what he was doing. I was so excited when i started working there because it was different. But after working there for over 2 years and seeing people get fired for nothing and then getting fired myself after working my butt off. Im a little indifferent, We are not robots we make mistakes and sometimes get tired or sore and hurt. They expect everyone to keep up with the ridiculous rates they have for everyone. I can say i enjoyed meeting new people i made a lot of friends there and will continue my friendship with them. I can say too i have had some awesome managers too not all of them were horrible. But the good ones end up getting promoted so quickly."
bad,"Mantras about hiring and developing the best were not at all true and the hypocrisy began to consume me. The focus is only and always on operations, i.e. throughput, and the intended focus on people is given to the hourly associates, not salaried team members, and only because they want associates to walk through their doors verses any similiar and nearby warehouse competitior. Attrition is high."
bad,"You never got credit for your accomplishments.  Their values did not allign with the culture.  When you were assigned a project and want to prove yourself, others would ask if they could help (more like watch you do the work).  E en though you did not need help, if you did not let others ride your coat tails.  You would get in trouble."
bad,Very different environment than usual but friendly. Very big warehouse lots of people to meet.Easy job.It can be very fast paced an very slow in one day.But work is work
bad,"Don’t speak to anyone because they won’t let you anyways. Go in there and keep to yourself. Make your rate. Leave. Amazon WILL get rid of you and have you replaced no matter how long you’ve been there. Over anything. It’s a big green corporation. You, as an employee, don’t matter."
bad,"It's a good place to work till it is good. The moment you have a concern about something, the HR and the management make sure they have an exit plan for your ready. It's an exciting environment where you work on different products and services in a short period of time. But that's just one element. The culture is terrible where people pull each other down to make themselves shine."
bad,"Very Unorganized and poor overall performance of Management, various jobs duties and productivity. A lot of waste and time of products being delivered"
bad,i have worked for this company for over a year i planned to transfer to another station because it is a steady paycheck. while looking for something with more advancement opp. leadership and HR are childish and VERY unprof. I would like to stand on morals and quit but I have bills and morals don't pay my bills but trust me I am looking for something else daily.  I work overnight shift which I do love.
bad,"I’d rather make minimum wage picking cabbage than work at Amazon again. Everyone I’ve ever talked to in multiple locations that have worked for Amazon have said the same things. It’s like we’re sharing old war stories, laughing about how everything was and then always ending the conversation depressed because we remembered how bad it was. Don’t do it."
bad,"Not many opportunitys to advance as advertised when hired. Management does not take care of the many issues that take place in the workplace, HR doesnt take care of the issues. When an employee reports an issue to management, the managers listen to the emplyees concerns but do nothing to resolve the issues. employees are overworked and underpaid."
bad,"mean management, draining, laborous, tiring, no advancement, short breaks bad hours for me no room to change hours just not my cup of tea wont work this type of enviornment again,"
bad,"They only care about numbers.  Place is huge, be prepare to be rushing for your break because it wont matter where you are assign, you still have 15 minutes of break to go to the restroom.  they only care about production and what you can do for them.   What they say and what they do is totally the contrary.  Unless you are a manager."
bad,People need jobs but Amazon will work you to death.  No one died at work while I was there but many people fell asleep driving home after work.  I did not want that to happen to me.
bad,I would not reccomment to anyone I know to work for amazon. They under pay their employees and the management treats the employees like slaves. Long gruelling hours. They issue way to much mandatory overtime. Not enought home and work balance.
bad,"There is a severe lack of communication among management and down to associates. Quick, hard workers are rewarded with more work to make up for slower employees. Management and promotions are highly based on favoritism."
bad,"Nessun tipo di riguardo per i lavoratori. Sicurezza ridotta al minimo, pressione al massimo, pause inesistenti. Lavoro altamente alienante."
bad,Not worth applying for would not recommend to anyone. the targets are ridiculous and when original started was told to do certain things and then told that if we did that we would be fired can produce evidence.
bad,I use to love this place to many changes. Managers never stayed always replaced management never had structure after awhile dont like managers breathing over shoulders just not fun anymore use to have fun contest managers use to be fun the environment has just changed
bad,"Management was poor and cut throat...only promoted their buddies. It was the old boys club at cvg9. Pretend to care about their employees by providing certain religious amenities, but trust me it was all a ploy."
bad,"You’re treated as if you’re expensive yet they hold a large signing bonus over your head if you leave voluntarily or involuntarily within the first year. For half the year, you work 80+ a week, 14-16 hours a day, often with no breaks or lunches."
bad,Amazon is one of the most corrupt and poorly managed companies I have ever worked for. It is literally impossible to even think about staying. It is literally one of the most morally bankrupt companies.
bad,"Management suck!! VTO all the time, which is fine, but the do not adjust rate for employee, so employee get a write up for not making rate. Not fair!!"
bad,"The rumors you've heard about Amazon? The horrible things? Their is some truth to it all. You work with a bunch of overgrown high schoolers and management is is basically mommy and daddy trying to calm down a whiny brat."
bad,Managers are aggressive. They even wait outside the bathrooms after break to make sure you are not using company time to relieve yourself. They also track your numbers and write you up if your numbers slip after one week.
bad,"It would have been a great job if they paid more, and had a more reasonable time frame for breaks. Restroom breaks were timed so if you had a stomach ache you are 2 points away from getting fired."
bad,Get talked to all the time for stuff that isn’t your fault because they didn’t properly train you. They fire people left and right  management is ridiculous they have no knowledge of anything!
bad,"They only promote and look out for friends and family. If you ever try to get somewhere they will work against you. They do not want to see someone else advance in the company, especially if it was done without them."
bad,The managers are idiots the pa are dumb this place is stressful I would not recommend anybody to work here unless u need a couple of checks there so much favoritetism
bad,"The benefits are great; the insurance is probably the best I've had as well as the cheapest I've had.  But the good news ends there.  It's a terrible work environment, most of the management sucks, upper management is useless, they preach safety but then write you up for taking too long by trying to follow their safety rules because all they care about is productivity, and they have medical on site but they are inept.  If you are desperate, it's something until you can find something better."
bad,"Finance needs better management skill leaders and more caring for the team instead of themselves. If you are not a good leader, people will leave you soon."
bad,"Amazon delivery center DIN1. The only goal was pushing volume, at the expense of its employees and customer's packages. I witnessed dozens of walk-offs in a matter of a few short months. It is physically impossible to do your job at the pace they require in many delivery zones on the line. The packages eventually stack up to the point that safety becomes an issue. Management does not care. Their only objective is to continually increase volume with absolutely zero incentive. Absolutely the worst work environment I have encountered in 26 companies that I have worked for."
bad,"Started as a fast paced, relatively boring industrial design job that became more and more stressful and stack ranking, week-long on-call rotations, and hostile HR entered the equation."
bad,"This company is extremely cut-throat. So much so that the turnover rate is extremely high. I worked as a contractor for almost a year now and they won't even compensate you for gas, and getting an actual shift is nearly impossible sometimes as a contractor. When you need support or need to talk to management the only ways to do so are through e-mail which you ALWAYS get an automated reply from someone in India. They just don't care."
bad,"I will refer this job to someone fresh out of high school or older people that is moving into retirement. The job is competitive, they expect TOO much out of you . Then when you don’t give them what they want you get written up or fired . The hours are long especially when your working 10 hours straight doing the samething over and over with limited communication with other people , no music just factory noise , it gets boring and annoying. The management really only care about numbers they don’t care about the employees. The job doesn’t let you move up to different positions and when you do try your waiting for weeks upon weeks . They provide you with a position and that’s what you have to stick too . People that like it is people that’s favorited or they have NO LIFE . You can’t go to school and actually have a second job with this job because your at work literally ALL DAY LONG . Human Resources gets an attitude when you ask questions and honestly they are NO help I had went to ask questions and they didn’t know the answer to it and sent me through the run around. The job is terrible in my opinion and honestly it’ll be better if the hours was shorter and there was a lot more COMMUNICATION."
bad,"They gonna make you work 3 hours a day, no breaktime and send you home. poor management, when it's freezing cold outside they leave the doors open even if there's no vans coming in or out,  the pay is weekly average 200$ for 5 days of work"
bad,its a very poor work place. That is why it has high turnover rate.  As a picker you are required to keep a rate of 80-100 items an hour with no mistakes. if you make a mistake you have to pick 1000 items to compensate.
bad,The senior manager has created a mistrusting culture as she talks about people behind their backs. She will also embarrass you in front of your peers.
bad,"Advertised at four 10 hour long work days. In actuality, it's more like four 13-14 hour long work days. Also, it may not be the norm, but I had three different managers over the year I was there."
bad,"Workday would typically involve sorting items and  building pallets. I learned how to manage their inventory. Management was fairly good, but not anymore. The hardest part of the job was the constant lifting of boxes and building of pallets, not a hard task but many workers built them incompetently so it made it harder. Lunch was enjoyable, met many good people there."
bad,"We don't have fun. "
bad,"Modern. Day. Slavery.  We were constantly pushed to do more each and every day with no respect for our health or safety.  All they cared about was getting the packages out, and people were expendable."
bad,Can't believe I've spent over a year wiring for these people. I would never recommend anyone to work here. We are the only facility in Columbia SC getting paid minimum wage.
bad,I think the companies tries to make the environment safe but the about of dust you will breathe in everyday will leave you with allergies you've never had before.
bad,"amazon would be a great place to work if it was fair and had good management, great benefits and flexible schedule. wouldn't recommend someone to make a career out of it"
bad,"So I have worked at Amazon for about 4 months now and I'm ready to leave. Night shift is $13/hr which is fine if you don't have a family (And I do). PEAK season is terrible. All overtime is mandatory (60 a week) from thanksgiving until after christmas. You cannot use any of your time off during this time. And if your time off dips below zero (And they take an entire hour if your more than 5 minutes late) you are fired on the spot. They have unrealistic standards for their employees to work like machine slaves. It's awful. Also, this year in particular we were promised a nice VCP, which is extra pay incentive to be at work on time, and we were never paid it. You are treated like a number. They do not work with you, they do not care about your personal life, they would rather fire you and hire 10 replacements than work with your personal life. Richest man in the world owns this company but they can't fix our equipment or pay us a decent salary."
bad,"Once you get hired at Amazon, every day after day one, the company is looking for a reason to fire you. I have been working at Amazon for 2 and a half years, and I have watched several thousand people come and go. The turnover ratio is out of this world. People don't get an opportunity to advance within the company unless the have a college degree or are an army veteran."
bad,Amazon is the kind of job that wants you to show up and work long hours with no change in what your doing. It is a boring job and one I never looked forward to showing up to. Thank God it was only seasonal work.
bad,"I did not enjoy working at Amazon for several reasons such as the work environment and how the management treated their staff. A typical day would be to unwrap items, and wrap items ready for them to be delivered. Also scan items off a conveyor belt and put them into a cage. The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy items consistently through the night. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new skills as because it was a big workplace there were several different things to learn each day."
bad,"Benefits are fantastic!  Pay for what you are expected to do is to low.  Negative, punitive atmosphere.  This is a physically challenging job for all ages.  Employees are constantly pushed to do more even if they are meeting job, quality guidelines.  No job performance is ever good enough."
bad,"Working at Amazon is not easy. It is very cutthroat, very competitive, not really friendly. The only positive is the pay. There are warnings but most people ignore them. But you have been warned."
bad,Management was horrible. They did not care about you as a person but they cared most about what you can do for them as far as labor wise. Management could've been alot better.
bad,"Lack of communication, poor management. They work you really hard fast pace. People really don't get a long do to the stress and confusion. I would not ever return to Amazon."
bad,"I applied for this job because so many people had bad things to say so I wanted to see for myself. The process took 2 months for me to get hired. I began a month prior to peak season, learned to drive a forklift on my third day, and became more inshape. But I decided to quit after peak season killed me. The rumors are true."
bad,Long hours able to enjoy interaction with associates no leadership and positive training for my position had to self train and navigate through programs that were not taught by learning
bad,They treat you badly after you get injured.  Value their favorite employees. Some diverse groups are favored over others. Fire people through email. Do not value your efforts and worry about getting their numbers or rates.
bad,"A typical day at work was fast paced & rate expectations daily"
bad,"When working here your job is constantly threatened against you, you go into your day not knowing what role they will give you. I never met a single person in my workplace that enjoyed the job. I would strongly advise not working for this awful company."
bad,Constant harrassment by managers wether you meet their quota or not. O PUBLIC RELATIONS by managers. they do not care if you have a physical disability and if you tell them you have a physical disability they do everything to make you quit or fire you for not meeting there quota.
bad,"promote outsiders, every week you have a new manager, rules change daily. You train your mgr. Managers cant do what they expect you to do in 10 hours."
bad,"I have worked at Amazon for 3 years and while i have worked there i have received 5 months paid maternity leave and a lot of other great benefits but because of that they work you into the ground. The management think that they are better then you and know more because they have a fancy degree. The only way to move up is if you have a degree or have military training.  Our building started writing people up for being off your station for more then 10 minute  in a 10 hour work day, there where people going to the bathroom and getting wrote up!! So if you need a job most Amazon warehouses will hire you on the spot and like i said the benefits are great but just beware the job is very harsh and mind numbing, there is only so long you can stand in one spot for a 10 hour work day doing the something over and over again. It is very repetitive."
bad,"Would not recommend this assignment as the culture is very anti-temp and the management is very quick to release associates immediately after the peak season. The temps are often looked at as lesser employees and are expected to meet unrealistic numbers with regards to production. the onsite Amazon staff were critical of temp employees and where injuries were involved, the temps were encouraged not to report work related injuries."
bad,It’s stressful and I didn’t feel appreciated for my work at all. I have gave it my all when I worked there and I loved the pay because it was good for night shift. I hate the security there because they are all mental and immature. They should be professional at their job and not socializing and judging others. I don’t like the supervisor’s fake smiles and managers “positive” fake attitude. They will tell you to keep your rates high constantly and you can basically get written up for almost any little error made.
bad,"Very disorganized. Very political and cronyism is rampant. People promote their buddies, whether they are qualified or not (and most aren't). Facts are not welcome when it comes to promoting people or correcting their mistakes. Hours and workload are relentless and never improve. Many useless projects that have no value. Everyone is so overworked and stressed that nobody remembers stuff and you spend your time repeating the same information and reinventing the wheel and spinning your wheels trying to get things DONE. Many silos and so much turnover that there is no institutional memory or continuity, nobody knows who did what or why and the pat answer is ""It's on the Wiki."" (Which it may or may not be, but 90% chance it's outdated and the person has left the company.) The top brass does not care about employees or turnover, or they'd do something about both."
bad,"I didn't work there all to long. but when I did it was very busy, fast paced, and long shifts. 10 hours days and all day long on your feet. couldn't get off your feet to even go to the bathroom unless you are on a break"
bad,"It’s ok to work there, you will get fired unexpectedly if You have a collective 2hours of t.o.t but other than that it’s a ok place to work..........."
bad,"You started work in a fast pace"
bad,Amazon is a good place to work but it is very stressful trying to meet deadlines. Most of the time you are never given an opportunity to fulfill that deadline.
bad,"Most days, there would be too many employees for others to work the positions they were hired for. Management did a poor job of creating work for everyone to do."
bad,The job sucks it’s for kids not an adult trying to make ends meet I would not even consider it the goals are impossible so stay away from this job it sucks
bad,"I have one thing to say about Amazon. They set you up to fail. There's no way that a employ can work up to their standards unless you are well liked. they have their favorites. Work your but off, they don't like you. Sluff off, they like you."
bad,too many people there act like there still in high school and they have very poor management there and very lazy HR team there too. It's a stressful places to work and you get treated unfair.
bad,A month and a half of employment i and a bunch of co workers were told we were trained wrong and needed to be retrained. After about a week from being half behind retrained we lost our jobs. Nobody could answer any question you asked them but they were bosses.
bad,"It's amazing to me that such a disorganized, overworked workforce can deliver customer service the way it does. My entire team was miserable and people started looking for new jobs as soon as they realized what they'd gotten themselves into. The pay looks appealing but it's definitely not worth the hours and stress built into Amazon's culture."
bad,"Amazon is a stressful job full of favoritism and less pay, The job is racially biased and the hardest part of job is dealing with mangers that are not willing to give you the opportunity to move up into the corporate world."
bad,It was awesome the people there awesome however when i was injured it was a pain to come back. Hr was no help i played phone tag with who i was supposed to talk to.
bad,Toxic work culture.  Poor leadership (can only speak for my FC) and poor treatment of employees. Huge amount of favoritism and poor hiring practices. More leadership training is needed for incoming management
bad,You get horrible training so called managers don't do anything they tell you to rely on each other to get through difficult calls you can't transfer calls to management they make you tell the customer or driver we don't have a supervisor and they are right we don't they pay you low wages but yet try and pile on extra work steer clear
bad,"Started off as a laid back and fun culture, after 3 months ran like a call center. Stressful , no one ever comes through with promises made to employees, all promises made and began were stopped and fell though. I do not think the higher up understand and see how FBA corporate is ran so different than AWS. Wouldnt recommend to anyone and although department new to Dallas Texas, moral and productivity is down."
bad,"Worst place I've ever worked, run by people who have no idea how to manage people. Hiring process is poor, high employee turnover rate, 20% of the people do 80% of the work, extreme partiality, management doesn't hold associates accountable,too many work stations are without working equipment.. Aside from that, it's very hard on your body if you've never done this type of work before."
bad,Amazon is a fast paced warehouse. Everyone is always worried about getting written up because their rate is not met but if you are good friends with the AM or PA you get special treatment. Management sleeps around with the associates.
bad,The Company Supervisers are low class trash. The company practices favoritism and does not appreciate anything you do. The wages are good but in the long run it is not worth it
bad,"The management was inept and incompetent and inexperienced, often times our responsibilities were unclear. There was constant overhiring and despite being told when hired we would never be sent home almost immediately after hire people started being sent home for no work"
bad,I do not recommend working at the oak 4 facility the management is terrible they treat their associates as numbers not people if you don't make the right numbers you are fired. They play favorites so if you are wanting to move up in the company you have to know the right people.
bad,"Wow, where to start.  Was employed @ LEX2 for several years.  Let's start with the CONS - No raise for 5 years, multiple shift schedule changes, constant rotation of fly by night managers to the point of being unclear of whom to report to.  Sometimes less than a 48 hour notice for being off on holidays.  Write ups for restroom breaks lasting longer than 6 minutes, quality and productivity expectations that leadership couldn't achieve. Horrible communication, building wide. If you enjoy being treated like a number or a machine instead of a human being, cold sweats on Monday mornings, nausea in the parking lot, this place is for you!"
bad,"High security inside the Amazon facility; however, no security in the parking area.  Security unwilling, or unable, to assist in highly violent situation."
bad,"Amazon is a hard place to work, Very strict, to many favorites, Bad management, I shouldn't say bad , They just don't care. Good management is important for any company, You have to treat your employee's decent, You will get the same respect back. And a great day's work. I see so many good workers get treated badly Just not right."
bad,"Your promotion is not based on the work you do. Fun is strictly based on your team. No proper management. "
bad,"Amazon is a great company for customers but not for employees (and particularly for managers).  The work/life balance is almost non-existent and senior managers have been promoted so quickly that they are process smart/leadership poor.  Overtime is a regular occurrence and managers are expected to be in the office for 12-15 hours/day.  If you like ""whack a mole"" leadership challenges, this is a job for you."
bad,"If you're someone who wants an entry-level high paying job even if it means your job will be your life then this is the place for you. I also recommend working here if you don't want to sit at a desk all day,"
bad,Always on your back to be faster..takes to long to get to break than you have to run back to your station.. terrible environment never enough..come home dead..
bad,Cutthroat... Robotics always failed waited 30 +mins waiting for repairs long walks for breaks lunches demanding demanding not properly trained constant retraining instead of proper training the first time
bad,"Terrible hours, terrible shifts, managers are kinda pushy, benefits decent, pay decent, feet ache, ridiculous expectations of employees (i.e. hourly rate)"
bad,"seems like the logic behind amazon's job force it to train, write them up and trap in a function, replace with new people to be retrained and continue the cycle. to summarize amazon is one of the largest corporations on the planet, but they do not have funding for common sense"
bad,"the management is rude and not accommodating, not willing to assist in personal emergencies, mandatory over time is extremely stressful working 6 days a week 10 hours a day"
bad,"There are far too many negative things about working here to sit here and list, I could be here for hours typing this out so I'll make it as short as possible"
bad,"stressful, hostile, unorganized at times. its a hard olace to work and you always have to watch your back due to people who cause problems all around or drug use being snuck in"
bad,Not a company to work for as they set unrealistic delivery package amounts in only a few hours and there is no care or good support systems. They over pack your vehicle with no concern and can be hard to get shifts at times.
bad,"The benefits are good along with time off because it's about intolerable to work there. The only way people meet their numbers is by ""stealing"" others' work. Like taking a bin of 30 items to scan it and pack it and go. It takes forever to walk across the building so good luck for lunches and breaks because you'll never make it in time. You have to be a robot to complete your daily tasks."
bad,"Not family oriented. Long work hours leaves no time for family, especially if you get the over night shift. Stressful and unorganized management. Orientation was an unorganized mess, leaving trainees sich as myself standing around for at least half an hour at a time not sure where to go or what the trainer was doing."
bad,"Difficult environment, I do not recommend working in the Fulfillment centers. The people are difficult and management is not the best. Work is not standardized across all buildings."
bad,This would be something that I would suggest that kid needing a job for summer or Christmas break. I would also tell someone that needed something between jobs.
bad,"I would not recommend anyone that wants to move up in the rank as far as a day is concerned. This place is vile and I would not recommend that anyone work here as the management is unorganized and the hours are very strenuous to someone who isn't use to the schedule. The job benefits are the only ""saving grace"", but quickly can  become overshadowed by the poor decision making of the team leaders and ambassadors currently employed at this facility. Work here only as a means to end. Not for a means of production."
bad,"It is a growing company with a lot of flaws. I hope they improve the work environment for the sake of the workers, It Is A Sweat Shop! Breaks are short and grace periods are even shorter. Mostly everyone is Part Time only."
bad,"I was responsible for only the hardware end of keeping the data center running.  It was very limited and boring compared to other places I worked.  I could bust my butt giving 110% and they would praise the guy who merely made the metrics look better than mine by cheating the system.  Even after I pointed it out nothing was done.  My experience soured after that.  I kept to just my work and stopped over achieving and they eventually took away the one thing keeping there, the schedule."
bad,"The benefits package is the only positive aspect to working at Amazon. The CHA1 facility suffers from incompetent management and is prone to promote only those within their social structure. Following EEOC guidelines are evidently not applicable at this location as employment advancement opportunities for well qualified, older individuals with proven track records are consistently passed over for new hires and recent graduates with half the education and experience."
bad,"Only good thing is the benefits, the managers talk negative about everyone and they are always on their phones and not helping their employees put to hit their rates"
bad,working at amazon for 2 years you learn the importance of why you should get in a trade or go to school to pursue a career. Amazon is filled with people who never accomplished anything in life. Management treats you like a slave but also management gets treated like a slave by their higher ups. Brain dead work and a place where they try to treat you like a slave and a kid like good job have a hand five. If your looking for a job and cant get hired anywhere just go to amazon because all the people who cant get hired anywhere go here so just imagine working here.
bad,Tough job. Great only if you want to lose weight and get in shape. Organization is minimum at best. Training is minimum. Expectations high but not enough training to help with those expectations.
bad,"to work for amazon is like slavery you get worked down to the bone get pushed around and treated like dirt hardly any internal promotions unless your teir 3, and the better you work the harder they work you and when you exceed that they work you harder until your nothing but an empty shell of a man or woman"
bad,"the security harrasses you, the managers try to write you up for very little petty things that are not even listed in the rulebook. no A/C or heat. H.R. is bad at communication."
bad,I used to work overnight and while I was there it was a very stressful place. The job could be fast paced or slow depending on the position. I say overall was a terrible experience.
bad,"Amazon is an ok place to work at, they have very strict policies when it comes to your attendance and rate. They have great benefits, discounts through Amazon"
bad,They investor much money on PR to attract employees for them to treat them like machines and harass them like their health does not matter. Push you to over the limits and them demands more. When something happen to the employee they dismissed them.
bad,"Very hard physical work and the hard workers are worked very hard while those who are in favor are not held to the same standard."
bad,"It is very fast passed, I would come home exhausted,I was too tired to do anything else.On day off all I wanted to do is sleep and rest.I felt like robot.The speed they want you to keep is way to fast .It is very hard to keep that pace.There is pressure to keep  fast pace and if you cant they write you up and then fired you.You are always afraid your going to loose your job."
bad,Great benefits pay is okay. However the job was the worst. It was a constant battle of trying not to break down from the terrible management to the ridiculous customers.
bad,no job security. easy work depending on what department you work in. long hours. when not on overtime you will work four days and have three off. breaks could be longer.
bad,Amazon was not organized and management had no clue what they were doing. The job was easy as long as managers weren't coming up to you every 5 seconds. I enjoyed unloading the truck with the fork lift and the employees on my shift were fun to be arounf except for a few Tier 3 supervisors.
bad,"You can't use the restroom they want you picking all day long I'm sorry but I at some point will have to go use the restroom. They are too, too strict they have one too many rules. But the other departments can stand around and talk all day, and the stowers stop the pickers from working. I am so sorry I applied here. The warehouse is a mess, they feed this lie that we clean up our area but that is a lie.I told someone that something spilled on the floor and nobody came to solve the problem"
bad,don't ever work for amazon ... the managers have favorites .. the work makes you wanna kill your self.. they expect to much of you... you wake up everyday hating your job and hating your life because of this horrible place... you work 10 hours.... no one cares about you... the coworkers act like it is highschool... just don't do it
bad,"They are gross . I can never eat McDonalds ever again. The food is gross , when you make it , it still looks gross. I know I am scared for life and hated that I went home smiling like French fries all the time."
bad,"Does not care for any of their employees. Only numbers matter!!!! Your job security is on the line from a week to week basis, if you do not meet the standards; you will be walked out the door."
bad,Hated the managers they want you fired quickly didnt make it even a month i dont know how you can get a write up your first three days i thought it was ridiculous rate is outragous!!!
bad,Management is the worst they will not help you out they rather see you fail and get you fired so they can hire new workers... Never will apply for this company again
bad,"Horrible place to work, especially if you are looking for a stable place to work.  Its like a revolving door there as far as an employee there.  Would not recommend this place to work."
bad,"i would not recommend anyone to work here unless you dont have a life & you like being mistreated . this company is very poorly managed its a monkey warehouse . There is no type of advancement .The best part of working here is that you get trained on all forklift equipment for FREE however you only get training for 30 minutes then they throw you out there . Management does not care about their associates what so ever , they tell you lies & give you cold pizza for appreciation  . This company keeps you away from your family . They have unnecessary overtime they do mandatory overtime with no work to do ."
bad,fun but the staff treat you like slaves there way ofd working was horrible constamtly on your back any mistakes made by somone else was put on you ect
bad,"Managers care more about there bonuses then the employees. They are constantly setting up their employees to fail. The employees are forced to come into work even when the town they live in is  in a state of emergency weather wise (they make use your time if you want to stay home however they do not give you a reasonable amount of time). Employees are consistently overworked and treated poorly by bosses, they take the approach that if you want to leave good we will just hire a replacement."
bad,"Other employees do not comply with  supervisor's instructions and supervisors do not enforce the instructions, Many employees walk away from their work stations without permission. Employer demands that employees take unpaid time off when production is slow or maintenance is being done to the building."
bad,I wouldn't refer anybody to work for amazon there benefits are amazing but the way they treat there people is horrible. A typical day at Amazon is nothing but hardcore work if you're a picker. You have to pick items and go up and down stairs within a certain time and if you don't its going to be consequences.
bad,"constrictive , stupid rules , boring work  environment ,  I would stand in one spot for 12 hours .  Nobody ever  talked because everyone had to be at such a fast pace and doing the work at such a constant rate"
bad,Does not do enough except the benefits which are the best thing this company has to offer. other then that noooooo I would not recommend for anyone. Just my thought.
bad,"once inside, you are not treated as human being. You are NUMBER."
bad,"The pay is not enough.The Benefits are good.Have to.do silly exercises in the meetings.Must make their goal or your gone.the job is boring time drags on.the so called leaders are disrespectful.favoritism at its finest level.rude coworkers.terrible training.will hire anybody no interveiw,if you can pass drug test and background you got the job.there is a reason there is always a crowd of people at the door waiting for orientation because alot of people are let go or quit to find something better, always more newhires then workers that been there a while.....whats that tell you"
bad,Rude management and company doesn't care about others. 10 hour shifts 4 days a week. You use your time for emergencies. Management treated others like they were kids and not adults. I will never recommend them to anyone to work there.
bad,Amazon was not a nice place to work. Their demands we're unrealistic if you where a stower you had to keep a constant rate of 250 pieces per hour this rate was possible if you had a box of a lot of little idums but if you had larger idums to put into the stowing bins this number was almost impossible to uptain on a consistent basis. And another thing that was bad was the employee morale. It sucked.
bad,"I worked in the legal department for about a year. More emphasis is put on appearing stressed than on actually completing your work on time. Very hostile environment towards both introverts and people with mental illnesses. Little formal professional development training, so your experience is often dictated by the quality of your manager. Unfortunately, the majority of employees do not stay more than a year, so most managers are inexperienced. The company encourages an unsustainable culture of stress, and a good percentage of employees take a leave of absence for mental health reasons. I, for example, was hospitalized for stress after working nine days straight."
bad,It was fun you always have something to do when you come to work it's never a slow day.... You a rated on speed so you have to work really hard to meet the rate
bad,"Free work culture but management is extremely biased and doesn't are about the employees."
bad,"Horrible HR management. These kids are young and uneducated. The job isn't hard and making rate is fairly easy. Standing, walking on concrete is very hard on the feet. I would never shop or work for Amazon again. Tips: do your job and stay far away from anyone in HR. Them kids are useless."
bad,"Tedious, boring, dull, uninteresting, unexciting, wearisome, tiresome, repetitive, repetitious.."
bad,Don't give false hope & promise of promotion after giving a raise to turn around & fire people. They tell you to work hard & they will promote you. Promote you out the door!
bad,"There is nothing but drama, drama, drama, backstabbing at this place i mean you have a CEO who is the 3rd richest man in the united states and we work for pennies! Ive been employed almost 5 years and just this week got a 75 cent raise so i make 13.75, but new employees starting are making 11.50 to 12.00 and they just started, does anyone see a problem with that? We have a very big turn over especially MANAGEMENT most of the are kids and dont have a clue! AMAZON cares about its customers, but as far as its employees they dont care how much time we are away from our familes, terrible attendance policy, try to limit our time to go on a BATHROOM BREAK! They claim they do so much for us, we work for everything we are entitled to like our stocks we are given but we have to pay the taxes on them, so basically we are paying for them twice we have to work for them then pay the taxes on them. Our HR department is a joke they are not nice and hateful! You ask a ? And you will get 20 different answers, or i dont know i will have to get back to you ( weeks later)"
bad,No loyalty of company .told I never make it permanent because I have disabled wife and needed time off actually told by one boss why couldn't my disabled wife get to a hospital appointment  by her self .after 4 yrs of working there as temp found out was being laid by a colleague. Management to gutless to tell me .laid of because they decided out of the blue no temp could be there longer than nine months. No matter that I was in the top 5 per cent of the best pickers in the company for the last 3 mounths .found it very odd that people who were not British would be made perm in the first few mounths of being there .i can prove everything I said here
bad,"The trainers are disrespectful trailer trash,  they belittle you, call names, yell at you when you're 17 seconds late and you've had to climb three flights of stairs. This company treats employees like robots not humane in any way, shape or form. Do not work here unless you like kicking dogs/ being kicked like a dog. It's not worth the money being treated like garbage especially by the garbage running the facilities! They are miserable and very two faced."
bad,"If you really really need a job its an easy quick start. This is typically a job for somebody young and in school the hours are good and its a very active job. I have 9 year experience in this field knew everything about the jobs and working environment. This place does not care about there employees what so ever I lasted 2 months before I did not meet there 100% production rate and was terminated. Your picks are random, you have no control of your pick paths, no matter how fast your pace you cannot make the rate if whats generated from your scan gun is spread out in far locations from each other. I have a great work ethic and Im not somebody that sits around and chit chats with others. My last day I was at 93% which was SERIOUSLY you don't stop moving at all. Doesn't matter to management if you don't  cut 100% in the 6 week learning curve your gone they don't care what, why, how come, anything you have to say. You will never see your supervisor less your have time off task or your rate is low yet they want you to think they care. Break are 10 mins the other 5 is considered walk to and from breaks, and its a pretty big place. If you do take this job I HIGHLY recommend comfy shoes your feet will hurt I promise you."
bad,"Company is designed for young, single adults.  Majority of turnover comes from immaturity issues surrounding youth hires.  Veterans with experience have to work within teams in inexperience and are held accountable for their lack of performance.  Simply put...21 year olds out of college should not be managers."
bad,"The pay is not work it! This place will beat you up physically and mentally. The management is horrible. If they're not chasing/looking for a boyfriend/girlfriend, they're standing around or disappear into the stairwell to use their cell phones. I met some good people there but its mostly dog eat dog to get the better job assignments where you're not trapped at a station for 10 hours."
bad,"Amazon is an okay company, but they pick favoritism A LOT. They don't care about their workers. All they care about is making sure you hit your numbers (the one box a minute expectation). If you get hurt on the job they think Bio-Freeze is the cure for everything. There is very little windows of opportunity to advance and there is absolutely NO communication. It's very physically demanding and strenuous on your body doing the same thing over and over again for 10 hours straight (sometimes 11 hours). If I had known how horrible they treat everyone I would never have applied there in the first place. Everyone always talks about looking for ways to get out."
bad,Too much favorites too much overtime hard to balance life and work I don't wanna keep talking about this company. These are the only nice things I can say.
bad,This company  is ok to wrk just part time i wish  that the shifts were longer. The management  teams is sucks and they treat u badd
bad,"If you're not a young person who has just entered the workforce you will HATE this job. Anybody who has had a decent job before will clearly see that Amazon is a disgustingly terrible place to work. Management is awful. Amazon brings in new managers every 6 months or so, none of which are over the age of about 25 so you could imagine how thing are ran. HR also consists of teenagers who also have inconsistent answers. "
bad,"Co-workers were great people but the management was terrible. The managers never communicated with associates about department changes which caused confusion. The most important thing I learned about this job is that, its not all about the pay but its about being happy and loving the job or career I am pursuing."
bad,If management does not like what I write then I will get fire. This has happen to people at work already. Most people there are nice and you learn to laugh about the things that happen. The turn over rate is very high
bad,"a glim and depressing place that only was a blessing to get out of, walking for 10 hours in hard unsolid boots with 3 breaks that you could have to walk a football field to the canteen during the break, having to walk all over when picking items that wasn't organised in order. only thing I enjoyed was talking to other workers and leaving the place."
bad,"Amazon gives a new meaning to ""fast paced environment"".  If you cannot keep up or are even 1% off of meeting quota, you will hear about it from your managers and be written up, three of these and you're fired.  This is by far the most stressful job I've ever had. The managers care more about the numbers than they do you or your well being.  Had to make many reports to HR.  They do not follow safety guidelines and in my opinion it is a dangerous place to work.  The only thing this place has going for them is their benefits.  So if that's all you need, but want to be completely miserable at your job then it's for you."
bad,"Poor unorganized management.  Very hostile and unsafe work environment.  Do not have the employees  health  or well being in mind when making any decisions. Most Co workers are not friendly and sometimes just down right hostile also.  "
bad,"No job security, expectations are no where near realistic. Unfair treatment of employees. Favoritism. Long days, no chance to breathe. Short breaks."
bad,"Most enjoyable, always doing something different. And working day shift. Too much turnover, Hopefully people will just be more than a body or number. Realize how the company treats people. Instead of telling them your not needed anymore, the badge doesn't work when they come in and go through the turnstile. Security has to tell the employee that there not needed anymore instead of management the day before. It's really SAD how the company treats people."
bad,they did not live up to my expectations I had to go elsewhere to continue my education I don't want to say more obvious not happy
bad,I felt like I wasn't good enough and they wanted more each and every day. It was ridiculous and they have a 100% quality assurance  which is very very hard and they harass you every few days to week with stats and telling you to be faster.
bad,"Besides the long hours, the culture is very poor. The only thing that matter is the numbers not the people. I won't recommend no anyone who has a little of respect for a human being to work in this place. The management most likely are people just graduated from University or MBA Programs, they are smart but unfortunately most of them doesnt have people skills, no experience at all developing people. They have a lot of technology, but unfortunately most of the reports are unaccurate. It was a very sad experience for me to discover what it is behind this great company."
bad,"I personally feel there are better companies to work for. I was put on night shift and promised I could change to day shift after 4 weeks. After 4 long weeks of no sleeping and eating and working long hours, I applied for day shift. Amazon advised I would need a doctors note as well as seeing one of their doctors. After bother doctors advised my body couldn't handle night shift, they put me on the day shift for a couple of days. I received a call advising I need to go back to working nights or I would be paid off."
bad,"ho lavorato in amazon per 14 mesi in totale, per l'amor di dio in tempo di crisi qualsiasi  lavoro va bene. "
bad,Integrity doesn't care about you never go thru them they hire all these ppl just to end up firing them because there's no work coming in if you're s stower
bad,"The salary at Amazon was amazing however the incredible long hours and the Culture is horrendous. I was an operations manager but had 0 power to influence change. This is exact opposite from what Amazon touts as a trait they like to see in employees. I was a mindless robot who was forced to be a yes man. The only manager who survive here are the ones with a short resume and have fear to find another job. The top level (site) managers are experienced but have a fear that someone will take their job so the overcompensate by being harsh and unhelpful. "
bad,"This is by far the worst company ever to work for. I don't even know where to start. Management and the HR team are unorganized and have no professionalism. Management don't lead by example. All they do is walk around with their laptops watch the numbers and find something to complain about. AMAZON DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR EMPLOYEES. Everything that the company stands for is very unethical. The morale of the company is a complete joke. I worked at the site for 3 years and in March 2015 I was really sick with the flu but I didn't have the time to take off. So instead of them being compassionate & caring enough to let me go home HR tells me I can't go home because we had mandatory ot thst week. HR advises me to file medical leave. Not to mention they wrote me up for being ""time off task"" because I was sick. So I filed and I missed only two days including my mandatory day. 6 months later they tell me that it was denied & my UPT was in the hold by 40 hours. So they separate my employment only to tell me I can come back to the hiring event today which defeats the purpose of firing me altogether. Their practices are very confusing and contradicting and I can't believe the people thst work there accept it & settle for it. Whenever your company is negatively exposed on big media outlets such as CNN & FOX NEWS it's a huge problem. Not to mention the CEO & founder Jeff Bezos said he wouldn't work at a fulfillment site if he knew the problems that existed. The company overall is atrocious & I'd rather have my peace of mind & wrk somewhere else that's more organized instead of working"
bad,i will never work amazon again. management is the worst they play on their computers or chasing young girls around than doing thier job
bad,"I worked in Amazon as support to B2B customers. "
bad,"a typical work day can be from building stuft to throwing away stuft ,but you have to follow the managers tasks every group is giving individual tasks to complete so that way every group has different assignments to do i learned very little from hear because the agency i worked for had me on a ""only need you to work when i need you'' the co-workers were hard working and cool management were good people  the hardest part of the job was the job itslef manual labor if thats your cup of tea, i did it only because i had to do it,"
bad,"Constantly changing schedules. Looking down on employees treating you were like a 5 year child especially when are a grown adult. Management had there favorites. High turn over rate constantly firing people. Not a good place to work. Check out the company before you sign any paperwork job isn't worth the time !!"
bad,"managment demanded unrealistic expectations, displayed rampent favoritism, and a childish and disrespectful attitude towords reliable hard-working employees"
bad,was a ok place 10 hour days four days a week never met my supervisor. probably walked 20 miles a day.pay was ok job was not for me though.
bad,for non-management personnel work is hard on the body. Management knows this and avoids people who expose this or complains
bad,"LMA - Last Mile by Amazon is a very young part of the Amazon business and is trying to take over the rest of the courier networks but keep making mistakes, Instead of diving deep into the errors and take the learning from them they just keep throwing different procedures into them, across the whole network, they have no respect for there delivery drivers expecting them to work unto 14 hrs a day and if they didnt they would sack them on the spot. they do this because they know they can as they do not work for them directly."
bad,"Meet at standup, then go to mezzanine to work, 15 break from the time you scan one item until the next and after you walk to the restroom or break room your 15 mins is up because of the long distance you have to walk, then back to mezzanine to work then a lunch break, after lunch meet back at standup, then back to work, the last break is determined by when your supervisor decides the next 15 minute break is going to be."
bad,Favoritism. If you have a degree it does you no good here. They prefer uneducated and low skill workers with no experince. Area managers are lazy they just sit checking their fb status. Good starting pay. NO room for advancement
bad,I started thinking I was hired for days.  3 days before starting I was notified I would be on the night shift and only at $13.00 per hour instead of the $18.00 I had agreed to.  I had no training on their structure and only had seen my manager twice in 7 months.  I was let go because I complained about security taking 30 minutes or longer to get us screened and out the door which happened after you have punched out. Day shift got all the perks and night shift got nothing but a tremendous amount of work to be done alone. 
bad,"trabalhar diretamente com todos funcionários da empresa é muito complicado e ao mesmo tempo muito valioso,aprender como lidar com pessoas diferentes é um aprendizado contínuo..."
bad,"This job was a flop. Worked you hard and took you for granted. Breaks were short for how hard you work. Points systems, they pointed you for everything."
bad,"when you get hired they say you're a worker, and individual. no one knows your name there, you are a number, a droid set to do work. don't do that work fast enough or happen to miss a day for an emergency or being sick. you're fired."
bad,"My experience at Amazon was terrible. They hire anyone and everyone. People are just numbers and you are on a point system. Hr. does not have a direct line. I only applied because I needed a job to work around my school schedule. The hours are decent and easy 4 hr shifts but the workload is intense. You slave away for those 4 hrs lifting and turning. It is a high risk for health. Eventually, your back and muscles hurt for lifting all day. All that for a quick buck. It was not worth being there."
bad,Not a secure job. Pay was good however management could be very rude and not professional at all. Wouldn’t recommend..................................
bad,They push you to meet impossible standards for older workers. The managers are deplorable and favoritism has no place in any workplace. But only the strong and administration suck ups survive
bad,"The worse place to work for , you never do enough , you constantly lifting heavy boxes,you suppose to scan 240 boxes per hour or else you get a write up and the next write up will be terminations . Even at time when it’s slow not much to scan they expect you to scan at the same speeds or you can get in trouble. You have no time to go to the bathroom because the scanner provides your whereabouts and if you’re Not scanning for long  they’ll take points off you and you will not be pay for that time . The managers play favoritism a lot and they’re also very harsh on employees. It’s not for everyone its a place that can trigger depression."
bad,"They have a high turnover rate. Along with the fact that 90% of them come  through temp agencies. It's called ""economic logistics"" they want a high turnover rate and use people through temp agencies for cheap labor without insurance benefits. If you want a permanent longterm job position Amazon is not for you."
bad,"Amazon assign delivery routes with 150 stops to be finish in 8 hours, that's mean you have to deliver 1 package each 3 minutes which is imposible. They gave me just two days a week of work."
bad,"I was employed as a seasonal employee for Amazon.com at the Keller area warehouse near the Fort Worth Freight airport. The working environment was intense and challenging. I had adversity while working there it however was very good experience nevertheless. I feel I have grown from working there, now I'm a stronger professional with more experience and knowledge that should easily transition to my next employment opportunity."
bad,"Words cannot begin to describe how awful it was working for Amazon. Not only was I injured, but they have the worst site HR management team I've ever seen. I was told that, because I worked in a certain department, I wasn't allowed to have accommodations, but others in another department could. Last I checked, that was illegal given it falls under workplace discrimination in my state."
bad,10 hour days with few breaks constantly lifting heavy objects on your feet all day is extremely exhausting and unsustainable. Dealing with nerve issues now thanks to the job. The pay was good but it wasn’t worth the constant pain. Also you really weren’t allowed to socialize at all so it was extremely isolated.
bad,"It was not that bad and not good ethir but I got good experience with them had a lot of fun with some mangers and the have a racist attitude, I worked really hard but my hand tried to do more"
bad,I worked here for 6yrs and I should've left a lot sooner than I did. Being terminated from Amazon was a blessing because I never would've left on my own
bad,"Management is all over the place, EVERY policy put in place is for the betterment of the company rather it's employees. System built around employees never having support, understanding and always lose ."
bad,I really didn’t like how they made us work like robots they made sure that if you were off task in any way shape or form that you got wrote up.. it didn’t matter how or what the reason was
bad,If you want to work for Amazon you need to be willing to commit your life to them meaning over 15hr days 7 days a week. There is no balance at least in the operations side of the business.
bad,"All work, all the time. Calls and emails 24/7. Couldn’t get any rest and had no family time. I do not recommend a management position with this awful company. Worst experience of my career."
bad,"Started with a 3-month assignment as a temp working remotely from home. Contract was extended several times, and I ended up doing a job similar to data entry 40/hours/week for 11 months, attending virtual meetings and participating with a team working on a specific development project. I always scored high on company metrics and consistently received positive feedback from management. But per Amazon policy, after 11 months they have to hire you as a regular employee and pay you benefits if they want you to continue working. When the time came, I didn't get so much as a ""good bye"" or ""good luck."" They just cut my computer off from the system. I got up for work one morning and actually called their IT department thinking I was just experiencing an issue. Nope, you just don't work for us anymore. "
bad,"Everything is production and by the numbers. bathroom breaks can be held against you, People only work there because they pay $15/hr. which, is more than average. there is no formal interview, just pass the background check and go to work. The videos they present to are you are very deceptive of where you actually wind up working. During Peak season, you feel as if you will die working. I am desperately trying to escape."
bad,this place is ok they don't care about the workers all they care about is production as a building. i got hurt and they didn't even try to accommodate me with help after i got a doctors letter.
bad,"As a shopper it’s fast paced and laid back at times, plus u can make your own schedule. I would like more hours tho! Also I think as a shopper we should have 8 hour shifts not 4"
bad,"sub-companies that work for Amazon treat workers inadequately."
bad,"Grey setting with long hours and management only cares about numbers, not employee health or comfortability.  Would not reccomend to anyone who cannot deal with long hours of mind numbing labor."
bad,"You are expected to work like a robot and tracked every hour about your work. They expect you to work continuously like some robot . The work is not challenging at all mentally "
bad,"Arbeitsklima katastrophal!!! "
bad,Amazon no longer has this position. Third party companies now handle all deliveries. My job was eliminated while I was on medical leave. I was fired once I returned to work. I would not advise anyone to work for Amazon. The pay is good but if u don't get hired as a full-time employee your job can be eliminated anytime.
bad,"**RUN RUN RUN. NOW!** DONT EVEN think about it- "
bad,"I started working at Amazon during August 2017 up until February 2018 when I was let go for not being able to perform my “job duty”. I had been trained on Each Receiver (receiving boxes), unloading trucks, and Picking (scan small items into the warehouse). While working in each receive, I was slightly injured tearing a tendon in my left wrist and getting tendonitis in my right causing work to be very painful. After weeks of therapy the pain seemed to be getting worse, and after asking if I could switch to Picking, I was let go. I was so excited to work for Amazon, but after everything I went through, I don’t even buy from there. I definitely don’t recommend working for them. They’re jerks who only care about money"
bad,"I had a great interview on the phone and in person. Had five total interviews. Thought that process worked very well. Once I got to the fulfillment center, it was all down hill. Senior management only cares about results... not interested in how or how many people need to be exploited to get them... just deliver.  General Manager was toxic. He cursed incessantly and the HR team did nothing despite reports of his abuse. I had shoulder surgery and was told if I did not return quickly, my job was in jeopardy. I was supposed to get a six week convalescence. I got 11 days. Would recommend anyone that has any sense to avoid Amazon and look elsewhere."
bad,"They push you extremely hard. Pay & the drive wasn't worth it. Minimum 10 hr days. Most weeks were mandatory OT. Room for advancement, however, if you want to push people to the limit. You are in charge of your own PT and UPT, which is nice. Overall, didn't like how crazy hard they push you, even though I met the rates expected of me. I quit."
bad,"Majority of the upper management lacked the skills in order to handle issues with the handheld devices, routes, and delivery driver complaints."
bad,This is not a great job unless you like being micromanaged down to the second. Company has no concern for employees and how they are treated. In the warehouse you are assigned a work station that you are not to leave unless for breaks or lunches. its 10hrs standing in a 10x10 box where you are not allowed anything other than water. Stations are setup to insure you cannot be distracted by your coworkers as you face each others backs the entire shift. I have worked in fast paced places but this is over the top.
bad,Is not good to ask about what happen inside to Amazon. I think because i like to work witch people like famili i dont like there... Is not famili and time
bad,they expect you to work like a robot there are too many people management wise telling you too many different answers to the same question you would ask
bad,A very fast pace environment ... only the best survives over a year ... great seasonal job if that’s what you’re looking for... constantly moving environment
bad,"The work you do at Amazon is dehumanizing. You're informed by a scanner where to go and what you need to get for ten hours a day, with little to no time to converse with your co-workers. You might as well be a robot. The work itself is not particularly complicated, no matter where they end up putting you in the warehouse- but doing it for ten hours will really grind on you."
bad,"management and hours and expectations and injury handling and just no don't do it like the pay was good but not worth any of it. the breaks were hilarious. you couldn't go to the bathroom during your shift because you would be written up if you left your spot for ""Time off task"" you only got two ""15"" minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch. The breaks were literally told to us as ""5 minutes there 5 minutes break 5 minutes back"" because the break started at the bell not when you got to the break room. so it was a five minute break."
bad,"No good managers, not very care for employees, No outside life just amazon,very nice pay, no ta great work environment, not good staffing, unreasonable hours"
bad,Poor management culture and no work/life balance. There's a lot of emphasis placed on working hard but the company does not care about your work-life balance. They demand a lot of the managers and say they want a positive associate experience but they don't care about the managers at all. There is a culture of valuing the men and not valuing the women managers or people and there are a lot of
bad,Their warehouse style hiring does not help staff evaluate different levels of ability. New employees can not choose what job is better suited to them. If you are unable to fulfill the job they pigeon holed you into they let you go instead of trying to find a better fit. They pay lip service to training and retraining. They reward people who take shortcuts or don't follow the little training we got. They do provide health insurance at a low cost and it is provided from day 1 of your employment. I would not ever recommend anyone who is not very young and in peak physical condition to work here!
bad,"This job is very demanding, they think that because they practically hire anyone at $15/hr., they can make you work like a robot.  They always run out of protective gear and water , which they’re supposed to provide to keep you hydrated.  There’s a manager there that’s screaming all the time to associates lol.  She is so obnoxious.  They have little to no respect for employees, and treat you like a number, to meet theirs.   You have to do repetitive labor for entire shift .  You will be very beat.   If you’re lucky, you’ll be assigned one of the less physical labor duties, which are like three or four.  Become an ambassador to work less lol   So if you have to work here, good luck, and see for yourself!"
bad,"Management was poor, Amazon managers breathing down your neck unless you bent over backwards for them, enjoyed not having the boss with you all the time, hated the high workload and constant high expectations from everyone in the warehouse. Learned how to drive recklessly, load vans, and that Amazon is NOT the place to work if you value your physical and mental health."
bad,Wasn't quite the right environment or moral i needed to thrive They did not use every one to their full potential and did not care about where others had strong suits and lacked in other areas.
bad,"At Amazon there are so many opportunities to look for what you'd like to do. Ideally, if you are bored with or don't like your current job, you can transfer easily. However, the worst part that overrules all of this is the bad management team. The ones I encountered are mostly very brutal and subversive. They backstab, manage people out unfairly and do everything evil to keep their job safe.to keep"
bad,"I start at 29.2019 September finish on 15.2019  October at Amazon for the first week and I was I had illnesses which I was vomiting all over and I was absent for  9 Hours of trying to recover and because although I did try to do some work in between while I was being vomiting  I was on probation for three months and according to Amazon if you are absent three times there will finished you because you are ill however in my documents it's says six times there will finish you if you have a illnesses don't apply for a job working for "
bad,"Amazon is very  critical about upt . God forbidden u get sick and run out of time . The just fire u no question, as of the environment very unkept the building as poor ventilation. So if u suffer for allergy good luck. Beside it being fast paced. The job expectation is crazy!!!! You work like and A robot. There’s a lot favoritisms also. When it’s come certain culture. Another thing the manager have poor saftey protocol..."
bad,"3 years of (bleep) all I can say is run now or don’t do it. I likened it to modern day slavery, you will kill yourself working here and I nearly did. If I didn’t have a family I would’ve left after 3 days shoot!"
bad,A typical day consist of 100+ task that can consume about 10-12 hours per day and expect to work 7 days a week. I have learned that it is very hard to have a work life balance because even one day off can set you behind in work equivalent to up to a week. Management is not the greatest as it is based off of placing bodies in positions versus actually knowing how to manage and be knowledgeable of the process in general. The hardest part of the job is knowing that it's ok to step away from the work and tend to your life. At this time there are no enjoyable parts of the job due to so many discrepancies that have presented themselves.
bad,"I lavoratori vengono trattati come schiavi, se non rispetti il loro ritmo lavorativo massacrante sei fuori."
bad,"The management team has a lot to do so they hard to find and talk to, everyone is nice unless you make a mistake, they run a tight ship but if you can hold on it's worth it"
bad,"Work life balance is close to none, but it depends on what team you get put on. No benefits as intern besides very high salary. Amazon is huge and still growing fast, management can get messy."
bad,Was there 6 years....the normal attrition time is about 2 to 3 years...I learned everything in the building...still no job security...its upper management governed by rate numbers and algorithms which trickle down to the associates......keep up or get fired...and no chance for unemployment...Slave Pit!!!
bad,Hired for one job but rated on how much extra I could cram into my day. Very stressful. Workaholics love this place but not those with a family. Very competitive dog eat dog environment.
bad,"It is a very stressful job, the policy of Amazone is "" Hire and produce the best"".They have a productivity roof that everybody should do or shall be terminated from work."
bad,"Management is terribly disrespectful to associates.  Very unsafe at times.  Cooling system does not work, very hot environment.  Constant excuses and hypocrisy from management/supervisors.  Revolving door of associates, average duration of employment less than a year.  Promotion opportunities exist for loud, bossy African-American females."
bad,"if work there you are part of a machine and can be replaced easily   Management just want you to produce your numbers,  They will not help you keep your job.  They will puts  favorites in easy jobs.  They rotate new floor managers a lot because of turn over."
bad,"the job was fantastic and had a great vibe until the head of HR was released due to unknown reasons. In the months that followed moral plummeted, internal issues were rampant and went unfixed. In the week that I was let go 9 other employees were terminated for reason dating back as far as 6 months prior."
bad,"HOU 2 Leadership is rude and disrespectful to their employees. They don't have respect, consideration, or compassion for a human being.  Their expectations are beyond obtainable provided that they've installed the Nike System that should allow totes only. However, the totes aren't always available which leaves boxes of various sizes.  We have to duck underneath a rack to pull the boxes closer to you for stowing.  This causes strain on your back and possibly hitting your head on the rack.  Meanwhile, you are expected to maintain a rate based on the new system.  Also, if you sustain an injury at work, then you're sent to AmCare (no licensed medical personnel) to evaluate you for 15mins.  They start a timer when you enter! HR doesn't know any laws as it relates to personnel issues.  The CEO needs to do an Undercover Boss and personally see how people are being treated. The only people that last are those that are benefiting from school, medical, or have bills to pay.  Otherwise, this isn't the best and comfortable place to work. If the hours were flexible, then productive will be much higher! Oh, you can't use the elevators unless it's a medical emergency...meanwhile management stay using it."
bad,"If Anazon calls you RUN! After a couple of yrs I was in the 15% in seniority. Amazon brings you on, they dont give raises, then they spit you out. Amazon wants your experience and gets rid of you. Amazon dangles stock to you hoping you will take it and tell you it's a hiring bonus - - once you are on board then they say it's your raise each year you are there. If you take Amazon's offer to come on board - - Good luck!"
bad,"Decent benefits, long hours, lack of communication by assistant management and supervisors. Clean bathrooms. HR is not very effective in problem solving."
bad,A typical day at amazon is the same as everyday a lot of hard working and standing on feet for a long period of time. Management comes and goes they aren’t so friendly.
bad,Don't work here. They lie to you. They try to fire you after a few years. I worked for three year just to forced guessed for six months and fired. Never work there..
bad,"1 day of training. Management are rude and very disrespectful. Management speaks to staff in a very condescending way.Ambassadors didn't know their place. Management expects you to know the job description without any training, than reprimand you for something that you were not taught. One of the worst places I have work  in my career. Amazon is too big of an organization to have too many unprofessionals running their establishment. I just can't believe that this company allows this foolishness to take place.I was told by another associate that this was the norm for their warehouse.Unacceptable on all levels."
bad,"I do not recommend working here at ANY level of employment. Unfair treatment, unfix-able issues that they are looking for you to fix. The working environment is horrible. In the beginning, everything is perfect! You're so happy to be working at the most talked about company. The benefits are great. When you're out of the training stage, they work you like a slave to meet productivity and production rates. Employees are overworked and operations managers train area managers to look past the employees HEALTH for better amazon results. I watched a woman pass out due to working conditions and having diabetes, all before the area manager i worked alongside wouldn't allow her to see the nurses (though they were closed during an OVERNIGHT shift), or get some orange juice (anything sugary) because it was out of the break times."
bad,"Just run! Horrible place to work HR is 99% trash and 1% is young lady that know how to do her job correctly. Hours trash, management extra trash. Don't waste your time with slave job that just gonna break you down at the end 10 hours for 4 days or 12 hour shift on peak week Stay away."
bad,Working there is extremely high pace. You have to work in seconds not minutes to get a task done.they are always firing people for little things even the human resources mistakes like with your pto time. Many are wrongly fired. And by all means don't take medical leave they will fire you when you come back.
bad,"Very poor management. Advancement was predicated on whom knew who,not by your performance. Amazon looks out for themselves, not the employees that make them millions of dollars."
bad,"Management(agency) mislead/lie a lot"
bad,With mandatory overtime days at 10 hours each and forced to work federal holidays (though you only get 8 hours pay for holidays) I wouldn't recommend Amazon to ANYONE!
bad,Very unprofessional staffing is rude no job stability the hardest part of the job  would be dealing shifty supervisors nothing was enjoyable it was either you getting messages to your scanner your not counting fast enough or too andons the kiva tech position was noce but then they hold it over your head
bad,It's a place to work for a check to get by. But favouritism is rampant. Promotions are rarely if at all from within. they say they promote from within first. But they bring in outside management. That doesn't know the equipment the software and lack people management skills.
bad,"For this to be a multi million dollar company they lack the management needed to truly be effective. There’s limited to no training, very disorganized and poor communication. Wouldn’t recommend unless it’s your only option."
bad,Very stressful they are always trying to write you up for productivity. Op break down all the time. Warehouse condition are bad . Management needs more training always lying .
bad,"It was no team, every man for them selves. The management was fake and rude. There was alot of drama and gossip. They will work you like a dog and then fire you if you didnt make rate. Also, it was very unorganized. But the pay and benefits were pretty good. Also it's a very diverse environment. I recommend that people don't work at the warehouses."
bad,I honestly try not to think too much about the time I spent at Amazon. It's a devastatingly depressing environment with exhausting expectations. Don't work here unless you have no other choice
bad,"They took stock options from everyone who isn't management. The time off is structured in a cool way. They pay for higher education after 1 year. Management will levy advancements against you to get you to work harder, then toss you to the birds when they realize you've seen through their charade."
bad,"Long hours, fast pace with penalty if your picking rate slows down, management arent the best most qualified, if your rates are high and you do well they just push more and more out of you(i.e raise the pick rate expectation and work you until you have sores on your feel and can hardly stand your back hurts so much). The fresh department i was in had a freezer area which is awful due to nasty warm suits that have tears and stink as well as ppe that foesnt keep you warm(ppe is bad quality and people get frost bite frequently) and if you are a good worker who doesnt complain they put you in freezer area most every day due to managers not wanting to deal with the people who will basically throw a fit if they have to do freezer. Managers play a huge favorite game. If you arent a favorite you are treated poorly and given the dirty hard jobs that nobody wants. Dont recommend this job unless you really need the benefits and you are desperate for a job. They hire anybody. People quit frequently due to harsh environment but theres always a replacement."
bad,"You on your feet at a fast pace, some on your back all the time, The supervisor cant help us because their Manager is on their back. It hard working in place when everybody is unhappy."
bad,"Production rate is nearly impossible to maintain "
bad,"Personne en CDI trop arrogant. "
bad,"Drains your mental health especially when you’ve got things going on at home & managers couldn’t care less about you, all there bothered about is productivity and nothing else they say it’s a fun place to work when you start on your induction but it’s far from it. If your ever put on stowing is the worst job on earth people are constantly getting sacked cause they can’t hit there rate or some of them leave."
bad,"Workwd at amazon for 6 months in stow "
bad,"- Terrible Pathways Operation Managers with 0 people skills. Notorious micromanagement. My manager was the worst!!!"
bad,It would be a great job if they knew who to hire for management. Unfortunately they hire people fresh from college who have never worked a day in their life.
bad,"Management was awful. they randomly would change workers schedule from day shift to overnight not caring about it not being convenient to you. they will tell you to quit the job if you can't work the new hours you didn't originally sign up for. they keep as many employees as they can as ""seasonal employees"" for months to not give them full benefits. just disgusting."
bad,It's like working and a plantation. Your feet hurt the time u if you cant keep up they will fire you they always watching you every move you make every step you take time you going to the bathroom don't let you sit down
bad,"Amazon is good company to work for , good pay , good vacation , good health care.you always learn something new , they always trying you when you need it."
bad,"no benefits they don't care about your safety"
bad,"low pay, demanding, zero advancement opportunities. Full time was 10 hours per day, until minimum wage was raised by MA law so they just dropped the hours so your weekly pay stayed  the same...and they are the richest company on the planet yet on minimum wage you will pay more taxes than they do."
bad,"Working in such an environment as that, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It's stressful & the job culture is pretty immature minded. Just not the right place to make a living."
bad,"I worked in the Prime now/amazon fresh part of amazon located in a Whole Foods. The average work day is pretty demanding at times and you can have a lot of orders to fulfill one after another with little break in between whilenother times you might just get paid to sit around, this is a very demanding job at times. Management is next to non existent with my boss not even acknowledging the most simplest of problems we have yet they’re expected to manage half the Locations in the state. You can try contacting what they call the “Amazon employee help line” but all you end up with is outsourced people who don’t know what they’re taking about and end up telling you to contact your manager. By far this is the worst company to work for as you’re just expected to work with no help whatsoever besides from coworkers to fulfill orders. I met by boss once and that was on my first day"
bad,you have to keep scan rate up or they'll be on your case. Break is started as soon as you hear it called so 5 mins you spend walking is 5 mins off your break so yay 5 min break instead of 10 min.
bad,"horrible place to work if you want to have a job that you enjoy. if you just want to make money they pay very well for what you do"
bad,"Don’t work here unless u need quick money this is not a long term job plus they hire u for nun if they have to many employees with ou a warning  ..... Lack of security ,they don’t care what u bring in but they care what u bring out, ex: someone could walk right in with a gun or bomb n no one would know until it was to late , the break are very short , u get time off task for going o the bathroom FYI it task about 5 min to walk to the bathroom ,. U can’t talk ,.. n your so pressure to compete with everyone around u,every thing u do seem wrong  n never good enough,.. we are human but there u have no room for mistake ,. There is like 2 cameras at your station watching u The Whole day ,manager just walk around n rush u to move fast ,.. every week yo rate has to go up"
bad,"Seasonal position, but there was not enough work for the people hired. I received a phone call after working just 3 weeks, thanking me for my time and my time had ended as of that phone conversation.  I was told I would “receive an email in 48 hours advising me of next steps.”  I did not receive that email and noticed I was being marked absent on the employee website. I called the company headquarters and was told I would receive a call within 48 hours,  I did not.  I tried to access the employee website today and received a message “ you do not have access to this site.”  I then called to follow up on the call placed last week and  was told that I was terminated.  Employees are treated like an expendable commodity at Amazon!  With the lack of training and poor leadership, they cannot be successful very long!"
bad,"i wouldn't recommend it as a place to work"
bad,U can work in  good task if u are same nationality with the managers or the team leads. The management sees the workers as a slave and they don't give anyone a permanent contract
bad,"My location was full of favoritism, making advancement very challenging. This is a great job to start out at with decent pay and benefits. But it is a  very physically demanding job. Additionally it is very cutthroat making teamwork more of a joke than a plan."
bad,This company only care about NUMBERS!!! They talk a good game just to get you in the door after that it all strictly about numbers. They have a ridiculous tact time that they want you to meet.  This job is for younger people that have no life!
bad,"They put you to work 6 days 12 hour shift in a row. Your whole entire body hurts, sprains all over but dont you there slow down or they will get on you. Every chance they get ,they try to intimidate you by terminating your job every chance they get. You accumulate so little hours that when you get sick if you run out of hours which you will ,you will be terminated.  Oh and theres no drs notes accepted.  You get the flu you need a week off to treat it? If you dont have the hours to cover that week guess what? You are fired and your drs note wont save you. So go right ahead to work with the flu and infect everyone."
bad,"A typical day at work can be very stressful due to the need to make rate when packing items. When you do no make rate, you can be written up. Amazon expects their employees to work in an environment that expects you to work at a fast pace with little to bathroom breaks without your rate dropping. "
bad,"The work day at Amazon is slow  and tiring, they do not give us any room to move to a different job title. They say they give you two 15 min but if you are in the very back and top of the building its more like an 8 min break. The pay raise they gave us was 15 dollars an hour but living expenses here are to high to be able to pay rent and live on your own."
bad,"strict timekeeping , boring ,getting tracked with the scanner , toilet brakes count as idle time .brake is too short for a smoker ,have to walk out of the building ."
bad,"I honestly didn’t very long in this job it felt like we were being worked way too hard, we had to reach a certain quota every night it was very competitive."
bad,Great mission concept but was not practiced at my location.  Many great ideas that were not carried through.  Very negative leadership and was unwilling to work with employees.
bad,"Amazon is a great company for customers, not to work for.  If one ONLY cares about the size of their paycheck and is willing to sell their soul to the company, then Amazon is for you!  If one wants ANY kind of work life balance then run away- there are other companies that truly value their employees and see them as people"
bad,"Given the high demand of production needed to keep up with incoming packages, management was not as adamant about getting a respectable output from everybody, nor would they assist in busy times. I worked night shift when I began and then the earliest shift afterwards. The night shift was usually shorted on hours because they day shifts would be overworked. The amount of people means there are a variety of types of workers. A lot of talking is done when work is priority. Harder workers are frequently moved around to compensate for slower producers and given no incentive to do the complementary work. Despite upcoming changes in pay, the benefits are lacking for most employees that are part-time with no discounts and few reward programs given the demand of the business provided."
bad,"Looks good from the outside but is a mess internally.  Lot's of politics and in-fighting.  The company appears to run by constantly bringing in new talent, burning them out, pushing them out and hiring a fresh replacement from an seemingly endless pool of applicants."
bad,"Poor Management!!! They breathe down your neck and nit-pick at every little thing! They find any excuse to write you up and put you at risk to loose your job! You're not allowed to talk or laugh without them wanting to know why you're talking and swear up and down you're stopping and talking and wasting time! All they care about is numbers, scan rates to be exact! if its not 130 then you're at risk of getting written up!!!"
bad,Everything you hear that is bad about working here is true. You are basically in a cement prison for 10 hours without human interaction. You can’t listen to music and the only sounds you will hear is the whirring of machinery. You will be in so much pain the first month and want to cut your legs off. Pay and benefits are great but that didn’t help me from spiraling into a major depressed state and wanting to throw myself into the conveyor.
bad,"It was good, fast paced, easy work for the money.  Then I got promoted to PA, they didn't want to give me a raise.  The handbook says you get a dollar raise when you become a teir 3, all I got was 25 cents only after I fought for it.  Managers can be great or they can be self absorbed and lazy.  HR is lacking in the compassion department.  They need to be retrained in diversity.  If you ask for their help they turn around and accuse you of things and set you up to be fired.  Most of the employees have a negative attitude, so if you want to survive, try to find the ones who have still have a great and positive attitude.  Management is dropping like flies because they are finding jobs elsewhere that pay more.  PA's and Management don't get cost of living increases so level one associate eventually make more than the managment.  Therefore there is no real incentive to want to advance to an assistant or manager position when you can stay and entry level associate and make more money than them.  Stock option is a joke.  You get one stock a year.  That's it.  Eventually it will be none."
bad,"Fast-paced, nothings ever good enough, leads don't care just want more and more results from you. short breaks! Hr pathetic!"
bad,the managers are not so keen on being lenient to accommodate those who are on transportation and dont live in areas. in other words they care more for the customers then they do the employees that help their business thrive
bad,Unhealthy work environment. Turnover rate is high between employees and managers. Not a long term job or career. Constant pressure from management to make production rate even when injured. Taking time off is looked down upon and is not welcomed since this affects company's productivity.
bad,"No quality review at this time"
bad,"I personally feel like there is no room to grow. I do not like the management, since it is changed too often. And I do not appreciate that they hire outside, rather than inside the company."
bad,the job is fun because i love to be moving all the time its just the company itself sucks! The job is easy very fast paced you have to make rate if you dont you get written up and 3 times your gone its a revolving door there new people every week its crazy.
bad,"This job is horrible,  avoid at all costs. They do not care about employees at all and you're just a number that can easily be replaced. No balance between work and home and punishment for using the restroom."
bad,The shifts are a long gruelling 10 hours. You do not get time to even talk to anyone and you are made to feel extremely isolated and lonely. Many people there don’t speak English and only hang out in there groups at break adding to the isolation. Break times are extremely short and you just have enough time to sit down and eat. This is because it takes some time to go to the FC to the canteen past security checks where they stare at you like your some sort of criminal.  The target system is also massively flawed. You are told at the beginning that it doesn’t matter too much about the quantity at the beggining but the quality. After the first few days I had instructors always on my back telling me to go faster causing me to rush and make mistakes. Targets are also normally very hard to achieve as most people have probably stated here. The people that do well at amazon tend to be foreign workers that don’t have much else going on in terms of employment and are desperate for money. The British workers are typically students who come and go within a month or so. A lot even leave after one or two weeks as the working environment is vile. I would not advise anyone to work here unless they want to make some quick money over short period of time. Working here anything over a month will damage you physically and mentally.
bad,"Not ideal, for any one looking for an easy job."
bad,I would not refer anyone to this company period. Its very hard work sometimes and it's production based so if you don't reach a certain number as an employee you will be terminated they misguide you putting you in areas that you're unfamiliar with and PAs and AMs telling you to do four different things because they don't communicate with each other
bad,Not worth it. your body is not meant to continuously pick 400 heavy items for 10 hours straight. lunch rooms are far away which wastes break time. dont do it.
bad,"Quite literally I felt like a spoke on a wheel-and nothing more. A numbered employee, robotic. Eyes on you from somebody-somewhere waiting for you to make a mistake. Cut-throat. Isolated to small cubicle with nothing but other cubicles to the left, right and front of you in rows. Unappreciative, Unemphatic, Unforgiving and  just did not care what-so-ever for employees regardless of performance or position. Stressful, worrisome, irritable, and at times unrealistic job expectations. Pray you get a decent direct supervisor. I think the best way to sum this job up is- You will feel exactly like Peter from Office Space.. With TPS Reports, job dependent performance reviews, And multiple supervisors letting you know of everything you did wrong and never letting you know of anything you did right. It is the epitome of monotonous. Decent initial training program, easy to work with computer system. Pay is ok dependent on what position you get.You will meet some decent, cool people. Other than that I would not recommend this job to anyone other than a introverted person who doesn't mind constant breathe over your shoulder."
bad,Mauvaise expérience personnelle suite à un nom respect du poste pour lequel j'avais été appelé.
bad,"You are not treated like you are valued, treated like you are replaceable. Receive enough training to begin but do not receive enough training if you get moved to another business."
bad,"Hot environment "
bad,"There's a reason most people don't stay with Amazon.  They don't care about you.  Most people stay less than sixty days, if not thirty.  Water Spiders gave preferential product to their buddies.  You are then judged by the harder product to stow, this happens often.  This can be looked upon as a racial issue."
bad,"If you value being listened to at all, forget Amazon. If you think that the partners they work with should be shown a modicum of respect, forget Amazon. It literally is like a bunch of ten year olds with unlimited money run Amazon. I'm sure their stockholders are happy. But they are a wildly unethical company."
bad,There was little room for advancement and they had a huge turnover rate.  I often had trouble getting paid on time or in full .  Even though I had severe illness that landed me in the hospital I was still not excused from work.
bad,if you ever wanted to sell your soul to the devil but didn't know how this is a close second. every horror story you've probably ever heard about working hear I can confirm is true
bad,amazon sets you up for failure due to peak season versus off season for internet sales. your pto vs your vto is crazy. if you miss a minute punching in for work or late for lunch you are docked an hour of pay.
bad,The managers never helps you or nowhere to be found. HR members are the worst people to ask for help to. They all have attitudes. Pay sucks. I don’t recommend nobody to ever work here. Amazon doesn’t care for nobody or what the employees have to say either. They talking about giving us new opportunities on moving up in Amazon but only thing they do is keep you down at the low level even when you qualify for the position.
bad,Extremely fast paced I would get horrible blisters on my feet from so much walking they make you walk non stop and time you on everything you do.........
bad,"Amazon is not a culture that encourages feedback if it doesn't agree with how management thinks things are going. There's a ridiculous process of reporting harassment over minor things that offend. 2 incidents 18 months apart are considered a pattern of behavior as an excuse to write you up."
bad,"The culture at Amazon is beyond bad. If you get a call from Amazon to come in for an interview, RUN!! There is no balance. They own you you night and day."
bad,just another corporate company. there isnt anything special to mention. You dont know when you will lose your job at amazon. Everyday is a godsend at amazon
bad,"Easy work processing over 80,000 items per day from a conveyor belt, computerized receive station, and a sort station.  Hand-eye coordination is key, as well as, attention to detail. Amazon provides  continuous opportunities to learn new tasks and work in new roles. The downside was sub-par management and an unprofessional work culture. Amazon replaces management and/or moves them around a lot to different departments, so do not try to get use to or comfortable with your manager. The most enjoyable part of working for Amazon in their distribution warehouse was as an Ambassador. Ambassadors greet new employees, conduct facility cite tours, train employees how to perform in their job path, provide safety training, and evaluates employee performance."
bad,"i worked there over 4 years. i dont wish for every body this place for work. they dont respect people, only scores is the most important. when they wanna smash the target they forget about safety!"
bad,"No promotion and no respect of employee;very frustrating place. If you want a promotion,have a friendly relationship with a manager!!           Thanks"
bad,"Embarrassed and disgusted to say I even work for a company like amazon that’s just complete TRASH. I’ve never worked for a company that treats its employees like useless garbage. Easy job, semi decent pay, and cool people to work with. Too bad the company itself  it’s trash. Horrible, inexperienced, unprofessional, management  in all departments. Nothing but favoritism and racism when it comes to opportunities or promotions."
bad,Working at Amazon Ont8 was a interesting experience but I could have been a lot better then what it was they had some many issue on a daily basis and it was becoming annyoing after a while.
bad,They don't care about you. Only your numbers. The UPT system is terrible! Voted #2 best Company and that may be true from a customer standpoint but from a employee standpoint its a terrible place to work for!
bad,"Management is a bunch of young kids with no experience running a team. Days are long and monotonous. Workplace culture is keep up or your gone, there is a revolving door of new people coming in and out. Lots of fights and theft."
bad,"not a fun place, very limited chances for any type of advancements. horrible management as well as hr services. bad pay and bad hours. would not recommend, but thats just me"
bad,"People were stressed out all the time. Everyone was mean and angry and at the end of the day the money just wasn't enough to stay. I am currently taking the buy out in the first week of February because I do not see career advancement opportunities here or happiness. I am currently an employee here of almost two years, I could wait till my 2 year and cash out on my stocks but I am miserable here at this facility. I do not see this facility becoming any better, I lost hope around year 1. CHA1"
bad,"There are those that refuse to do ANY job outside of their own comfort zone, and they are accommodated by management.  Yet associates such as myself, that kill themselves on a daily basis, and will do anything they are asked are paid exactly the same amount and NEVER recognized for their great work ethic."
bad,Amazon was a slave ship and it makes you work too much and has unrealistic goals to keep your job and most everybody I worked with hated it but they give plenty of hours
bad,Let’s just say you easily replaced if you don’t make goals bye then. If you are late for a 2 minutes they count that as a hour and the manager I had at least did not care the I had school after work and I tried to communicate that with him and he did not care at all would even try to help.
bad,It really isnt a good place to work the only thing that makes is good is the benifit otherwise no management is terrible general manager got caught sleeping with the secretary to much walking
bad,"Lack of communication,everything is needed at the last minute, manager does not care to help subordinates with information to do their job. Everything changes and then you promise employees something and you have to take it away."
bad,"I will never work at Amazon ever again.  I've worked hard physical jobs before, eighteen years in construction and five in a warehouse environment, and never before did I ever have to take a medical leave due to strain from the work.  After my first two weeks at Amazon I had to take a month long medical leave due to the pain in my lower back created from having to meet Amazon's desired rate of scanning merchandise."
bad,"On paper, it looks great, but the lack of advancement opportunities & the stress w/ inadequate pay results in poor employee morale. Bezos did his homework; however, under the surface, it is truly shameful."
bad,3 managers left or were fired in less than 9 months. Poor communication from senior staff. Deceptive and misleading information from senior staff members. Horrible working hours/scheduling errors.
bad,Great benefits. poor management and poor communication. good workplace culture. policies always changing. learned as I went along. not many enjoyable moments.
bad,Managers are switched so often you never get a chance to know them. If you want to get in with managers become a tattle tale. They think it really gets you far. Haha
bad,It was a very stressful place to work. My supervisor didn't know how to handle stressful situations. The healthcare benefits they provided were very good.
bad,"A lot of walking,they want you to always have over 95% rate in prod-uction if you didn't you would get wrote up.Did not get your full lunch break because of every employee had go through security."
bad,When they are trying to cut back on employees they do things intentionally to make it hard to keep up your rate. Working in other departments was enlightening.
bad,If you ever have a person threaten you repeatly and physically try to harm you and they even get it on camera good luck to you HR still will turn their head and act like you are over reacting to work place violence. This place is the worst with incidents
bad,"I hated my job, someone’s always over your shoulder ready to criticize you and write you up for any little thing you do wrong. There is very little margin for error once you start"
bad,"Project goals set by management were usually not realistic and when not met, project mangers would be fired and new people brought in. Too many military style manager. Great pay, but not a great place to work."
bad,"I worked at Amazon and it suck. On my first day my trainer looked at me and told me i wasnt going to be allowed to drive the order picker because I was too ""short"" they didnt even give me a chance to try it and they said it infront of EVERYONE. They judge a book my its cover. I thought amazon would be a better company but i was wrong."
bad,"Amazon does not want anyone to work there over 10 years.  Doesn't matter what kind of degree you have, you will be in management position.  Not all degreed people have the skills to manage people or workflow."
bad,"A typical day at Amazon, stress, stress, and more stress.  There is a hiring and firing cycle that is continuous all year round.  When your hired in Amazon gives you stock options that you can have after working two years.  The trick is keeping your job that long"
bad,"There is too much to be said about this job, though I will keep it brief."
bad,Extremely fast paced. All about # of items per minute. Did not enjoy the long hours 10-11hrs. They do pay a night differential for those working the night shift. Most people quit within their first month working for amzn.
bad,I had issued since the start of being there. Very unorganised for a massive company. Injured my back at work (amazons fault) and whilst on sick with a valid fit note being told to come in to work. THEY DO NOT TREAT EMPLOYEES RIGHT!
bad,"Only did this because I really needed money, on the whole it was a horrible experience. The worst part was working 60 hours per week for a month when they introduced mandatory overtime at christmas."
bad,"Typical day at Amazon its fast pace and very hot. What I have learn is various jobs there, such picking, packing, shipping and other jobs. The workplace culture is ok. As a packer the hardest part of the job is getting items out at CPT times. Which is due out times."
bad,"I gave my heart and soul to the company and they discarded me like a used Kleenex.  They care about the costumer and the bottom line, but not the people who work to make the customer happy.  The smiles on the box do not come from the employees!"
bad,Cut-throat work without much understanding for associates. Hard work is necessary for all positions and pay does not seem adequate enough majority of the time.
bad,"did not like it, too much pushing for rate, while you are not able to make rate because of constantly moving out of the way for other workers. 10 hour shifts, longer walks to break, no phones, music or anything to help the workday go by. third shift creates a huge imbalance in your personal life."
bad,I find that some days I love my job and other days it is the most unorganized place I have ever been. They want to provide a fun work place but their rates are keeping that from happening.
bad,"The management is lacking, there goals are ridiculous, and they preach safety but constantly talk about ""move faster"" or ""hurry up"". Don't be fooled by the nice benefit and the orientation, they are just like UPS, USPS, FedEx and all the other shipping companies."
bad,55-70 hours a week on a 40 hour salary. Micro managed beyond belief. Senior Operations tells Operations to tell the Area Manager to pick up a piece of trash on the ground.
bad,"I started as overnight shift, and was changed to days which i didnt mind. What i did mind was that HR was the big hassle. I feel they need more help in the HR dept so we actually have a chance to speak to someone that can actually help."
bad,one of the worst jobs. always doing the same thing without rotations to different jobs. people that were suppose to getting your boxes when low or out never doing it. the amount of  favoritism to so many people was so unreal. the communication of the management was bad. the 2 15 minutes were cut short because as soon as break started you left and had to be back at the 15 min mark in station.
bad,I did not enjoy the employment here. Long hours. Mandatory overtime. I felt that I could not have a life outside of work. This is not the place to be unless you are looking to make some easy money.
bad,"Their training period is far less than it should be. I was pressured for numbers (rate), which went up 10% when In was there. There was no time to get settled at one position, when I was moved to another section to struggle to meet their quota. I was told I had 90 days to get this daily quota but was let go after 60. And was constantly reminded about 15 minutes for their breaks, which is not nearly enough time for someone who has to walk from the back of the warehouse."
bad,"I enjoyed going to work everyday, for the most part. Management isn't really hands on (unless it's someone they know) and the actual basic employees are nicer and more down to earth."
bad,I was hired for dayshift. The waited until my first day to tell me they changed my hours to overnight. I also made it clear i am highly afraid of heights and they still made me go high up in the air.
bad,"10 hour work days for a part-time worker, endless walking/standing, workers not allowed to sit while not on break, short breaks compared to how long the shift is"
bad,"Overworked,underpaid for the amount of work they expect out of one person,Poor Communication,Poor Safety,Management Changes way too much causing issues for associates who get paid less but know so much more than the manager given.Amazon has issue hiring managers due to their College made backgrounds instead of their experience in the Management field. A typical day when working at Amazon you can expect to go in and be driven to work hard to in return feel very unappreciated. Amazon's biggest problem is their hiring standards have lowered so therefore any and everyone can get a job no matter the background or work ethics you carry. Their turn over rate their is ridiculous. I will say I did gain a lot of learning experiences working their dock as a Problem Solver/Freight Check In. Meeting lots of different faces and working with many different nationalities."
bad,"This company does not believe in second chances, you make 1 small mistake and you're fired immediately. Harshest violations I've ever experienced ever"
bad,A place where work should come in first and get used to it. Fast paced keeping up with rates but no windows keeping your mind from wondering.
bad,"then get rid of you. "
bad,"Work wasn't bad, but managers are never on the same page. Was doing 3 different jobs at once and being yelling at by 3 different managers for none being done fast enough. Always sent people home with vto who could be sent to other areas to help. Pay and benefits weren't worth staying at a job that had no room for advancement. Was told by one manager that if I thought me being upset and yelled at was something you should see how he is treated."
bad,"They make sure you're not doing nothing but your job at all times. Can't take bathroom breaks because that goes towards your ""time off task"" and will be written up if its past a certain time. They dont like you to talk, leave your station. Schedule is either 4 days a week for 10 hours or 3 days for 12 hours. Only 30 minute lunch."
bad,Formateur jamais satisfait. Le travail est assez précaire (quasiment que de l'interim)
bad,"You will meet different people from different countries and most of them are not going to be really nice with you. If they need free positions for their people, they will kick you out. (They will found a way to do it)"
bad,"A typical day at work is rush, rush, rush. It feels like there is never enough time to finish an e-mail before you are bombarded by oblivious or angry callers. The time metrics are nearly impossible to achieve for brand new employees but you are still held to the same standard as those people who've been there for 10 years.  There is SO MUCH to know and you have very little time to know it all.If you don't know it all you'll be put on a chopping block."
bad,Amazon is a nice place to work. I just wanted to say that it was a very nice place to work and I would recommend to all my friends to go there to work. I just hated that I was fired. I really like what I was doing
bad,"Amazon is a joke, their hr is a joke they are very rude, it'a just a lot of kids running the place. Their is no respect at all, you can ask one question to 10 different pa's or managers and no one has a answer. Amazon is a sweat shop, they care nothing about the employees. Only the number rate.  This is a job for some one to make quick money and leave. over all not a good place to work they need to do undercover boss. very dirty place on the inside."
bad,"Not a good place to work at all, a lot of favoritism and racism no respect for employers at all maybe talked down to disrespected and never recognized for helping build their company"
bad,"The job isn't that bad, it's the management that "
bad,"Most enjoyable part of the job"
bad,"they work you like a slave but the pay is good you meet lots of people there its just hard work,but the pay is really good they only hire people when they need them"
bad,"HR Department gives employees no respect and has no knowledge of company policy"
bad,"négatif, déception, aucun apprentissage intéressant, relation de travail non enrichissante"
bad,Find ways to weed out people who are slow management stinks co-workers are nice hardest part going fast best time of the day was getting out of there
bad,The first couple of years working for Amazon were great. The people I worked along side with and my management were the best I could ever ask for. Due to hiring unqualified management everything went down hill quickly. 30% of the staff left the company entirely due to the drama that upper management caused. After a year the culture changed completely into a hostile work environment. The turn around time for a new hire was a max of 6 month. I would not recommend my department to anyone looking for a job.
bad,"didn't last long. was laid off after i applied to be fulltime wont go back"
bad,Spanish forced down your throat ALL day. A little taxing for those of us who speak English. . Horrible place to work. Place is a joke and amateur compared to other bigger amazon warehouses.
bad,"Shift's are very long and demanding."
bad,"worked packaging lines , loading trucks on dock, operate slam scales keep good housekeeping and safety main goals"
bad,"Not what I expected from an industry leader."
bad,Overall satisfied.I lernt to work in a large organisation.
bad,All about money. They say they prioritize the employees. They do not. A lot of management acts like they are helping you but they’re just trying to keep you calm. Pays amazing though. Benefits are amazing.
bad,"Amazon is a big platform to learn new things on daily basis and also you can develope your skills and take you to next level."
bad,"È una tipologia di lavoro x chi x mille ragioni in quel momento non trova altro di meglio, ma consiglio spassionato appena inizi in Amazon manda CV altrove perché la maggioranza dura pochi mesi di contratto poi li lasciano a casa con la scusa calo di lavoro che in Amazon non c’è mai xche pressoché sempre costante..."
bad,"Even when he ou hard worker they will make you like a slave. No advancedment "
bad,"Managers etc don't care about workers. Job not hard but they make things difficult. Worked here for ovet a year. Silly rules and expectations, money is good that's only good point."
bad,"Very stressful this job, hard work, targets very hard to achieve. Salary is good i give you that. Overall not a good place to work. Is mostly job for robots to be honest."
bad,"You have no voice there. Have to do what they say. Dont help with time off for kids. "
bad,My time for Amazon truly frustrates me because if you don’t pick a schedule within the time drop you just don’t work at all which sucks. Lastly it’s everyone for themselves no help at all.
bad,"The area I work in has a turnover of between 60% and 70% of staff."
bad,Probably the worst place I have ever worked. I was never notified by text or email or mandatory overtime which then was fired Cuz I missed a shift I didn't know I had to be there for
bad,"12 years of blood, sweat and tears and they fired me because they changes the process and didn't give us a chance to adjust.  Monotonous, mind numbing, thankless work that will kill your mind and your soul if you stay to long. Benefits were amazing and the pay was so, so. They expect to much though and you basically are not allowed to make mistakes."
bad,"Only good thing was the money. On a 10 hour shift, you are not allowed to stop and sit for 1 second. You go home every day with swollen feet. They give you 2x 15 min breaks but they do not let you take the full 15  mins, you spend most of it walking around the warehouse and get a max of 5 mins and then back to work, aching for the 30 min lunch which truly is 20 mins, again due to walking."
bad,Only apply if you're desperate for a job. It pays really well and you get great benefits (depending on what package you elect to pay for) but the behind the scene politics and the lies aren't worth it.
bad,"If u love working in a warehouse 80 hours for two weeks , including schedule changes out of the blue and miscommunication, hard working manual labor then amazon for u. I hate it here , the money and benefits good but it’s not worth your health and mind"
bad,Amazon was great but they let me go because i was stealing time and i didnt just was overwhelmed with my situation as i locked mu keys in my car and didnt let me come back just caude of there policy i accepted it
bad,"Unprofessional, unorganized and over their head DSP. Delivery vans had crucial safety issues that were not fixed but, still required to drive. ( ie. non working hazard lights ) Impossible delivery expectations, 200-275 packages to be delivered in 9 hours with an hour of breaks and no running allowed no pulling in driveways.  Impossible.  Managers continually changed rules and regulations regarding termination if broken on the fly in a Workplace App ( like FB) only nothing in writing."
bad,"Es war stressig, und die Bezahlung war blöd keine Überstunden wurden bezahlt man arbeitet täglich 12 bis teilweise 13 Stunden am Tag und es wurden nur 8 bezahlt  Frechheit Menschen ausbeute"
bad,Amazon was probably my worst job because the job gave me too much time to think about my own life decisions and why I was continuing to work at a place of Work I didn’t enjoy the work itself was easy.
bad,Lavoro stressante e ambiente pesante...stipendio buono ma il resto sfruttamento al 100 percento e soprattutto se non siete raccomandati da qualcuno non andrete da nessuna parte fanno crescere solo chi vogliono loro e fanno tante promesse senza mantenerle....esperienza pessima
bad,"If you work in the corporate sector of Amazon I'm sure its a whole other world but if you work in the fulfillment centers for Amazon, god save your sole. Amazon will work you to death and replace you in a second. Its like a border line Chinese labor intensive company brought to the U.S. Dont work for them unless you really need to make ends meet. You can get hurt and get injuries you didn't even know you had until after you quit. Also if you have hopes of moving up from a fulfillment position, good luck, there's tons of competition and they promote from with in so every rarely can you make it to the corporate sector unless your already there."
bad,"A lot of favoritism. No rubber mats on concrete and you have to get on your knees sometimes on concrete.  I was forced to quit after 1 year of service because I had surgery and they did not want to give me light duty for 4 shifts. Tried to make me take 3 weeks off, because that's how long it takes to get medical accomodations  to go through. The manager could over ride and just give me light duty but he chose not to do I had to quit"
bad,"It's all about the bottom line. Working at amazon is modern day slavery. All they care about is how you can make them money. As a high level manager, I was constantly harassed by my senior manager to perform at optimum level, he would ping me a million times during the day and complain about everything, he would go as far as saying ""you're a woman you get too emotional, you're not fit for this role"" , what a scumbag. I was under constant pressure and my health started to deteriorate. I struggled with depression and anxiety, as I had to fire 2-3 people each week because they couldn't make rate.  would take a 10 min break to just sit on the toilet and cry. No time for a decent lunch . 16 hours a day of work during peak season, 6 days a week. I fantasized about the day I quit my job every night. I WILL NEVER GO BACK. No mater how much they pay me. My health is more important than the money. Stay Away from Amazon. They treat people like garbage."
bad,"Ho iniziato a lavorare in Amazon a Brandizzo tramite Adecco "
bad,"I don't recommend it. Very boring, repetitive work. They do not work with school schedules and do not let you advance. I know people who have been there for 5 years who haven't advanced."
bad,The managers were mean. One time I asked a question I wasn’t sure about to a manager and she gave me a nasty attitude. One lady got in trouble just for passing out water. Managers didn’t know what they were doing. They couldn’t agree on one thing and would change things like everyday. It was really hot in the warehouse and they overwork you
bad,"You could tell the managers all day that things could be improved, even give them detailed plans on how to fix things, but they couldn't comprehend what was going on. Most were kids, straight out of college, many of whom had never worked prior. "
bad,"In my opinion, you should only work here as a last resort or until you find something better. The hours & productions goals were ridiculous. The management never listened to feedback, only to respond. But if you want a job where they care more about your performance than you as a human being, this is the right place for you."
bad,"For someone that likes to do the same thing over and over again, this may be a good fit for them. No team building or time to talk to your coworkers. Standing on concrete for eight hours straight. Fast paced and you just become a number or statistic."
bad,"Paid is decent. Definitely not a place for advancement if your over the age of 20. They must pay the labor board to over look the workplace discrimination laws, they break them daily. Air quality in the facility is bad and not check on a regular basis."
bad,"A typical day at Amazon SMF1 from the eyes of ""Inbound Stow"": "
bad,"Mauvaise expérience, les  promesses de la hiérarchie sont non tenues ( changement d’heures soudain sans prendre en considération votre vie familiale et s’il est donc possible de pouvoir les assurer) "
bad,"I’ve been with Amazon a little more than one year. My observations are as follows: an 18 year old with a high school diploma or GED will be promoted over a 40+ year old who has his BA degree, plus the fact said older worker produces more quality work and makes the rate. Older workers, even when more productive will never get promoted and are made to do the back-breaking work the younger associates are not assigned.  The younger associates are given problem solver, quality control, amnesty positions. Those positions do not require the hard soul-numbing labor the majority of associates perform. Mostly the younger associates walk around with a laptop, chit-chat with other associates, and take numerous breaks which others do not. There is much favoritism and politics involved. "
bad,Did not enjoy working for Amazon. felt like a high school/Prison atmosphere. They do not care about their employees. i would not recommend them to anyone to work there
bad,"I worked on an assembly line, where I had to correct packaging errors (Make sure the tape is secure on the package. It was all about timing. How fast you could put the package together in different sections. Oh yes, you were being timed. I was a seasonal worker December 2017- December 2017 I was homeless at the time living in my SUV in Houston, Texas. I was written up multiple times because I couldn't package the package in less than 1 minute despite many coachings.  Started Tuesday, December 5, 2017, I quit  Friday, December 30, 2017, because the next write up I would've been fired, Would I recommend to anyone maybe if they can package a package within 1 minute but No. There were all about high numbers. Who could package multiple packages fast? Had a friend who had high numbers they deactivated his badge once it was over. Take this job only if you really need a job. I took this job becuz I was homeless, i had applied many places but got no callback.,"
bad,"The worst  company i used to work. I left my previous job behing a dream when i was selected to join amazon. As a all new job, promise and things started at day 1. Still 1Y and half mothing has been accomplished. I have seem a lot of people coming in and out at all levels. They dont care about you, this is all about money and ship packages to keep their metrics at top level. No matter who you are, you will be stand.all day long which is painfull for your legs. OT when they need it, when not your are enforce to use VTO (Going home without pay). I wish everybody read this review before going there even though you dont have a choice. Find a second opinion with somebody who has been there even working for third parties like JLL and some others contractors. Dont be fooled by these companies mentioned, you will remember these words."
bad,"If your looking for work to take care of your family or home, keep looking.  Amazon is all about the packages.  You work for amazon and feel like an outsider because of the DSPs.  Division in the work place.  Start work today gone soon as your 90 days are up that's when your benefits kick in. Eight days later you have no job.  You are not important, again it's about the packages.  I will not renew my prime."
bad,"Working at Amazon is simple, you scan a package, you place it on a pallet."
bad,"Having to make sure you did a 100% or better"
bad,"Please don’t work here, I’m a driver and management  can be very rude probably the worst I’ve seen at any job. If you’re not cool with the manager your not getting promoted, most co-workers are pretty cool but some really are terrible. You can’t do much since your a temp/seasonal. Anyways if you need money but don’t stay long."
bad,"I can lease a brand new van for £200 a month, Amazon charged me £200  a week for a deathrap so that I could work 62 hours a week and make £67 a day after all costs are taken into account."
bad,Dont be busy in doing overtimes  I know you get money but at certain point of time you will spend the same money in medicines and hospitals due to health issues. Never do overtime be it even for money.
bad,At the beginning there was qualifications for moving up in the company and to work in other areas of the warehouse. As time went on I learned alot about the company the systems they use and pretty much all machines in the warehouse. Work towards the end was very stressful and production was not evenly distributed throughout the Inbound areas.
bad,Amazon doesn't treat their employees well.  They feel everyone is dispensable and replaceable. Hard work for unfair pay. Turnover at Amazon is substantial.  No one stays there long.
bad,If you are working on the fulfillment (warehouse) side of Amazon be prepared to be worked to the bone.  The average manager lasts less than 1 year.  Most quit.  I was there for several years and was one of the stronger performers.  The pay you get will be your pay for a long time.  Expect no raises or extra stock.  Your work-life balance will be horrible.  Believe all the bad things you hear.  It was not worth it in the end.
bad,"Its a decent place to work if you are just starting out in the workforce but their leadership skills need alot of improvement. They will relocate you to a different department when they want due to ""Business Needs."" Another words we are just another number to them so that they can meet their productivity goals."
bad,Work was physically debilitating and hourly goals unreasonable. It was impossible for me to maintain the pace required. I missed several bathroom breaks to keep pace.
bad,"This job stress me out. The worst management that I have ever had. They think we are robots, always making us work under cruel rates. On average People have to walk 4 to 6 miles in one shift. This is a stressful - non friendly place. I don’t recommend anybody to work here, maximum you’re going to last one year without breaking apart with stress."
bad,If you like to have your nose in the managers butt then you will get along just fine. Management will lie to employees constantly. Management has their pets and you better like them or they will harass you and find a reason to get rid of you. Management is very unprofessional. If they had good management it would not be a bad place but management is horrible all the way up the chain too
bad,"Standing in one spot for 12 hours a day with someone barking at you."
bad,"My partner worked for the newly built depot in Ottawa, On. Has been there for only a week! Got trained in the area as ""Cherry Picker), the training was NOT the expected 8 hours training. Granted because of heights you need to be hooked, for obvious safety concerns. However, this company does not give chances, especially if you are new to this environment. One person crashed into a P.I.T. which is basically a lift. This person was retrained and put back on, my partner, forgot to hook back on was ""supposed"" to get retrained, it took the management people all day to come back and give my partner the fired papers, with not even a chance to plea the case of why it happened....This is not the Canadian way to do things! We give chances. So their philosophy is basically saying that, it's all right to drive into other vehicles, which could have easily hit someone if that person was in between the two P.I.T. but forgetting to hook up, oh my, can't have that.... It may be their policy, but where is the fairness? Where is the benefit of doubt? Why take a new person's word on how things happened without asking the actual person that was involved? This company is NOT a good EMPLOYER! Beware of their niceties and all the perks, it's a trap to get you in!"
bad,Frustrating and unorganized. Worth more than what they pay. To many changes. The work did not bother fairly easy follow directions and know your warehouse makes it easy.
bad,"This job was actual h*** for me I was in pain every night for 4 days in a row and the 3 days I had off my body was recovering from the pain. I did the stretches, warm ups and wore athletic shoes but nothing lessend the pain. Management is horrible, very rude, don't drink the water because you'll get sick, but if you don't drink water then you'll get dehydrated like what happened to me 3 times and I had to go to patient first for fluids. The only good thing is the pay and benefits. Amazon is an actual nightmare and you're literally a number to them, they will easily get rid of you and then replace you."
bad,"You cannot complain about their mistakes, you better don’t talk and keep a low profile, they tell you to follow the policy and sometimes go against it when requested, they also ask you to report your own difficulties or discomforts and use it against you."
bad,"If you dont pick the right number per hour you ar our the door. They only give you a week and a half and start writing you up for not meeting the quota, which also seems unfair"
bad,"Job wears you down. Huge disappointment after years of ripping my guts to be skipped in promotion again and again. Nice people though, from around the world."
bad,"To stressful , demands to much from u , do not recommend to any one , the pay is to low for a warehouse , using heavy equipment,  management is quickly to fire a employee"
bad,"You have to rush to do anything and can't take much time to use the restroom or you will fall behind on your tasks. When you speak with management about the problems you are facing, they won't help."
bad,"I drive and deliver no interaction all day I show up at 630 am get my route, load up my van, check my gear, and start the route I deliver on average 250 plus packages a day from homes to apartments and business. I do it for 10-12 hours a day depending on route and traffic."
bad,Worked for them for 2 years anb it is very bad culture. No one should go there unless they have no other choice. Don't be filled by the good comments some have posted here they wrer done by mangers or leads who like to keep their jobs. No chance of  progress even if you work hard. There is a Spanish manager who is a recsit and thinks he owns the company.
bad,"Working at amazon was a lot of work, and you were kind of underappreciated for the work that you did. I worked there when was 18 years old and you do meet people there but it is also kind of lonely because you are working by yourself on a daily basis for like 10 to 12 hours. You have to be able to go a while without conversation and your not even able to be accompanied by radio or some music. But if you are able to be alone for hours, you'll be ok. I wouldn't recommend this job on a career building mission but for month or two it's alright."
bad,Unfair workplace. I don’t know why I have to keep it at a certain minimum. You see? This is what I mean. Nothing is ever enough for Amazon. Just like the old days!
bad,"It was just very hard, my feet would swell, Id sweat through my clothes, and by the time I got to my car for lunch it would be time to head back. Just not a good place to work in my opinion."
bad,"would go into work do a stand up, load people trucks and then load your and leave a go deliver packages i didnt learn much because i use to work for UPS manangement wasnt all that cut out to bu but wasnt bad the hardest part about the job was loading your own trucck and the most enjoyable part about the job was you was by yourself to almost 10 hours a day"
bad,"Go work there and find out yourself. Nobody wants to sit here and bash a former employer. That is not only unethical, in my situation it is uncalled for."
bad,"Unless you have to it isnt worth it, the hours are long. Management is childish at times. They would fire you just to cover their butt. Communication is horrendous, and proper training just doesnt exist."
bad,"I wouldn't advise anyone to work there. If you want to forfeit your, respect, dignity, honour, manhood, womenhood, human rights and you want to feel like you're back in school and be told off on a constant basis don't work in any Amazon branch especially the one in Dunstable. I've done warehouse work on many occasions, but this was the worst experience I've ever had and that's got nothing to do with the actual work. The work agencies are powerless and cannot act on your behalf as attorneys. Their job is to get you in there and get their bonuses and pay checks. The oppressive work culture stems from the CEO. If you don't believe me just check the other reviews and watch the YouTube videos on Amazon. If you still want to work there after all what I have said then all I've got to say is ""Looks like everybody's gotta learn the hard way. You've been warned. Remember Amazon is not the only place to work in in UK. You're a slave and a number that can easily be replaced."
bad,"Metric Heavy, you are a numeric in a laptop being constantly monitored.... the work is all repetitive for my 12 hour shift .... mind numbing .... Management is out of "" The Stepford Wives, "" don't blame them but they know a basic associate is a ' grain of sand ' on The Amazon Beach. If you can dial your IQ to ' zero, ' you will be able to do the work, ...."
bad,"The agency I was with was not the best agency I have worked for"
bad,"Der Tag besteht primär aus Backlogarbeit. "
bad,Amazons hiring process for EOTs stinks. The other employees leave you stranded. Sink or swim. Those Qual cards for EOTs is laughable. The job for 1 person on a shift in a mega huge data center is impossible....especially if a rack goes down.
bad,"This place pays very well but apply at your own risk. Upon applying, you will lose your happiness. It is extremely political and if you do not kiss up to the right person, you will not move anywhere within the company. Managers are aloud to talk to the associates anyway they want to. They can curse at you and threaten you and if you go to HR, you will be retaliated against. Also, you do not get breaks."
bad,Amazon doesn't care about their employees. Only worried about production and not being sued. Managers and young and inexperienced. The only good thing about amazon is the benefits
bad,"a lot of managers are young and don't know what the heck they are doing or how to speak to employees. "
bad,hardest part of the job is meeting rates that continue to rise. it is also hard to maintain a healthy personal life while working the hours they need you to work. It is stressful on your body.
bad,Their managers want to do things the way they want not the Amazon way. They convert temporary employees that cherry pick to boost their numbers. They make their decisions on employees numbers only. They don't take into account employee errors.
bad,They play sides and favoritism  not a fair work environment. want you to out work yourself so they can sit back and do absolutely nothing. little to no functional training so you can move up in your position.
bad,"its an 10 hour shift that people are wolfs in sheep clothing precisely wanting to reach the up graded position in the company i have been blessed with multi-facted knowledge from problem solve T.D.R. pallet receive heavy equipment operation. Management is a open air sercet  society a faternity hyprocisy an overflowing amount of preferential treatment. staying awake for a 10 hour shift, the possibility of excelling in the company."
bad,"Work isnt awful, but managment is incompetant.the conditions are absolutly terrible, 10 minute break in a 10 hour shift. We had people passing out, getting hit from falling objects, ect."
bad,Would not recommend to somebody with a family to care for unless you plan to move to managment. Would not recommend if you have any disabilities. They will mark whenever you use the rest room and if you go to many times in an hours they will try to terminate you instead of working to give you an accommodation closer to a restroom
bad,The company like to hire a lot of new employees in order for them to give them laid off later on. The discount is 10%. They cut hours and get mad at us when we asked them why.
bad,"They are not willing to accommodate people with disabilities.  They put you on short term disability so that they can accommodate the person; however, once they receive all medical documentation they are not willing to accommodate the disability."
bad,"overworked, paid well but comes at a price.  no work life balance and management are not experienced at all.  in order to be successful there, you need to be single without a family"
bad,Profits before people. People are dying on a regular basis for amazon across the planet. And the organization focuses more on containing the incident.
bad,They work you hard and hand you more work that is possible to achieve. The expectations are unrealistic and there are no support. They embrace a self-learning culture and you are expected to deliver regardless of the circumstances.
bad,"The job is very physically demanding. Management changes every few months. It was rare to find a person there who genuinely enjoyed being there. Other than making some friends and great benefits, not a great place to work."
bad,run the other direction. quickly. it's all about rate and doing everything mistake free and as fast as a robot that was designed to do what you're doing.
bad,"It got you by but once you're sick, forget it. In the eyes of this company, every associate is expendable. If you don't have enough PTO to cover your time, you're either going to work sick or you're at a high risk of getting fired."
bad,"A day started with punching in and attending a ""stand-up"" where the day before's numbers were gone over. Then management would decide what and here you where doing it that night.  Then they would work you to death with little care for your health or well being."
bad,The people there are the people that make it easy to go back to. The people motivate you for another day. The pay is good for a while but a lot of wear and tear on the body after a while. Loading trucks would have to be one of the hardest parts of the job. Especially on HOT summer days. Those trailers are no joke. Young and motivated people who are willing to make a nice amount of money I would recommend to apply and work here.
bad,Unless you get lucky long term advancement doesn't happen. I had an injury that ended up getting me fired. The fact that Amazon really doesn't care about veteran employees has kind of left a sour taste in my mouth when it comes to this company
bad,"stay away "
bad,"I didn't enjoy my time here because management is worthless and they judge you based on your production rate which is unfair. For example, you have to perform at 100 percent or better to please them. If you perform 99 percent or below, they write you up. They seem to raise the rate every now and then because somebody is actually hitting that rate (regardless if they're actually following correct procedures). Management is also lazy and they do nothing to help their employees out. "
bad,"enjoyed the work only management is useless. bins are so jammed full there's no room to stow new product, and if you are a picker you just bout have to pull everything out to get that one item shoved in the back."
bad,"I would advise all, especially students to stay clear of amazon, especially around winter. Long hours, lack of sunlight and being stuck in a metal container all day results in a very negative working environment. Staff are polite, as are managers but the conditions you are working in are like non i have seen before. The money is good, and there are benefits, If you can hack being stuck in a solitary position with no communication for 10 hours then this job is perfect, but for me I felt lonely at Amazon."
bad,"Expect to work more than 40 hours a week, and never be thanked for it. Yes the salary is great, but when you account for the hours you're working it's not worth it."
bad,Amazon counts on it's brand name to draw in talent and does nothing to retain or develop that talent. There are many smart young people trapped in low level positions that Amazon prefers to cycle in and out instead of invest in as future assets to the company.
bad,Over worked and requirements are extensive for most people. Too high of turn over rate due to pace rating for employees. Need to give higher pay for extensive work.
bad,The pace was slow but management wanted productivity even when machinery was always down. They didn't know how to work together. Cut throat. Food was ok.
bad,"stressful job. while the coworkers are great, the job is very bad if you want a life. other than that you feel as a slave would, working 10 hrs a day can be dreadful, at least for the amount you get payed, $12/hour."
bad,Amazon is not a good place to work if you have a family. They dont care about any one. Once your in negatives they will fire you. This job is only good people coming out of high school with no responsibility. Thia job will stress you off. They may pay well be just as fast as your hired is as fast as you can get fired.
bad,"Amazon is not a good place to work! Poor management, human resource employees are sarcastic, no overtime, company tell lies about future goals, company losing money everyday, no counseling provided on-site when needed! No and I say it again, Amazon is not a good place to work! One thing I forgot to mention is that everyone is always off task! And when I complain to my manager, they always say ""I'll look into it""! And they never do! Favoritism is the most violation the management team always commit! It's a joke!"
bad,"A typical day at work is picking and packing shipments.  Making sure they are right, and if they are not right then figuring out why they are not and then fixing it. There was a basic first training, and then you were basically on your own from then on out. management was alright, go go go type of work and they did not understand that people can get injured doing some of these positions. The other employees were always very nice. Hardest part of the job is just the physical demand they put on people, there were a lot of injuries, including myself, i ended up needing shoulder surgery."
bad,"This place is a great place to work from the outside. But is filled with favoritism, poor management, and is like working in a preschool where everyone is the kids."
bad,"I feel as though they don't take into account how their employees function.  The bathrooms are half a mile away, by the time you get there on break you have no other time to do anything else."
bad,Management ruins everything for you & are not genuine in helping you. They don‘t care if you have the flu you have to go to work. You have to work overtime even if they are over staffed but they won’t let you go home. People got fired all the time because they weren’t meeting rates or because they ran out of their personal time. The people you meet there are all low lives.
bad,The work environment is a very rushed and dictatorship type of atmosphere. The management is never happy with your performance and always wants more production. The awards given are always to the same handful of employees. Many young and new to the work force employees think that the work place is a night club to be used for picking up a date. The job is very physical and strenuous from start of day till end and the leads push you from start to end and especially at end of day when they see everyone tiring. There is nothing enjoyable about the job. Time keeping is to the second on overtime and at their discretion during regular hours.
bad,Their standards for their workers are outrageous. They expect you to be at 110% the first day you are employed there and barely learning the ropes. They are constantly giving write up and they don't care.
bad,If something goes wrong don’t expect to get a fair outcome. Everything is by the script no exceptions. They are constantly changing things no notice in advance. The job is not flexible with workers at all. Packages getting out is the main concern not people. They push you to the limit. This job is only good if you plan to be there for a short time.
bad,"I worked here & I kept getting written up by a manager I’ve NEVER met a day in my life. The people act shady & weird, I definitely hated working here."
bad,No security in the position. Fulfill all demands and yet still you can be cut with zero notice. Needs a union in there to secure basic workers rights.
bad,"Amazon is place where visual design goes to die. Inexperienced designers in gatekeeper type positions dictate draconian design rules that are impossible to work around unless you are on teams blessed by Bezos such as devices or Kindle. Amazon cares about moving inventory faster, so visual design takes a back seat to UX design in all cases. However, most UX designers here are not UX designers by trade, they are visual designers moved into a UX title for the sole purpose of getting a higher salary. The proof is in their devices and interfaces. The objectives here are to get things to a state where it's just good enough to launch. The problem with this is  the high turnover always comes into play which means it takes  longer to migrate a project to any kind of polished state. "
bad,"Amazon is a Physicaly and mentaly exausting job. Injury is inevitable with this job. Although some managment I encountered was great at their jobs, most did not know how to do the job they were overlooking. Any and all positions are fast paced and there is very little room for error. I would only recomand this job to people starting in the work force."
bad,The job of picking was a lot. I have worked at a warehouse before and this place lined up workers and filtered through them if the quota was met to their standards.
bad,Very cut throat and cult type management. Same as most American ran companies choosing color over competence. Not good for blacks or Latinos. And I was in management!!
bad,They expect you to run full speed for 10 hours but only give you a brief break. The production rate system is unrealistic they want you to keep a 100% rate but even if you go on break or to the bathroom your rate is still running so you have to do twice the work to keep your rate up
bad,Amazon isn't bad if you want something crazy easy that doesn't require an ounce of brain matter. The mind numbing job I was doing led me to do something that violated a safety protocol and I was let go do to my own stupidity. If you want something that doesn't require much thinking and don't mind repetitive work then maybe amazon is the place for you. It just didn't work for me.
bad,The company cares nothing about the associates at all. Extremely long days with no interaction with others allowed. Not enough time to eat given the amount of people the facility has.  The management is very rude and could care less about any issue that you may have. The opportunity to move to other locations are slim to none. The Christmas season is the absolute worse.
bad,"Very hard working place, the environment in there is terrible, managers are terrible, the 15 minutes breaks feels like only 2 minutes. you only get trained for 1 night and they expect you know what your doing like you have been there for 3 years, its just terrible."
bad,"If you are happy with a job where u don't know if you're going to get fired everyday you walk in this is the job for you. The rules are ridiculous, they overwork you with impossible standards. It is VERY easy to get fired. There is no guarantee that you will keep this job. A couple of mistakes and you're gone"
bad,Amazon Lex 1 was the worst place I have ever worked. the pay is great but its JUST A soul sucking job and the company clearly does not care for its employees
bad,"Working at Amazon is the most stressful and mind boggling experience thus far. Working here has made me appreciate all of my other previous employers. The work is very easy, but you are required to do it at an extreme fast pace, on your feet, non stop until your assigned break. Working here limits your freedom tremendously. Managers keep tabs on you at all times and if you are not doing work for more than five minutes you can be held accountable for it, no matter what the reason is for you not working. Your body aches from head to toe from the physical labor and managers still expects the best results from you no matter what. The hours working here is another complete con. Overtime is given to Associates often and is mandatory. So, instead of working 10 hour days for four days, you are expected to work 11 hour days for five days straight! It takes a lot from you physically and also mentally. While working in my department, I am alone all day with no music or anything for 10 long hours. It makes work less enjoyable. Working here is definitely not worth the pay. The only pro I can think about are the benefits, but most people don't stay working here long enough to enjoy them."
bad,The work is physically demanding. Working there has given me back and shoulder pain that still remains. Every worker is very closely supervised. The management staff was generally rude and lazy. A full time associate started at $11.00/hour and received annual pay increases. I didn't find any parts of the job enjoyable.
bad,this is a great place to work if you like fast pace work environments. the management is ok but rarely listen to the likes of its employees. the benefits are good though.
bad,i've been working there and its exhausted you gotta work almost 12 hours per day they give you just 3 breaks 2 of them its just 10 minutes and the lunch is 25 thats it since 6 am to 5:30 pm there is not work life balance they send you to the freezer all the time  the benefits are good but i dont recomend this place to work except just for part time part time its just 5 hours 4 days a week
bad,"excellent technical learning. "
bad,Unless you are willing to do manual labor. Don't come here.  A very high turn around.  Lots of walking just to go to break or lunch . Very boring and repetitive.
bad,"the workplace is incredibly unsafe, fire exits constantly blocked by pallets stacked over 6 ft. causing you to find another if there were a fire alarm. managers were very young and promoted only attractive girls, and after you call that out you will be targeted and singled out causing any associates to have no voice for themselves."
bad,I did not like this Job because it interfered with my scoliosis and this job was always tiring. this job has to do with a lot of heavy things and your always on your feet and its a very boring job.
bad,Working at the warehouse was not enjoyable. I did not feel valued at all. I was just an expendable worker. There was no room for advancement at all. Terrible Hours as well.
bad,"very stressful work place, if they had an 8 hour shift they would keep more people from quitting. They have very poor management, managers only seem to care about the rate you work and how fast you move."
bad,"Management: everyone pretty much runs around with their head cut off and nobody knows how to do their job. they definitely play favorites. "
bad,"Bad management, no room for advancement, that's about it.  The work life balance is poor, management is pretty bad. The benefits are pretty good. But there's not much else."
bad,"Terrible work environment. Many employees do not know who their manager is for weeks! Management treats employees like lesser humans thinking that their education got them their job, therefore they are somehow above, Not knowing (ignorant) to the fact that many employees are better educated than them!"
bad,Amazon is a very busy place to work. Lots of overtime during peak seasons (up to 60 hour weeks mandatory). Limited vacation and personal time. Doesn't take doctors notes. Lazy managers. Have a daily quota you must meet. Write ups for not meeting quotas. Will be fired after 4 write ups.
bad,"the makeup brushes were great when i put them to use, they did not shed or anything. until i washed them with the brushes cleanser spray they began to shed when i apply foundation on. then they became useless and was used them for some other reason."
bad,Management was terrible and always assume 1 hr flex up even if you are not able to do it. By time you walk from back of the factory to the break room its time to turn around and start back working. The hours are terrible if this is your on and only job. Do not make this job your priority. Sent people home on days they didn't need a full work place. They can dictate rather you will get off early or a hr later.
bad,"When I first started working there I thought the job was awesome, then I experienced my first peek season and all h#@+ broke loose. I've never met so many disrespectful people in my life, and management does nothing to change the horrible atmosphere"
bad,this job is full of it they play favoritism they will tell you that you can be hired in at the end of January and then they are cutting all the shifts and making new ones. don't waste your time with it
bad,Amazon does not care about their employees only their numbers. Everyday you are doomed as soon as you walk in that door. You are constantly harrased by management to make rates and if you don't you get written up. Not a career position. Amazon sets employees up for failure.
bad,"Treated like a number and not a human being. And it's bit what to know, it's who you know.  Punished for having more than 1 day off for family emergencies. Very bad company to work for."
bad,Management was not very organized and also I felt as if they worked you much more than they where willing to pay you. As far as the work place it self was nice n clean.
bad,"A typical day at work is to locate customers orders from the warehouse shelves and deliver to the packing department in a timely matter to insure fast delivery. What I have learned is working with people in different age groups was very challenging. I was able to learn various operations throughout the warehouse. One of the main draw backs of the job, is that Management and supervisors are all unorganized and lack communication with one in other. The hardest part of my job is moving about the warehouse at a fast pace for 10 hours on a hard cement floor. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with some of the coworkers and getting off work, knowing that made it through another day."
bad,driving a forklift we should get paid more. The co worker was not helpful at all. I didn't like my hours or days and I learn it was a busy jus open so they had learn just like me. My most enjoyable moment was getting paid.
bad,"The pay and benefits are great but it is a terrible work environment. Terrible hours. Though having a set shift is nice with three days off. The management is bad, very unorganized. Though people do try, I will give them that. The co-workers you will meet are terrible. It is like a giant dirty, immature people filled high school. I only met a few decent folks there. They literally hire anyone, brain or not."
bad,amazon are not good to there staff and rip them off but i have no complaints with the recruitment agencies i have gone thru
bad,"Had awful shift changes to two five hour shifts per day, 6 days a week. Starting at 7am-12pm then 5pm-12am and again the next day. No time outside of work. Travel time was ridiculous as the transport provided took 90 minutes as it went round all the towns in the area before going to Rugeley. Thats sixteen hours a day on work and travel giving you eight hours to sleep, eat, shower and do anything you need to do at home (washing clothes, washing dishes, seeing friends/family, household chores and getting ready for work/bed). Also the eight hours aren't in one go, there are four hours between your first and second shift and four hours after you finish for the day so you are never going to get more than four hours sleep in one go. Overall very draining and not social at all, very hard to talk and socialise during working hours and canteen is expensive other than free tea/ coffee. You never get your full break because the break time includes the time it takes you to walk from where you are across the factory to the break room and it takes forever to get through security."
bad,They run out of work all the time. we end up standing there for hours doing nothing. it affects us and we get in trouble for it. not a place I like to work at. the management pick favorites.
bad,"I would give negative stars for management if I could. (I.H. Services). I was hired as assistant manager for I.H. Services, a contract company. Employees were not receiving their checks and were not paid. Hours worked were not being documented, and miscalculated, and funds were not being disbursed into direct deposit accounts. Safety violations occurred because we were told to override them against the rules of safety management. Benefits were automatically extracted from employee checks without paperwork and taxes were taken out in two townships (which I was able to resolve). My boss was writing personal checks while we were missing pay. I demoted myself as assistant manager because I didn't receive support from I.H upper management to resolve employee concerns."
bad,"Yes, Amazon has great benefits. But all the blue badge (actual Amazon) are completely lazy. They think they don't have to work. Yet, the temp people work their butts. Management is screwed up. They sit around on their fancy computers and have no idea what's even going on. I don't care if you are temp or not everyone needs to work! IT IS CALLED A JOB FOR A REASON!!!"
bad,A truly horrible place to attempt to start a career. The management changes more often than the weather. Normally they are fresh college graduates who you can tell have no clue how to deal with people at a more physically demanding job. The competitive nature of everything involved leads to a lot of deceit and backstabbing. Hard work is hardly recognized. All of that in a very fast paced job where you can be fired for a few bad days of work or for simply being in the bathroom for a few more minutes than your manager wanted you to be. What started as a great job at a great company quickly turned into one of the worst jobs I've had with some of the worst management I am sure I will ever see.
bad,"decent company, if you dont mind hard work, very labor intensive. seems all management cares about are the production numbers. i feel like im just another body filling a position."
bad,"I have now worked at Amazon for a little over a month and have learned to do five jobs! They are wanting me to be able to do everything when PEAK rolls around. I am looking anywhere and everywhere for a job, because it is just way too tough on me physically. I have lost 50 pounds in the month (about 10 a week)! "
bad,"too much for me. Drama, Drama, Drama. Unfair treatment. they chose who they want to keep. Chose alcoholics and drug takers over sober people who are trying to make it better."
bad,started at about 5:30pm followed by a meeting on our day objective. Once the meeting was over we pretty much on our own. If there was a problem and you needed help it is the worst to try to find management.  During your shift your had 15min breaks but if you where all they way at the back of the building you are out of luck!!!!! you have to sign out of your scanner and if you come back a min late the office will be notified. Nice people to work with but very stressful place to work.
bad,"You have to work really hard for low salary, high target are really hard to achieve, no air condition system, only 1 break time that means you have to work 4 hours without a break"
bad,"employees are fun to work with, short breaks, always working to meet quotes and ten hour shifts"
bad,I would come in and recieve products from skids and then I would also stow them to bins. I also worked in problem solving and in vendor returns where I returned damaged or overstock items to the company it came from. I learned how important it is for items to be done correct so that way customers get the right and correct product. The management was not very good at Amazon.com because they did not know how to talk or treat the employees. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the management. The one thing I enjoyed the most was the friends that I met working there.
bad,A typical day at work would include 10 hours of walking around a warehouse and picking up orders. The warehouse was very hot in the summer and full of noise from forklifts and cherry pickers. The check they gave me never bounced though.
bad,"Not recommeded for a great place to work. As advertised in Amazon's classifieds, Have fun, work hard, and make history. Does not hold true. No fun there."
bad,they dont pay you any where near enough for the amount of work they have you do.
bad,Amazon had some great benefits when I started but then the longer I was there the more they would change how things functioned. Like at first we had monthly bonuses and stock options but eventually they fazed all of that out. Management was good at first but the longer the building was ran the more incompetent management we would have to deal with. And the hours were too much. I mean it was good pay and they gave you time off options but it was never enough. Everyone was trying to get out of there as often as they could. Being there for ten hours straight just wasn’t worth the pay and the other problem was their screening process. I mean they would hire just anybody even some criminal off the street. I often felt like I wasn’t safe when I was working there. No one wanted to follow the rules and management pick and chose when they would enforce them.
bad,"Just like with any job things can always vary, but from my experience it has been a nightmare working for amazon. Benefits and Money are good but it will eat at your physical and mental health very quickly if you already have health problems."
bad,The Compensation is decent but you are overworked and fired if you can’t go fast enough. I would recommend short term but you have 0 Job security here. They literally treat there employee’s like they are disposables
bad,"Getting in is a group hire, as long as you can pass a mouth swab and they take most people even if they have a felony. So be careful who you’re around it’s not always a safe environment and they like to sweep a lot under the rug."
bad,"There were days I actually liked going to work. It really just depends on your manager good fast paced environment."
bad,"Potential to make alot of money though the hours and work itself are less than desirable, way that new employees are brought in leaves the working environment feeling very cliquey."
bad,"Amazon cares about how hard they can push employees. If they cared about anything else, it was not apparent. Injuries and physical stress was common and turnover rate was exceptionally high."
bad,"they will find out sooner than later. the company is not all its advertised to be. if you have a concern HR will start the firing process, so its not an open door company."
bad,"Very demanding workplace for area managers.  Amazon cuts other departments such as safety, learning and HR,.  While cutting other departments manager have to take on these roles while already working 12 hour days"
bad,"Had the job for four weeks. due to peak period some of the pickers didn’t have stations so we would have to wait until they found us stations. Me and another employee had been waiting until after our first lunch to get a station. Eventually one of the managers approached us and gave us both a station number. He told us if someone was in that station, find another one, if you cannot find another one then wait in the canteen until we find one for you. So me and the other employee waited for 4 hours and after our second lunch until someone approached us and told us that the managers were looking for us. When we saw the managers, they pulled us in to an interview room separately and told us we were terminated for gross misconduct just because we waited in the “wrong canteen"
bad,"I was able to move up the ladder at Amazon after performing a grueling amount of work. In hindsight, it may not have been worth it. I now have a very marketable position on my resume, but they also took a lot from me. The downfall, however, has been a serious toll on my mental and physical health. Amazon does more with less, and will run you dry. I just want a job, any job, where the management and requirements are reasonable. Pros: vertical mobility exists more so than other companies. Cons: you will be pulling you hair out because management makes illogical decisions, Amazon runs on a ""more with less"" mentality (like 90% less than what it should be in my opinion, making for quite the hair-pulling experience), and you will get paged on your trip to the beach. The culture is open, but it also incites giving away your personal time, life, and freedom. When they low-balled me for my new position after organizing a hugely successful event and coming in top 10 in the company, I uploaded my resume and decided enough was enough. Amazon is great in the short-term, but deplorable in the long-term. Pay your employees what they're worth and let them breathe. No wonder their turn around rate is terrible."
bad,"working here is a very stressful place,, which wasnt an issue for me,, long nights (worked overnight) i have mixed feelings for working there.. i did feel over worked for little pay but at the same time its really good money and the benefits arer good"
bad,I enjoyed working with my coworkers and my job. The problem is they overwork everyone and once they are injured they don't care what happens to their employees.
bad,"Working for amazon is inconsistent and poor management. You show up every scheduled morning for “huddle” and that’s is where they would give you your route, some days you may have a route and some days you may not. If you don’t not have a route that means no work. If you do get a route you will complete your route and then mandatorily have to go rescue someone else and get their packages and you did not know when you would be off work  the operations managers are rude disrespectful and do not care about you  packages and help them finish delivering"
bad,"I worked there for 3 years and it had its moments but overall its a toxic environment. I worked on the shipdock so that is mainly why I even made it that long. I made many friends and meet the love of my life there. At the end of the day you get a paycheck, yes it should be more for the amount of work we do but still its work. The benefits were amazing and you didn’t have to break your paycheck just to get fgood benefits."
bad,"Terribile. Mille parole riguardo a quanti benefit hai, tipo tavolo da ping pong, palestra e cose così, ma il lavoro dentro fa schifo. Ti trattano come un robot e ti mettono addosso uno stress incredibile. Ogni giorno vengono a dirti se la tua oroduttività va bene o no (cosa che tra l'altro è illegale) e ti mettono ansia oer farti correre di più. Sì, CORRERE, perchè altrimenti non ce la fai a fare quello che ti dicono. Non lavorateci!"
bad,Amazons expectations are inhuman and very impossible for most workers. Every person no matter what job is suffering from some type of work induced injury.
bad,"PMP staff at Manchester are very very dodgy especially the recruitment manager at the oxford court office, they make mistakes and look for invalid reasons to dismiss you (even if you have valid documents). Please avoid PMP agency at all cost, If you want to work for amazon use the other agency called Adecco instead. DONT GO THROUGH PMP RECRUITMENT THEY WILL MESS YOU UP"
bad,It would be a nice place to work if it had a good workflow structure.  Day to day not organized. Management good on paper but not functional in work environment. One hand doesn't know what the other is doing or how to give instruction.  Environment full of clock riders and not enough workers. The hardest part is working with people that don't listen to ideas how to do the job better. The part that was enjoyable was the schedule.
bad,Mandatory overtime is very unreasonable. You have little time to take off. Can get fired for the pettiest reasons. No one truly cares about you as an associate.
bad,"Dont work here. They push you to unreasonable standards. Not worth the pay at all. And if that wasn't fun enough, they will give you extra overtime whenever they'd like. Overtime is another 10 hour day added to your work week. Then those 10 hour work days turn to 11 hours a day. It's just ridiculous. Your break starts the second you scan your last item. You still have to put your items on the conveyor, put the cart away, put the scanner away, and then make it through security to your locker to start your break. Usually takes 5 minutes to go on break 5 minutes to get off break and back to your post, which they want you to scan your first item from break AT THE 15 MINUTE MARK or someone will track the scanner you are using down and talk to you about ""extended breaks"". So you really only have 5 minute breaks. It's lovely."
bad,"Simply put, it's a sink or swim job in a high stress environment. There is definitely a learning curve, but with critical thinking skills and keeping strictly to safety training, new hires will do fine. The managers and veteran workers are fantastic. They are all willing to give advice and help when they can. I've met some amazing people at Amazon and they made it all bearable. Operating equipment gets easier with practice, but keep safety as top priority. Benefits for Blue badge employees are good and one of the few reasons I stayed as long as I did."
bad,Google Amazon employee deaths and you'll see that Amazon literally works their employees to death. The quota is set far too high to be obtained and employees must rush at a deadly dangerous pace often breaking rules to make quota. It's brutal and if that's not bad enough add to it that the warehouse has no air conditioning & approximately 30 people suffer heatstroke each day. #Truth
bad,This place was an amazing job opportunity at first but it's become extremely stressful since they announced 1 day shipping. Ever since then the fulfillment center has been trying to catch up with shipping and it keeps falling behind.
bad,Horrible place to work. If you need some quick cash yes but it is not a career. Worst job experience I ever had. Management is horrible. Rules change ever week there to fire people. That’s why they refuse to have a union there.
bad,"Amazon is the perfect place for someone willing to be overworked. Personally the job wasn’t hard at all I’m strong able and fit young woman but for my mental state I wouldn’t be going back. You aren’t a human to these people , they have robots working for them what do you think they’re expecting ? Go to toilet come back you have your manager asking where you’ve been go to fill my water bottle up return to find manager making notes at my gate. I always work hard whatever job I am in Amazon is very degrading and draining and higher management I’m not sure who they think they are but need to come back down to earth"
bad,They lied about the position to get me to take the job and then the new manager tried to get me to quit.  I would never recommend anyone to ever work at Amazon.
bad,"I worked 5 different positions. Picker, counter, ""inventory"", Tote Rep, High Velocity Picking, and Learning Ambassador.  I was able too meet my quota, and excelled expectations. Management was friendly and I worked along side with ALL dept personnel. I got along great with all my coworkers.  The mentality aspect of it was that every week, Amazon gave everyone more reasons why they would want to fire an employee than keep them. Not good for morale.  It was the tote rep position that put me in the hospital twice. I would have to push a 4X8 heavily loaded tote cart non stop for 12 hours supplying pickers with totes to fill orders. I pushed the cart an average of 21 miles per shift. I asked for help numerous times and denied assistance. Amazons policy was that 15 pickers or above I would receive assistance. But I would have over 15 up to 29 and denied help. But my work ethics pushed me to do it. I would sweat so profusely all the salts in my body would leave a thick smiley face from my stomach to my chest. It would take all my days off to re-hydrate and rest just to do it again.  In December 2018 I suffered from abrasion blisters across the palms of both feet, causing me to have the skin removed and wear bandages until April 2019.      In May of 2019 I was Hospitalized for 3 days. Given 6 IV'S.  All of my internal organs were shutting down,kidneys-liver-stomach-lungs-heart. due to dehydration and Malaysia. I went back to work two days later. the following week I felt ill again. I had to make a difficult decision. I proved to be the best tote rep,and I when they needed a superman"
bad,I worked here as seasonal and came into complications with being in and out of the hospital none of my notes were accepted horrible management easy job just overall unacceptable working place that doesnt care for their employees and youll be lucky to get a break before you even leave off your shift
bad,In simple terms your a robot and are treated as such. Privilege comes if you’re down for kissing butt.  You can be amazing at what you do but that only helps you to get burnt out. Once you’re burnt out you’re deemed useless.
bad,"Bonne ambiance de travail , très respectueux les un enver les  autre"
bad,Ambiente rumoroso ma si sta bene economicamente veramente
bad,"Be prepared to work yourself to death or risk being fired."
bad,You clock in and you're just a number. Must stay for team talk then head on over to all forklifts. Mandatory safety check is needed before heading out to work. Then proceed out to the floor and must pick orders at a required rate.
bad,"Amazon is great pay. I work night shifts Thu, Fri, Sat... Terrible and strict schedule options. Not flexible at all.  Overall, TERRIBLE ALL THE WAY AROUND. Unorganized. They expect you to basically be a robot. You have be on your feet all 10 and 12 hour shifts. Required to meet a very high quota. Meaning you have to work fast paced throughout the WHOLE shift..If you don’t you get written up. 3 write ups= termination. 3 breaks. 1 30 minute paid, 1 30 minute unpaid and 1 paid 15 minute... you only get 2-3 hours of PTO and Vacation time every other week."
bad,Management in my area is weak. Amazon has a list of principles that no one actually go by. My team OPs manager is a bigot. The job itself is simple. They just have a problem hiring and keeping adequate managers. The hardest part of my job is dealing with them wanting us to police each other.
bad,"It was a very hard and crucial job, you're on your feet for 10 hours straight, they lied to us about how fast we should be going which pushed a lot of workers to their limit. Unfair management."
bad,"Amazon bills itself as the most customer-centric place that you would ever want to work. However, it is not employ-centric, you will find that not all policies apply to all employees."
bad,Its ok if you can stand for 10-12 hours straight. If you can learn the skill and go fast for that long then this is for you. They act like you are inhumane and can always have good days. If they warn you too much then you will get written up. They won't tell you depending on the management.
bad,"No direction in my team, loose-talk about customer obsession but no flexibility to do any work that is not in line with few hidden puppet masters in org."
bad,"long hours standing not enough time to eat lunch on 30 minutes, and people need chairs to sit because they ask way to much of its employees to not always be treated fairly, the managers do not communicate well with one another, they are very un organized and need work on communication."
bad,"don't work for them ause they put you on ot for no reason and ot can go 4 11 hr days, 5 12 hr days,or what ever they want to put you on and they don't care"
bad,"Worked on the nightshift for approx 6 weeks, worked in packing department, never done this Kind of work before, but thought of it very good at the beginning, after training  you have to get really fast very quickly, but after a couple of weeks the tiredness sets in, lived off energy drinks all the time, lost a lot of weight, also you never get enough sleep, as before you know it your back to work, would recommend this job if you were usian bolt, training for the Olympics, or doing a marathon, because that's how I felt, I got told to go see my agency of u was getting paid for a v.t.o , 3 days ago only to be told i had a week's notice, was told I had a 9 month contract, the agency's should be clear with you that it's only till xmas that they need you for not lead you on like a carrot in front of a donkey that it's only to work the lead up to xmas, not let you believe  you will be there 9 months, also you see a lot of team leaders just talking in groups, laughing, joking, not doing what most of the employees are doing which is a basically a gym work out but at 100 mph, constantly getting watched aswell, good money but you have to work hard for it, the most enjoyable time being there was at 5.30am home time, you go home to pass out, so if you like to keep fit for 9 hours a day, like working 60 hours a week then this is for you"
bad,They only train you for one day and its watching unnecessary films and they they put you straight to work on day 2. the training does not provide enough time to get their pace. too many people work on top of each other so then you\u can get fired for the workload. they blame you for all of uppermanagements faults that you can not control. DO NOT WORK HERE IT IS A SCAM FOR 15 AN HOUR UNTIL THEY FIRE YOU.
bad,Very presur job dont recomend it if you are a soft person somtime dont even have time to eat but its fast past and time flys bye  always work it doeas slow downn on cristmas
bad,I believe I was fired due to my medical issues.  I believe they only care about your productivity.  If medical conditions interfere with that they will find a way to terminate your employment.
bad,Clock in. Start-up meeting. Get to work. You're being timed. You will be questioned about time spent between end of start-up meeting and first scan. I learned that I was disposable and was of no worth to this company. I could have 30 good days of hitting rate all day long but one bad day and I 'd be questioned about my performance or lack there of. Management is just as disposable. Watched them come and go. Switched to night shift on a dime because it benefits the company. No concern for family life. The hardest part of going to the job was going to the job. The most enjoyable part is clocking out.
bad,"Orders were doubled up too many times on delivering  Restaurant food and orders to customers by Dispatch or computer error.  They expect perfection and timeliness no matter what the conditions ( bad traffic, food or orders not ready at Restaurant or from Fullfillment Warehouse Centers) and this caused me to be late to the 2nd to 4th orders repeatedly causing frustrations to me and customers."
bad,"All the rumors of amazons culture and being a sweat shop is true, they attempt to cover it in a pretty bow. But if you need to work, it's there. Just don't be fooled. At about the 30 day mark, you will notice a change in the understanding of your personal work style."
bad,Working at Amazon was a pretty awful experience as they initially said the contract was for 3 months but after a month the management decided to let the majority of the staff go without pre warning and this was just after Christmas.
bad,"There's a lot of noise day-to-day, usually from the Nerf fights. If you don't mind working in a loud call center environment, it's not that bad. You also have to be able to live with working for Amazon."
bad,don't work at amazon unless you're really good at being a suck up they scare away all the hard workers and keep the butt kissers can't keep hardworker
bad,"They simply don't care about people who have disabilities, they push on you to make that Percentage of scans."
bad,I worked this job right out of undergrad while I was going to law school at night time. This job was not a long-term career option for me as I was pursuing my advanced degree while employed. Left this job for a career advancement opportunity.
bad,Its a very fast paced and stressful work environment with poor management teams. If you are not a fast paced worker then they will terminate you without question
bad,en el puesto de trabajo no se organizaban nada bien
bad,"Amazon puts the wrong people in management positions.  The company is growing too quickly for its own good, and proper training is not valued.  Attitudes are very bad and culture is one that is very arrogant.  Amazon basically creates robots out of its employees, while operating under the facade of valuing creativity."
bad,"management is constantly reigning in employees like toddlers, using patronizing and belittling statements to drive employees not to socialize and keep their mind on their work. minimal climate control in the building. no margin of acceptance for illness or outside factors that require time away from the job. I had back to back wisdom tooth surgeries and on top of that the stomach flu; even though I was able to provide valid doctor's notes outlining recovery time necessary, I was fired. not only was I fired, I was made to come in to work, do the stretching warm up with all other employees, begin my task, and then was pulled aside and escorted out of the building and ""let go"". if you are not 100% dedicated to sorting and shipping packages and you have a real life, with real life issues, this is not the best company to work for. if you live and breath saran wrap, cardboard, and packing tape, this is the place for you."
bad,"Salary, overtime, Transport, meal Coupons is attractive, work culture is not so good, people work individually than work like a Team. No cross Trainings. Politics by top management. Internal hiring decisions are based of favoritism than on performance. Annual hikes are based on favrtisim. Break tools are introduced for HR Team as well like Customer support. Too much micro management.  Performance metrics are not designed well. No fixed week off,"
bad,They use you during peak season and make you feel special as an employee. Once peak season is over they began to show there true colors. Also they do a lot of VTO because they don’t have a lot of work. You are not appreciated after peak season they start looking for ways to get rid of you. They also hire a lot of young people to be in management who has no experience. This company is a joke.
bad,"Everything about going to work in this place is ok. You clock in with your badge, look at the board to see what you are doing and you grab an RF gun to go do your assigned function. It was very easy and fun to do. Kept me busy all day. However most Amazon employees will not like the fact that you are temp and will feel threatened by your presence. I was a temp for about 2 years and they never hired me full time. This is why I used competitive in this manner. As long as the full time employees complain about temps, they wont hire any of them. And thats why I left. I gave this place way more time then I should have and I dont plan on coming back or I would not recommend this place not even to my worst enemy."
bad,There were a lot of politics here. I made it a point to make myself ineligible for rehire. There is a lot of favoritism and dishonest management. Lack of advancement for those who speak the truth/ their own opinions that are opposite management's.
bad,This job is just not good it was absolutely awful. For. The long hours to the short breaks. This job I wouldn't recommend to anyoine. And get ready for walking like 12-13 miles a day
bad,"A typical day at Amazon starts at 7:30 am. The hours are pretty long, and not much room for error is left. management is highly critical on error, and there is a quota that needs to be met. The pay is not very good."
bad,"it left to  be desired, it was quite bad paid according to the work. there was no enjoyable part in this job, you have to walk a lot during a working day."
bad,I just wouldn't recommend this job to no one. The benefits are pretty good that's the only plus for this job. Breaks are extremely short and so is lunch
bad,"At first I was excited but on the first day they lost me because they didn’t know what to do. We signed up for Wednesday-Saturday shift and we not even on that shift they have us working when they want us to work. It’s a lot of walking the breaks are terrible they are to short, we work long hours to be having short breaks."
bad,This job is slave labor at it's best... can't say it any other way you work ten hour days at 11.75 an hr 10 minute breaks and 20 minute lunch breaks.  You are constantly on your feet ten hours straight restrooms are five minutes away and so is break rooms. you are constantly confronted about time off task (tot) which means if you go to the restroom often the managers confront you about your time off task.  It is constant work for wages not worth it.  Managers are not friendly are helpful they set you up for failure.  If you don't pick up a cart do to low workloads that's considered time off task too.
bad,"Very competitive workplace. If you don't make rates, they will fire you. Great for having a lot of last minute overtime. They don't accept doctor's notes if you're sick or have an emergency. They will deny medical leave and fire you for it. They are very cut throat and have a high turnover for a reason."
bad,"This is a good place for people who have indirect work, but for the laborers it is awful. Poor training and time to learn your position are lacking.  After 2 days of basic training you are on your own, put in areas you have had no training; seeking, asking and listening to help takes time and your rates go down.  Company only cares about your rates on productivity and accuracy.  If you aren't a good fit at one position they will not take a chance on you in another position in the entire warehouse where you could excel, they dismiss you.  You are managed by computers and computer write-ups. Turn over among new employees is extremely high!"
bad,Its a ok place to work but you are require to do so much if not you will get fired! 2 weeks of training really just to log in or log out is time consuming plus 10 min brakes really! I would not recommend working here only if you really want to be miserable.
bad,"Work, work, work is all the supervisors want from you. I really did't see an equal opportunity among the leadership. We it came to making people do equal amount of work they would not make some people do it. Regardless, of making a point to let them know or even showing them that a certain group of people was trying to do the easiest part of the work and stirred away from the hard work."
bad,"Amazon is not a good place to work. Offer 4 10 hr days and tell you not much mandatory overtime. I asked before taking job what overtime is like because didn't want a lot of mandatory overtime. I was told only a couple weeks during Dec. In 3 months have only worked 2 40 hr work weeks. The rest 50 and 60! Besides not claiming the truth, not even a Monday-Thursday shift so you work every week on a weekend day. No weekends off to enjoy family"
bad,"The job started out decently, easy work, nice pay, good benefits, decent management. With new management came horrible work conditions. The hours were random, one week I'd work 20 hours, the next, 55. I had no time for anything outside of work, no time for school or friends."
bad,The hardest part of the job was keeping a good rate because bins were so full it was hard to pack things efficiently and correctly the way the company wanted us to do it.
bad,They make up so many different rules everyday to get you fired be careful at any amazon company. And it's not a union to fight for you so it like they can do what ever they want without no explanation.
bad,I have been at amazon for 3yrs loved my job at first until it became to stressful i became very unhappy so and thats when i knew it was time to go because they dont care about  there employees your just a login that can be fired at any moment
bad,"12 hour shifts short breaks and a lot of overtime, it is a lot of hard manual labor so the pay is decent but 12 hour shifts give you no time for anything other than a quick meal and bed before going back to slave all day"
bad,"Terrible hours, promise of great earnings, instead was working 12 hour shifts for 45 pounds a day (which is about half the money than working for minimum wage)"
bad,"The hours were too long, most days required standing in the same position for 10 hours straight doing the same repetitive work over and over with no change. The work was not challenging in the slightest after 10 minutes the rest of the day was spent looking at the clock waiting for the shift to end. The people were friendly and easy to get along with (including permanent mangers) however the agency was very strict and offered no incentive to keep hitting targets. It is impossible to do this job for any extended period of time as it is so mind-numbing. The best part of the day was leaving."
bad,"U can work really hard for this company and if u mess up just a lil they we let u go really fast, they say they care about u but they really don't.  all they care about is numbers not the people who works hard. ask anybody there about break time, u only get really is a 9-10 min. break for a 10-11 hr days they r crazy. it takes u 2-3 walk to the break room and 2-3 walk back  u do the math.  to many managers telling u what to do. These workers need to get paid more at Amazon.!!!  Walmart's warehouse get's better pay, lot's of people here left Amazon to Walmart  to better them self. U go to work each day thinking em i getting fired today, not fun"
bad,"When I worked for this company , it was alot of favoritism . Upper Management was NOT organized. and they laid off alot of good workers after working with them for years and months because they were lazy on submitting background checks and waited a whole year to start doing them and laid off the people who didn't pass background checks after being their for years. Alot of the people lost their homes and cars and are now struggling because of the way they ran their business. we were also punished for being fast and efficient at our jobs by making us do extra work and not being rewarded or recognized for it ."
bad,"A typical day at Amazon consisted of walking through metal detectors, scanning items in solitary, and binning items. The management is very unorganized and unfriendly. You are to work alone with no contact ot people. The hardest part of my job was being confined with no music or human interaction. I enjoyed the wear house feel and always having a task list on had to keep track of my progress."
bad,"Amazon can be very stressful. They have mandatory overtime which leaves you absolutely no time to spend with friends or family. I've never worked at a company that had this high of a manager turnover rate. The days are long, boring, and there is a good chance you will be fired for something that you have no control over what-so-ever. However, If you need cash, and don't mind working 10 Hr. shifts, this is the place for you."
bad,Amazon has a great benefits program.  The reason most people decide to leave is because they have a max out at $12.50 after three years.
bad,wasn't bad in the begin but as you get more experienced the less they car about you. at times they don't give you what you require to complete the job
bad,"A typical day of work is complete chaos, little strategy or purpose, and doing the equivalent of at least 2 FTEs of work. This is just standard, how they do things. Management is very hit or miss and largely depends on your role and team. You'll work with some of the smartest people in the world, for however briefly you are there. The hardest part of the job is losing all personal time, spending both days and nights working. You'll learn a lot and hopefully be more marketable once you are so burned out you can't take it anymore, which usually takes less than 2 years."
bad,"i worked 12 hour dhifts mon /sun one day off.The travelling hors where 14 a week so as you can imagine it was work work work ,with me not drinking ,wasnt a problem needed money.the hardest part was keeping you body and brain going at the same time or it could be boring ,music was always my answer ,kept me going ,."
bad,Azienda che da uno stipendio da commercio e non da logistica puntuale nei pagamenti manager (capi turno) neolaureati senza ne arte né parte azienda con problemi di organigramma in alcuni casi anche gravi pretendono e in cambio oltre a 1250 euro non danno ne aspettative di continuità ne possibilità di crescita se non per gente che concede favori oltre l'ambito lavorativo se non trovate niente va bene altrimentialtrimentiebenevvbenaavaaltraltrepropoststate
bad,Most un safe and unprofessional place I’ve ever been  one if the many fires  they put fans on it and continued to work people for over 15 min with the building full of smoke. Finally the security guard pulled the alarm to get people out  one of too many examples
bad,"Amazon doesn't care about employee's, they only care about the work load. No such thing as a blue badge anymore as they want blue badges low enough to stay open and avoid tax. If they have more than that they sack them and get temps. The secruity don't care if someone breaks into someone else's locker because majority of the camera's don't work, so it's unsafe to leave your stuff there during shift."
bad,"Pretty much they had me waiting for over a month and a half to tell me I'm not certified, alrighty, at least tell me a week later than a month and a half,  (They kept on sending me emails telling me they haven't forgotten about me, and to wait and then boom, you're not certified with no explanation) From far what I could remember, I used to work there before and left off good terms, leadership was all over the place anyway's, and due to respect for some of them I'm not even going to start, Good reddens."
bad,"Great payroll, opportunities are possible but quite a wait, normal schedule is understandable, well diverse amount of people. Breakroom provided but breaks are short."
bad,Not as good managers weren’t the best to work with and the job was terrible  ain’t for people with short breathes ffs s d h y w d h r d h u e s hi t e d u r e
bad,"You don't get no breaks but they gone take it out your check. They expect you to deliver 180 plus packages daily or you are garbage to them. They don't tell you this job is seasonal when hired but when fired in the 2nd week in December (common sense). You take a drug test, go to class, and they run your background for 6 weeks. They keep the ones with low driver ratings, that don't take breaks, and the ones that throw their packages."
bad,"Ma io credo che tutta questa frenesia e data dalle persone che credono che si devono sbrigare, in base a quello Un algoritmo registra i tempi e in base a quei tempi registrati non si può andare più sotto e tutta colpa di Chi vuole Sbrigarsi. Questa non è vita.... e chi  fa tutto di corsa e non pensa che registrando quei dati amazon ti chiede ogni giorno di più e ti devi adeguare a quei dati perché in base a quello si può fare"
bad,"Although the pay is nice, the work hours are quite ridiculous and the expectations that they place upon you are just as ridiculous. They expect you to work in complete isolation and not move from the same 3 x 5 area the entire 10 hour shift. Their “standard brakes” or 15 minutes long which they say includes a five minute walking Period. That’s two 10 minute breaks a day. What a joke."
bad,"I went to two jobs event at Amazon. I expected the time they give while I applied, I will work around this time. At the event, they said they don’t This time. Then, I replied it won’t for me. When I said it won’t work, the guy replied with a very rude, “ we don’t have a job for you.” Instead to try working out something with me. The way they offers their shifts are completely ridiculous. They trying to make you think they are very flexible they aren’t. In reality, it just a scam I do not believe they have jobs to offer people. Those hiring managers are so rude and offensive when they talked to people. I attend those event at a church in Brockton avoid it if you can. I don’t have any ideas about the other locations."
bad,I worked for this company for over 7 years and I wasn't satisfied with their work ethic They treat their employees like robots and there's no growth on my end if I continue to stay with them.I provided all the service that was needed but I guess it wasn't enough.
bad,Travaille trop stesan toujours pressé car ils faut satisfaire le client coûte que coûte donc IL faut roulait de plus en plus vite
bad,The management didn’t really communicate at all and I really want my job back but they’re hiring procedures or discriminatory and they hire younger people
bad,"Few managers not having people management skills, but become a manager by the blessing of his manager. "
bad,30 min breaks. Thats are really like 20 because of food preparation. 10 hours of standing which is not good for your body. Do not work here. Bad balance of health
bad,"after being in the business world i decided to try amazon as a change of pace.  their turnover is over 50% and if you dont make production you are terminated after a period of time. they hire 'off the street' (college hiring fairs) for managers before hiring in house staff for managers. I have done 'ambassador' duties (training new agents) and 'problem solver' as well as part time/seasonal ""PA"" (production assistant-assisting a area manager) and was never able to make area manager or full time 'PA'. the place is hard on your knees, hands, arms and you are not allowed electronics (cell phones) on the production floor (except for area managers and above of course). to learn to work HARD it's a pretty good job but for a career not so much. i would NOT recommend amazon ever despite very good medical benefits."
bad,I worked for Amazon flex .The money was great.Tampa Florida on Adamo drive. I’m going to put this out there.That place delivery they have people there stealing block and sale to the Spanish people that don’t have a green card to work in this country..This tall Spanish guy makes a living off people that don’t have a green card . I see it time and time again.The manger knows that he doing it. Thisandthe people he working
bad,"NO comment, this was an unpleasant experience and no room for growth. I would not recommend  Amazon as a place to work. they do not care about experience, just degrees."
bad,A 3rd party company should not be used for calling off/bereavement days its very inconvenient and is the reason i no longer work there. HR at the site is no help they give you the run around which ends in wrongful termination.
bad,Bad  I hated it they suck they were mean and in fair and unprofessional and it seems to be the only thing they care about is quota so that being said it is also an in safe place to work
bad,"Highly recommended that you are in somewhat physical shape and bring two pair of shoes as you will be walking around a warehouse for your entire shift. Unless you are licensed to operate forklifts and other related machinery; you will have a very demanding day, everyday. There is minimal iteration with anyone in the management. Unless of course, you aren't making rate. At that point, you WILL be seen by one of your departments supervisors. Personally, the starting pay is what brought me to the company. After working for the company, I would definitely like to see them their wages for the workload they are requiring."
bad,"I worked at Amazon for 3 years. I was hard working and everyones go to and got fired for a BS reason. HR is terrible there. There are a few really great managers, but most don't care about their associates."
bad,"Great place, loved everyone that I came across. "
bad,"very stressful, no commucation too many hours no family life  , to many people in the wrong roll , hours were long lack of discipline to associates Great place if you like to work a lot"
bad,"This company is huge and doesn't know how to communicate! It takes sometimes weeks to get anything done as far as a conversation. If you hurt yourself they , tell you that you have to see workers comp and then push you aside."
bad,"Dont go negative in upt, keep your rates high, never go to HR for help, dont be time off task and you never see managers until they write you up. You get wrote up alot there."
bad,Amazon is a wonderful place to work I'm still there just trying to find another job to go along with it for more hours management is great couldn't ask for better
bad,"the terminated all Amazon driver positions that were on amazon payroll. You had a choice to work for ""partner"" logistic company set up under their roof driving amazon vans, delivering amazon packages, but with a  sub-contractor. reduced pay from $17.25 hour to $15-$16.50 with either no benefits or less benefits. Very unethical."
bad,"Not everyone is the same and can do things as super fast as maybe two or three people but they want the whole building to measure up to those few and if you don't they fire you. They never considered that those few fast people were probably on energy drinks or something else. Management's expectations were ridiculous and never appreciated the work you did do, but only acknowledged the work you missed. WE ARE NOT ROBOTS!!!!"
bad,"Management harassing you, long hours, getting yelled at for going to the bathroom... things that are constant there during the holiday season. The AmCare of this building refuses to take care of you nor let’s you leave if you’re feeling very ill or in pain. If you want decent pay for a while and benefits, it’s a decent place to work, but you better get walking shoes and a smart watch because you can’t have your phone on you, and it’s a big building."
bad,Nie polecam pracy w sosnowcu. Po 1 co denerwuje w amazonie to ze praca nie jest rowno mierna. Jak jestes na stow to zapierdzielasz po 20 wozkow dziennie chodz wszystkie przegrody sa zapelnione i jak zrobisz w 1 alejce pol wozka to jest mistrzostwo swiatw. A sa tez tacy ci siedza na kompie 10h i nic nie robia. Pozatym firma oszukuje na wynagrodzeniu. Za miesiac mojej pracy bez l4 jakis uzetek itd dostalem 2300 zl natomiast osoby z mojej zmiany ktore nie braly nagodzin dostaly 2590 jak to jesr liczone? Nie mam pojecia ale znam conajniej 50 osob co zostalo tak oszukane. Wiadomo ktos powie ze 200zl to nie majatek ale jednak na to 200zl trzeba caly dzien pracowac prawda? Obiadow nie oceniam za zl bo ich nie jadlem dlamnie to dosx smieszne zwlaszcza na zmianie nocnej gdzie obiad jesr o polnocy... a i do wszystkich osob to 15% premi co mowia to oszustwo znam conajniej 200 ludzi z tamtad nikt nigdy premi nie dostal przynajmiej w sosnowcu. Ogolem ttaktuja cie tam jak taniego robocika nie doac ze pracujesz to codzienbie podchodzi jajis typek ktory sie cb pyta o wszystkie zasady firmy nie raz nawet 30 minut przez co leci norma. Ludzie wiekszosc ok liderzy tez mili tutaj plus.
bad,"I enjoyed my time with people, the pay and benefits. But I couldn't grow past my position which frustrated me. The perks were great for morale. I'm glad that the employees are currently getting close to adequate pay"
bad,"Ridiculous rates, very political, 10 hour work days, repetive work. If your a good worker and can hit rates your good but they will use you up. Many workers walk around and get away with it. Stay clear of this place if you care about your body. Horrible"
bad,"They say Amazon’s number 1 priority is safety, which is false. Unless your stowing at a 350 or 400 units per hour your most likely going to have PAs or AMs complaining all day. I worked at TPA1, never again worst 2 years of my young adult life. 20yrs old and my backs hurting like I’m 60. Also HR is very disrespectful. There’s no communication whatsoever between anybody. DO NOT WORK AT AMAZON. BENEFITS ARE NOT WORTH IT."
bad,"long hours, short breaks, food trucks was a plus, not enough space for products you'll never make your productivity numbers because your looking for a space to place an xbox, they also don't allow you to talk to anyone else"
bad,"Work is rough. Time is strictly kept, if you are 5 minutes late you will lose an hour of UPT. Feet get sore fast, so get some comfortable shoes, because concrete is horrible to stand on for extended periods of time. Also, the job is horribly monotonous."
bad,"Overall, this was a very difficult position. You work long hours and do not get a chance to eat. Upper management is very hard on you and it is more of a management position versus leadership. Very unhealthy work conditions."
bad,"Management was ""ok"", pretty terrible place to work. Two fifteen minute breaks that were more like ten minute. one lunch that is only thirty minutes long. Not a lot of rest in a ten hour day."
bad,While working at Amazon I work four days out of the week and twelve hours on the days that I worked. If you're pregnant I wouldn't suggest the job because of how much they criticize you leaving your station. It isn't easy to move up in the company and for the 6 months of me working there I went through 3 supervisors who didn't start with the company.
bad,There management system is poor. They do not communicate with team members. They are not equal with there employees who work hard. They are not equal at all.
bad,I do not recommend working for Amazon. They do not care about employees and expect you to over work yourself. It is also extremely hot in the summer months.
bad,The management doesn't care about anything but numbers.  There was too much walking.  They stopped the huddles after day three.  I fell off a ladder and hurt my knee and told my manager.  The only thing he cared about was me accounting for my time when I was in my station the entire time!!!
bad,"Company isn't employee friendly. I worked for them for just over a year, never late, never absent until recently because of a hospital visit. Terminated the next day."
bad,"Poor training, set up for failure, no advancement or cross training, manager have no understanding on how to utilizing their employees abilities and knowledge on varies tasks. No consideration for loyalty nor dependability."
bad,"Surfboard, bugle boys and cheerleaders every day, depending on what team wins is how you come out. Run to you station than run behind the winners normally you don't come out, hit the bench till they get rid of you. They act like a bunch of bunnies hip-hop to their tone. I was told enter in cross a line of no return then asked by them for the game of star track from me to win like getting hired but having to win the job at the same time, and boy did I blank right up out of there, don't think I didn't try to win, everybody needs a job."
bad,the pay and the benefits are fair. the management was very self oriented. they stay on top of safety inside the building to stay way from trouble with lawyers. A worker was killed by a trucker leaving amazon and another woman slipped our their steps outside the same day because the safety team ignored the dangerous weather reports instead of sending workers home early. 90% of management only care about their group ratings instead of their groups needs. Breaks are 15 minutes but it takes 3 minutes minimum to get to any break room which leaves you with 9 minutes for a break. lunch breaks are 30 but the lines to sign out are way too long. you have to make sure you sign out within 4 minutes of lunch or you'll get penalized for signing back in 4 minutes after your lunch. there are lines for microwaves and vending machine which takes longer to eat lunch. They care abut productivity more than your self concerns.
bad,A lot of people come and go. Pay sucks! Benefits are awsome! The management team I was under was great. You work hard for the amount you get paid! The the health benefits are great!
bad,"Easy warehouse work, but I didn't approve of their business practices. I learned that management in every department is extremely incompetent! I hated being told to work faster!"
bad,I was like you were supposed to be a robot.  It would have been better if you could listen to music  it helps. I also think that they should  let you know where they plan to put you before you expect the job.  Not ahow up on your first day of work and tell you. They should also move people  who  cant reach quota  to other positions i also think  that  as much as they value their customers they should  equally  value their employees. Just like the  customer without employees uour business  wont move.
bad,hated working there to many hrs for things they didnt need or have.Good benefits but you also had to work your butt off and there is no sitting down except on breaks
bad,"I do not recommend AVP1 to anyone. The hours aren't the problem;  the work is ridiculously rated and they expect more of you each time you raise a concern. My coworkers were for the most part unapproachable and simply not desirable to have around.  Management never knew what was going on, problems were always passed onto others instead of being solved right away. End of Line is an impossible position to make rate,  there's no organization,  and they don't care if you do what you can unless you meet their rate."
bad,Horrible place to work if your trying to move up and also horrible if you cant move fast from 6:30 to 6:00!! They tell you youll get a 15min break but really it only ten mins sometimes less. bathroom far away and by the time you go there. Your rate goes down and you cant in trouble and yelled at.
bad,"Low pay, back breaking pace, no sitting, managers under enormous pressure to perform.  Associates basically work in a sweatshop, with Safety hovering around to fire you."
bad,All for them and nothing for us. There is nothing that Amazon wants to do for the employees. Now hiring seasonal employees that way there is no medical or any benefit for the employees.
bad,always having to rush not able to go to the restroom with out being asked where you were. great exercise. able to build a lot of friendships.had access to food trucks for lunch which was a plus.
bad,"Poor management, young adults with no person skills, very little training skills trying to relate to persons already established on job. management never stays very long."
bad,Not a good place to work if you looking for a work home to grow. That is it that is all I have to say not professional at all. They don't care about the workers.
bad,I can say that Iove the team I was on I just couldn't stand the manager. They get the tittle in they head and start acting stupid!! No matter how hard you work you feel like you at not appreciated!!!
bad,I am just going to write what ever because I'm in a hurry and don't have time to write a review and they are forcing me to. This job was fast paced and very difficult if your an older person.
bad,Your job is not secure no matter how hard you work. They have a high turnover and make many promises that they rarely keep. They promote friends versus the hard working people.
bad,It's just awful. So awful. Terrible hours. 4 hour shift feels like 100. I cannot live off the small amount of money they pay us each week. Not a place to work for long.
bad,"Besides the pay and benefits being good, over all the management, department leaders and HR are a complete joke and a bunch of kids. They do nothing other than lie right to your face, watching YouTube listening to music while everyone else is working, failure to follow company policy which is forced onto employees exp: (cellphone in warehouse area), failure to LISTEN to employees and ACT, failure on attitudes AND being positive, failure to become a leader and over stepping that line, huge failure on SAFETY, huge favoritism between employees and department leaders, NO PRODUCT means waste of time and gas to where they offer VTO (Voluntary Time Off) and the security their is just as worse. They have NO RESPECT for the employees who work there while they just sit there for most part. Think twice before applying. Unless you don't mind these conditions which has a HUGE turn around which everyone agrees on AND talks about, all power to you and best of luck."
bad,They fire you as soon as you’re not needed much anymore even though they promised so much more and I waited for this job for a long time. They literally didn’t even bother telling me that I am no longer in until arriving to work and my pass wasn’t working and then they let me know. It’s a shame really
bad,"I don't and will not ever suggest anyone work for this company. I was really excited about working for Amazon. This was until I saw how they treated their employee's. They treat you just like a number, want IMPOSSIBLE rates. You are basically a slave and if you can't meet their goals, there's a write-up waiting for you. Don't expect any time off during peak season. Management is all sorts of messed up there, at least on my shift it was. They will find reasons for you to "
bad,I would not consider anyone to take  this job offer if received. very unprofessional and unfair management. very huge warehouse with lots of errors that need to be fixed in a timely manner or you will be at fault for it.
bad,Think if people were in a position they were properly trained and fit for it could be a great company. I felt there was no where to go for correct information or help. It was as if employees ran the place but were not fit to do so
bad,"i worked at two buildings, in two states. The company as a whole is great to work for with amazing benefits. The individual sites are where you can have either a good or bad experience. There is good and bad management. Good and bad coworkers. You must work, theres no slacking, or you will not meet your goals. If youre not lazy, you will have no problems."
bad,Working at Amazon was horrible. I hated the management there was no organization with the company or management lots of confusion and no one having answers to many questions.
bad,It feels impossible to balance your life with your work.  Your shifts are 10 hours long and start at strange times.  The pay feels like the bare minimum you should get to work these shifts (ESPECIALLY if you work night) and the benefits just seem like a way to try and keep you for at least a year so you don't want to immediately quit.
bad,"Lots of favoritism, work like a slave. Not family orientated like they say they are. Terrible communication. Changes minds a lot. Changes stories to fire you...make you pay for stuff you win. etc, etc"
bad,One of the worst jobs i have worked at. Hours are too long and i felt we should have got more pay rate for what we was doing. Management is poor and they don't work with each other. They fire you amd hire you that's all that Job is about. I do not recommend this job too anyone.
bad,That illegal immigrants made it very bad for the American people have their background checks it was great working there but the management was not knowledgeable of his job
bad,i came in at 6am and left at 6pm i went from a-z picking orders to be shipped everything was timed and you had to find the right things or the scanner would buzz lunch was quit but the money was worth it
bad,"They basically watch over you like you are a slave and the company basically makes is seem like the employees are suppose to be robots. They don't want you to talk, laugh, or even go to the bathroom while you are working. Hr is always on the managers side even though they know the manager is wrong. And plus after 2 years of working there you don't get bonuses anymore and oh god don't be an area manager you get paid once a month and no over time pay even though they have to come to work early and leave work late and that is terrible."
bad,it was too stressfull and too much drama. managers didnt care and hr was worse. the hours were horrible and it was painful on the body to work there..
bad,I was very invested in company to be let go and the problem is management is hired from college with no on job exp in which advancement should be from within
bad,"Typical day is clock in, meet at stand up, talk about current amazon events if there is none do stretches, grab your scanner if you're doing counts or laptop if you're problem solving. Go to your assigned station and scan, scan, scan, scan, scan until its either your first break, lunch or second break then you go home. The challenge here is management. Management and HR are HORRIBLE at this organization. How nobody has blown the whistle on amazon warehouse yet is mind boogling."
bad,Prace me velice bavila vedeni bylo uzasne...jen agentura nejedna fer.
bad,amazon has a  high turnover rate. The management was ok in some working areas. It is easy to experience job alienation. The pay was ok. But the benefits were good.
bad,They have great benefits but its a terrible job its like modern day slavery !! You do the same job daily and they make it hard to transfer to a different department or just evolve period !!
bad,No stable hours they just use you and send you packing I wouldn't waste my time here again they send you home if there is no work have you come up there for no reason they can be more organized.
bad,Benefits and wages are sweet deal but other than that management is not where i expected to be. Every work day is basically doing same thing and there is nothing to learn in a workplace comparing other workplaces where there are more opportunities to learn something every single day.
bad,Lots of running around. Hard to make rate. Messy. Work you 4 days 10 hours with 3 days off but your so exhausted you don't do anything but rest on your days off.
bad,"Very hard place to work for, benefits and pay is good but management and HR department needs some work- workers needs are not listened to or taken into consideration"
bad,Its a fun place to work if you are a machine. They are all about numbers and not quality. Their production rate is more important than the way the product looks.
bad,"That place is heartless and very filthy. They sure do have a lot of favoritism. Harassment in a hostile is what they deal with. employers supposed to provide a healthy environment for their staff."
bad,"The job sucks, don't ever work here. Pay is good, but working really blows. Long hours are cool for some jobs, but working here is insane."
bad,"nothing good to say about this company. management is all politics and although they say they care about their associates and their input, they do the complete opposite."
bad,"Poor management and communication from managers and HR team. Good health insurance though. Little to no vacation and personal time. Lots of overtime. Also, good work environment. Safe. Team members are helpful."
bad,My review of Amazon is that it can be a good place to learn and grow leadership skills...However it seems like you must watch what you say and who you say things to...And not only that you have to dig deeper in the learning of being a order picker driver as far as using the scanner and making quota everyday and staying on top of the situation without asking for help seemingly..
bad,nous sommes soumis à un fort rendement mais dans l'ensemble ca va
bad,"I started as seasonal and worked my way up to a ""permanent"" employee which is bull, because you can get fired at anytime. You need to make a rate and if you don't, you will be written up and eventually fired. Making rate is fairly easy, but when you do, they expect even more. There is no pleasing the managers."
bad,I would come in and check everything to see if everything is the way it supposed to be. I would usually have to prep vegetables. After that I would assist on the front line and try to keep everything filled and or clean.
bad,There were changes in the job almost everyday. New rules or system programs that didn't really benefit the workers but were set up to make us fail. I learned problem solving skills and basic wear house functions. The managers were always changing. My co-workers were always a joy to be around. There were many different people from many backgrounds. I learned so much from my co-workers. The hardest part was the long hours and trying to keep up a good rate with dry lines. The co-workers were the best part of the job.
bad,its a hard place to work and it is very unfair the people you will be working with are a laugh and they do make it okay but the management is a joke and its not a place you want to work for a long period of time and that would be if they kept you on and its a 95 percent chance they wont so if u go for this job id only make it temp i worked their for 4 years and was happy to get out
bad,"There was hardly any communication within management. They put everyone in different places constantly. They would do this and act like you knew what you were suppose to do. When in reality you would be wandering aimlessly for an hour trying to find someone who knew what they were talking about. You could be the quietest and most efficient worker and they still would complain about your performance. The devalued their workers every day. It was like trying to win a losing battle working with them. It got to the point where I would come in a feel like a zombie. I didn't want to talk to anyone in fear of being barked at by the ""management"", or even process guides with big egos thinking they knew it all after being there for a week, and were younger than you. There is nothing like having a job take the life out of you and making you into a person you never wanted to be. It isn't worth to pay. Just don't do it!  "
bad,"It was a great experience, the work is very easy , But the management over works you, they don’t care about your health ,or have any consideration for employees."
bad,I wish that weekends could be alternated. I hate the hours especially. The people in Human Resources are really rude at MKE1. The manager shows favoritism. You cannot give feedback. Even if they do ask for feedback they will never make changes. The work and hours is too long and hard to do. They constantly repeat the same things at stand-up. I am seeking another job.
bad,"Even if you get inside the busines, your still expendable and corporate really doesn't care about you. The work is easy but there is not security or advancement."
bad,Job was cool at first until you become good at what you do and they take advantage. Sometimes induct/Unloader push too many packages on the belt causing everyone to be backed up. Need to raise the pay because this work can be very stressful. Only a 3 day work week but have opportunities to come in for extra time. If you NEED  a job quick yeah but if you don’t like being a slave NO
bad,"Utter garbage"
bad,Honestly Amazon got my bills paid but DCA1 learning ambassadors didn’t tell me everything I needed to know which led me to leaving the company. It is a good company overall it’s just the management.
bad,"My experience working @ Amazon ""sort center"" was good and i enjoyed it. I then transfered to the fulfillment center because I thought it would of help me out in many ways. I wish i NEVER switched. They want way to much from us associates. Piercing sounds from the belts that can seriously damage your ears."
bad,"Amazon while good pay it's very stressful, it's hard to get help outside if the warehouse and it's hard on people with disabilities. I got an investigation against me for something that wasn't my fault and they didn't care."
bad,"Not even a month ago did I get hired and I hate it here already. It’s literally the same thing over and over and over and over again. Its very boring. And you cant really associate with other people because we at like our own station. It hard to make friends unless u actually put in effort to be somebody’s friend. And then they constantly give you SO many packages and the pods will come in like 6” or 9” when you need a 18” or 16”. And then they want to complain about your takt time and be like “oh, you can fit the box in there, just make some adjustments and make it fit” yet they dont want u to force things in the pods. Like what? I came in this job thinking it will be reasonable considering that we new but no they still give us a takt time that needs to be around 14 or better. It literally seems impossible unless you’re really really fast and get all the right pods at the right time. If you want a life, dont work here, ur going to be working literally half ur day. The 12 hour shifts seems soooooo long and boring considering you dont really have people to talk to. Then they only give u 2 30 min breaks they goes by quick because u got to walk 3-4 mins long to get to the cafe and get through them annoying security guards. On top of that you have to be DIRECTLY on time for work, if ur over 5 mins late, they would take off a whole hour from your work. And make sure you have a credit card if u want lunch because the machines only take cards. This job sucks! I would never recommend it to anybody."
bad,"Working for Amazon was okay getting your full hours until we found out we would never be full-time BLUE BAGE employees. Then being tricked to switch over to the NEW DSP companies and not getting full hours not being able to move up due to your experience with being a previous driver. This is the worst thing within this company and it hasn’t been a  good month yet looking for a new job. The pay for the labor every other week it’s enough to live"
bad,They are not professional at all they talk back to you they treat you like a slave they overwork you they don't care if you fall out and pass out there going to say go to the ER room sit down for 15-20 minutes back to the floor you go
bad,Just don't it's not worth it. The company as a whole sucks and I honestly feel like there is no security in my job. Like you can be replaced and they won't think twice about it.
bad,"A typical day at work is 10 hours of excessively repetitive physical labor. Job expectations are almost impossible to meet, and are constantly being raised. There is absolutely no job security. The only perk of this job was the benefits."
bad,"Work environment is good. All the colleagues and processes are streamlined. There are certain process where you are made compulsory to assist customers in a language you barely know. That in turn hits your performance and nobody is there to listen you or provide any assistance. The managers, group managers and HR are not willing to help even after a formal complaint. No assistance given by HR's on issued raised. The environment has become toxic over a year now. They local Managers are biased towards people coming from different states- let it be manager or an employee."
bad,when i was working there it started off fun and friendly but they had no understanding on life when trying to explain they didn't listen i was let go with no hope to ever return
bad,shipped boxes and reviewed boxes to be shipped. sent out packages and set up pallets with product on. set the packages for shipment. scanned shipments in and out
bad,It was fun and interesting good pay so I can help my family thank God for this job. The place was big the job was kind of hard but at least the job help me out
bad,"My typical day at work would be, getting to work early ,cause the the traffic in Houston is terrible, I would get my coffee and watch TV in the lunch room alone. Then I would clock in and attend the morning meeting do the daily calisthenics and start stowing til lunch. I would eat my lunch with the guys from my team,which I think half these guys were just gunning for other jobs and wanted more money.After lunch before my last break I would go back the job,sometimes they would train me to do other jobs,at my last break I would eat and watch the people who were joking for position playing lunch room politics, then I would finish out the day."
bad,"Working at Amazon was nice, the pay was good and the benefits were great how ever the hours and timing was horrible. Starting early in the morning is a great thing but not being offered long enough brakes and lunches makes the day seem longer than it sounds."
bad,they don't care about their employees only their numbers to many hours . Some times you just need to sit down for a moment not a chair any were you had to walk a mile to go to break when you got to break room break was over
bad,For the overnight crew you work long demanding hours and with mandatory overtime you work 60 hours a week 5 12 hour shifts your life is basically gone day and night have no meaning and you are worked hard for those hours
bad,You walked more than 36 miles in a 10 hour shift and was phsyically painful after each shift.  They gave work incentives that were nice but still not worth the physical pain you were in.
bad,"They Treat you bad unless you are liked by the managers, alot of favoritism, work place was awsome cause the people and a clean warehouse, and most enjoyable was the people there, the management was horrible from what i experienced, and a typical work day persist of clocking in a 7am and leaving at 5:30 standing in one spot processing items."
bad,"Working in the warehouse is a crushing experience, unless you really have no other options financially, or really need to lose some weight, don't work here. It isn't worth it, unless you manage to get a desk job or really enjoy physical labor."
bad,"Most challenging experience.  They expect manager to live at the FC (work 14+ hour days, come in on days off, change schedule with minimal notice).  The only positive thing is they pay extremely well and they have a terrific retention program in place.  They know the job is horrible and they keep people there by throwing money at them"
bad,"I love working at Amazon.com, but lately everything is changing and I see no future there. The benefits are great and coworkers too."
bad,the days are long and there is almost overtime every week. The job doesn't require a lot of heavy lifting Management doesn't focus on how to help you grow.
bad,"Communication with Hr is no good, and management sucks, it is all younger adults that never had a job, and there is a lot of favoritism with their friends."
bad,I am not happy with my job and it has many things going on that need to be addressed. There are many things at amazon that could be done in a easier way that nobody wants to address them when it is brought to their attention. The HR is the worst.
bad,the company is a good place to work if you want to be lazy and not care about the customers needs. seems to be no sense of urgency among most of the associates
bad,"Amazon is a great company to work for, the only thing about the employment is the management that I worked under at the time, would not place me back at my local Facility to be able to keep my job. They stated that my performance was not up to par and that I had to be release of my duties. I beg and pleaded for them to place me back to my local facility instead of losing my job and was denied. I should have been given a chance have working for them for almost 8 years."
bad,precisa olhar mais para os funcionários não cumprem com normas estabelecidas pelo MTE não oferece epi suficiente para os funcionários
bad,"I felt like i was in a prison at this place. Managers are constantly breathing down your neck, whipping you with the words ""quantity."" Management itself was poor, and promised job rotations hardly happened."
bad,"Good pay but long hours and unnecessary rules, very physical and demanding job. Have to be willing to stand for Kong’s periods of time without question."
bad,"A typical day of work is an individual being pushed to their limits bending over and picking up boxes regularly back to back. It becomes a complete routine and often feels robotic, and people slowly but surely are losing their minds."
bad,You will be given high level of empowerment in planning and execution. You will get to work on some amazingly tough challenges and get to work with supremely talented and passionate people. This is truly a journey of a lifetime
bad,"Great for PEAK season other than that waste of time, reverse discrimination and favoritism, lazy/ dumb coworkers and management. Unprofessional, people on phones standing around not working safety is a joke so are warm up stretches."
bad,Im a full timer and the company only gives me 2 days a week to work.. it's not fair they hire someone to make them struggle with a fulltimer hours....
bad,"Great company, but few things needs to be fixed. Hard work is required though. In the company you don’t get to really see the mangers. HR is rude sometimes. The break is 15 mins but it’s really 10 mins."
bad,"Although Amazon themselves are a good company to work for they unfortunately employ people through a temp agency on 0 hour contracts."
bad,"The most depressed place I ever seen, Co workers are miserable there bodies hurt and they are very unhappy and after a short period there,  people realize nothing changes, turnover is massive. Brain washing culture."
bad,Over crowded and over worked. Very little employee appreciation. Extremely unorganized. Rude supervisors. Some employees will stand around and do absolutely nothing and the situation is never addressed. Unrealistic expectations. Company equipment is always either broken or not working properly and then you are penalized for not completing tasks on time. Hours are terrible. Worst job I’ve ever had.
bad,"Absolutely terribly managed. Also, when there is a problem and you want to resolve it, Human Resources is no help whatsoever. It would probably be a great company. But, there is too much micro management."
bad,"The communication is not y to o good working standard & the professionalism is off, they preach safety but most of the vans aren’t maintenance & they rush you out the plant after the amazon warehouse workers have everything out of order"
bad,Rapid logistics is a part of Amazon they pay there employees late and don't pay them there overtime. It's very unfortunate I really enjoyed my job but I'm not going to beg for my money. I was paid for a service I expect my money on time or at least some type of communication.
bad,"Worst company I have ever worked for."
bad,"Work like a slave and get treated like a slave."
bad,chalk and chulckes 1340 in store manager  my work is all gaming item to in or out  to store  any order to received me  . My company is very poor to monthly payament
bad,amazon at union city needs better management.everyone walks around as if they are doing soemthing but in fact are nto doing much at all. they keep the ac on meanwhile its winter and that makes no sense. people can get sick easily there
bad,"Avoir l'esprit  d'équipe, mais aussi de la rapidité. Interdictions de parler et a peine 5 minutes  pour passer aux WC"
bad,"My experience was a negative one. Poor management and work/life balance, This is to continue typing until the one hundred fifty character limit is reached."
bad,Constant FAST walking standing for hours back and overall body pains  unprofessional  management being timed during bathroom breaks hours being cut!!!
bad,Job is easy just stressful standing 10hr and breaks are actually 2 5min breaks and 1 30min lunch break being you have a bit of a walk to get to the break rooms
bad,Da kann  man einiges lernen nur kann man vergessen Festanstellung
bad,Overall a good experience and fun workplace to be at. Awesome peers and the new campus is just amazing. Get used to being in your comfort zone and you'll get by.
bad,i didnt like the job that much i'm glad i left team was ok the employment company was a pain i'd work here again if i had no other option it was close to home however
bad,"Mitarbeiter untereinander sind herablassend, belästigend und sehr unfreundlich. Teamleads unterstützen nicht. Um den Kunden zu helfen geht es eigentlich nie."
bad,"Dispatcher wants the driver to answer the phone right away even they're driving, not safe and illegal.  Dispatcher/warehouse management gave easy route to their friends with same language, unfair work load and unfair racial treatment."
bad,"Exploitation du personnel à mon goût, le seul point positif est qu'entre collègues le dialogue est plutôt simple et rapide"
bad,"Amazon is a fast faced work environment. The managers are all over you if you do not meet your numbers. However, it is impossible to meet your number if you follow the proper way to stow. This job does not pay me enough to do it. Should get paid more. Would not recommend this company to anyone."
bad,"Je préfère me taire taire à ce sujet, pour ma par je ne voudrais pas travailler chez eux"
bad,Ambiente lavorativo pessimo. Lavoratori abbandonati a loro stessi . Obbiettivo comune amazon e agenzia del lavoro: assumere e licenziare in continuazione in modo che il sistema a delinquere giri costantemente e anche le agenzie si arriccjiscono co u corsi fi goenaziob
bad,"ho iniziato a lavorare in amazon il 19 settembre a brandizzo...turno notturno...mi hanno lasciata a casa...e con me moltissimi...senza una spiegazione dopo aver passato una settimana a buttare il sangue!!! il contratto con l adecco è di 7 ore....il turno è dalle 23 alle 6. dopo  le 6 non puoi tornare a casa perchè devo buttare altro sangue a fare le ""liste"", cioè a preparare i pacchi pesanti... e non... per i corrieri. quindi fai altre 2-3 ore senza essere pagato come straordinario...ma te lo mettono come orario del mattino! una vergogna lavorare in certe condizioni..ti danno dalle 2 alle 4-5 linee a persona...un massacro!!!!!! il personale è gentile...l'ambiente è giovanile...ma il lavoro è da schiavi!!!!! mi hanno lasciato a casa senza una motivazione...come me molti altri! c'è un giro allucinante di soldi sui corsi di formazione...ti sbattono in 2 hotel...passi una settimana a massacrarti la vita...e poi ti lasciano a casa! una vergogna! esperienza assolutamente negativa!!!!"
bad,"Worked here for over a year, the problem is that you're forced to stand in one spot for 10-11 hours a day in a very repetitive place. You're timed for toilet breaks (don't believe what amazon tell you) if you have health problems you're given no leverage to their health policy. The money was good but the hours are terrible. Especially when it comes up to Christmas (6:30am-6:30pm)"
bad,En tant que chauffeur livreur il y a une forte pénibilité du au cadence excessive puis il y a encore d'autre problème comme les heures de travail impayé
bad,The management staff had unethical work related practices and it extended from lower management to the head of the facility. I was illegally terminated but haven’t yet filed any legal action.
bad,While working at Amazon I was an Amnesty Tech.  My department did not have any quotas to meet but all the others did.  There was a high turn over rate because most people couldn't work at the speed that the company requires.
bad,"I worked over nights. You are going to be exhausted and you are expected to always be energetic by the supervisors. You have to deal with unfair supervisors. What they say is okay for one team member they will pick with another team member for. There were a lot of different people from different backgrounds, so you'll have cool team members to work with. Management didn't know how to communicate with the team members."
bad,"They expect absolute perfection to their ridiculous hourly quotas and if you don't meet them or make any small mistakes they send a manager to re-train you, if it happens again you get written up."
bad,"First of all, the job was TOO easy to get, as Amazon will hire ANYONE. There was no interview, only a brief introduction, drug test and background check.The job as a warehouse associate is manual labor, however the first day, you are expected to know everything and management will look at you crazy if you ask questions/clarification. The work atmosphere is extremely negative, very ghetto and profanity filled. The environment reminds me of modern day slavery and feels like you're in a prison. You are expected to overwork your body to meet unrealistic rates, regardless of the minimal 30 minute training you receive prior to going on the floor. The a/c only works half of the time, otherwise you are working like a slave in 95 degree temperature in a tent. The supervisors get mad at you for contacting Human Resources aka the Employee Resource Center, so they punish workers by increasing stow rates, extending hours worked between receiving breaks and taking away the required second break.They are required to give two 15 minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch, however you receive Break 1 within 1 hour of the shift, lunch within 2.5 hours from the start of the shift and you are often expected to work 3.5 hours before the second break, if you receive it at all. If I could rate this place negative stars, I definitely would because all money isn't good money."
bad,"They lie to you about everything, say they care about safety first which is a lie only care about getting the packages out and the AMs only care about hitting numbers so they can get promoted to one of the home offices. STAY AWAY"
bad,"La cosa che davvero da fastidio anche se vai bene non rinnovano i contratti ,massimo pochi mesi ti sbatti accetti turni extra fai ore straordinarie e poi ti lasciano a casa"
bad,"una empresa donde se promueve el chivato el mal compañerismo y donde los que manda no tiene nin idea de lo que realmente pasa,el have fun es un engaño,y si tienes un accidente o te haces daño,exerce sobre ti tamaña presion como para que aparte de estar lesionado te sientas culpable de ello y sobretodo la culpa siempre va a ser del trabajador.."
bad,"fired for missing work due to eye injury( injury did not happen at work)"
bad,"schlechte Bezahlung"
bad,"I would describe my job the best. I loved helping people, and doing my bes I could. It's not the Amazon logo itself, it's the people in Fresno Delivery station, that are crooked. Not all but, the ones in management and supervision team. Need to know more, just ask me. It's too long to explain here. Get honest people who really care."
bad,"Worst company I've had the misfortune too work for."
bad,"This self employment job couldn’t be made possible a employed job as it would break so many laws and health and safety procedures. "
bad,I lost 50 pounds working at Amazon fulfillment center. They make it sound exciting but really its exhausting. The place is sooo big that your 15 minutes breaks are really 5 minutes. By the time you get to your locker or outside to chill 5 minutes already past by. They only tell you when you are on your final warning when you didn't even know you were written up to begin with. If you have to use the bathroom you might as well use it at the station because they will write you up for being gone from your station more then 5 minutes even though the bathrooms are a mile away. Only last for 4 months till it was time for me to go.
bad,"They hired a lot of people to launch new warehouse, didn't offered training and after probation they said: ""You didn't met our bar and we need to dismiss you"" but they never offered training or say which bar you need to met."
bad,"Amazon deceives and manipulates uneducated employees. the working conditions in the return centers are poor. I was inclined for promotions nine times and never promoted, even though I had a master's degree and had served as a seasonal PA (supervisor). I was wrongly terminated and won a wrongful termination suit against Amazon."
bad,"If you want to get treated like dirt, used and abused then amazon is the place to go. if you have common sense, you will stay away from this tax dodging company who do not care about there workers the slightest bit. they will replace you the first time you mess up."
bad,"A typical work day was sort and stacking parcels."
bad,"You never feel secure with having ongoing employment. I was an excellent customer service agent. I had 1 bad call with a very difficult customer in the 10 months I worked there. They let me go without hesitation and I didn't do anything wrong."
bad,"Due to quotas many people cherrypick the carts to restock (not supposed to) and despite safety regulations you will see items thrown on top of shelves and a coworker of mine actually had something fall onto them."
bad,"Horrible place to work. I got problem with my foot. My doctor advised some alterations. They were not wiling to make any of them. As a result, I had to either keep destroying my foot or quit the job... these were the options that I was given."
bad,"a typical day at work is very sad,you do the same thing over and over again with not a lot of break. one thing that I learned form this job was time management skills. the hardest part about this job is standing for 10 hours. i would not recommend this job for any one unless you really need the money."
bad,"Stipendio buono, date anche le tante ore di lavoro. Lavoro di qualche mese perche´ troppo stressante e con ritmi altissimi"
bad,"It is a horrible place to work. They treat you with little respect, they watch you for your bathroom breaks. They over work you without any recognition."
bad,"Never work from home for amazon. You have set hours for 4weeks of training then after that you have to do shift bids and you may end up having to work late nights for 3 weeks then early morning for 3 weeks, etc. The job is very stressful and Amazon is very demanding. I wouldn't recommend it being a permanent job because its no way you can live off of $350 every 2 weeks, but to each its on!"
bad,Managers were not professional just the whole work place was not for me very loud noisy very disrespectful the whole place was nasty they where disrespectful towards me
bad,Advised by Amazon customer service that applications only accepted at amazonforce.com all others are not permitted to offer jobs and those other sites are not reviewed for job offers by amazon. found out hard way by fraud impersonator.
bad,"Not to inform you that you are over worked tremendously at SLT amazon! They are racist and full of favoritism! You load your own route of 190-200 packages and they rush you throughout the day to push so they can go home before 6or7 o’clock! The gas station refuse to give you gas because you or over the limit due to amazon not paying bills on time! You are told that you have to rescue others when you are first hired, but yet you get wrote up or suspended for 2 or more rescues"
bad,Amazon rewards bad actors in terms of abusive management.  The leadership principles are admirable but they don't hold all leaders accountable to them.  If you complain about this you're labelled as the troublemaker.  There is low moral in the rank and file as well.  Abusive leadership will bring that on.
bad,Fanno moltissime promesse e non ne mantengono nemmeno una
bad,Pay is good but they work you like a dog!  They do not care if it is killing you! Don't make any mistakes or get hurt. You will be fired immediately and the HR department will get you to fill out paperwork by telling you to use certain words and these words will effect your ability to get unemployment. Protect your rights!
bad,"They expect you to meet a certain goal, which is impossible while following their strict  safety rules.  You are given only 2 15 minute breaks which it takes 7 minutes just to walk to the bathroom"
bad,bad company to work for they cut your pay and hours switch yours days with out a fair notice time.Its way too much work for what they are paying and its hard to get a raise
bad,"I applied for Warehouse but instead got employed for what they call a Warehouse Shopper at the Wholefood Store.  I was thinking I was going to get a fixed schedule but I was informed after employment that I have to ""fight for shifts"". You can only get 20 to25 hours if you can get it. Management is very poor and always changing policies not knowing much about the job itself. The Warehouse Shopper position only been here for about 6 months so no telling if they going to keep doing it. And they keep us in a very narrow, small area, there sometimes over 20 people in one spot with low air condition. They treat their employees very bad. I thought Amazon was better than that."
bad,"It's the closest thing to slave work that I have ever done or seen . I'm in my late 20s and in great shape been in contstruction and warehouse my whole life and go to the gym routinely , and this place kicked my a** , Talk about pick things up and put them down I average 34,000 steps a night on my step counter on my cell phone after about 2 and half months I found something else that payed more and was literally heaven on Earth compared to this place if you a citizen and don't have a bad criminnrecord you do not belong or should work here Stay away just because the Company Amazon is judge you would think it would be a amazing company to work for couldn't be anymore wrong."
bad,"Apparently even though my email and paperwork says my start date is at a particular date. They say that my paperwork is messed up and is incorrect. They will take a several business days to get back to me which by then will be past my start date. When informed them of this they stated I would just have to wait."
bad,"Jobs are rated but not set up for success. They provide video games and ""fun events"" at start up meetings. They offer college classes which they pay for but then cancel the last class needed for certification."
bad,"A well run company but one that squeezes its employees like sponges and seems to take pride in doing so. A good environment to grow yourself and your skills, but not one that is in any way enjoyable or good for work and life balance."
bad,"If you get sick and have to use your Short Term Disability or FMLA, you will be likely fired! I was a hard worker, volunteered for overtime, had good metrics and when I could not work, they found a totally false reason to fire me..."
bad,"Amazon job is always and all about making numbers, they see the people/human to act as robots. There is no promotion and training for you. You have to do the same job and samething for entire your life."
bad,"This company was inconsistent. They work you like you like a dog, and although the benefits are good, the thought of you being one item away from being fired is not worth it. Rules change daily. It was so bad at one point, they fired a massive amount of people and called them back saying it was a mistake. Most people stayed gone. A lot of people were grateful to be let go."
bad,"Amazon, Hazelwood, MO - Sort Center - STL5: Very poor Management! Extremely lazy and arrogant Managers. The only people that are promoted at Amazon are the friends and family members of the Managers. No employee is valued at Amazon. All employees are treated as dispensable."
bad,"Working here may have had benefits; but that in no way made up for the way that employees were actually treated.  Don't get hurt, that will ruin your entire career there.  I got hurt and just went down hill from there.  If you don't make buddies with the management then there will be no room for advancement for you."
bad,"I wasn’t able to start working until ~3 weeks after my given start date then told the shift they offered me was not longer available. On top of that, it took them almost 4 - weeks for them to complete a background check and drug screen.  I would not recommend applying to amazon, they were extremely unreliable in terms of the on-boarding process."
bad,"people work for machines instead of machines working for people, and the supervisors are nasty."
bad,"Got to be the worst job I have ever had."
bad,Sunt un baiat muncitor si cu experienta in domeniu
bad,Amazon needs to give more breaks throughout the day for pickers because the warehouse is huge and most of the time you have to walk back and forth all day long (even though the managers say your scanner takes you on a mapped our route.) It gets very tired after 10 hours a day for 5-6 days a week.
bad,They wouldn't let me use the restroom for number 2 in the first hour of my shift. Got written up if you tried to rest. Numbers they want you to reach are unrealistic
bad,"I went to the hiring event in Jefferson for the new warehouse. I was given a start date and never received my new hire paperwork. After MONTHS of calling them repeatedly and not getting anywhere because I was constantly told to just ""wait for an email"" THEY GAVE MY JOB AWAY. This company is an absolute joke. I have a child to feed and needed this job due to the days and hours that were available. I would advise everyone to go elsewhere if you need an actual job."
bad,"They have no idea what they are doing.  Seems to be solely based upon numbers and not the dsp carrier relationship.  It is sad because given the right people, this is really a great idea.  They also say one thing and then say the opposite.  They ignore the values of hard work, dedication, loyalty, and determination. If you only care about numbers, seems you will fit right in."
bad,"Well where do I start?  The hours were 8AM to 930PM with no breaks!  Had to wear depends(adult diapers), no water or food either!  This for a Delivery Associate typical 10-15 hour route! "
bad,"I found this job frustrating.  Long hours, work conditions were not very clean.  Also noisy.  Many co-workers were not friendly and you pretty much are not appreciated."
bad,Strašný  jako zaměstnanec u agentury sem odpracoval řádně bez jakýchkoliv problémů a srážek a stejně sem nedostal za celí mesic!! 121hodin a tři děti do daňích!!sem dostál 7877kc a 150na hodinu. Proste Amazon okrádá lidí to je můj názor.
bad,your rate had to be at 100 percent ever week and they didn't like it if you went to the bathroom you could not wear adverting for certain company;s and it was to drive for me
bad,Amazon is a horrible company to work at. I would tell people to not apply at this company. This place is only good for people who love manual labor and love to get paid very low wages.
bad,Employee evaluated as if they were robots. I do not recommend to anyone. Very high employee turnover rate ( includes management ). Only good if it's an office job in Seattle.
bad,"Es un citio amplio donde puedes,hacer tu trabajo sin ningun tipo de problemas, me siento agusto es divertido y siempre e tenifo buena quimica laborar con mis compañeros y jefes"
bad,"Little if any training of value. Productivity expectations exorbitant. Many managers have told me that they, themselves, personally could not achieve and maintain productivity goals."
bad,Not a stable job. Great opportunity to make extra money. Long hours. Unable to use cell phones (may have been an emergency) Had to keep off floor ions away from work station. Break rooms football fields away from work stations. Thirty minute lunch breaks. Overcrowded
bad,"I applied for a position at the amazon warehouse in Tucson Arizona, I was drug tested and background checked and passed with flying colors I was promised a job. I waited for 4 weeks to receive a notice of when my first day would be and they told me they had made a mistake and over hired people for the warehouse. At the time I was down on my luck trying to make ends meet and they basically told me sorry cant hire you until further notice. DO NOT APPLY TRUST ME SAVE YOUR TIME"
bad,Ich habe bei viele Firmen gearbeitet aber eine sxheise Firma wie Amazon habe noch nie gesehen
bad,"Don't do it i would not do it again. Did not like, the hours, the management or co-workers. Amazon over worked you and it seems like a slave place. I wish I would have never life FedEX"
bad,"Underpaid For A lot of work and rates would not recommend this job to anyone, hard to move up in company unless you know someone or you kiss butt and I"
bad,Worst warehouse you could possibly be into. Think a million hundred times before subjecting yourself into modern slavery. Management are worst. Dont ever waste your time and be one of those thousands of people whos being continuously lured by their rate and offers. I wouldnt recommend this company to anyone out there.
bad,"This is not work place, this is work camp. This job is like nightmare, you are observed all the time, I felt there like in big brother home. "
bad,"Mucho peloteo, no te valoran por lo que trabajas si no como le haces la pelota al los manager... Muy mala coordinación y horarios insufribles"
bad,"My brother and I were each tested, interviewed, given employee numbers, took and passed drug and background tests, and were told we would be notified by e-mail of a start date. This never happened. When I called the employee concern line, I was told that HR wasn't  ready to start training yet. (This was for a personal shopper position at Whole Foods.)  After waiting for a month, we finally got employment elsewhere. I will never work for Amazon. They lied about the start date, and everything else. We went through some time and trouble, going across town, using our time, gasoline, and not to mention the wasted resources,  and then they got our hopes up needlessly. What a sham."
bad,"I found myself all too frequently cleaning up after other peoples' messes.absolute chaos. not worth your time. my opinion is likely skewed though because i wasnt eating right at the time. as in at all. but to be fair, that was mostly because of the hours."
bad,Pas de horaire fixe le salaire ne suit pas les acces son pa organsier structure pr le chauffeur manque de materiel
bad,"A difficult job for anyone seeking some sort of mental stimulation in their work day"
bad,I do not have any opinion about amazon. Amazon was just my place of employment. I do not have any thing to say for or against the company Amazon and associates.
bad,"rubbish place to work, unreachable targets, rude managers, rubbish hours, you have to walk the length of 11 football fields everyday. boring and monotumous."
bad,Work example of a work statement that indeed will be able to use to market to other viewers. These statements are a part of the free service that indeed requires.
bad,"The HR team is not very helpful. When you are hired, they don't explain everything and you are left to figure everything out on your own. I needed accommodations and they didnt process my paperwork which lead to a lot of issues."
bad,"Driving for Amazon Flex is awesome in theory...."
bad,"Fast paced days based on lack of dayshift work and organization. Learned how to quickly solve certain issues created by dayshift. Management was atrocious all the way around, never knew where they were when you needed them and didn't know how to do their job in any way. Hardest part was trying to find someone to solve an issue you couldn't on your own. Most enjoyable part was being able to do my job without interruptions or problems and find a nice steady pace to work at."
bad,I feel like they had favorites that they picked for advancement and I was not a favorite to the right people there. There were some managers that I really got along with though.
bad,Pay for the position is not applicable as a trainer I feel that we should have been more for what we were doing. Advancement was not properly address as well
bad,Political environment.  They chew through people rapidly (over half the company has less than a year with them because of massive turn-over).  Not a good place to build a career.
bad,The work overall was okay for someone young like in there teens and is active. The workers are not treated fairly. The lunch is not long enough and I think management only care about their job and pay. The job is stressful because the management work their employees like slaves
bad,"The cool thing about this job is the break room. With the arcades and Televisions. They also have a nice selection for food."
bad,"A temporary job with 6 x 10 hours while they need you. If one desires permanent position, must contend with ever changing standards, and management contrivances to ensure that one does attain them. Did not appreciate packing sex toys. And especially do not appreciate the spot checks which would not permitted police offices. A slumdog employer who should be and their products banned from this country."
bad,Appalling. You are nothing more than a number. Very poor management. I wouldn't recommend this company to anybody. The staff turnover rate is very high.
bad,"Can be long hours but overall its a job, great if you drive for location."
bad,Amazon while it's not the worst job it's definitely not the best! The managers are over the top and unprofessional. Their is definitely favoritism if they like you the help you move up but if they don't like you they use you to do more work then required! This job is like working in a high school i wouldn't recommend this to anyone in my family!
bad,majority of the company is run by kids; they provide no training specific to your area nor explain rates until it's too late. They have old people working where they obviously should not be working.
bad,"job was easy, the piercing noise of the andon buzzer was too much!!!"
bad,nice break room but that was about the only thing that was good about it. got yelled at a lot for going too slow and not keeping up the pace; commute too far from home
bad,"Never know if you'll be fired or have a job the next week."
bad,"Terrible, zero HR onsite, idiot college-aged supervisors.  Hardly any space to work.  Awful, you're a number not a person.  Felt like a jail, lots of low-life thug coworkers."
bad,"Poor treatment, they expect you to be back on time from a 15 min brake when it takes 10 mins to get to the bathroom. i don't like all the rules and regulations they have."
bad,I don’t really know what to say it was not a fun place to work at all no one cares about you no one notices you unless you did something wrong and then bam your FIRED ITS TRASH
bad,I didn’t think this job would be as bad as my last jobs but my supervisor is the reason why I’m leaving because he has no communication skills at all!
bad,Ok for seasonal work. Typically not my line of work considering I have a BA in Geography with a minor in Russian. This is just a part time employer and the work and pay isn't for someone looking for a career.
bad,"it was not an enjoyable place to work in. "
bad,"Ambiente desfavorável ao crescimento, uma vez que não atende o crescimento profissional individual."
bad,They treat you like a slave and all they care about is the numbers they run and how much products they can push out. If you're injured they don't even try to work with you.
bad,"Started the day in Pick. Located product and scanned for location and  correct product.Mid day went to Pack and scanned product for packaging size ( box metrics) and shipping label(s). Learned a lot about shipping and product fulfillment in an fast paced environment. Mangement were always on hand to address  discrepancies  with product ,etc. Workplace was casual yet fast paced. Hardest part of job was the miles logged in a day (averaging 13 miles or more a day).Enjoyed the employees and personel."
bad,"Fast-paced (read as: non-stop) work environment.  Long hours with little time to sit down.  You will be expected to work like a robot, so set your pace accordingly from Day 1, as it will be expected of you every day from there on out.  Very little opportunity for advancement.  Exhausting and thankless.  Security checkpoints at every entrance / exit make you feel like a criminal.  Everyone is afraid of losing their jobs.  Don't work here; they make it sound better than what it really is."
bad,"The work is hard because the products you work with are very heavy to lift.  When I started the production quota was reasonable to achieve.  But then they raised the quota to an unreasonable amount."
bad,When I applied to Amazon I didn't get hired for a regular position. I had to apply with the staffing agency. I was alarmed when my documents was not entered in there system correctly and no one seemed to be able to answer my questions. this caused a delay in me starting.
bad,"This company seems all smiles on the outside, but its customer obsession has led to a deficiency in employee retention and satisfaction. The temps and seasonals get treated like utter garbage, being ineligible for their pay raises, in house contests, or PTO. Likewise, the company boasts an incredibly lazy and apathetic HR team that proved unhelpful to most anyone. If you're looking for a temp job during the holidays, then look no further. They'll take you, and you'll at least be paid something for however much you work, with virtually limitless VTO and On demand extra hours. Just don't expect to get anything else out of it once the holiday season is over. If you're looking for a career, look elsewhere."
bad,This was a horrible work environment. They treat you like worker drones. You are very expendable and they do not hesitate to show you that you are. The rate you must achieve for your job is sometimes impossible to achieve.
bad,"Expect a lot of work done in a short period of time. You could be doing very well in the company, how ever if you make one mistake they will try to fire you"
bad,"poor experience "
bad,Very stressful due to lack of accountability for cohorts. Constant calls while off. Expectations higher for the top performers. Low performers consistently given breaks. Competent staff is underappreciated.
bad,I quit last night after about a month at Amazon in the Fulfillment center in the STOW Department.  I plan on writing an Expose and my experience there. The only positives are you meet some very interesting co-workers and the pay is decent however it's like being in a concentration camp. Literally. High turnover rate I'm still getting calls from other locations to see if I'm interested. Haha the 12-hour shifts are BRUTAL.  Unreasonable expectations. I could go on and on about the conditions  but I'm going to write a story about it in hopefully a lot of people will read it.
bad,"I would never go back, it was the worst job I've ever had. Employees were treated poorly and the pay was NOT enough for the expectations of the company."
bad,The management with amazon at home is horrible. They don't care if you can't control the outside noise or not. They do not care about anything that happens at home that interrupts the job at the moment.
bad,"A typical day consists of 10 hours, a half hour lunch, and two breaks. It's very fast paced and morale is low. Management are kind but everyone below them is an unpleasant person to work with. The hardest part of the job is making quota without 3 energy drinks or 8 cups of coffee, seriously I wouldn't be surprised if most of these people did uppers before work. The most enjoyable part of the day is getting into bed and putting your feet up."
bad,"they take work as you are a robot not a human being, they are for productivity not for its labors, the behavior of manger is very bad towards workers ans there medical care team is inhuman"
bad,"They are full of empty promises and the company revolves around favoritism. Hard to move up if you are strong willed and smart. Amazon will work you hard, but never be loyal."
bad,"That’s what I thoiught exactly, you go for orientation, they show you around, five you snacks, it’s exciting, you don’t get to choose what you do, you can either pack boxes or pick up all the loads for 10 hours... for the long hours and the labor, I believe they should raise the salary up, I know people getting paid 4 times that amount, taking calls on the phone.. VERY BUSY, and long days."
bad,Make quotas and if you didn't you'd be let go. I thought that it was boring. Hard making the quotas. Breaks were a little different as well. You had 2 minutes to get to your station and start working.
bad,Great pay and wonderful benefits but management and HR is horrible. I love the company as a whole but its not a good place to work. Only good for fast money.
bad,"Amazon was great at the beginning but quickly , became a horrible job , rates went higher and pay stayed the same , they blame there employes for not giving good number but the managers don't even know what they are doing at all"
bad,i was in ICQA i would use a scan gun. scan the items that were in the bens as fast as i could. inventory. the hardest part about the job was keeping up with your production.
bad,This is a great company to work for. everyone is like family. the pay is great and the benefits are  awesome. I would recommend this job to anyone. I hated to leave.
bad,"Amazon sucks all around besides the pay and the benefits. If you love money and good health insurance than this job is for you because there is no air conditioning, and the managers are rude."
bad,They don't care about your well being just about pushing out product. You don't get paid enough for as hard as you work.. if you don't make rate they will let you go. Even if you speak out they never take what you say into concentration.You have to be a good looking female to move up.
bad,Is a very hard job you have to by stand u for 10 or 11 hours. Very bad pay rate for all the work that you have to do. But the company have good benefits.
bad,Amazon's pay and benefits were all very nice but diring peak seasons don't expect to have much time off to do anything. As well as the insane quota expectations.
bad,labourous job. could not stop to take a breath. I see why they have such a high turn over rate and are always hiring. the shifts suck you are very tired after work
bad,"more focused on numbers not employees, so PC they forget to look at performance and focus on how numbers look over all not will to look at a persons morale."
bad,"The hours are very long. You cant have a cell phone in the building. The breaks are short, by the time you get to the break room the break is over. A 30 minute break is not long enough when u have to fight for a microwave."
bad,"aucune reconnaissance pour les ouvriers toute la gloire revient aux managers qui eux passent le plus gros de leurs journées à surveiller le rendement des ouvriers et à les pister via les scan.On vous parle comme a des enfants de 4 ans c'est limite si on ne vous dit pas d'oublier de respirer.On vous rappelle constemment que AMAZON est le numéro 1 du e-commerce tout en vantant les chiffres d'affaire éffectués, mais tout cela en vous payant une misère et en demandant plus de rendement à chaque fois...les boite intérim internes à l'usine qui recrutent vous bourrent aussi le crane à la manière d'une dictature..il manque juste la statue du PDG à l'entrée et on se croirait en corée.Ce genre de système ne devrait pas exister un conseil d'ami n'y allez jamais travailler"
bad,"Management will write you up for ""quality issues"" aka ""overages"" that you will not learn about in your 1 1/2 day training so ""Overages"" meaning you accidently scanned a barcode 2 times. If you do this once they write you up....every week on wednesday. Out of 9,000 boxes  you are not to mistakenly scan a box twice...even tho it does nothing just makes the scan gun beep.     :|"
bad,"I would come in and sort various packages into their appropriate location, so that customers are able to receive the items they bought online."
bad,have already rated this company before -- dont know if there is an issue with your system - or what reason why they would ask me a second time to evaluate this company -- is a warehouse - plain and simple
bad,"Believe the reports you read in the papers and see on the news. The money is good, but, they do expect you to work hard for it."
bad,"Not much to say... I didn't enjoy this job much. Maybe it was my position?! I felt as if I was being treated as a body for work. Sure, the pay was decent but it was a very steady and frustrating job, in my opinion."
bad,The quota system was difficult to manage. There was extremely little space to stow items but you are required to meet high quotas for stowing.
bad,did not like the treatment and the way I was disrespected on a daily basis the expectations were raised far too often without being given the tools to achieve.
bad,the quotas they expect you to hit for inbound receive is a nightmare and if you don't hit it the system writes you up automatically. You feel you have NO job security!
bad,Per qualsiasi informazione basta cercare le recensioni Online sul come vengano trattati i dipendenti.
bad,"I didn't like the fact that they make you operate a lift, that takes you 50 feet into the air. They train you one day and put inexperienced people on those lifts."
bad,"Really liked my job there.  Co-workers were great, helping whenever I needed help.  I learned that tips to packing faster from co-workers helped me very much.  Hardest part of the job was when an item was missing, from scanning list.  Having to go find it in cubby.  Losing valuable packing time.   Seemed like management did not touch bases on my packing improvement.  And I could have been put on a different Position, rather then getting let go.  Another hard part of the job were the hours, 6:30 P.M. until 5 A.M.  But I was happy to be employed regardless!"
bad,you clock in and do your job then you go home simple and easy. but the work load can be overwhelming.  also when going through temp they can let you go at any time.
bad,Nearly Impossible to keep up with the rate they kept wanting faster and faster rate times mine kept moving down instead of up. I had a broken foot that healed back wrong which was my doing. they won't work with you it is pick at these rates or you are Fired.
bad,Did not think company could meet my overall long term objectives. Management doesnt  care if you live or die as long as you go fast
bad,"Prevented store losses using awareness, attention to detail and integrity."
bad,"Very bad place to work, employees are nasty and disrespectful, same with HR and supervisors.. Work you like slaves for little pay"
bad,10 hour day and standing almost all that.  Receiving in products at a fast pace.  Learned other areas and safety of the warehouse. Management not sure what they were doing and admitted it. Co-workers were great.  Hardest part of this job was the standing for long hours.  I most enjoyed my co-workers and benefits.
bad,"10 hour days,handle thousands of refunded products,great mamgement,their very approachable,co-workers very respectable"
bad,"I learned how to used RF gun scanner and towing "
bad,"Been picking books from people who order online from the day I start till my last day."
bad,"aziente gestita tipo Lager nazista,gerarchie interne,paraculismo e zero meritocrazia,lavoro snervante,a volte molto monotono,poca possibilità di parlare coi colleghi durante il lavoro,unica nota positiva la sicurezza a volte esagerata,anche se quando c'è da correre anche li chiudono un occhio"
bad,"work you to the bone with no apprechiation, no point taking any break as the time you get to break area its time to start getting back to work area or a disapline will be given to late arrivals, targets are unrealistic"
bad,Management is hateful and unapproachable. You are just a number.Total sweat shop. I dreaded going to work every day everyone is miserable. Hr.is unhelpful and rude.Everything is a secret and u are not entitled to know anything. Very high turnover and no room for advancement.
bad,My husband and i haven't even been there a month and we already quit the place is a JOKE. If I knew I was going to be babysat I would've just hired a babysitter not work at that h*ll hole. If you're down for 30 seconds they b**** about it you can't go to the bathroom or find something or someone without being b*tched at. I would NEVER recommend Amazon to anyone.
bad,I come in see where im supposed to be go set up my station and if im a slam operator I get all my machines running make sure I have everything I need I check all the packages that kick out from bad ones to good ones check the weight check see anything is missing from the package before I shipped it out to the customer. ive learned a lot from amazon but I also taught them about being a team player management never was around or did they care that you needed help only ones we could rely on was our co workers the hardest part was lifting stuff with variety of stuff that was the wrong weight for shipping only enjoyable part of my job was my co workers
bad,"Long, boring, work days. Forced to constantly run around in a circle where ever the scanner tells you to go. All you do when you get off is sleep. The company truly does not care about their employees."
bad,"Stowing, packing and preparation work. Learnt Team skills and how a large infrastructure works."
bad,I move and support all phases of inbound activity in warehouse.
bad,"Management and operations personal need addition training as technologies changes,"
bad,"The controls are garbage, the conveyors are garbage (from Dematic) The ladder code is an incredibly confusing hairball of Add-On-Instructions, AOI's some of which are embedded 3 deep. They use Message instructions for interlocking controllers instead of Produced/Consumed tags."
bad,"I work with about over 300 associate on a daily basis however, during our Peak season we may see up to 1000.  Our job is to perform first aid skills to our associate and work with safety to make sure all assoicate's are performing their job in a safe manner"
bad,"Not a good place to work. you are treated like machines and not people.They don't hire you they ""order"" new people for employment."
bad,"Horrible safety ethic, managers play favorites, life/work balance is miserable. (seriously, work, home, sleep, work, 6 days a week.)"
bad,i dont really want to make a comment on this company because they are such a shambles
bad,Worst Place I worked. Great benefits just not a long term place of employment to amazon acts as employees are disposable.
bad,great place to work if you don't like physical activity and you enjoy being yelled at over the phone
bad,good pay and alright work conditions. co workers were cool but management didn't care about their employees.
bad,"This is by far one of the worst jobs I have worked at. They treat their employees very poorly and unfairly. The pay is good compared to other places. Management does not know how to run that warehouse. The work is on the easier side, but the management is VERY poor."
bad,"absolutely terrible, management sucks, work is dumb, environment is  poor."
bad,I learned a lot of things working here it was okay they just lay off alot they dont really hire through the company that much they work you to death then lay you off
bad,"Working at amazon is a fast pace enviorment and its getting me  pyscialy in shape as for all the moving, bending, lifthing, and sorting I enjoy the enviorment its very proffesional"
bad,A typical day at Amazon is receiving thousands of shipment. I learned how to receive the shipment and enter it into the computer. The coworkers there were friendly. The hardest part of the job is keeping your rate at 100% all night and everyday.
bad,To much work and you have no life at all and going threw a temp service stinks
bad,Warehouse is definitely not for me. I feel like they care less about the employees and more on the work getting done. Thats not a great environment to work in.
bad,"Co workers are not very friendly, the only hard part is walking and being on your feet ten and a half hours a day."
bad,The hardest part of the job driving a folklift picking up heavy boxes to put on the cage of the forklift.
bad,"This was not a good experience at all.  Management was not good at all, everyone in the upper management was messing around with each other and especially the employees"
bad,"If you want to be belittled and insulted all day by regular Amazon employees all day, get a contract position at Amazon."
bad,the worst warehouse job. they are not professional
bad,I thought I was getting a great job that I would be able to enjoy the environment. I do enjoy warehouse work. So far my experience with working as a Stow Associate has been very unpleasant. You get two fifteen minute breaks and one half hour break for lunch. The fifteen minute breaks aren't even worth leaving your assigned area because by the time you get to the break room it's time to turn around and go back to work. The lunch break isn't exactly 30 minutes. You work until 12 then you're expected to be back at your stand up for afternoon stretches exactly at 12:30. Your lunch break is actually about 15 - 20 minutes long depending on where you are in the warehouse when it's time for your break. There is no organization with where you place products either. You just stick items on a shelf after you have scanned it. So you're constantly racing up and down aisles trying to find a place to put items when there is not enough space and then you have the team leads telling you you aren't working fast enough and you need to increase your rate but while they are talking to you they are causing your rate to fall further. Which believe me they will come to you and complain about later in the day. I'm hoping it'll get better but I've noticed all these things and I've only been there 3 weeks.
bad,Managers don’t tell you anything are are quite busy and irritable if you need help. I was seasonal and let go even when I was told I would convert over and be full time. I had perfect attendance and no points against me. They are unprofessional because they tex you a number to call for a representative to let you know on your off day that they don’t need you anymore because the season is over.
bad,The work is very strong and demanding. They exploit you at work. If you like to work hard you won't have problems. The benefits are good. but bad managers and supervisors. They only care about the convenience of themselves.
bad,12 hour shifts. 6AM-6PM. No phones. No music. Limited person-person interaction. High demands. Major micro-managing. Weak management. Problematic point system for tardiness (reach 5 - possible termination). 30 minute break at 10. 30 minute break at 2. Could continue on but I won’t. Real-life sweatshop with great pay. I hated it. I was a picker.
bad,you are lifting between 15 and 23 kg on your own which is not good for your back make you work between 50 and 60 hours when it is prime week which is not good for you as you only get one day off so if your on nights you might as well not bother getting out of bed for that one day. very tiring at times when you have targets to hit.
bad,Don't work here unless you absolutely need money and have nowhere else to go. If you even perform the tiniest screw up you're fired. They work you to the bone
bad,"Great place but very clicky. If your face doesn't fit you won't get anywhere, the favouritism is appalling."
bad,"Reason Ieft as a levle 3 was because they took away our yearly stocks and our monthly bonus. Which during peak season was between 550-900."
bad,"T first every body wants to help you but when it comes to lifting, no one is around.. Don't ever work for Amazon they work you like a dog. And you don't get no respect...."
bad,"Be prepared that the temperature in these warehouses are dangerously high..upwards of 100 or more in summer months. steer clear of here."
bad,I was recently converted to a full time associate and while I can say this company does have good pay and benefits I feel like their expectations and policies are way too over the top your expected to keep and make rate during the time you start til the time you leave. We get 2 15 min breaks which by the time you get to the break area or your car you only have 5-6 mins left which is barley enough time to check messages or to check on loved ones. We also get a 30 min lunch which FLIES by I feel like they could atleast expand the 15 mins to 20 and the 30 min lunch to 45 mins. The hours are LONG which doesn’t help the fact that the job itself is very boring and repetitive sometimes I feel like I’m going to lose my mind. Also they should really provide deodorant in AMcare because some of the workers have really bad hygiene.
bad,The workplace was okay but the reason that I discontinue with this Company is because my feet couldn't take the fact of standing in one spot for 12 hours.
bad,The past place was good but miss Communication with the staff i wish the manager could understating employee more and respect them the HR look at the employee different
bad,"I love my coworkers I work with fantastic people!"
bad,ok i was fired under false pretenses. i was told i was over on my upt but after sending screen shot stating it was not over i was still fired. So now waiting for over 2 weeks for HR to call me I have yet to call me back so in my opinion this is not good and not sure that I would work for them again.
bad,"Constantly moving with time constraints, management was very helpful, hardest part was not having one specific job, I enjoyed stretches with my team, I learned that they are running a business and can  find someone else to fill your spot."
bad,"The managers are basically spoiled brats that just got out of college that are on a power trip. They are highly incompetent, and rude. They run around the warehouse like they don't know what's going on."
bad,"Theres a few things I do enjoy about working for Amazon, like being disabled and being able to work from home.  But to be part of the wealthiest company in the world, and #1 customer service business in the world it's one of the lowest paying jobs for Customer Service jobs I've ever worked for.  Calls are not that bad as a whole, but much of that is due to my ability to deflect esculate callers.  The communication and training is downright aweful.  theres not many ways to communicate other than chat room, and most management doesn't communicate with you unless you do something wrong.  when you need help you are always told to look it up in our knowledge base."
bad,"I would not recommend coming to work at Amazon if you want to actually advance in yor career. I worked their and I know plenty employees who had been there 3-4 years and never even made it to a management position yet. Amazon is trash, uncontrolled climate environment and not human to their workers. I despise Amazon"
bad,I have 31/2 years exprience with amazon with honestly with my hard work.no body care what i did .no bady help me very bad experince with amazon.good benifit .l like this job.but they not respect the employee
bad,"U have to be able to fit 75 lbs boxes. Otheriwse they will not let you work there. Break time is 15 minutes!!! ***** 15!! Even if you will go outside it takes 3-4 minutes to reach door, because it’s huge building. And even to come back 1-2 minutes. Soo, you have 9-10 minutes to take a break"
bad,Amazon is all about making the CEO wealthy and keeping the employees in the poor house. While corporate office gets richer and the people who actual make the company cant make ends met that is a problem. The wages is not fair and the hr practices isn't fair. Amazon take your lunches and breaks making you take care of HR issues on the time you should be resting getting water using the bathroom and getting a meal. The do a mass hire every year and then find a way to fire the 500 of people two of there warehouses. The don't do write ups or warning they just fire you when the peak season is over. Do not quit your jobs to work at amazon because you will be unemployed when peak season is over.
bad,"Always have to be in hurry to make  rate if not you get a write up"
bad,Don’t work here with a learning disability. They DON’T know how to deal with them and they’re unwilling to provide a realistic accommodation for you to do your job properly and better. Area Managers(supervisors pretty much) at my location for the most part are fresh out of college. Pay was excellent as well as benefits. Just be prepared to bust your butt every day and work in a NON CLIMATE CONTROLLED environment.
bad,I took company buyout offer. After constant pick rate increases in conjunction with no improved pick routes for some employees. Management worked hard at the task at hand and certain guidelines it had to live by.
bad,"pay was fine but just working 10-hour shifts is too much for a person. People are friendly but there isn't much rotation in work positions"
bad,"Too much wear and tear on the body due to fast pace working, leave feeling like slaver, everybody self medicating themselves due to pain, and depress."
bad,my current job is amazing but I'm looking for something with higher pay and a job where I can grown higher at. The management is incredible. The hardest part of the job is the lifting.
bad,bad management you wrote up for anything they have favortisim only thing good about the job and the job security and the benefits other then that the job is a waste
bad,"Physically it is very hard, people leave all the time, very strict rules. Impossible to keep this job for a future career. I took this job thinking it would be a good future, the pay was decent but the physical hard , back breaking work was killing me. I had to leave. I outlasted most of the guys in my team, but everyday someone was gone.  ."
bad,I just got tired of call centers. I wasn't about it anymore. For someone that can handle it then I would definitely recommend but also they are very strict about bathroom breaks which is a deal breaker.
bad,They tell you to wear something comfortable for a reason.  You will sweat in places you've never sweated and your feet will hurt every day when you are off.  Definitely too hard on the body. This job is not for anyone out of shape.
bad,"All you do is move heavy boxes all day long. As a receiver I moved heavy boxes opened them and sorted everything inside, its very boring and repetitive. (10 hour shifts)"
bad,"After being promised for a permanent role for respecting the rules and conditions and having my productivity and attendance on top, being in top 3 productive associates on my process out of more than 100 associates and having no absences nor errors or problems throughout my process, I've got dismissed and other associates with lower productivity and absences got to stay, so I'm out."
bad,"A typical day at work included working over ten hours a day, six to seven days a week. The job was very difficult and you stand all day long. You are not given long enough breaks during the day. There are two good things about working for amazon. The managers are very supportive and kind. They are always willing to help you improve and become better at your job. The benefits are also nice. You are covered under vision, health, and dental."
bad,"I loved what I did but found it difficult to get everything done in an average work day and ended up working long hours. I also found because of the long hours, I did not have very much time with my family"
bad,Dont do it. There is a reason for such a high turnover rate. They treat you like robots. Expect too much. No life outside of work. Pay was too low for what they expected from you. Discounts sucked.
bad,The pay is great but the way they run the company is more so technology based alot of computers and not enough humans to help in some areas. They subject you to very long hours and alot of mandatory OT which is no way around unless you in school they do not care about the individual because the company is so big you will never know anyone on a professional level other than the team you are placed with. Very demanding and laboring work as well especially during peak seasons
bad,"You think review is a courtesy to the reviewer,and  you'll get you a ""thank you""in return. The view cleverly makes the reviewer an accomplice.the reviews inputs."
bad,Unorganized. Facility is too hot in summer. I learned problem solving. We're allowed to talk to each other while working. Managers are sometimes rude but they greet us in the morning.
bad,"Busy all the time. Learned how to lift, twist, and squat properly. Management was very professional, helped in all situations. Very mixed cultures. The hardest part was being able to work 12 hours straight with extremely strict break times. The most enjoyable part was being able to win things and being recognized for the work you put in to make your job worth being there."
bad,"The work at Amazon was very easy, however the very strict time restrictions, made it feel like we didn’t get a chance to rest. It’s very repetitive, and the days are long."
bad,It can be a good company if they allow the employees to clock out after the security it takes our lunch away when we only get a thirty minute lunch it's not enough time to get food and go back
bad,Don’t care if you get hurt on the job. Don’t want to pay you . Don’t care about me safety or the workers . I really don’t like the one in west deptford
bad,kurze zeitverträge nette kollegen guter zusammenhalt
bad,Some of the supervisor abuse the role of being a supervisor while others are very respectful. Very unorganized at times. Treat their employees unfairly and side with the supervisor even when they are in the wrong. All in all the job is ranned like a sweat shop
bad,"My work day consist of opening the store getting the salad bar open, changing labels, doing all you're waitress duty's "
bad,Amazone c'est sympa pour le travail de l'équipe mais dur
bad,"Amazon mistreats a lot of their employees, but pays very good so that's pretty much the only thing good about that place."
bad,"what I learned is about hardworking and team working ,the management of the  company talks to us like one family,is when we do our delivering in time."
bad,Poor management the supervisors or managers does not interact with the employees and they treat you like slaves The pay is awesome the benefits are awesome but the way they treat they’re Workers is preposterous and they will find any reason to terminate any one just so they can let a family member in
bad,It's easy money and keeps you busy. However the managerial staff does not care about your safety or well being. They care more about your scan rate than the people creating the awesome scan rates.
bad,worked long hours with no regards to family life no sick leave until after you have been working there for a long period of time.
bad,"I'd walk around twenty days alone striving to be number one at the end of the day. Picking items from shelf's, putting them in my pick cart and repeating it. for ten hours. The pay was great, the people were great, but the work for me was just to repetitive and grew old to me very quickly."
bad,"Starting at 7:30 end of the day at 6:45 pm"
bad,got wrongfully terminated for joining the military terminated me 4 days before i left for basic and said that is within amazon policy hr gave me the run around after i got back from ait (Advanced Individual Training)
bad,It was a great experience. I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone. The company doesn’t go by the signed agreement at the hiring process. They fire employees out of no where for no given reason.
bad,"gud mrng "
bad,"Never got to work for them, it took more then six weeks to get orientation after acceptance . Then another time to start date ."
bad,"145-190 stops a day 250+ parcels."
bad,"Unless you have a map to every property in the state of NV for all apartments and gate access codes, having a difficult delivery will be you, as the drivers fault."
bad,I wouldn't recommend this job but if you feel like it's for you go ahead. I rather drive for them then work in the warehouse because it's never organized and they always want you to work overtime.
bad,"The more you learn, the worse your treated. Instead of holding people that are not working accountable, management works the people that do work harder. They seem afraid. Unable to effectively communicate to the different types of people. They create unsafe work areas then get upset when the blue light comes on indicating an unsafe area."
bad,Not for everyone this job is fun but management puts or ties your hands when implications or policies are broken could use a lot of structure and guidance in order to achieve their goals.
bad,"It was a great experience. But the management team were not attentive to workers. They lay of white badge workers with notice or reason, saying it is business."
bad,Over worked under paid. Many hours promises of advance that never happened. Regular asked to work over time. Lead to believe full time employment was near.
bad,"Organization lacks management that knows how to run business. Average age of manager 23-25, who have no other real life experience but possibly college. Show up, take care of your safety, and don't try to understand the lack of communication, or how ambassadors became one, when they have zero person skills, knowledge, or empathy. No training, or room for growth. If you don't expect anything but a paycheck every week, you won't be disappointed. You will sweat profusely in the Summer, and freeze in the Winter, as there is no a/c, or heat, except in breakroom. Wear very comfortable shoes, and do your best, keep busy, make friends, it will be what you make it."
bad,2 Jahre der Schelchteste Arbeitgeber . Hier kann keiner auf dauer glücklich werden.
bad,Entre ellos se molestan y al operador no le toman opiniones de mejoría ya que hacen lo que quieren.
bad,I am not sure about different locations but the one at YVR3 braid street is one of the worst place I've ever worked at. They lied and withheld important information during an investigation to work injury. They did not honor a signed agreement for accommodation restrictions and was constantly told if you can't do it go home with no paid. I've never had a place violate my human right as badly as this
bad,No real pluses you won’t have time to enjoy or capitalize on them. Management sucks they lie you can ask each one they will all have different lies. Use the job for what it’s for peak season overtime. I have worked here several times just to get my money up.
bad,"When I first started I enjoyed working for the company but now I’m, it is a non factor. There are changes every day and they don’t care about their drivers as long as the packages are delivered and the customer is happy. Not too concerned about drivers safety.."
bad,it seems like there is an infant running that place. it is a head ache in there every single day. UNPROFESSIONAL. there is something different everyday. But its easy money
bad,They over work you with no compassion to your personal or family life. They don’t accept doctors note of any kind. If you get the flu and don’t have hours to cover. Your fired! They care more about making money from new hires than developing current dedicated Employees. “ Don’t make Rate you will get fired. There is a 100 people waiting to get your spot”- site TPA1 GM.
bad,"Long hours they keep on back to get targets rate of pay poor don't get bank holidays promotion opportunities limited "
bad,"This place runs like a plantation, and the workers are the slaves! 10 hour shifts that start at odd times! 3rd shift shouldn’t start at like 7. And don’t have a day where your not working as good cs the numbers is all they care about! To be a mgr here you can have a associates degree in swimming they don’t care. There are some really great workers who will never grow bc they don’t have a degree."
bad,Come on what to you expect. Your feet are gonna hurt and until you get used to an extra crazy and fast paced warehouse your body is going to hurt as well. After a few weeks you’ll get used to it and some of that pain goes away.
bad,"This company does not put nice, rationally minded individuals as Ambassadors. You’ll be treated like a potential thief by, not just security, but by the managers and ones who lean over laptops on the warehouse floor. You’ll sweat and work your hind end off while they’ll watch and monitor your every scan and move. Forget ever feeling at ease. So you’ve never done a bad thing in your life, and you did prove this by passing a background check? Well, welcome to Amazon, where you will be treated like a prison mate whose every action is monitored closely. No amount of money is worth that sort of unfounded, constant treatment."
bad,"Overall, nothing to speak of. It fit the bill at the moment. That's all I have to say. Every time I press preview, it continues to ask for more."
bad,It sucked working for amazon because you have to do as much as poissable in one hour. they really get on your case if you don't  get the packages out as fast as possiable.
bad,"Versprechungen werden nie gehalten, sehr viel Druck, Zahlung sehr unregelmäßig."
bad,I'm a college student trying to make money for the summer. I thought this would be a good job for $15/hr. You can't listen to your own music. Even if you have one head phone in. which doesn't make sense how people are allowed to wear ear plugs? Safety hazard I guess even though if you're a picker you stand there the whole time. Some days you will be lucky to have music on one of the 3 speakers they have. The playlists are through amazon music and it will just repeat over and over and that gets very old. It was a really isolating job. You are working by yourself the whole time basically listening to the machines. I thought I could keep up with it just for 3 months and after one month I couldn't stand It I had to quit. It legit made me feel depressed how isolated I was and not be able to work with anyone. Also since you are going so fast paced it wore out my knees having to squat and stand up so fast.
bad,"Some management is fair. However like the high school experience, it is the one who is liked or who can brown nose the most that gets the best jobs or lanes to work on!"
bad,You can get fired from amazon as easy as you get hired. They managers always try to make everything your fault. But other than those things the job is really simple.
bad,Don’t pay enough for the work they expect and was not willing to change my weekend shift I was assigned to after 2 years. By the time you get out the security area for lunch it’s time to come back you will only have about 15 minutes instead of 30 even if u go to the cafeteria because you have to wait on the microwave cause it’s many people using them
bad,"The warehouse employees constantly mess up the order of packages, making it more difficult and your days longer. Some people dont have to work as hard as others. Then we are threatened to be reduced to part time if we cant complete the unbearable workload. I'm constantly given 140+ stops vs others having 107. The routes are so screwed up, it has you going in circles."
bad,fast pace no training and no communication. They work you from place to place. There's no one set job that you do. You can be unloading a truck or pallet than you are  called to run line for picks
bad,"The managers were very rude about everything other than 110%accuracy. The only way you can move up in the company is if you're a favorite of the managers, and they are incredibly unforgiving if you have a family/medical/ personal emergency."
bad,"amazon is great if your unemployed and needing a job to tie you over. Not a job anyone should be permanent, The conditions are very heavy, the level of manual work is tough on even someone who is very fit. i must of done 35 miles a day for 4 days straight in my first four days there. I have never felt pain like it in my legs and ankles before, lack of support from managers, building is always too hot. targets are nearly impossible, even if your active and energetic."
bad,This is not a job that I reccomend for the faint of heart. Expected to move and scan very heavy bags and items that are not movable unless you are physically fit or a man. I hurt my back and was not given any kind of compensation for travel to doctors appointments or my time off. Never will return.
bad,"I worked at smf1 during seasonal, and the job starting off took awhile to get use too, because working 11.5hrs during peak for 5 days was not something you can just walk in and do. However, once you get use to having a 4-5hrs sleep schedule, and aching body for 2-3 weeks the job itself was very simple, and one of the good thing about amazon was the community; the community was great everyone I meet and talked with were nice and helpful."
bad,dont work there they dont keep people very long . Management is very poor they kick people out in the cold once they are fired. I did learn a lot of warehouse skills though.
bad,práce by šla ale ta výplata i přes peaky no hrůza.
bad,Bad experience not a great place to start work... alot of people treat you like outsiders.. and you will say let’s move on people only stay and work because they want to make money that’s the only reason.
bad,"can lose job over medical reasons depending on paid time off or unpaid time off balances, takes a long time to get anywhere in the building which takes half break time or more"
bad,"The Fulfillment Center is a big warehouse. It requires some walking from destination to destination across the entire pick mod including three separate floors. For newcomers,its hard to locate the destination."
bad,"no one cares about you personally"
bad,Being at a newer building is rough. the work is easy and routine. the problems you face at the building are the politics behind moving up. Management promotes people based on looks and personal feelings instead of performance.
bad,"A typical work day at The A Warehouse in S does not involve much actual work. There is literally  hundreds, if not more, employees ( most are from a few different staffing agencies) just standing or walking around. No body is sweating or breathing hard. There is not a single person pulling a muscle or pricking their finger."
bad,Inconsistent work hours. Terrible customer support. No pay increase over 2 years.  Less and less hours each week.  Independent contract worker. Think 3 times before working doe this company
bad,Not very forgiving with call outs or time off. Hours were usually very odd and long and they forced a very brisk pace and could be fired for not keeping up
bad,Good job if you don't have a life. Pretty demanding. If you can't make rate you are written up until they just fire you one day. Decent company and benefits that needs a higher pay rate for the amount of work done. Very stressful job.
bad,"This workplace is extremely stressful because you have the dispatchers condensing employees.They also don't like when people have to take off for family emergencies, funerals, etc. If you have a family, this would not be a good match to work at. Also the schedule is not set."
bad,"Fast paced, changed you from job to job. Constantly warning you of termination! No help on lanes, would put you on a lane to work all by yourself. Come to you criticizing you about your scan count when you had to sort and do push downs all by yourself. Impossible job!"
bad,"The hours do not match the pay which makes working at amazon difficult. You have no clue"
bad,They Treat you like a slave and no security of tenure.The employee turnover is very fast because they want a new employees so that they will not get any benefits from the company.
bad,You do the same thing over and over moving from  station to another were size of products is different. There are no respect for anyone there is stealing from employees from other employees.
bad,"The pay was good, but they work you like a dog. No family time, forget free time when holidays are around. You have 15 minutes for a break but it takes you at least 10 minutes to walk to the break room so, you have to just stay at your station. If you're a minute late clocking back in you have a manager coming to ask you why"
bad,"when it was busy you worked like a robot"
bad,Management needs some direction. Always changing policy. Need more hours and consistency. Warehouse needs a lot of work. Overflow of inventory very unsafe work environment
bad,"The typical work day at amazon involves walking in to a place that feels like a prison. The hours drag on, the management doesnt care about their employees, and forget trying to make any friends that can understand what you say because very few people speak english there."
bad,"Working at Amazon was okay, for the first few months, it seems like you're voice is heard and that you're important... after that, it goes down hill. They don't care about you as an employee, and you're just a number to them. They're a revolving door."
bad,They will hire anyone and fire you if you are not fast in productivity or quality. No job union or security. They state a pretty picture but your body will be destroyed 10 hrs standing on hard concrete floors the breaks are shorter then 15 and 30 lunch
bad,"HIT's at Amazon currently average out to 6.00 per hour for pay.  Hours are voluntary and work is done from your home computer. There are no mandatory hours but you can work as much as you want, but there is no overtime compensation."
bad,If you can stand being on your feet for 11 -12 hrs with no problem with pain and stress on your body then go for it....if not stay far away. It's not for the weak hearted. The job was easy....being on your feet for 12 hrs was the challenge.
bad,Worked two weeks at 10 a day for 4 days then automatically switched us over to 12 a day for 5 days till I was Wrongfully terminated. Does not care if employees are high on company time are coming into work still highly intoxicated and drunk.
bad,"The managers sucked and didn't ever do anything to help. We were under staffed and they seemed to not care and let everyone sink. If you can't work hard, it isn't for you"
bad,"I Worked there temporarily for their Peak season. There were always new hires coming in, because they fired people in batches. If You were exhausted from working 5 days a week, 60 hours a week, and couldn't keep up with the break neck pace they expected of you, Oh well. There were fresh people who could do your job. There was no job security. ""Oh, But they Have Medical Benefits"" You say. Yeah, But You are too exhausted to even be able to use them. Unless you were lucky enough to call off sick and go to the doctor. And Then You better hope they put your information in correctly, because trying to get anything fixed was like pulling teeth."
bad,"Working for Amazon may had not been the best place for me. Coming from several years of experience in Distribution and Third party warehousing, I seen lots of rookie mistakes made by inexperience managers, most whom have never worked in this type of industry."
bad,"When I was called in the wrap packages on Fathers Day, that was my Limit of patience."
bad,"Typical day is non stop if you are a picker, very long physical days, at times you physically couldn't do anymore of which the agency team would find you and give you marks against you."
bad,"I need conforming job  ,I handling  manpower, and line  5s maintenance, i kown computer basics,basics of exal and ms office, hardworking, easy to learning  processi"
bad,American born working for this company. Not a good fit. The managers are all African and treat america workers real bad. When I first day at work one of the African manager wrote on my hand the station number. I reported to HRA they did nothing. So i knew then this place is real ghetto.
bad,Amazon treats its delivery partners like subhuman annoyances that they allow to work for them. At every turn they take as much advantage of you as possible while offering you as little as possible.
bad,"too much pressure on pickers, too long of a work day with not enough breaks standing in one spot for a long period of time, being pressured to keep a rate but other positions making the same pay don't have the same responsibilities, mandatory overtime during peak hours extending the work day to 11 hours in a 5 day work week which is not optional"
bad,I work for amazon in fall river ma and they always under pay you and sometimes they dont even pay you at all for another week or so. My wife says im always in a bad mood cause the boss is always on your case about rate and if you dont meet there rate they fire you but im glad im quiting soon i wouldnt recommend the job to anyone unless you really need to pay rent and there is no other job out there. The reason they are always hiring is cause they fire people or they quit because of the stress.
bad,"The managers were really bad, they didn't care about you they only cared about the work being done. long hours becomes very tiring for the body and mental health. pay rate is horrible for the work they expect to be done.  hundreds of people left because of individuals getting treated like slaves."
bad,Amazon et un grand groupe mondial et c'est pour cela que la cadence de travail et très élevé et compliqué !
bad,"Run from there it is a terrible place to work. you don't want to work for this company. they always go by the surveys that the customers give, without investigating probably."
bad,A lot of hard work for no recognition and a lot of drama. probably would not go back. would not recommend. worked long hard hours for no recognition
bad,training was hard to understand as the tutors didn't speak English well and couldn't completely understand the questions asked
bad,very hard place to work and the management was poor  the co workers where good to get on with but overall I wouldn't recommend working there unless conditions get better
bad,What I did not enjoy about the job was the hours I worked very short lunch and break u had to go at a certain paste but overall good money
bad,"The Amazon motto is work hard, have fun, and make history and it is false. All they care about is the work hard part. The have fun goes out the window as well as their idea of fun is similar to the Army's mandatory fun days. The moment you try to have fun at work to keep things from being too serious, they get on your case and tell you to stop talking and get back to work. All they care about is rates and currently giving 100% isn't good enough for them. They want you to give them 120% or better everyday but that starts to take its toll when you have to work 10 hour days doing the same thing everyday because they don't know how to rotate your tasks for the week."
bad,Worked as picker picking up 17 out of target of 23 had no sympathy for disability tended to overwork staff I.E expected to walk 10 miles a day
bad,"they dont care about their workers, the breaks were not long enough. And they never seem to attend to the workers needs. the coworkers were very friendly. but management werent as friendly."
bad,"There is no social life. The day is very tedious, as a warehouse job is expected to be. The breaks consist mostly of walking to your break destination and back to your work location (break rooms are too far away from work area). The higher ups treat new employees like dogs to say the least. Overall, this is the worst job I have ever held. The CEO is probably the nicest person involved with that place and I have never met him."
bad,Very fast pace. I learn how to work fast get the task done for our costumers. I enjoy myself. I did not like the six days a week but the overtime was great.
bad,"Onde aprendi como funciona uma empresa de comércio varejista, com picos de receita, de acordo com as datas festivas."
bad,This place is not bad to work at but you cannot get to work during the holidays.
bad,"you may be assigned to a dept such as pack but everyday it changes you may be picking products all night or doing something else,. the management is very strict, the jobs are hard and they are slave drivers"
bad,"you are on a 0 contract but you are doing 40 to 55 hours a week with the agency, they can release you at anytime"
bad,While working at Amazon it was a extremely physical enviroment and not to mention emotional. There is poor communication and follow thru with employee's and management. They also do a poor job of thanking employees for hard work.
bad,"Azienda grande che ovviamente spreme come limone le persone che li sono considerate numeri, di squadra non c'è nulla, ma solo competizione tra tutti."
bad,"Great Profitable company with values that shape good business leaders, not people leaders. Employee appreciation/value do not hold as much importance as the company places on their external client. Overworked employees holding multiple roles with inadequate pay compared to the competitive market. People should be the number 1 priority."
bad,Too much work and the pay is not enough for the job. Management is also messed up as far as choices and decisions that they make including the treatment they give to their employees
bad,"Manager arrivisti e non professionali o poco competenti al lavoro fisico. Non gestiscono bene il personale caricando in Force come muli i nuovi arrivati spesso in somministrazione e facendo riposare ai limiti della indecenza il personale assunto fisso che a sua volta tratta da muli galoppini i nuovi arrivati...si favoriscono parenti e amici a scapito di tutti gli altri, per fare far numeri si portano pedane si roba facile a chi bisogna far assumere o far salire di livello penalizzando tutti gli altri... Gli otto mesi più brutti della mia vita."
bad,Bof entreprise qui ne pense qu’à sa prod et ne se soucie pas de ses collaborateurs
bad,"Receiving, moving, checking and storing incoming goods. Checking and inspecting goods received and ensuring they are of accurate quantity, type, and also acceptable quality. Packaging and labelling products before they are dispatched."
bad,Very physical over work you too many required hours not enough money for the type of physical labor you are required to do. Is this really necessary to talk about something I don’t feel comfortable talking about just to look for a job?
bad,Its a good job i like driving everywhere out of town. The pay is good. The route dispatchers are not always fair and thats the bad part and you must go where ever they send you so theres no telling what time you end. But over all i liked it because as soon as they see how much you like to work and always on time you can get routes you like and that pay better then others i like out of town type routes.
bad,"Worked as a temp for 4 months, october - Jan. It took up my day from 5am and not getting home until 9pm, for subpar wages. They work you very hard and expect you to work tirelessly with strict deadlines and a ""3 strike"" type system, where if you make 3 mistakes you would be let go. "
bad,"You would just clock-in, pick orders, go on break, clock back in, and leave. Very mundane job. You would have to rush to pick your schedule but usually the schedules were horrible and at odd times."
bad,Corporate culture is the least positive in my experience. There is very little sense of community. Work is not very demanding. Most of the work is managing the chaos and the unclear lines of command and communication
bad,Después de 6 meses vas a odiar trabajar en un warehouse de amazon
bad,All walks of life people are friendly only problem is lack of communication due to the fact they could not speak english and how can you have team leaders and supervisiors who can not speak english and get a promotion like that just because there good order pickers what happens theres an emergency how can that person  explain the situation of what to do its pathetic now where is the Health And Safety Regulation Clause Regarding Communication
bad,"I love my job, don't get me wrong, but no one is enforcing policy even though they preach about policy being followed. No communication between managers or departments. No matter how many times we bring things up that are unsafe or could be improved upon, management never takes it seriously and have even stated that ""if you're not cheating at your job then you're not doing it right"" and safety is as simple as ""make it disappear"". The hardest part of the job is that everyone is supposed to be taught the network standard of policies and yet no one is taught the same way ever, everyone gets a different version of what is acceptable and no one seems to know what is actually acceptable and what is not. Short cuts are taken all the time and people do drugs on the property but no one seems to care about that either."
bad,"You are literally just a robot scanning packages to pallets. All managers care about is their production rates. You are taken advantage of and overworked. Hard work is not appreciated or acknowledged. You are filled with empty promises from management, especially operations managers. Most of the PA’s are on power trips. Repetitive work. Always getting yelled at by PA’s and AM’s. Very unorganized. I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"Falling behind means being reprimanded, and excelling means being exploited. Managers were inconsiderate at best and incompetent at worst. The job is built in a way that it tries to take over your life, they make you work 60 hour weeks during the holidays, with these asinine attempts at placating with boring and uninteresting games."
bad,Amazon treated temp employees as they did not matter. Management at my location was horrible. Hated to see all the items they destroyed instead of donating them. Some management were cool others thought they were better than most. Pay was ok.
bad,"I worked here for 3 days working 12 hours per day. It is easier said than done. The people running the place were complete amateurs and it really felt like modern day slavery. I can’t work like that. I’m 100 pounds, they had me pick up items bigger than me. There was a group of young girls that just mozzied around giggling and flirting with all the guys. It was really insulting. I tried because I was in between jobs, I couldn’t muster up the strength to go back."
bad,"It’s honestly not worth it. At first, $15.00 an hour seems great, but it’s far from the truth. "
bad,"Job was good, yet there's no room for growth, unless you were one of their favorites. They work you like a slave, and you were treated like one. Work load was heavy, I actually lifted more than 50lbs every night. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone, it takes a toll on your body. "
bad,Not a good place to work. A flawed culture that puts the bottom line over the mental well being of it's employees.  Raises are non existent and the management utilizes subterfuge to ensure the bottom line stays low.
bad,"Hours were very long and the culture was not flexible for staff who do perform repetitive tasks."
bad,"Not a good place to work, pay is ok but you are overworked. No vacation or personal time off. No room for improvement or advancement unless you are part of a click. The most qualified workers get looked over and don't get interviewed for position. They post position to apply for but they already have who they want for the position so why apply"
bad,Give specialty dept. and loved it then they decided to give the whole dept. to foreign customer service reps without any notice. screwed around on new scheduling then a day before it's to start they cancel the shift bid.
bad,"There is a ton of walking and they micro manage employees to the extreme."
bad,"30 minute lunch break, with 2 15 minute breaks. Those unable to stand on concrete for extended amounts of time will have a hard time. I would come home and soak my feet in Epsom salt for a few hours, go to sleep, and do it all again the next day. Fine for those who can withstand it, but not so great for those who can't. Also, don't plan on doing anything outside of work during the weekdays. You have to get up bright and early and will want plenty of rest. High turnover means you don't get too familiar with people. In management's defense, this makes it difficult for them to keep up, but many times they were unsure of what was going on just as the rest of the workers were. Most of them were pleasant enough to work with though. Very busy during the holiday season. Unfortunately, sometimes you are required to handle some products that are less than desirable to handle (feel free to search on amazon for all sorts of crazy stuff to see what I mean), but this is rare. This job is fine for the young and healthy who are looking for their first job and it pays very well, but those unable to handle standing all day really should find something else if they can. For me, this job wasn't great. For others, this could be a fine opportunity."
bad,"If you're looking for reasons to/not to work there, you probably shouldn't be applying. "
bad,I was hired as an on-demand only employee. That means that I only had work hours when Amazon sent out a text notification saying that certain hours were available to work. There was no set schedule for part-time employees in this class.
bad,"As a starting job, I can think of worse places. Just don't expect good advancement opportunities, pay, or much in the way of respect. At Amazon you are a metric. Your performance in your role dictates how much management likes you, as your performance directly influences your manager's paycheck. If you aren't a manager, expect to make 6-10 dollars an hour under the poverty line."
bad,"Amazon is for someone just starting to work because there’s no future for a driver,Amazon firer me on the behalf of someone in a different state behavior and that was right all I did for the company!"
bad,"Amazon doesn't have a bad rap for nothing. It takes a particular type of person to work here and excel. That person is willing to work and be on call 24/7. There is a high turn over rate for a reason. Most people don't stay in their current position for more than 6 months, otherwise they will be ""managed out"" (fired), and then they transfer teams. This leads to a work environment where there is no tribal knowledge and it sets teams back and causes a lot of continuity problems. Take 2019 Prime Day for example. Not a single person that has worked/ran Prime Days in the past was working on this year's event. This lead to a lot of poor planning and timeline set back which resulted in overworking and employee burnout."
bad,Over worked under payed pushed to 20 drops an hour no breaks expected to work over the working time directive as vans are not regulated. Hire and fire if you don't do as they require. Self employed with no ni tax or pension contributions
bad,"typical day was ok, nothing special"
bad,It's a ok place to work I think it's more a job for high school kid it's a fast pace job alot of moving walking and alot of speed it's alot of overtime
bad,"I hated working there, it got to the point i was ready to cry everyday knowing what i had to face for this long day and drive i workes put in haslet and the managers were rude and the Hr people were all very young and no experienced"
bad,"Amazon, in the time I've spent with them, is not a good place to work. my place only had part time, at most work 20 hours a week, and had no benefits because of that. Managers would be behind schedule, not listen to concerns or even treat some people poorly because ""they were too busy"". Even when giving out safety guidelines, they would sometimes not even follow it and other employees had to point them out or call them out on it."
bad,This was one of the worst places to work at.  But it prepared me for a position I was much more prepared for and qualified for and as a result was hired with ful benefits and intend to retire in this new job.
bad,"Amazon pays you good, but they are only worried about hitting rates and reaching goals. They help you for a few days then you on your own. They don’t flex with schedules , they have a set 6am-6pm shift or 6pm-6am all full time and no part time, use your PTO and UTP wisely."
bad,"long shift needing to clock in 15 minute before start of the shift. learned pallet management and how to pick and stow. management was funny as I got along with a lot of managers there but found others to be well, in the role for themselves. Most enjoyable part was going home."
bad,"Loved the first 3 years of working for the company but then the last 2 really were terrible. Outside management hired based on ""diversity"" and not merit ensured my managers were not equipped to perform their jobs."
bad,"The company is built on favoritism and if you are not on likable terms with all the manager then you will not get promoted despite your work."
bad,one motion was the company i worked for through amazon and it was the worst company to possibly work for as they never paid wages on time and never paid you in full and the management were not nice people.
bad,"Your typical day of work is standing around at a station picking product or stowing product to be shipped to customers. It was a fairly straight forward job. Management in general is supportive but company wide they do not have a nurturing environment to help employees advance through out the company. Yes they offer insurance, stocks, 401k, and other things but their policies are not conducive to retaining employees. They do not have follow through to support employees, their employees are just disposable."
bad,"It was very much like high school, people all had their groups and were not nice inviting new people in. Prejudice was at an all time high within the company and the management teams."
bad,"Worked for amazon in Leeds for a month delivering parcels throughout West Yorkshire."
bad,typical day consists of team meeting at first. Than find the work station you are assisgned to.Long period between breaks.management  helpful but hard to find most of time. Hardest part of job is 10 hours on your feet.best part of job is the diversity of the people you meet.
bad,"Very bad for your heath and very stressful amezon is like Kmart very cheap company no heath insurance no vacation "
bad,"it was an unpleasant experience working at amazon, very violent work place and they did nothing to stop it from continuing including alot of bullying from other employees."
bad,It was an ok job didnt get much out of it though. Not much time we had to set up everything for the vans because of the managers lacking in their work to provide the help for us to actually get the shipments onto the vans in time.
bad,"I have no comment at all, That all I am going to say about my time at Amazon. The comment that I could say about Amazon would not be nice to say at all."
bad,"Amazon fulfillment does not hire managers to think, rather hires you to work extremely hard.  You have meetings to report out on 15 metrics each 2-3 hours of a 12-13 hour day.  You are required to know your team's production numbers every hour.  You are required to fill out multiple checklists, and production boards by hands, so when it's all said and done, you have no time in the day to think, create, or improve much.  The culture is extremely based around everyone being micromanaged, including managers.  Also, you'll be promised promotion when hired in, but the promotion will not come for approximately 2 years and when it does, as you'll then be an internal promo, the increase is minimum."
bad,"manager made me feel incompetent and when I'd ask for specifics he'd shrug or go off on a tangent about something completely irrelevant. A lot of his answers or coaching never made sense to me. He would try to use his own experiences to ""guide"" me but left me confused and scratching my head. "
bad,"Your treated completely unfairly. Asking to get cross trained is ignored unless you become an ambassador. If you become an ambassador theirs an easy chance you'll get fired. There is a whole lot of drama and nosy people so if you had a private life before, forget about it."
bad,"Not a good place to work. They don't promote from inside, very poor choice of management. Pay not compatible with the workload. If you have an issue HR is not a good place to go."
bad,Warehouse work. Get there early and leave late. Warehouse doesnt have AC so in the summer you cook inside of there. Real time rates for functions like picking and packing that roll into your break. Worst job ever.
bad,"Culture does not promote teamwork or people always in competition with each other, cutting each other, untrustworthy trust."
bad,"Good place to work as a stepping stone or to help get your life on track, but not good for long term employment.  Unless under CERTAIN.  circumstances"
bad,The pay($14.90/hr) and the work expectations are unrealistic for human beings. HR department have no answers or solutions just excuses. They pay minimum wage but expect you to perform like your getting paid $20 an hour. This company has brought the concept of sweat shops to Canada. Shame on you Amazon. They write you up for being in the 90% range. MTO (overtime) is expected or you get attendance points. Think twice before getting involved with this company. They have a very high employee turn over for a reason.
bad,"Amazon is an amazing company that champions growth and professional development, but lacks those qualities in retail. The managers in retail are inexperienced and unprofessional. There is zero room for advancement from retail unless you become an ASM, which is problematic when it is advertised that retail can be used as a gateway into other departments within the company. "
bad,"Amazon expect too much. They use and abuse, and when you are no longer useful to them they discard  you  with no further regard. Work/Life balance is not even on their radar - you are a drone - completely expendable."
bad,Place is run terribly. Managers jus stand around and do a bunch of nothing while workers struggle. Workers don't really work. Its a big social gathering. Place gets by on the work ethic of few. Do not work here if you can avoid it.
bad,Job was ok as long as you can handle the fast pace and ready to rack up the miles walked. There are no warnings in place before you are going to be written up nor are you told after the fact.
bad,"I must say I was shocked by the way theytreat their new hires.  On the training videos they talk about safety, staying hydrated.  None of that is available not only that, you’re not allow to have any snacks or liquid on the floor.  Yet, they expect you to move around the o’clock like a robot.  All they push for is getting work done quickly on the expense of their employees well being and that’s why the offer health insurance from day one.  Simply because it’s not the best environment for anyone to work in."
bad,10 hour days of speed walking with less than 10 minute breaks to SIT. Break time started while you walked away from last pick spot to first scan... :(
bad,"Workplace culture is basically, everyone just can't wait to get done with their shift. Everyone is unhappy and complains about the management. Lack of job advancements and promotions."
bad,"For a multi million dollar company there are so many things that need to be updated to provide better service for the customer as well as a safer environment for the employees. There were multiple suggestions made daily on the suggestion board that could and would have improved the care and service or product and staff but never saw any of those changes made,"
bad,"a typical day at work is extremely boring as it takes more then thirty minutes for a truck to arrive to sort packages and even when one is on time there is a delay in getting it unloaded.  The management is lackadaisical as they don't know what theheck is going on half the time. The workplace culture is for a better term nonexistent, the irritating thing about Amazon is that there's no communication between Shift Manager's and sortation associate as the Shift Managers are clueless about every day procedures. Probably the most enjoyable thing the job was meeting new people."
bad,"Communication lacks and stress increases. Many very qualified individuals apply  for assistant and management opportunity and get overlooked and stay at the low wage warehouse associate they were hired at. Genuine positive recognition of surpassing rates, excellent attendance & people person that the entire team loves get no incentive or raise. Feels like a slap in the face. ""The offer"" is harsh and a smart way to get leave so we don't have to pay you your raise coming in three weeks. I thought amazon was a great company to work at and atmosphere was fun but when it came to anything to advance we hit brick walls as if it was impossible. Still here for now."
bad,"Very hard, unforgiving, stressful, fast paced, no time for bathroom brakes, no time to go eat lunch, no time to even smoke a cigarette, penalty for not going fast."
bad,"hired as a dispatch supervisor, 10 months into the job everything changed. more work not enough manager to handle the warehouse. they combine both jobs with more pressure and stress"
bad,Extremely difficult job....im in shape but the strain on my body was too much. A ton of work for paltry pay...management will take competent people and move them all over the place (disrupting your work day flow)
bad,working for Amazon is a fun but the wages after 3yrs there is no more raises and sometimes you are promoted socially promoted  not by work ethics and attendance
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working here if you have any sort of degree. It's great for people out of high school who are looking for work but it's very labor intensive. Hours are somewhat consistent depending on the time of the year, however, if you are injured on the job, they will ignore you flat out. They don't take injuries seriously. They also don't value your education to help you move up in the branch. They'd rather hire someone fresh out of college with no work experience than someone with a degree and has worked there for a few months."
bad,"Long hours. Treated like robots. Picking and packing."
bad,If you have a family this is not the job for you. You will be completely exhausted and as far as advancements go there is too much favoritism. It is a good temporary job.
bad,Job is very boring i always tried my best but i guess it really doesnt matter so i wouldnt recommend but if you need something fast why not. I believe amazon is better when you join  with them not through integrity. Amazons coachs where alot better so i will love to work for amazonbut never  through integrity every again
bad,I like my co-workers and have fun. It is a very physically demanding job. I am in the part time only building and am still a seasonal worker. They work 4 hour shifts and flex down to 3 hours a lot so it is hard to get your 20 hours a week. You have to become permanent part-time to receive benefits. You do not get a raise unless you become promoted to a management position. Break time is only 10 minutes plus 5 minutes to walk to and from the break area. I am not sure if I want to continue working here.
bad,I like to work there I love to work fast but the main thing they never hire me as permanent employee as i work so hard and gave them work rating above their requirement.
bad,"Too much of expectations, because of the name."
bad,{Need It Now Couriers} Management was atrocious. We had no HR Department for months. Worked overtime hours taken away. Package counts were ridiculously high daily. They lowered pay rates. Didn't abide by contract. Had us all re-fill out multiple applications during employment. Very poor company.
bad,"i took this job over the chrismas period. it was £7.95 an hour on 2pm-11pm shift. i thought this was good at the time as i was 18 years of age."
bad,"As the summary states, working for amazon is only for those who have the mental fortitude to just keep going without stop for small prizes or bragging rights. The pay is decent but the demanding 10 hour shifts can be taxing in a hot and dark warehouse."
bad,I would arrive at work at 8:00 a.m. and not leave until after 6:00 p.m.  I was on call for any HR issues.  I would receive calls in the middle of the night.  Their were many HR issues with employees not getting along.
bad,instead of building teamwork they encouraged associates to only focus on their own production rate. Even if the systems go down or conveyors stop working you still get held accountable for not meeting your production rate.
bad,Very hard to move up in Warehouse as it is a very favoritism setting and not based on production as much. Production only counts enough to the extent that you must do so much over a pace per hour or better but if you are constantly at a top rate of production not noticed as much as if you know or socialize with the right people
bad,Working at amazon was an okay job. It was nothing hard about working there. Work was easy. The main thing was the management and the pay wasn't worth it.
bad,"Many people as well as myself think that Amazon does not know hot to treat their employees. I worked at the location in Hillsboro and the ""managers"" were not good, they didnt know how to treat people as well"
bad,Working here was a bad experience .  They paid well and had great give aways . . . However I would never work there again they have poor management skills .
bad,management is a bunch of fresh out of college kids the pay is good for people fresh out of high school a bunch of high schoolers in that place calls mandatory at the last minute dont care about people with kids u are a robot
bad,"Work is always plentiful if you can keep up with the accelerated job requirements and avoid injury, it is physically demanding with little to no growth potential."
bad,"It isn't easy to advance if you don't have any higher education, but as long as you have a bachelors degree in anything you can so be in charge of 1500 employees and not know how to do anything to actually help anyone. The rates at which they have you work is ridiculous and almost impossible. But other than that the pay is relatively decent and that's about it."
bad,"typical day - u come to depo but cant go in to office or park van inside of teritory"
bad,"Ottima location climatizzata d'estate calda d'inverno con sale ricreative dove stare al computer o bere un caffè gratis alle macchinette .. Per il resto è la rivincita dello stile americano.. Dove si sfruttano gli operai sottopagati e senza pause di legge nell'orario di lavoro,per permettere ai clienti di comperare a prezzi bassi e in breve tempo.. Ma se superi il target e fai più produzione solo il manager ha premi in denaro nn l'operaio.. Contratti di 2 settimane.. A volte lasciano a casa persone valide e veloci per tenere chi nn si da da fare.. Non si capisce come sceglie i dipendenti.. E ciò è molto grave.. Ragazze giovanissime  straniere che avanzano senza requisiti..Pausa di lavoro unica e vergognosa di 30 min in 8 ore.. Che si riducono in 10,30 minuti x consumare un pasto che ti permetta di proseguire il lavoro a volte frenetico e sicuramente molto fisico.. Fissati con la sicurezza più per paura che per interesse del lavoratore che per andare veloce come ti spinge l'azienda a fare non può lavorare in sicurezza.. Organizzazione elementare manager poco più che ragazzi che nn reggono allo stress lavorativo e non sono abituati a grandi responsabilità.avrei voluto discutere questi punti.. Per vedere se l'azienda potesse migliorare..ma non sempre essere attenti e disponibili serve.."
bad,"Do not get too comfortable, or you will never exist outside of customer care. The employees are great people however the management do not follow suit with the culture they portray during enrollment process."
bad,"Amazon is stressful. They change the schedule, increase volume with not enough workers, removing certain co-workers attendance points, and no benefits"
bad,"Clock in listen to lies and bs go to break and come back and do it again, then you have lunch clock in listen to more bs and work like a slave,   another break which all breaks are suppose to 15 minutes but you only get 10 in reality.  Come back to your station work more then its finally time to go home.  Managers are horrible get away with a lot.  Do not go to HR, it does no go."
bad,"Publishing a book on Amazon is an exercise in futility.  They take 65% of your earnings, and you are literally competing with millions of other authors to even get your book seen on Amazon."
bad,Poor communication and poor management. Not willing to work well with others and floor layout cause safety procautions. Not enough time to eat during the day during a 10 hour shift.
bad,"I was there for a year. They weed out older workers by constantly raising production goals until they can't be met and they fire you. It is also very click oriented.  If you are part of the click, you do fine. But if all you want to do is work, they'll find a way to get rid of you. Before taking a job with Amazon, look up the website called ""Faces of Amazon""."
bad,"This is a company that will take some of the most phenomenal employees who give their all, and will not ensure they're taken care of. In the event you become injured and need surgery with this company, they will cancel any and all health benefits within six month. Your work ethic is not taken into account with this company, and they put most individuals in the same/similar categories in which they're hired. It's a shame that this is a company that considers itself to be a head of the trend and with the times. Unfortunately, I believe that it's only those fortunate enough to work within corporate, that reap the benefits of such positive work environment."
bad,You work long hours with short breaks. You have to work 3rd shift weekends to get decent pay. you can't even slow down for a bathroom break without it affecting your performance rate.
bad,"They don't care if things are done correctly, only that things are done fast! There's merchandise being kicked around on the floor, things are just shoved haphazardly in places, and a lot of things get damaged."
bad,This was the worse job i ever had...Management was terrible respect was the last in their list..Open door policy..BS..mandatory OT..for no reason at all..and ince they got you there..They would VTO you..not to mention they were so unorganized there were times when i would go in and they wouldnt have anywhere for me to work..it would be kik 20 -30 ppl that wasnt places..and as far as moving up...ha! Never u had to be a favorite or special..they would pass up a great candidate just to give a position to there friend..i would say the Only good thing was the giveaways during the holidays..
bad,"There is very little training available to WAH management, and those who are in place are not qualified. This creates a hostile work environment and low morale. Upper management is selected based on the lowest ratings on a selection of specific qualities, which makes no sense."
bad,"I found working here was not very nice"
bad,I've worked for the company for 2 years. i am a very hard worker that shows up everyday early and leaves late only to have my hard work overlooked. its been 2 failed attempts for me trying to move up. instead positions are filled by the kiss up people that work there. they say its an equal opportunity for everyone that applies for a higher position but i doubt it. they know exactly who they're going to promote so if you're not looking to move up with the company this place is perfect for you. be prepared to have no life due to the amount of hours they require employees to work.
bad,Amazon at least the department I was in is run like a prison and a high school combined. The general worker are nice and enjoy working but the people up stair are always pushing for impossible goal even when they know there is a know problem that slows work.
bad,"Not fun to work at."
bad,"I learned a lot from interacting with people from many backgrounds and cultures."
bad,"hard to handle when working part time and fulltime."
bad,"it was a good experience for to work at that warehouse, spent %99 of the time pushing carts and walking and running around looking for items."
bad,"horrible place to work unless you enjoy not having a life. Rude people, long hours, and they don't care about their employees."
bad,"Management uses favoritism, Learned basic warehouse objectives. co workers were lazy! Hardest part of the job, was listening to the bullshht the leaders told."
bad,Hard busy working day early start late finish but  but loved the job could earn extra if I wanted too. all my mates got a job there easy to get into
bad,Its was a fast pace and hard work. Its had its rewarding moments and fun. Like any where else you there are friendly and not so friendly people. You learn as you go.
bad,"Was very very tough on your body and soul since they didnt have any A/C when it was very hot, or heating when it was very cold."
bad,"Empresa com um ramo de atividade boa de se trabalhar, obtive um aprendizado sobre conhecimento de transporte, quanto a diretoria e gerencia falta aprimoramentos, falta de um planejamento adequado."
bad,"Yesterday I worked 17 hours - 7am until midnight - and got paid £70 before tax and national insurance. I would have finished at 7pm if they had been organised and let me collect my parcels on time instead of waiting in a queue for nearly four hours! They are so disorganised it's unreal. "
bad,"I work in a warehouse fork lift order picker i pack i rebin i slam i pick i bin count"
bad,"Not Inclined:"
bad,"Working there I met interesting people, and learn something different over day. I was unorganized, and at times could be unprofessional."
bad,"Easy work, but management believes SOLELY in negative reinforcement. You can scan the most items on the floor in a day, but they'll nitpick about one overage or shortage that's typically caused by someone else earlier in the chain (but they don't want to hear that)! If you DON'T see management, consider yourself as doing a good job because they don't give a darn about you or getting to know who they're in charge of. You're just a number. Or, if you're doing your job, they come by to watch you and NEVER give a perfect score no matter how productive, accurate, or fast you are! Most Managers are fresh out of college and walk around with a laptop and a radio and do zero real work. You can forget about leadership by example if you think a Manager is going to show you how to do your job. They care only about numbers and then at he end of the day....try to give you a high five as you walk out the door.....for what? Making them look good? Oh, and the absolute worst part about the job? You're there for 10 hour shifts. You might be a football fields' length away from the nearest break room, so when you get a 15 minute, it's really only like 5-7 minutes due to the travel time to get there! Same thing with your 30 minute....more like 20-23 due to travel time, lines to use vending machines, etc...."
bad,"Probably the most telling incident was an all hands meeting where they asked how many people (in a room of 550) had been working here for the last 2 years. It was supposed to be a ""pep talk"", but maybe...just maybe 10-12 people clapped."
bad,would not recommend this company to anyone. no life outside of work no time for family need 8 hour shifts. only care about getting the product out
bad,we all get out of bed to make are life better but why work for a company that don't understand how to say thanks no respect treat people like dogs
bad,working for amazon was brilliant love the job but the agency we work for is not good as we were working 56 hours each week from start up until the begining of this month where our hours have been reduced to 20 hours a week due to the volumn intake
bad,"Safety Safety Safety all about safety, but still expects you to make an imposable rate."
bad,A typical day is 10 hours of standing stooping even walking. The managers aren't concerned about you they only want numbers. If you are sick and its not work related don't even think about Am Care because you will be sent back to work if you're not on break. And then the breaks are suppose to be 15 mins but by the time you get to the break room or wherever you choose to break its time to go back in and they are clocking you!!!! The building is hot and there is so much favoritism that if you wanted to advance you would have to be friends with the manager. The hardest part of the job is being there because cause you have a family to take care of. The most enjoyable is coming in contact with new people.
bad,"# 1 in the industry, bIg name, big numbers, small pay checks.   For a person actually moving material and physically paying the price that most customers don't pay upon a purchase... That is where your money is going.   Not to the people moving the material or product.   To someone in an office telling the bottom of the totem that they shouldn't let it tip and they will be fired for 2 more replacements if they drop the ball again."
bad,Very mentally draining place to work.  Employees were measured against the clock on a daily basis whilst performing the same routine on a daily basis with no real room for career development or progressing up the business.
bad,"A typical day involved driving up to a minimum of 10 hours and delivering up to 130-150 parcels. I learnt how crucial it is to have a strong attention to detail."
bad,"i will never work there again "
bad,"a typical day at work was not an enjoyable prospect, being searched on the way in, and on the way out, the time given from point of clocking in and getting to and from workstations and at break times was not sufficient to provide proper breaks, management would not listen to any suggestions to improve productivity, any need to either take care of any toilet based needs or drinks was frowned upon, co workers all felt the same, and no sense of loyalty was apparent either from the line workers or agency staff. Very poor"
bad,"Not even sure why people do business with this company? Anything Amazon sells you can get at your local store that day and cheaper for the most part. Sure it gives me a job, but the people running it are not very bright. They implement changes that aren't practical for every day operations. They put you in positions that you don't like because you don't like it. They have all but eliminated morale. They care about one thing and that's their numbers. If you get hurt they tell you to take it easy instead of removing you from that position. Horrible place to work. Needs to be unionized to eliminate all the BS the managers get away with."
bad,"I believe with many others the company might be a great place to order from but not to work for. They constantly screw up points, hours on checks, if someone is injured on the job or not they will not work with you to help you out. If you try to address the problem to a manager or human resources your a snitch and will be looked down on. Favoritism is all that is done by the managers. If your not a female you wont grow into the company, all the managers do is flirt with the females. The mangers don't know what their doing. The place is a joke!"
bad,Amazon requires to much unnecessary things. The people I worked with were great but the rate system and management is unbelievable.
bad,cette entreprise doit servir de tremplin il ne faut pas compter évoluer
bad,they expect you to be a machine and make certain numbers and work 12 hr shifts and some times for 60+hrs a week
bad,"amazon is a very stressful, unhelpful, and unsanitary place to work. i learned nothing. management does nothing but put unnecessary stress on the workers. they only care about unrealistic quotas and working at such a fast speed that it causes work injuries and lots of errors. the only enjoyable part of the job is the pay."
bad,Area Managers work 15 plus hours and mainly write up and fire employees. There is no flexibility in shifts and management is rigid. Extreme turn over and constant training for new employees and other managers.
bad,"As a top producer on my team, daily, I am appalled by the number of people who do not have to produce the daily quota. My manager has said I do the work of 2 sometimes 3 other employees yet there is no cross-training, chance of promotion, or anything of value to me here. Mandated 12 hour days for 5 days a week during the months of November and December, then in January and February, you are forcibly ""coaxed"" to take VTO, voluntary time off, as they overhire and don't have enough work for anyone. Managers always have favorites and if you aren't one of them forget getting any perks or advancement options. Schedules consist of 4 ten-hour days from 7:30 am to 6 pm MST, working solo at own packing station if you are in Singles and limited interaction with co-workers."
bad,"Constantly flexing up or down depends on volume thats coming in. A lot of work work work or you will be punished for a bathroom break or any conversation due to scan rates needing to be high. Leads to people grabbing smaller packages. Bring lots of water, wouldn't recommend this job. Avoid unless you need money. Feet will hurt."
bad,"In nearly 5 years of employment,  no pay rise or increase in fuel allowance "
bad,"Went amazon hire you like a seasonal driver or employee in general they will fire you with no warnings at all so be prepared for it at all times , I won’t lie that the benefits are good but the lack of communication is outrageous and the management don’t care for no one just the numbers in the spreadsheet"
bad,"Fast paced, no one shows you  anything, until you do it wrong, theres rates(quotas) you can't hit them consistently your gone, managers are all early 20ish right from the university of wherever, wet behind the ears attached to lap tops,"
bad,"The work is alright but the salary is relatively small compared to the work you put in and the effects of the work you do (profit). Poor management, unfair treatment (nepotism)."
bad,"I worked production for a Prime Video show, not any of the offices or warehouses. It was not a great experience. Leadership was largely unprepared. Scheduling was poorly planned, resulting in conflict between departments. After I left, I'd heard working conditions and morale only further deteriorated. If there was anything I liked... I appreciated the head of my department. She was an inspiring individual."
bad,"Management isn't given the proper tools to help others succeed, and the advancement process is almost nonexistent. Pay is very underwhelming for the expectations."
bad,Driving for Amazon was stressful and unrewarding. Having to pay for the use of the vans was more than I was taking home! I was always late home with little support from supervisors!
bad,Poor Rating because HR didn't even demonstrate a comprehension of my questions upon termination of seasonal contract. I was looking to continue at Amazon full time and consistently communicated to my superiors of how difficult it has been to acquire reliable work anywhere. I feel my file had been closed and the responses might as well been that I was never employed there. If not for my supervisor ensuring me he'd keep me up to date on any new opportunities I wouldn't have very much encouragement.
bad,"Started well but soon enough targets were introduced and a constant monitoring of your movements and actions , this job will effect your mental health at some point because the relentless pace , pressure, repetitiveness  and monitoring will effect you I would suggest no more than 6 months for your general overall health."
bad,I did not enjoy the job mostly because id work hard nights throughout the week and barely get any compensation. what I was getting paid didn't even come close to the amount of work I was putting in.
bad,Harsh environment if you don't have good shoes be prepared to change jobs if you aren't good what your doing. Its pays ok but you won't really have a life if you work at night.
bad,High focus on performance management creates negative environment to the point that associates feel beat down versus challenged or empowered which creates unhappy employees
bad,Il lavoro a somministrazione permette alle aziende di trasformare le PERSONE in numeri.
bad,Communication problems advising you of your shift and start time daily. Expected to work when ever. Needed a more permanent secure job knowing what hours you were working that week.
bad,"If you take the hourly pay you make as a Level 3 Process Assistant and compare it to your salary pay as a manager, you actually take a pay cut to get promoted.  The bonuses are spread out over 2 years which you have to pay back if you decide you can't stand working 60 hours a week on your feet and having zero work life balance and quit, you have to pay that back prorated."
bad,"Hire and fire and don’t care,poor medical benefits,Management is helpless&clueless, backbreaking job making 150-180 stops a day for terrible money.always rushing around and barely get to take your breaks   Today they fired about 70 workers no heads up no care after promising workers they were trying to build company up"
bad,Unprofessional  place to work  they switch mangers  like crazy and have of the supervisor  dont really know what they doin when they come in which make it hard for us
bad,"I was a seasonal delivery driver for this company and the pay was good, we were paid weekly. But the management was unorganized. This is a good place if you want to work a second job, but I wouldn't suggest long term."
bad,Management is steeped in the concept that there is one box and any thing else is wrong. Suggestions are ignored even if they might improve safety or productivity
bad,"At amazon you are not and individual person..your treated like a number."
bad,You are not noticed until quota is not met. You will be physically and mentally broken down just to be kicked again. No fresh air and very dark. You are constantly monitored as if you have done something wrong and then you are scrutinized on your screen not even in person. Not ever sure who is in charge because everyone just walks laps with their laptops looking important. They know where you are before you do that is how closely they watch you. You have just signed up for prison boys and girls!
bad,You will work very hard. It's not an easy job some days majority of the things u need are missing or don't work. Management is all about them they tell you everything to get u in the door and then don't live up to it once ur in.
bad,"No health benefits, and not flexible with hours, poor management, lack of communication, human resources managers on site for short hours of the day, poor ventilation"
bad,"This company is only good for seasonal work. There's no room for advancement, 10 min breaks, the hours were always unstable so you couldn't really depend on this job except for gas money. Amazon can definitely do better."
bad,Avoid it unless you really need the money. Shifts during peak season are 11 to 12 hours for 5 to 6 days straight. Breaks are 15 min from scan to scan. It takes 15 min to get off your OP and walk to the break room. Lunch is only 30 min. The job is strenuous and physical and management does not care about you. All they care about is production. If you are not fast enough and don't meet rate you are out.
bad,"It is tempting when all the numbers are given about potential earnings! These will not materialise as deductions are made for van rental, expenses, and delivery penalties. Bonus's are difficult to achieve on a regular basis. It all depends on the Delivery Service Providers level of  honesty, integrity, and work values."
bad,"Einfach nur Schlecht, keine Achtung der Menschenwürde."
bad,"Non ci andrei più a lavorare,  chiedono troppi straordinari tutti i giorni,  turni con orari strani, faticoso, pausa troppo breve considerando la strada lunghissima che devi fare per andare in mensa."
bad,"Not a desirable place to work..the packers are treated like robots who once they hit the weekly goal..it only goes up and is harder to achieve. They look down upon restroom breaks..as your given a 30 minute lunch and a 30 minute ""free"" break.."
bad,"There was no interview for this position. I signed up online and picked a starting date. Then came in and took a drug test. That was the hiring process. The actually job itself consisted of standing at a conveyor belt and moving boxes from the belt to a shelf directly behind me. Most of the management team I saw, either played on their phones at their desks in the front of the warehouse, or sat in the break room chatting with each other all shift. The warehouse consisted of maybe 100 employees per shift, but a large amount either slept the entire shift in the break room or out in their car."
bad,"I don't recommend working at Amazon if you have substantial employment history. This place is made for people with zero work experience, or just getting back into the work field, or someone close to retirement. If you are intelligent, this is not the place for you!"
bad,"The complexity of the routing , the problem with the app in certain areas, the customer support not supportive! Fun job enjoyed delivering packages, it was more so the handlers at the hub not zoning properly!"
bad,"If Human Resources demonstrated some respect for scheduling preferences without inhibitions from policies, Amazon would best place to work. It is only part-time, and not worth killing yourself over."
bad,"Your just part of the machine,The only way to get help on your line is to not keep up! It seems that if you work slow you get help but if you keep up they just move you to a line that has fallen behind. I believe that if they had incentives they would get more from employees. It’s mindless work that anyone can do if you don’t have expectations on your future."
bad,"You will either fit in or not, there is no in-between. "
bad,"La mia esperienza in amazon è stata negativa sotto tutti i punti di vista. Shift manager incompetenti e a volte saccenti, colleghi interni che fanno di tutto per farsi vedere bravi a discapito di altri. In conclusione uno schifo totale!!! Sei sfruttato come un mulo. E se non vai bene ti Burano fuori dopo pochi giorni. Spero che all estero sia diverso."
bad,The co-workers were a lot of fun to be around. But Management wrote you up for going to the restroom. They do not work with you at all when it comes to personal time. I would never go back to Amazon.
bad,"If you can deal with the clueless managers and their ""Process Guide"" lackeys, you will get by. Rules are only selectively applied, depending on who you are and how much you kiss a**."
bad,Manager cares more about rates than employees. You do your best but it never seems to be enough  I love what I do and the employees but the owners don’t appreciate your hard work and the toll it takes on your body
bad,"Not a great place to work, all workers are expendable and not treated with the respect they deserve. They need to learn to respect there workers like they do for there customers"
bad,Granted its a job but you constantly get in trouble if you miss quota by one package. If you are injured they encourage you to basically quit with making time off due to injury a pain.
bad,In gorakhpur Amazon distributor is also bad here job security not only today is good so good. Here many froud by officer's and bleam on DA. Here are delivery associate working in very poor condition.
bad,"Poor conditions (inadequate training, no chairs or room to sit during a break, no protection for customer's order in location where you have to get outside from packing area to the store to pick the order, no response from the manager regarding problems with orders or WF store staff) that were not addressed by the manager."
bad,"The job is very physical and fast paced. This is not an issue but when you add that to- management that don't care if staff members get hurt on the job, bad talking staff, cherry picking friends for low stress duties and pressuring others to meet impossible goals, it becomes a very unhealthy negative environment."
bad,Working for them was ok short hours. and no way to move up in the company. Plus they were not every understanding when it came to people having kids. you couldn't miss to many days and you couldn't make any over time when you needed to.
bad,Managers are slow/ half of them aren't even qualified to do the job. They hired a Canadian teacher to run logistics.  Guess how that went?  No HR means you have to call them and wait for them to call you back.
bad,The hours and labor involved for the amount of pay and benefits were not equitable. Often times we had to fight over hours available to a team of over 50 but only 8 shifts are posted
bad,"When you first start at Amazon everyone seems really friendly. But after you've been there a few months, you start to notice that it's not that they're friendly, they're brainwashed. They're being overly friendly and positive about the job and the company because they're trying to escape the tedium of the job and the fact that the people calling in on the customer service lines are rarely happy with the service. And an Xbox in the game room doesn't really make up for that!"
bad,"Threatens firing for small mistakes, or if a customer complains. Trained to go up driveways(or other time efficient things) then threatens to fire anyone who is breaking the rules. Implementing mentor app and told to drive safely, no harsh braking or turning but provides outdated, third-party ""rabbits"" to us that have constant issues with the GPS, and are slow to scan barcodes among other issues. Half of the vans don't have phone mounts as well which is a safety issue."
bad,Slaved until you die of will to work. Replaceable with a flick of a finger. No guarantee you will have employment beyond tomorrow. Misery is a thing everyone should get comfortable with.
bad,"They make you feel welcome and special,  but soon you realize you are just another body. Required to work long hard hours, extremely fast paced. Mandatory overtime."
bad,"Get this Amazon hires me, I do the training and all that then they have no schedule for me. This goes on for 3 weeks. Then they fire me for not working."
bad,"When I first joined, it was amazing. I was in a great FC that was on the up and up.  However, we had several upper management changes that tanked all of that near instantly.  They made behind the scenes changes to boost numbers temporarily but then when it caught up and they dropped dramatically they were cracking down on all of us to get them back up to the numbers they cheated to get to. My manager was trying to save his own job and therefore threatened all of the people underneath him with PIPs to try to either get numbers up for him to to clean house. Mandatory overtime was the worst, associates will make more than you when you factor in overtime and are capped at 60 hours a week while you are working close to 75 as their manager without OT pay."
bad,Get the right people to train the new employees. 2 days on the road training is ridiculous. Management didn’t know what they are doing. Had to sit in a parking lot when job was complete for the day under an easy up. No break rooms.
bad,"Hours are only available during holiday season, as soon as that is done hours disapear and jobs are cut.  If work load is ligh for the day employees are sent home."
bad,"Getting to the canteen for breaks is a logistical nightmare, I would describe it as a 'cattle market'! The harness to my PUP Truck was hidden from me by other employees and when I reported to supervisors they fobbed me off!"
bad,Es ist nicht alles wie zu sein Scheint. Und hier trügt der Schein.
bad,The recruitment pnp company were terrible and have god complexes. they demanded outrageous things and treated you like you were trash. they need to work out there own problems instead of blaming others.
bad,es una empresa muy explotadora que pide mucho y paga muy poco
bad,mind games are played and they only promote you if u hang outside of work with them. they abuse hard workers by overworking them and let the slackers slack
bad,"Back breaking work, I hurt my back on the job and they are fighting me for workers comp. Everyone is out for them. It's all about the numbers you produce. If you do not meet the hourly rate of 2,500 items stowed you can lose your job. If you take unpaid time off you can and will lose your job. There are so many rules that are in place that it's no wonder they have a high turnover of employees."
bad,Stressful and no assistance or support team available. Management leaves you to fend for yourself in messy situations that you have no expertise in. Complex systems with policies that constantly change with no notification to workers.
bad,Amazon is a terrible compliant with terrible rules. They're only focus is that you get the job done. Machines are always breaking down and you get blamed for your rate being low. They will also move you involuntarily and they make it hard for you to go back or progress.
bad,"A typical day at an Amazon warehouse is fast paced and a good work out. But that's as good as it gets. The management at Amazon is nonexistent. They all know how logistics work, but none of them know what a MANager is. The management style at Amazon is maximum passive aggressive. "
bad,one of my co-workers was terminated at the job for being assaulted on the site by another worker if they would do that to him that goes to show amazon shows no value in you as a worker. If something like that could happen to him it would happen to anybody the pay is good but this job can be stressful at times because of the freezer work lack of material to operate and function properly. Broken equipment & poor wifi connections broken shelves wet slippery floors small isles. i wouldn't recommend anybody to stay at this place of work for extreme periods of time it can cause harm and stress to your body and health.
bad,"The job is easy, but there are a lot of lazy people that makes it harder than it should be. No a/c at the facility I was stationed and management was horrible."
bad,Expectations are mixed.  Wanting the leaders to be on the floor; however required of lots of meetings at the same time.  Worked so many hours I am not sure how I got home most days.  And you were always threaten that you could be the next to be on the bottom of the 9 blocker.
bad,Management pushes for numbers they dont need to further there own bonuses .they rush you through training in like a day they are very unsafe and as soon as they start hiring they start looking to fire any one making over staring wage the only people who move up are inexperienced managers right out of college .you will be just a replaceable number tread carefully
bad,"Talking down coworkers negatively and no cooperation was the environment. Assertiveness and cooperation is frowned upon."
bad,Higher management positions micro-manage everything which is not good for employees. There is always changes in processes which create somehow an unstable environment.
bad,"In der Schulung am Anfang wird leider vermittelt, das es nur um Kundenzufriedenheit geht. Dann hat man ein halbes Jahr Probezeit in der man gewisse Ziele und Werte erreichen muss. Diese Werte werden verfälscht indem wenn man krank ist oder Urlaub hat, die Werte einfach mit in die Gesamtbewertung der Probezeit mit einbezogen wird und wehe man bearbeitet einen Kontakt länger als man telefoniert hat, dann bekommt man schon einen auf den Deckel."
bad,"Wide variety of projects to explore and learn! However, some teams do not have diversity causing politics to overtake productive work!"
bad,"It is a terrible place to work, long hours and bad compensation. It is exhausting to work there, and they constantly ask for overtime. They don't provide enough breaks either."
bad,"A typical day at work is mostly chaos.  Management is not very communicative with associates or other management personnel. Directions are often given in gray terms and not very clear nor do they make sense.  Mostly people want to come to work, get paid then go home.  No real sense of unity or teamwork."
bad,"Lacked good leaders, however quality at which products were shipped off was good"
bad,"I would not recommend working at Amazon.... The turn over is unbelievable. To satisfy part time wages, Amazon took away monthly bonuses and and yearly stock options. Yes They did give a raise but it did not compensate for the loss. Once again I would not recommend working there."
bad,"- Manager versuchen erst gar nicht Konflikte zu lösen"
bad,"I worked in the contact center in Seattle, WA. Long days, extremely rude customers, and for a billion dollar company I was only paid $16 hourly. I was hoping for advancement opportunities that were non existent."
bad,Stripped us of all health benefits and refuse to give us decent amount of hours a week. It's ok for extra spending money but you cant live off Amazon wages period !
bad,There’s no advancement in the workplace. I was trained and moved to be gatekeeper and never was placed in the position. I do everything from training new recruits to sweeping the floor for left behind packages to helping management and dispatch. I’m undervalued at the site and it makes coming to work a drag.
bad,Often over hire for peak season then look for excuses to fire you when they’ve got more employees than they do work. The AM’s are probably just as green as you are to the role.
bad,"Only been there 4 weeks and I’m already done. They just had a family day last week (6/20) and badges get scanned to have the day off as VTO (voluntary day off). Still marked me as absent. They have a point system which seems ridiculous. Even if you leave early for an emergency, or you’re feeling sick, you get points added. Management is the worst. They hire from within and don’t seem to know how to manage properly. One of the ops managers at night actually walks around with a counter, clicking each time she walks past a packer to keep track. You have to keep your rates high at this location or you’re not going to last. For the type of work that you do and how strict their rules are, I would think the pay would be higher. I’m already looking into another job."
bad,"Positive work performance lasts for one week, negative work performance last forever. Unnecessary stress, rate is arbitrarily determined, as the same exact work process can generate different productivity rates based only on how the item was classified when received.  Management constantly looking for new data metrics to negatively review your performance.  Recently began “Minority Report” type feedback, punishing you for behavior that may create errors, even if no error occurred."
bad,"hard on employees, no benefits unless get full time, no ac, no water, paid weekly on Friday if part time and full time paid bi-weekly, management has a high turn over, they keep getting fired, so not a good sign for moving up"
bad,"Management doesn’t care if your over worked all they care about is making themselves look good even if it means over working employees. Shift leader was very rude always had rude and smart comments about people , refused to let you do any hours over 29 .. give you no training at all just bring you on the warehouse floor and expect you to do a job you have no clue what you are doing"
bad,"Put it this way. High employee turnover can only mean one thing. "
bad,Never organized always changing stuff without consulting with employees force you to help people who slack off make you work longer then u have to management comes up with new rules everyday they mess u schedule up put u days u tell them u can’t work i wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone
bad,When I first started to work for Amazon they were over all ok and the work environment was calm. Then as time progressed they became very unorganized and inattentive to the morning employees. All the managers were rude and snooty. Not to mention I was attacked twice there and before they took action I had to open a case with the EEOC in order for them to take affirmative action. They fired me because one of the managers had intimate feelings for my attacker.
bad,Only one location in the Washington area (Kent) offers full time positions. This isn't a real job unless you're going to school or something. Hardly any parking available at the Renton location. Everyday you show up and they ask if 20 of you want to go home because there isn't enough work.
bad,They would prefer to let people not do their jobs than allow management to hold them accountable. Yet another company that would rather hire some kid off the street with a piece of paper showing they went to school vs someone who has been in management for 10+ years. Your paid brakes are 15mins... But depending on where you are stationed in the building you may only get 5 minutes.
bad,The hourly rates of pay per hour aren't sufficient enough for the amount of work they require and the sweat needed and put into the high production rate expected is just unreasonable . The hourly pace needed or expected of employees isn't fairly evaluated per worker and training giving isn't enough to perform the job properly how the company expects .
bad,Wish HR would have been better to help in stressful situations we would rely on them but they never respond of help in any way even when they have the ability to.
bad,The enviroment for basic warehouse workers is overly fast paced amd require you to make constant absurd quotas. Even for offering 15 dollars an hour. Unless you are a blue badge permanent employee you get zero benefits.
bad,"Constantly raising rates, to include errors and time off task resulting in write ups and termination.  Breaks and lunch to short.  Managers who don't know what they are doing and show preference with employees."
bad,agent d'exploitation mauvais management car pas de coté humain
bad,"Regardless of what has been read in the media, there is a reason why Amazon refuses to allow cameras and recording devices in their fulfillment centers.  While the work is not physically demanding the overall treatment of general employees is below average."
bad,Hands down the worst HR job I have evey had!  HR is expected to fall in line with all Ops demands regardless of the negative impact or repercussions it may have on the associates. All the nightmarish stories you may have read are 110% accurate!  Avoid the Amazonian trap at all costs!  You have been warned!
bad,"Too fast paced. Break room, restrooms are on opposite ends of huge building. Very hot environment. They wouldn't let me transfer to another shift or dept with no reason of as to why. Breaks are 10 minutes and it takes at least 5 minutes to walk to anything in huge building. Constantly being told to work faster and harder. Alot of time off, even if some is unpaid. Hired quickly with no interview. That is just the tip of the iceberg...."
bad,Always felt left out as I was not as young as the vast majority of employees. Left as as soon as I had realized I would never be offered a permanent position. They only wanted to hire someone who was young and had similar interests.
bad,"It's exhausting, unrewarding, promotions are based on a point system and you earn points through things that have nothing to do with work, like signing up for the Safety Committee or Activities committee. They'll put you in roles above your employment level but won't pay you for it. Management changes every six months cause managers get moved to other buildings. It's not worth it."
bad,"Been told to be trained by an experienced(6months)partner for 1 week, trained for just 4 days. Been given van with almost empty fuel. You pay fuel everyday as it is a self employed basis. Haven't receive anything on the training payment, management(doubtful about if the people running the show actually studied & learned people management- very poor of providing ongoing support and direction for employees) they just talk to you like a dog with no choice but to bite the bone yourself. Working too much hours, they schedule you on the first wave which you need to be there at 6:15am then you will get your loads of parcels(more than a hundred! it's ridiculous and you will be covering series of postcodes. The job will be like these: You drive and follow the nav.. stop to the destination, find where to park- grab the parcel- walk(if you're unlucky,go up to 3rd floor),go down, climb your van, off you go! same cyclic job rest of the day. It's so stressful that you will be back at the depot around 20:30hrs, still to  drive going home coz you can't bring the van home."
bad,They do not provide accommodations during Peek season for associates with children. They love the customer more than their workers. HR is horrible so don't depend of them to help you with anything.
bad,"if you need a temp part time job its fine. meat factory, no care for asst hours, will tell you if they need you to go home early or stay late the same day. never worked for this type of company before, and will not again"
bad,"The conditions at amazon are horrible. There is no communication between managers and employees. It gets unbearably hot in the summer due to lack of air-conditioning and extremely cold in the winter because there is no heating."
bad,I worked at Amazon through a job agency for a new Amazon location at that time that they just opened. So they were not organized at all. They were just learning as they go.
bad,management was poor. the lack of respect and compensation was horrid. if you apply for this job make sure to have another one lined up and ready to go.
bad,"After looking for a job for almost a year I started working at Amazon and I was so happy about it.from the beginning they just talked to us about the safety stuff and the rules and after that we were on our own to go learn how to get the job done and no training what so ever , but after the first month working there I was seeing that they're hiring more than 10 people a day and it was crowded and we had to flex down ( they call it VTO) almost everyday. After a while they started firing people every week and us workers call it ""PURGE"" when I saw they firing people I decided to work as hard as I can so I don't lose this job because this was my only source of income so I became the fastest worker there and was working everyday like a Robot and if one day I couldn't work as fast as before they'd ask me to be faster ( basically I felt like a slave) but I had no other options because I really needed this job. On Christmas eve and the day after new years they fired almost half of the people there and were telling us that the morning shift is being closed and they're going to fire everybody and only couple people going to be moved to the night shift. I already knew who's going to be moved to the night shift because there was people who started working after me and they weren't working as much as others but they had good connections with the managers. So yesterday they called %70 of people who were left from the previous purges that they're done and they can't come to work anymore but I didn't receive that call yesterday and I thought I'm chosen for to keep working but today after I"
bad,"I worked for Amazon and have many years of experience. I will tell you that the older people who had the knowledge to help enhance the company were not considered for leadership positions. If you didn't have a degree they would not consider you for a supervisory position. The supervisors there were very young. The people were treated as numbers and the pace was extremely fast. If you were not fast and couldn't keep the pace you were not a star in their eyes. The less clothes that you wore the more popular you were. I watched them literally leave a man on a job by himself until he was injured and had to be taken out by an ambulance after I had asked 2 supervisors to get him some help. It was absolutely ridiculous. Also the signs that were posted on the ground said that the joy was paying $15.00 an hour but, however once we got into the interview we were instructed that the pay was only $12.00 an hour. The job was a complete disappointment. "
bad,"A lot of time spent talking about issues within our team, not enough action. I think employees should be valued more and work should be enjoyable just as much as it is productive."
bad,I would pass. theres not a lot of advancement and pay sucks in the end. Depending on the shift it can be hard to manage. People are good people working there though just wish they paid more.
bad,"Daily administration of logistics, deliveries, inventory, returns and missing parcels."
bad,No work/ life balance. Not a friendly place for older workers. My experience was a frustrating one in thatissues with my manager were either ignored or not taken seriously
bad,"All about the business, productive and numbers."
bad,Be prepared to be written up if you dont make your numbers I came with a group literally there was nobody left either fired or quit. Short breaks quick lunch they dont trust there own mother camera surveillance and metal detectors everywhere decent pay but kis it worth the exhaustion and body hurt don't think so.
bad,"Workloads are always unmanageable. Since churn is so high, hours are always in flux to cover personnel gaps. The strong bias for MBAs, hampers one's ability to rise in the ranks on the Retail side of the business."
bad,Very   unfriendly environment work work work vro at the end of peak season will have you broke unless you want to stand around and do nothing for 10 hours.
bad,"This job is only suitable for temporary workers for some quick money. I would describe my experience very disturbing. They put some targets that are impossible for a healthy environment, I saw people collapsing for the workload. Brakes are monitored and if you go to toilets few times they would come to you and give warnings. And if you don't meet the crazy and impossible targets for 3 weeks they would fire you. You are basically a number for this company, you don't count as a human being."
bad,"It was a terrible place to work, staff was friendly but management and working environment wasn't that good.  Id never work there again.  I wouldnt recommend anyone working there"
bad,"Your experience here is very team dependent, that said there's a lot of very bad managers. Little autonomy, you get thrown from project at the whims of upper management."
bad,Not flexible with working schedule. It did not work well with my families busy life. Working from home is not something I care to do. Managers weren’t readily available.
bad,"Amazon has great benefits,pto, and unpaid time off .you also manage your time if you go negative then ur fired so as long as you watch your ok. However I've been there 5 years stuck no raises because they tell us they do evaluations in the local area on how much those companies pay their employees.Every October they seem to come back with we are paid higher if you include benefits. Not only are u stuck at 14.40 after 2 years they raise and raise your rates and change systems, rules etc to make it easier to be written up. Alot of the time they don't tell employees of these new rules or changes and then people get handed 2 write ups at the same time or even walked out. So it's very stressfull in the aspects of job security no matter how long you've worked there or how much you do there to help the daily needs. Long 10 hour days no sitting allowed no music no cell phones just warehouse loud noises. Id say it's a paycheck and i wouldnt stay longer then. ,Years you'll cap out anywas so I'd say 2 years if you can keep yourself under the radar with numbers and watch your time."
bad,"Bad shifts. wouldnt really suggest for women candidates. they will ruin there health, Target based work will make it monotonus and you will not enjoy there"
bad,"Amazon pretends to care about employees (with Kudos points, and ""BBAM"" [Better Boosting Amazon Morale]), but anyone that isn't half brain dead can see it for what it is. There is very little upward mobility, and if you are on the phones, you have to endure a LOT of verbal abuse from the customers you have to deal with on a daily basis. Even so, those that you do help, will still rate you at a low score, which affects your metrics, which determines your mobility within the company."
bad,"Amazon will take everything you give. If your looking for work life balance, this is not the place to come to. Amazon moves fast and expects its leaders to sacrifice what is needed to keep up with the demand."
bad,The culture lacks proper management. Total disregard for employees and their work/life balance. A very toxic environment. Managers need to stop building conflicts within their own team.
bad,A typical day at work is very stressful. The managers were clueless about what to do because the upper management lacked communication. The hardest part of the job was to keep up with the outrageous rate they have set for their employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was leaving.
bad,"During the 2 years I spent working for Amazon, I admit that I learned more than I thought I would. However this was one of the few good things I have to say about the location I worked. I learned Basic and moderate trouble shooting of an advanced auto sort system along with basic flow control skills. I was typically stationed on the auto system and assisted in diagnostics with the machine when problems were to arise. The work itself was challenging, yet rewarding."
bad,Everything is about time and numbers. You get about two days of training. They may give you a week to truly learn the position after that you will start to get write up for your counting or picking or packing rates.
bad,"Very biased job assignment standards, high production rates and frequent disciplinary write-ups. Often went to work wondering if it might be your last shift."
bad,If you are looking to work like and animal in a cage not being given enough to time eat and go to toilet then this is the job for you. Not bad for cash over xmas
bad,The job is part time. Good for some but that is all they offer unless you are able to climb the ladder pretty high to thuggery management. I felt like a minority there and the ones who advanced were friends with the managers and didn’t do much work! I worked my tail off just to be unnoticed
bad,"Everyone's always competing against each other for menial gains, so it's a real toxic workplace where you can't trust anyone, and everyone's out to get ya. Long hours, hard work, it's just draining and soul sucking.  Not for everyone!"
bad,"I worked at Amazon as a temp gig to get some quick cash and would not recommend it to anybody. You have to work 4 days on 3 days off of 14 hour shifts, get only a 30 minute lunch that you cant even get to the break room in time to get or the 5 minute breaks that you are better off just sitting down where you are. The money is good but don't let that lure you in to a bad job."
bad,"If you are going to work here, have a plan. It can get very competitive and biased if you plan to work here for the long haul. Its a good job to help someone get back on your feet. Management is very much out for themselves, but every once and awhile you will come across one who helps and develops their employees."
bad,"Really good discipline regarding doc review before discussions which allows for well-informed discussions. Wow, i find this particularly annoying.  Here I am providing info and you guys aren't happy with the number of words that I put in.  Seriously guys."
bad,"Learning the basics at amazon has you covered. There aren't many duties to learn so when you do, they will use you where ever they need you. The warehouse environment is a concern as harassment is rampant between associates. No room for advancement."
bad,I joined as part of their seasonal Christmas staff. We were hounded by management for not meeting targets and laid off after being behind on said targets three times. Mandatory overtime close to Christmas meant working at least sixty hours per week.
bad,Not Best for life to many hours and this job will take all of your energy. They will wait till You will burn out all of your energy and than ask for more.
bad,"I had to work in either too hot environments or too cold, literally in a freezer they think we are just machines. my health deteriorated dramatically while I was working there.  Since there is always people quitting just expect to find anyone as coworkers. the pay is not enough for all the stuff you gotta do and all the stuff you put your body through. my advice: do not work for Amazon."
bad,"drive anything up to 100 miles to collect your parcels, all expenses on you. deliver usually in a radius of 30 miles.  Very limited on support and often accusations of parcels not received"
bad,I worked as a contractor. I was made to feel disposable. I at no point felt like I was valued as a person or an employee. The FTE's made us contractors feel like lowly henchmen.
bad,"Culture and managers , work time , daily shift change , not an employee centric , no development, no appraisal , no respect for employee , weekly team change"
bad,The job expects you to constantly move for 10 hours with 80% productivity. The breaks are very short. Productivity is giving 3 times a day. By the time you get off work you will be too tired to do anything else.
bad,"When I started at Amazon, I was excited for this new opportunity with a growing company.  That soon changed, they make false promises, extremely disorganized, no direction and poor management.  They hire continuously so you are just a number.  If you work hard and are helpful, you end up making up for those who are less ambitious.  Also, they constantly change the schedules to fit the business needs.  For example, I was a morning worker but after peak they eliminated my shift and if I wanted to continue working there I was forced to work the overnight shift.  They also constantly add/remove working hours to fit their needs."
bad,"Could work there again, but must be in different departments. Amazon is ok to work for in the right department. The management is very in-experienced. And most have no idea of what they are doing."
bad,"Fast paced, heavy lifting work, stressful dealing with hot headed individuals, poor management, convenient work hours the only positive thing I can think of."
bad,This job was not fulfilling. The equipment used as a stower did not work well.  The employees were made to feel dispensable. The hours were long and grueling and the workplace culture did not encourage teamwork.
bad,Your not a person.  Your barley a number pay was good and that's it.  One needs better or to get one tied on quite often to deal with this place it is not a place to work.
bad,"you hire in for an “unknown” job. Once you manage to “make rate” at that job(if u do), they train you on another iob you didn’t ask for and expect you to make rate on it too. If you don’t “make rate” in the specified time or make certain errors too many times they “write you up” on a laptop and you dont get a copy of it. (I wasnt even told I was getting written up when it happened. I found out abt it myself on the hub) Three write ups and ur fired. I started out “picking” and barely make rate doing that. Then they trained me on one of 3 types of “counting” which I am 132% rate so they leave me alone on that. Just trained me on “stow” and not making rate, so will likely get written up soon on stow. Don’t know why they wd rather make me do jobs I dont excell at and fire me rather than let me do the job I do excell at and remain employed. Never worked at a place like this before, and won’t ever again when my time here is over."
bad,Amazon valued customer satisfaction over employee needs and concerns. Meeting production goals was important than the safety of the employees or accuracy of doing the job correctly.
bad,"no matter how hard you work ,they'll always ask for more.you are told at hiring it is a seasonal job. they provide a screening service,Your forced to be aggressive to keep your counts up."
bad,wasn't very good to work for running about collecting things from A to B. No security in the job since most of the jobs were temp and only lasted 3 months for christmas period
bad,"this job is for people who would only want something temporary, i personally can't see anyone who would want to spend 70% of their lives in a place where there is an enjoyable world out here"
bad,"Everything is run by a computer system, if you try to do everything online and say set your schedule you have a chance for the days that you set to work, the system will not accept it because it will not work."
bad,You can lose your job for taking a summer vacation or a vacation with your family or a destination wedding. They give you certain amount of hours for unpaid time off; feels like trapped if you don't want to lose this job. No raises after year. Not being appreciated.
bad,"Been there four months in few departments.If you are a general warehouse operative from agency just do your few months and leave.Tthey sack +95% of agency workers regardless how they work and what part of the year,don't dream about full time contract and tbh. its not paying more so don't give too much for this job since the work you put in not going to pay back.Just make a few bucks and flip the bird when they treat you like dirt too many times,like most of the people.Do not take this job seriusly since they dont care either."
bad,"The morale is nonexistent here, it is consistently mismanaged, and employees do not feel like people: only numbers.  Human Resources consistently fails to correct their mistakes for employee accounts, and managers make their employees feel like garbage with demeaning words and raised voices.  Employees who have been in that building for years--and at full time status-- have been reduced to part-time status and moved to other buildings, being told that they ""aren't needed"" here.  This reduces the human experience at this place to zero, and it is such a shame.  I expected more from a billion-dollar corporation."
bad,"Depend on your team and your manager, it could be a fun place to work. Or it could be a miserable life. No work life balance. Be ready to work 24/7, if you want to be successful. I have seen managers works 60-70 hours per week. No time for their family. Everyone denied that amazon doesn’t care about family. However, if you want to get promoted, they will look at how much you did. Most of the time, you must be willing to work anytime required. Amazon doesn’t really commodate for breastfeeding mother. Even though they said they do. But if you need time to pump at work, you will be judged."
bad,"Je pense sincerement que les managers devraient adopter une meilleure communication avec les associates."
bad,"Every day is a struggle just to keep the job. 3 write ups and you are fired. managers pick favorites and if you aren,t as quick as the others you will easily become fired."
bad,this company is only concerned with how many items you pick in an hour.  You have no direct contact with management.  You will walk between 10 and 14 miles per day.
bad,"Don't really know where to start, the manager I had was totally incapable of his assignment, we were on our feet for 10 hours a shift, during peak we worked 12 hour shifts, 5- 6 days a week. You have a really unachievable hourly rate you have to meet, and when you don't your out the door, the wages are way too low for what they expect from you."
bad,Night shift 12:00-6:30 (small sort) for the most part CO workers are easy to get along with . We have a team work motto. Some management & ambassadors treats employees with severe disrespect. Craziest thing I've witness is someone getting yelled at for using the restroom like seriously are we supposed to use it in  our pants or wear a diaper to work??? If you work hard it often gets overlooked . Unloaders are the only ones treated with respect  .... Some ambassadors absolutely do nothing & when I say absolutely nothing I mean stand around sleep on the job feet dragging walking extremely slow.. the turnover rate is high extremely high people leave all the time or get fired for a scan rate below 1:30.. If you do apply here do not work the night shift day time or evening shift is the way to go
bad,Sucks dont know when they will let u go. Make rate or get fired management doesnt know what is going on. Typical day at work is stressful. Pay is alright and benefits is good wouldnt recommend to anyone. Always talk about how many people they hire but never say how many they fire
bad,"they don't grow people from inside , some do if u r manager's favourite , your talent n competency not valued at Amazon."
bad,"the job I had at amazon was to test the waters with my first job, that being said the structure of the management was terrible I never knew who was in charge of me and the quota they had set never seemed attainable even with maximum effort"
bad,"Pay is low for warehouse work starting at 8.20 but it is made worth it by being weekly pay (Every Friday). Do not come into this job expecting to be there for years on years as I have been working for Amazon since September at the Tilbury site and have seen 100's of people fired or 'released' as they call it. Shifts are 8-6:30 on a 4 day week, come the third day you will be tired and going on the fourth youre exhausted so having three days off is nice but still not enough, this and the fact that they can change your working days with a moments notice say goodbye to your social life. The management is not great at all and they try to avoid questions at all costs, they set the targets at an incredibly high rate and allow no mistakes at all (Double scanning an item, overage (which isnt even your fault) and not putting two items into the same pod etc...)"
bad,"Yeah, it was nice from the beginning. But it's a game of who like you the best to be hired full-time. It's numbers game and if you like work do it but don't set your bar high because moving up is tough. It's just a job."
bad,Amazon is a job for young people with no responsibility.. can't live off of just the one check. ------------------------------------------------------
bad,They will work you till you can't anymore Favorites advance base on friendships made. mangement is a joke. Only good thing was Medical insurance! Most employees quit after 2 years.
bad,"I would not encourage anyone to consider this work environment as a long term job placement. The job is physically very demanding. And the company is not loyal to low level employees but treats them as disposable. You will meet lots of interesting people from varied backgrounds, most of whom very much want to be good and successful employees and who rely on the income and benefits for their own and their family's basic survival. There are some benefits to the work schedule, but 10 hour days in such a physically demanding job will take a toll on your body, especially your feet. As a temporary or short term job, you may find it a good experience. If you are expecting long term employment, you may be shortly disappointed."
bad,"micromanaged all the time with no training, the team i was on didn't have a manager for a while so it was even worse. everyone does things differently so when they coach you you get told to do things 10 different ways, its super frustrating. the job honestly isn't worth it."
bad,Paid well but never met my desired needs or they never gave what was promised before getting hired. Typical day was slow depending the hour or who was working. No managers took their job seriously and that was really unprofessional and frustrating.
bad,I simply couldn't work those ridiculous hours doing those boring task on that horrible floor. We couldn't even listen to music to help us stay awake all night. The pay wasn't enough for the amount of pain you will be in everyday and or night.
bad,"dog eat dog for sure, the 4 months I was there they went through over 1000 people! Yous have to start before your shift and then work after putting in 10 hours"
bad,"Hard working conditions and low pay, Sucks. The company expected far too much out of their employees for the amount of pay that was given. Another thing would be the labor its such hard work being at Amazon"
bad,Nedoporučuji kvůli  špatnému přístupu nadřízených.
bad,"Long work hours that require standing hours at a time 12+ hours a day. Disciplinary actions taken against injuries and/or illnesses. Any sensible companies know to increase profits, take care of your employees."
bad,"All production errors are blamed on the employee, not on design of processes and equipment failures. "
bad,"Amazon, is a warehouse type of work and does not care much for promoting from within or qualified individuals. They believe that humans are machines and are treated that way, they are required to pack at a certain rate and maintain the rate for as long as one works there."
bad,Typical day is consisting of new hired managers from other companies or new college grads with very little insight about analyzing the productivity in the warehouse for Amazon Fresh. The company is growing so fast that there are very few qualified persons in management available to direct the company efforts.
bad,"Walk an average 15-20 miles a shift. Very hot, uncomfortable. Crowded. Systems not accurate. Ridiculous pick paths that make absolutely no common sense. Safety risks"
bad,"Life post Amazon: sleeping, socializing, eating well, feeling healthy, feeling great about the future. I would not recommend Amazon.com to anyone. Does knowing first hand that there are monsters under the bed and monsters in the closet help a career going forward? Amazon's former Studio chief is on a continuum of bad behavior that includes harrassment that is not Weinstein-esque but ruins lives just the same."
bad,"poor management, ridiculous expectations, rude HR department that just sits around and doesn't fix hostile work environment, stress inducing, the fact that you have to have time to cover you being tardy or absent is absolutely asinine, just all over a terrible, slave driving company."
bad,All about numbers.. Not about safety at all.. Every get 12.75 Everyone. And they write people up for the numbers  I mean . But when it's a safety thing they don't write people up.  They make your day like so your worthless until you either quit or get fired. 5 out of 100 people stay for 6 months. 60 a week with one say notice. Horrible just horrible.
bad,Amazon is extremely fast paced. You can walk up to 25 miles a day. Bathrooms can be 100 yards from where your stationed. If your not extremely friendly and extremely open with management then your probably not going to succeed.
bad,"Fast Paced - Every working minute measured, including productiivty and breaks. The hard work from associates seems under appreciated. Part time work, have to pick you schedule every week. not always same schedule. Some weeks difficult to get the maximum of 24 hours."
bad,"Overall review working with Amazon, for the type of heavy workload being in a order picking machine, working constantly on your heavy steal boots all day picking and carrying heavy items that weighs more than 40 pounds at a long period of 10-12 hours a day, they should pay more for this type of job! $13.90 really??????????, More responsibility and most required attention & safety is at most priority when operating this heavy order picker machinery! I believe they should pay more than this rate that they require!"
bad,"Decent pay but no job security. Good if you're only looking for something temporary, I don't recommend staying for too long as there is no room for progression. Long hour shifts and repetitive work. Hardly any training provided and lots of pressure from the agency to meet the targets."
bad,How can you be told that your line can go home by the shift manager because the job was done but give everyone on that line a point for leaving. Thats how I lost my amazon job had 5 points that I had just asked hr to correct earlier that night because it said I had 6 but its cool
bad,"no one ever knew what was going on. one day we had a certain amount of time to do our sweep, the next day no one was informed of the time change then people wanted to get upset over things not being done. the 15min breaks is actually a 5min break according to the managers & hr. The amount of time it takes you to get to break is your problem not theirs no matter how you cut the cake according to them. had to write each pod I counted along with time and amount of items in each pod while trying to keep rate, because if you cant prove a mistake isn't your fault then you get the write up."
bad,It started out good but once I started working there it got harder than I thought it wasn't what I thought and no I wouldn't tell any body to go and work there.
bad,"Walking or slow running 15 miles a day "
bad,"Typical day you wonder what kind of BS you will be doing as you are rotated  around. Normally loading trucks with team lift and mech lift items. They recently installed a bell system to herd us to and from breaks (not active yet but will be). Work/life balance is nonexistent with 10 hour shifts. There is no moving up in the company for real as they hire managers straight out of college that never worked in a warehouse to manage entire departments. Avoid at all cost, if you happen to find yourself in a Amazon warehouse do the bare minimum as they do not show any appreciation for the people who go above and beyond. I could go on and on. The only good thing they have is the insurance but even that isn't worth it in the end to stay there."
bad,"This company is very shady and greedy. As a whole, they only care about numbers and being at the top of every ""who's who"" list there is. It is one thing to have high standards and push your employees to uphold and exceed those standards but those employees are still human and they have feelings. At the end of the day, Amazon doesn't function without those same employees they often tend to forget are the sole reason they are even able to make their millions. Each and every manager I encountered at some point and in some fashion either directly disrespected myself or countless coworkers. Amazon trains those managers to become self-serving jerks and they only look out for themselves and their select favorites. If you do not get in good with management at Amazon's warehouses, you don't stand a chance. And good luck if moving up is your dream, this place is a dead end unless you have some sort of degree. Literally, any degree will do. No related experience necessary. The new group of area managers that showed up just before I ditched that place were all younger and less experienced in life in general than probably over 80% of all employees at my location. They were clueless and passive and had NO backbones. They have very unrealistic goals and standards (stow in particular) and WHEN you come up short of those goals and standards you are dismissed with very little regard to all the hard work, blood, sweat (literally), and time you've poured into this joke of a job. Speaking of time, they have NO problem stealing your days off and forcing you to come in for mandatory overtime shifts."
bad,The attitude was tense and impersonal.  You could not  be friendly and open.  You supervisor may ever think that you think your better than them because you had a couple years of college.
bad,Don't expect to take breaks while working. Very fast paced. Sometimes required to do overtime. You do meet new people everyday. Flexible hours. Very busy all throughout the year.
bad,"Fast paced. Not worth the money in my opinion. Most managers are very unreasonable.  Time off fast and rate are a joke.  Rate is easy to get, basically you can only go to the bathroom a couple times a day without being time off task"
bad,Amazon Fulfillment Center on N. Commerce in East Point Ga has the WORST managers that I've ever worked with. Very disorganized. Rather flirt than work
bad,"No need to comment, my rating said it all. Over work their employers and too strict, being the biggest online shipping company you'd think they'd hire more people to make their demands instead of working them to death. Their system is complete garbage."
bad,"I worked there for about a year. It was all good at first but then things started changing.. This is understandable for a new thriving company, but the things the drivers had to endure was bafoonary"
bad,Work Hard minimal compensation. Its Amazon what can I say. Where time is more important than the customer and employee. its true what they say tons a pressure with reward but bad salary.
bad,"Its a very good job when you're with the right contracting company, but the management is very poor, the communication is poor, and everyone does not have a single day of training... My boss wont pay me until i get upset... There honestly is not a single thing that is hard on the job. My favorite part of the job is the warehouse environment but id love to leave this warehouse and work for someone that cares about there employees"
bad,"In my first role at Amazon, I couldn't have asked for a better team or department in which to work. Then I moved because I'd been on that team for about six years and felt that it would be advantageous to move on. Worst. Mistake. I ever. Made. The succeeding organization I went to, fulfillment center technology, was riddled with management problems, cut-throat antics, and the most stressful position I've ever had in my career."
bad,"If your not in a clique or a new graduate...gaining an Area Manager will be very hard to obtain! Not a great place to work!! Very long hours, Assistants were made to feel unappreciated on a regular basis! Very stressful and disorganized!"
bad,"when you start at amazon you're just building pallets all day long.workers aren't very friendly, and some management could be weird. I didn't enjoy working at amazon at all"
bad,"I believe that amazon could be an ideal workplace for a handful of people. Most people have a very hard time working there. Kenosha does need more jobs, but amazon mke1 is not an ideal place for most people to work. They treat their employees like robots."
bad,They treat you like a heard of cattle. All you are is just a number. The sites with the least amount of product being moved have the better equipment than the sites with a higher volume of product coming in.
bad,honestly not the best work environment I did not like them nor do they care about the workers. I was hurt there and was put on light duty however work didn't agree with the doctors.
bad,"Very fast paced and overly repetitive. Not paid enough for the work you are required to do. The mangement and Hr Department are not very understanding, compassionate, or helpful."
bad,"Amazon is not a career type of job the turnover rate is high. if you are looking to gain experience in the field of the position you acquire  amazon then this is for you, but longevity and possibility for growth is not  something you will find after a certain level of advancement"
bad,"Out of all the places I have worked at, this is by far the worst!"
bad,A typical day at work involves answering phone inquiries from customers where one is somewhat empowered to resolve issues on behalf of the customer. This is helpful.
bad,"At the peak time managers, PAs and ambassadors will treat employees in good and professional manner. However, when the peak is over everything will change. You will expect frequent rotation, a lot of VTO offer, few hours to work and overall disrespect toward employees especially from manger' helpers such as ambassadors and PAs."
bad,"mais beaucoup surveiller, mal payer, mais bonne ambiance"
bad,"We were given basic training and expected to preform outrageously, attempting to meet exceptionally high standards, regardless of where things were located.  Managers would come by fairly infrequently to comment on your work, telling you to move faster."
bad,"I worked in the part time building for almost two years and it was terrible. Since Amazon just hires people and do not conduct interviews they do not have quality workers. Also, there is a lot of favoritism with the management. There were always people sleeping in the break room or just killing time sitting in the bathroom. People would just stand around and do nothing but talk and managers would do nothing, they would go and join them. Hard workers get no credit for their work."
bad,"Had a terrible experience working for amazon. I won't recommend to anyone. amazon doesn't care about you or your family. all they care about is making money. even when u are sick, u are still expected to meet targets."
bad,Job requires you to be on your feet from 10 to 12 hours a day with poor pay poor work environment and extremely difficult job requirements to meet in time frame.
bad,"Former employee, Part-time Fullfillment Center:  Management changes frequently, and their main focus is to drive for top results.  I worked countless days on VET, but it did not matter that I helped meet Company goals during Peak Season...no bonus, like FT employees received, No accrued time off, like full time employees received, etc..."
bad,Pourquoi y a t-il un brassement de tans d'employés toujours des nouveaux et jamais la possibilité de retourner y travailler en tans qu'anciens.
bad,Did not enjoy working for amazon. Always being threatend with your job if you don't go faster and more accurate everyday. They want a high turnover rate. Even you manage to get to management they will send you somewhere else in the country. If you don't want to go they will find a way to fire or make you quit.
bad,"$12.25/ hr. sounds good until you realize you are only working 18+ hours/ week. So if you are retired, or a young buck just starting out in the workforce, then this job is perfect for you. If you have mortgage payments , car payments, utility payments, children to support, you won't make enough to live on. NO advancement, NO acknowledgement you are doing a good job, NO healthcare. Plenty of favoritism. And don't think getting an Ambassador vest means you are special, it just means you have to put up with all the bull**** without an increase in pay or hours. Teaching safety school, which used to be a leader job, is now an Ambassador job. More responsibilities with no extra pay. Leadership was more worried about where they were going to order their next lunch from than employee concerns. There were and are good people there, but they soon become discouraged and leave."
bad,"Long hours, small pay, and body aches. That pretty much sums it up. I learned that I am not cut out for this type of work. I am use to working in an office setting not a warehouse setting. The hardest part of the job was being on my feet for 10 - 11 hours a night for 4 - 5 nights a week.  For me, there really was not enjoyable part.  I did enjoy making a check but it was not worth the wear and tear on my body.  I am still paying for it.  My left knee and ankle will probably never be the same."
bad,"Waste of time! Signed up to be a delivery driver in Columbus ohio 2 months ago and so far ive only worked 7 hours! "
bad,"male dominated most of the work is seasonal part time."
bad,"I hated working here, it was a horrible company to work for. In this company your nothing but a number that can easily be replaced. No one is safe here and it's unfortunate ."
bad,Compensation is lacking and is sad due to the revenue made by this company.  Most positions are seasonal or temporary with a possibility of being hired as a permanent full-time employee with no guarantee after 6 months of work.  A company this size should know within 3 months if an employee would be a fit or not a fit.  Spends a lot of money recovering issues with shipments instead of resolving the direct issue of allowing customers the ability to choose what shipper they want to use.  This company got the shipping formulas wrong...if a customer is willing to pay for whatever shipper they want to use this company should not tell the customer they know better than the customer.  Adding a fleet of trucks will not resolve this issue.
bad,Amazon is the best environment for an individual who has been frequently mistaken for a sociopath. There is no desire for a genuine person that wants to build and develop associates.
bad,Ok place to work. Hours aren't all that good but it isn't ok. A lot standing is required and counting.  10 hours shifts. 15 minute break and 30 minute lunch.
bad,"I drive an order picker.  I was hired prior to Prime Day.  I was actually trained Friday before and on my own Saturday.  Mandatory Overtime for Prime day.  Since by their workweek I was in my second week and required to work overtime and meet a curve of productivity.  I still don't understand the very small curve given.  My trainer told me if I was working a sweat I was moving too fast.  I got written up for productivity that week.  I didn't even really know I was up for productivity goals that week.  I was also written up for something they call fast track.  You have 13 minutes from clock in time until you go to a meeting stretch out fill out safety papers on picker get cage and have your first pick.  Plus any time off task is counted for and you get written up.  Productivity is a huge issue.  You see your manager about once a week to write you up.  For me, its the first day I go in.  Meaning I struggle with days off wondering what I did wrong.  I have been written up 4 times for 3 things while working there.  I am on my last written even though my numbers have come from the 50%-like 96&  I have to be perfect or over perfect for next 90 days or one day I will go in and be fired.  They call mandatory overtime as late as lunchtime the day before.  They even watch you pick path.  People who have opportunity to meet goals are in a special section that allows fast picks.  Otherwise its unlikely with big bulky items your going to pick 42 per hour while switching isles opposite ends of buildings  Its very hard and probably is the hardest most lonely job I have ever had.  You also"
bad,Worked for security contractor at a distribution warehouse. A totally thankless job. The guards and supervisors are treated like third class citizens at best.
bad,"Though Amazon is a growing company, upward mobility only exists for those straight out of college or former military. The pay is well below industry standard at all levels. Management is typically inexperienced and unguided. Though there are many different schedules to work, Amazon is quite rigid with transfers of shifts and departments. Mandatory overtime is commonplace and there are more than six weeks of black out annually, in which vacation time is not allowed to be used. The education program is a joke as you are only allowed to pursue a handful of career paths, all of which amazon only assists to an associates degree which is useless in almost every field. The hours are long, tedious and physically demanding. Injuries are commonplace but the onsite medical staff is extremely rude and uncaring so most people hide injuries and seek out their own medical care."
bad,I personally did not really care for the job . The security were awfully rude as well as some managers. Paid good but didn't feel like I was in a good work environment.
bad,"If you are looking for a company that works at employee retention you should look elsewhere.  However, if you just want work experience then by all means apply."
bad,"You're in a building with no sunlight all day. You work ten hours for minimum wage with two 15 minute breaks and a rushed half hour lunch in a busy canteen. You have a few managers so you have to keep explaining your problem over and over to different people. You will have to wait a few shifts to speak with the same area manager that said you could have permission for time off holiday, only to be asked by  another area manger why you weren't in on your return and to fill in a return to work form, and get a point for your pre-arranged absence. It wasn't communicated that area managers actually have no authority they just watch the screens to pull people up that are not working quick enough. You need to ask to speak specifically to the MANAGER (different to area manager), who is one of many. Complaints of unfair points to management may be met with indifference or even a patronising grin. Compulsory overtime means you come in an hour early every day and on one of your days off every week for the busy Christmas period so you have even less time to get home and have your dinner before you go to bed and start it all over again. Stowing is pretty free range so you're not too confined to an area. The leaders and workers were lovely, they are always happy to help and up for a chat and a laugh. Just about anyone you talk to on the floor will be happy to chat back to you which really relieves the boredom. Some days you are on a quieter floor and don't see much of people all day. I felt I watched the time on quieter areas/days on apparel, where break time to eat some food was the only"
bad,"Not a career. For job transitioning purposes.  You cannot expect to exceed at work and outside of work with the Amazon schedule, you live here. It feels like they are taking advantage of the cheap labor in the south."
bad,"Amazon does not pay enough for the amount of work that they expect to be preformed, especially not for the physical strain that is put on your body on a daily basis. You literally walk nonstop for 9.5 hours a day. You're given a day and a half of training and then thrown out into the production floor."
bad,"The work is physically demanding. All employees are timed which are regularly posted. The training is nonexistent. The managers only care about corporate feedback. They set quality's standards they don't enforce when the standards do not directly affect the corporate numbers. Some managers are respectful toward employees, but too many are rude and contemptuous, making for an overall stressful environment.  After one year, employees don't get a raise.  Instead, they are reclassified as ""flex"" and are not permitted to work more than 20 hours per week to avoid having to pay benefits.  Regular employees (those who have been employed less than a year) are not allowed to work more than 29 hours a week, but any hours scheduled over 20 is called ""overtime."" There's lots more to describe, but overall Amazon is making its billions in annual profits on the backs of undercompensated employees."
bad,just a regular warehouse position nothing too special simple work for the most part flexible schedules to choose from management doesn't pay much attention to you they dont really care everyone is mostly temp thru agencies so many people come and go but since it is so busy the temp jobs do last awhile
bad,"Learned a lot in the IT department, about imaging/ updating and maintaining software. Typica day at work consists of packing product at your station all day. Management can be cold and pushy to meet numbers. Co- workers are friendly for the most part but some are unprofessional, and full of drama. Break rooms get hectic do to too many employees. Yelling and throwing food etc... Hardest part of this job would be standing on my feet for 10 hours and dealing with the many different personalities."
bad,You have the opportunity to work with a lot of different people. Unrealistic expectations at times. Medical benefits offered are very good.
bad,I use to love to work there and thought i could move up and advance but after 4 years I slowly began to figure out the hard way that that wasn't going to happen.  I worked hard there for 7 years and tried to show that i deserved to move up in the company but they saw otherwise so that was why i made the decision to leave and go back to school.
bad,"too much favoritism"
bad,Supervisors don't know how to talk to the employees. I learned how to drive PIT equipment. Walking around all day.Sometimes driving as well. Dealing the laziness. Walking out the door at the end of the shift.
bad,"Amazon is a unique company in which you can make history in nearly every role.  The types and scale of things you get to work on/with is quite astounding.  Now...the downside...Amazon will work you and continue raising the bar until you throw in the towel.  People early in their careers will NOT find any coaching, mentoring, or social interactions.  In most areas of Headquarters its super quiet as folks are afraid to be seen not working - you will be ran off next appraisal period.  The management (Directors, etc.) is hit or miss.  There are some good ones, and then there are some atrocious and down right mean ones."
bad,"I worked for Amazon for roughly 4 years. 1 Year as a temp. Warehouse work is not something I enjoyed doing. It was very depressing thus the poor review. The job culture was very corporate and cold. I did learn a lot of leadership skills by leading teams as large as 200+ during the holiday season. Other then for some of the people I met while working there, my time there was pretty miserable!"
bad,"to be blunt. Not worth the drive for the money nor the aggravation.  unless you standing around for 10 hours packing boxes in station covered in tape, labels and trash covered floors then this job is for you.  decent 401k, alright benefits, but the starting pay is the same pay rate for a retail job ( 12 An hour), so this or may or may not cover your personal expenses."
bad,Amazon is a very unique place to work.  They are extremely controlling of their employees closely monitoring any time spent off task or even the amount of time one takes to perform a task.  Often you will be confronted with time off tasks if you go to the restroom or if the system takes you to the other side of the  warehouse and you take too long to get there. Improvements being made but slowly.
bad,The only good thing about this place is the pay and every once in a while they would give free snacks at lunch. When the season is done they start letting people go.
bad,Not a people friendly place to work.  Only concerned about meeting unreasonable schedules at the sacrifice of employees lives.
bad,this place was just the worst place to work. there is nothing to really say. this place was  a bust. the suck at paying they employees. paid under the table. only stayed for two weeks because of this issue
bad,"Seasonal position over Xmas 2012. Ended Jan 13. Receiving calls from Amazon customers with a wide range of queries regarding products, delivery and account inquiries. Very high PC speed required for the role and excellent navigation skills required when resolving customer queries."
bad,"The work was hard and it didn't match the pay. Some of management were fine, but others treated you like a child. Co-workers stayed in clicks. You must always work harder and harder."
bad,This company job security is terrible.the turn around rate is very high and the breaks are very short.
bad,"the hardest part of the job.."
bad,"I was employed for five months at an Amazon warehouse. I worked hard and I hoped to get hired on to the company. I felt I was mistreated because I was employed by a temp service. In essence, there was special treatment for those who were directly employed by the company. The work you do is not easy and  there are areas of the warehouse where the work load is a lot lighter. The managers are supposed to move employee positions around often; so as to relieve those working in one area for a long period of time. At the facility I worked at they rarely or never rotated us. Therefore, one person could be stuck in heavy lifting all week or longer; while another is in light lifting for a week or so. THEY ARE UNFAIR!!!"
bad,"Long lours and working two locations so you never knew where you where supposed to be and if you had required overtime, that;s right required so forget about you life outside the Amazon world.  Amazon is like the Walmart of the internet world, might as well just work for Walmart and know when your off so you can plan fun things to do.  Forget about advancement unless you are willing to move across the country, management has a death grip on any positions worth holding and their attitude is bring them in, use them up and replace them.  BTW, if your not a minority then your not a favorite, I knew more Indians that would only hire, promote and work with other Indians, where is America heading these days?"
bad,"Ständiger Leistungsdruck und permanente Beobachtung durch Vorgesetzte ist zu stressig."
bad,Amazon is a warhouse that is like most warehouses and it is what you make of it.  I feel they should be a little more in tuned with there employees since majority of them are also there customers.  they sit and talk about quality when actually they want quantity.
bad,I hated the job because intergrity staffing do suck. All they do is harsh all there workers. Being a picker is not a good position to pick. It's constantly a lot of walking ever day for 10 hours. The breaks go by so fast. The intergrity staff will claim you been off task for 10-55 mins and try to write you up. Their point systems is so stupid. If you do decide to work there then try to get hired up and pick another position beside PICKING. I never hated a job so much. It's a lot of overtime during the holidays too.
bad,Ma mission a amazon été d’effectué la préparation de commandes et les papiers cadeaux si le clients l'avait demander lors de sa commande sur le site
bad,"Worked there for 6 months. Colleagues were good to work with and managers were nice. Work was tough going with short breaks for workload done (~30 mins for 8 hour shift)"
bad,It was a long working 10-12 a day on your feet at all times. My co workers were great to work with. 
bad,Amazon was an ok place to work. Coworkers were about half my age. I looked forward to getting off work everyday.
bad,"Amazon might be good for middle age adults, but it isn't good for college students. They don't care about your school, finals, or sleep for classes. The management feels as if they're above you, and like you're an ant and they make sure to treat you in that manner. I would never recommend that anyone work at this job ever again."
bad,"There are so many other companies that pay as well or better, and that treat their employees so much better. Go work at one of those companies for the sake of your wellbeing."
bad,"Working at Amazon is like working for a rogue agency, most work for self-interest, and every colleague is potential competition for your credit. Associates look for ways to short the company profit, managers primarily focus on at-risk bottom percent, operations doesn't capitalize on profitable individuals, HR looks out for management instead of associates, and opinions are collected anonymously. Workplace culture is cynical at best with the hardest part being an example for others. Most enjoyable part is breaking records without incentive, keeping others from taking shortcuts."
bad,"from halloween through new years, you are expected to work 60+ hours a week with only 1 day off. this does not give your body time to recover from lifting 40 plus pound packages 10 hours a day. they constantly raise the quotas of packages per hour. in my case, it was 70 per hour. while this may not be bad for a warehouse delivering cd's/ dvd's and such it is not good for one that has the oversized, overweight, bulky objects."
bad,"It is a Stressful environment with poor management and HR team. This is not worth the pay, and you are treated like you are disposable. Mandatory overtime occurs and you will be penalized if you don’t follow."
bad,"A me scadeva il contratto il 25/01 io fino a quel giorno non ho saputo se rinnova anno o meno, ho ricevuto una chiamata dalla gigroup, agenzia con la quale lavoravo per amazon, in cui mi chiedevano se ero interessata ad un rinnovo ed io ho detto si ovviamente. Un mio collega invece lo aveva saputo qualche giorno prima. Io ho una figlia da far crescere da sola."
bad,"Breakes were strict and regulated"
bad,"Lol good luck lasting there !"
bad,"Your just a number. There almost no training. No true concern for your safety just talk. You can’t barely use the bathroom or eat. And no matter how hard you work or how well you do they won’t acknowledge it. They will only acknowledge if you do something wrong. Also, they run contests that you get to enter when you do a good job for big items and then management wins them???"
bad,Amazon can do way better. Needs more human interaction and a suggestion box. There are a lot of ways to improve your companies work flow. The job often gets repetitive and stale causing workers to become uncomfortable and uninterested. Make it more fun!
bad,"Stancante fisicamente ma soprattutto mentalmente dopo tanto tempo, un lavoro che non va bene sul lungo periodo, e poca opportunità di crescita"
bad,Être formé que 3 poste en aillant des bonnes prod et fini 24h sur le même poste comme des robot
bad,Managerment thinks that it their job to treat their workers like slaves and micro management the whole shift...If you think that you doing your job you correctly you can could get fired when ever your manangment get a bad day. Worest job and i cant wait to get out of this place. Happy hunting
bad,They asked people to work 60 hours per week during peak time and removed most of employees benefits. They treat people like robots. The working area always dry and dusty. Paper and plastic bags are on the floor anywhere.
bad,"The job is very demanding. There is a lot of walking, your constantly monitored through computers. Short lunches, short breaks, long hours during the holidays."
bad,This job is a physical labor job it is very very fast paced the work is laid back fast paced but management is poor very very poor it’s close to impossible to find help if needed
bad,"I was hired through the recruitment firm Insight Global, starting as an eight-week contract with promises of advancement. I performed well as an employee, and even discovered some tricks that my superiors could not figure out. I never spoke to my 'managers,' but my team leads were helpful and encouraging. I had no reason to expect an issue; the recruiter even told us about a system of warnings before being fired. "
bad,"Only advance favorites, but the favorites usually are the laziest of the bunch. Racist, people of color (African American) definitely are at the bottom of the barrel when it comes to advancement. None exist in management at National City location."
bad,"If you come into the company on a white badge, you work the same hours just as hard if not harder, but aren't receiving the benefits of the blue badge employees. Please don't let go of your current job for a job here."
bad,work/life balance was not reflective of what was represented by leadership during interview process. there was very little support from management on alleviating burn out on the team.
bad,Long Days. You do not work expected hours. The scheduling is a mess so is management. Worked through ABC express which is a company whom works for amazon.
bad,if you are looking for a short period of work this is the job for you. Its not horrible overall but it is in no way a good job. You are treated like an animal and lied to by most of the management.
bad,"Les pause sont à la vite fait , les instructor savent a peine leur boulot , franchement globalement je n’aime pas du tout cette entreprise en plus d’être surveillé comme des voleur et de travailler comme des sous coté on es vraiment très mal payer d’ailleurs on es mieux payer chez Macdo ."
bad,They cut full time employees off just as fast as seasonals after the holiday rush. Make up reasons to get rid of ppl to save the company money. They are so use to being shady that they watched me break down and offered no kind words or support it was nothing for them to fire a single mother of 4 kids a week before christmas and walk me out with a shady smirk
bad,Decent place to work a decent salary.  Better as a second part time job so you wont break your mind and body. The managers and people working there are horrible.
bad,"It isn’t the long shifts, with little breaks. Or the realization that no one has a clue what’s going on. It is the fact you are threatened constantly to be removed for the smallest thing, or things you can’t control. If you are American good luck, you won’t last long, once you realize you are the first to go. They will find the smallest thing and hold it above your head so you can’t advance."
bad,"be ready to receive heavy volume, with a tight turnaround as its fast paced, and they expect you to keep up with little regard to work/life balance. burn out is a real and very common occurrence at amazon"
bad,"I worked at the fulfillment center in North Haven, CT. The managers are a joke. They don't care about your success with the company. They probably have so many associates to manage that you're treated as just a number. They expect you to perform a task without providing what's necessary. If you can not do mandatory overtime, you can resign. Otherwise, HR will find a way to fire you if you have personal time off planned."
bad,"Would recommend it for entry-level workers.  Being a delivery driver details and efficiency are key.  Time-management skills are essential.  Sorting packages and making sure you deliver them in a timely manner.  Amazon is great with OT, you will definitely get hours.  It's not a lot of room for advancement and I'm looking to be a Leader Warehouse clerk/Supervisor."
bad,"As far as hours 24 hours per week is not livable, 32 hours per week would be more reasonable for parents with small kids. There is no hour flexibility at the sortation center. I should have work for the fulfillment location instead to get the much needed hours. No air conditioning in the place either, really. It was cooler outside than inside the building by over 10 degrees. Fix the A/C units, drinking over 1/2 gallon of water/sports drinks and still getting heat exhaustion is ridiculous. Summer in Utah can get very hot, so fix the A/C already for your employees."
bad,"There are a lot of things to do and learn in Amazon, so everyone has to work very hard. I am very interested in AWS technologies, so I have learned a lot in Amazon."
bad,Management is usually hired externally and they’re less qualified than employees who have been Tier 1 for years but can’t seem to move up. They think putting balloons up or a cardboard cabin helps morale (it doesn’t). They love favoritism. I had a manager that was an absolute moron who was like a military dog barking orders constantly. Worst place I’ve ever worked. So glad I never have to go back!
bad,amazon war die schlimmste arbeitgeber den ich je hatte
bad,"Terrible management. Very unorganized. Not a terrible place to work if you don’t mind unorganized chaos. However, the flexibility of the hours are nice."
bad,"Lack of work in this facility. they continue to hire more people until the only option left is to get sent home. Its 76% women here, so they constantly try to push their will on you to show they are in charge and keeps other men in check. Nasty disrespectful people who show bias openly. Lots of people here will ignore seriousquestions you have about the job and just restate the question you asked as a answer"
bad,"Company demands high targets all time,  in my department I was witness of a significantly increasing of targets making your job really stressful."
bad,No comment am working in apsolute security facility last half in a year am leaving the country and will be there for am working with my way  am very hard-working man no one compare me
bad,"Amazon isn’t a bad place to work at, yet employees get treated unfairly, managers are rude, they have favorites, everybody does not work together and it’s just not a place I would recommend someone to work."
bad,Cuando aplique al trabajo se llamaba Delivery Associate pero en el momento que entre ellos agregaron la palabra seasonal estuve trabajando 1 año con ellos haciendo lo que me exigian y al fin al cabo rescindieron de mi contrato cuando en su momento por ley nos debian dar el blue badge
bad,It would be an okey job if you had the same route everyday because you could learn the route but they say that they cannot give you the same route because Amazon chooses the routes for the drivers
bad,"Everything was fast-paced and timed, even the time spent in the bathroom. I would not wish this job on my worst enemy, but considering how little work there is in the area, I will probably end up going back."
bad,"I did not enjoy working there,  they put me in an area,,logistics but did not train me but criticised me due to not being able to that part of my job very well and didn't try to help or train me in that area, I was also doing email and retail calls at the same time, the young "
bad,"Long 12 hour shifts, short breaks, you need to arrive at least 30 mins early just to find parking. Really fast paced and if you slow down a little, management will gladly walk to your station to tell you to pick up the pace!"
bad,"Stupid points got me fired. "
bad,"over worked under appreciated, also they play favorites with the work load so 9 times out of 10 you end up working twice as hard for no reason, their flex scheduling is also a pain either way it screws you with either your money if they work less hours that day or your body and mind if they work more hours that day"
bad,You can easily get stuck in a boring job that no one else wants.  Employees often behave like Jr. High students. Hard to move up.  Management is  mostly incompetent.
bad,lousy management with poor communication and very loud work environment and high volume warehouse fulfillment center poor people skills because of management very poor management because managers do not have people skills and show to much favorites toward there chosen few
bad,People leave poor managers not poor companies. Amazon needs to work on the director and VP level to ensure qualified professionals are put in the proper positions and reduce incompetence in leadership. In my time there was only one department leader with actual industry experience and he was fired for being competent.
bad,Als Führungskraft hat man gute Ein- und Aufstiegsmöglichkeiten. Der tägliche Druck ist jedoch enorm. Diesen soll man täglich an die Mitarbeiter weiter geben. Der Vorgesetzte hat immer recht auch wenn die Erfahrungen etwas anderes sagen. Der Schwächste verliert.
bad,"Senior Management is comprised of young people looking to get a name for themselves at the expense of others,Their means of promoting is something to be desired."
bad,"The culture here is difficult to navigate. Getting on the good side of your managers is a task no one should ever have to go through, but is necessary. Do what you’re supposed to do and get out a soon as you can."
bad,"First of all... I just want to say regardless of my rating I am very thankful for the opportunity that integrity and amazon gave me in getting this job despite it being a temp job. The job really helped me out with moving to a new city but anyways onto the job itself... The job is mundane, repetitive and boring. You are just another cog in the corporate machine. You just stand on a thin rubber mat for ten hours with only two breaks and a 30 min lunch processing customer returns. I work in customer returns so I can't speak for other departments. I don't know how anybody can stand to work here long term... there is some older people at my warehouse that have worked there for awhile who have sustained some pretty severe permanent damage from the stress the job puts on the body. This alone is a pretty big driver for me getting out of there as soon as possible and moving onto a better career. The issues don't stop there. The next thing is the annoyance of your rate and having to sustain a ridiculously high rate. Some days you will get moved to the very front of a line and your rate will drop drastically due to the fact that when you are on the front of a line you get all the packages that have passed everyone else on the conveyor belt which of course are all the big packages and the packages that won't scan so of course you process far less and that negativity impacts you. Also, when you take a long time processing a package that will count towards time off task, also time off task is 30 mins per ten hour shift so you run to the bathroom once, have some big packages and have to empty"
bad,"In Kentucky they only advanced young white kids; if you are ethnic you will stay on the heavy lifting work forever...."
bad,"they offer gift cards, and other incentives to do well and work hard.   Good food is provided often !   I like the unpaid time options that was helpful"
bad,"They let me go today without warning and just about every other seasonal delivery driver in Davie Florida.  Job less right before Christmas, what a terrible thing to do :("
bad,The #1 issue was the supervisor at the main warehouse location in Ruskin Fl. The next issues was the culture. It was unrealistic and fake. I'm a workaholic but they really work you like a dog and ave no remourse about it. I did not expect that type of management and environment. It was one of the worse expericence as an employee I have ever had. If that supervisor was fired I would have sucked it up and dealt with the culture. I would not recommend working here at allllll!!!! I wished that the CEO of amazon would read this comment and revalute the people they are hiring as management.
bad,"Lots of over time if wanted , you are just a  number in the warehouse nothing more , managers don’t care about you just care about numbers , Boring job"
bad,"The job isn't the greatest job on earth, but it'll help make ends meet/get you a little extra pocket money, depending on how many shifts they allot you. The management is very standoffish, job culture is very cultish."
bad,"Amazon is a good place to work if you're just starting out, and I mean just starting out. They give you just enough to keep coming back but never more than that. They have what is considered oppressive policies for their employees, but I guess it's all in what you are willing to deal with. If you need a job don't hesitate."
bad,"Amazon is an ok place to work if you just want to make a few bucks and have no aspirations. If however a career is what you seek look elsewhere. They favor bringing people in over promoting from within and utilize unsavory business practices to keep employees at lower levels."
bad,"this was a very poor job. It involved working 6 days a week, +15 hours a day. This was a contract based role and so there was no job security or company benefits. It also resulted in being paid below minimum wage Due to the company structure being self employed was demanded and this meant you had to work otherwise you would not get paid.  "
bad,"At first the job was awesome and convenient as it was work from home. But I applied as full time and went to part time when it was available. After going to part time, I was required to sign up for full time hours as this was ""business need"" and required to work those full time hours without full time benefits. The work life balance was very poor. I had no time for family."
bad,Poor management of employees and dangerous vehicles not maintained well. lots of damage goes unreported. high turnover on management. always reporting to someone new. poor structure
bad,Just a regular warehouse job nothing more nothing less. They need to work on their layoff rates. They also need to work on their time home management as well.
bad,Depending on the team(90% of the teams suck) you'll be thrown into a pool of legacy stuff and expected to tackle and clean up after others who would've already left the team.
bad,This is a job for young people who have energy. Lots of walking. Soul crushing box after box after box. You get the idea. Boring af. It’s so big by the time you got to the door your break is over. I developed carpal tunnel from using scanners repeatedly.
bad,"Amazon don't care about People, they need only numbers. They will use you and after they will leave you with out job. Management can promise a  lot but in real they don't keep there promise, they want only numbers! Amazon HR not keeping confidential information. Lot of people is racists. Totally not recommend this place to work."
bad,Amazon says they encourage growth but you can’t even move out of your department! I’ve been a picker for a long time and it’s absolutely insane how many times I’ve tried to get into another department but for some reason I’m not allowed! You work crazy hours which I’m okay with but when it’s hot there’s little ways to keep cool. They don’t have enough fans in the building so if you’re pushing yourself to make rate you also have to worry about over heating in the warehouse. I keep big water bottles with me but even with ice cold water the heat can be ridiculous. The managers want everyone to be equally fast when that’s not possible. Not everyone can speed like a bat out of h*ll just to make a rate they set. If you’re doing 380 units per hour (standard for pickers) they tell you to do better!!!
bad,I've worked for Amazon multiple times. Honestly extremely surprised I stayed as long as I did. The safety they train isn't realistic. Your expected to put more strain on your body then what they tell you. They hire anyone and everyone. I trained new hires and I didn't feel at times that they gave new hires enough time to learn the PIT equipment. It was a bulk facility and you were expected to be able to move heavy items weighing over 100lbs by yourself with no help. If you did get help then you wouldn't make they're rates that are always going up. Management constantly changes giving new Kids straight out of college these high paying jobs that have no experience in management or warehouse work. Its sad because it has potential to be a good job but they are to focused on numbers without a realistic expectation. You would watch them fire good workers over little things and keep the laziest workers that don't deserve the job. the like to have tier 1 associates do tier 3 jobs and have all the responsibility without the pay.
bad,"Changes like a dirty diaper so you better be able to drop ur life plans at the blink of an eye. Van's are hardly ever maintanaced, hope ur an ant person & someone who can extend variety of weathers, dogs, & hazardous roads."
bad,"My overall impression was that you had a skeleton of hard, reliable workers in an environment where they are more or less not valued."
bad,"I enjoyed working for Amazon in the beginning, great management, sllight competetive environment and great seasonal employees. After the salary increase to $15 an hour it seems the demanding work was worth it. It went from a fun place to work to a demand to increase production to cut hours nightly, hence loosing pay by hour. Ideas are appreciated and inplimented but no credit goes to the employees that create the efficiency per the demand for speed increase. When applied the heaviest weight for packages was 50 lbs, but then increased to 75 lbs. there is medical because all employees are part time and get little benfits. Amazon is ok for seasonal work but NOT a career. Even managment is replaced in waves, and production and saving the company money is the name of the game."
bad,"I asked my self, what leadership? The whole time I was there, everyone just read from their tablets. There was never a straight answer to a question as the computer in their hands won't let them tell the truth. It's like talking to a telemarketer with their flow chart."
bad,"You better have two other jobs because you can't live off the pay. They promise a lot but never deliver. Age and gender discrimination across the board! Why work hard in college, when associates with GED's get managerial positions?"
bad,There are opportunities to be had but you will have to be extremely determined and competent to get them. It is not easy to work here in any capacity.
bad,Not the best place to work but also not the worst place.  If you can get a job other than stow or pick you will be alright.  The accommodations team is unethical when it comes to accommodating worker injury and Dr.'s restrictions but if you play the game within the Amazon system then you can come out on top.
bad,Employees are a pleasant to work with on a daily basis.  Poor management.  There is a lot of favoritism amongst of few individuals. The environment is very hot in certain areas of the building during the spring and summer seasons.
bad,Not a bad gig if you're looking for some quick cash for a few months as they will literally hire anyone off the street. Don't make long term plans here.
bad,"10 hour shifts,  breaks are supposed to be 15 minutes but are actually 10 or less depending on how far you have to walk to a break room. This also includes bathroom time. Management is horrible. Managers do not know how to talk to associates with respect. There is a major lack of communication. HIGH TURN OVER RATE"
bad,"For this to be such a great company they should care more about all of their employees. If you are different, this company is not for you. Make sure you have a plan to keep you sane because this job will drain you if you let it."
bad,"Favoritism happens all the time from supervisors right up to managers.  If your manager does not like you are left in a difficult position.  My manager will not directly to me but will go my ""equal"" counterpart to discuss things that only affect me."
bad,Hours should be more normal like 6-2:30 or 7:00 to three. Have more paid holidays off long hours during holidays so you don’t get time to enjoy Christmas with your family should be closed from Christmas to New Years
bad,As A delivery driver I go to the Amazon warehouse check in with a warehouse member wait until the packages are brought to the front of warehouse count packages place them in the vehicle and deliver them.
bad,"As long as you are in favour with the despatcher you receive 5 shifts per week favourites are offered six."
bad,"My experience with Amazon unfortunately mainly consists of horrible sexism. Additionally, open communication, specifically top down communication is not something that is widely practiced. This type of environment does not allow for female employees to grow within their career."
bad,"Abuse their employees and treat them as if they are idiots. Tell them lies to answer their questions thinking they won't understand and will leave them alone. Too hot. People pass out from working too hard in a hot environment. Ambulance is outside almost every night once temps rise. Management doesn't know how to manage. All hired straight out of college with no experience. Supervision is a joke. Threats to fire employees is their management style. Work employees all shift in same position compromising their health and safety. Have rates that hey expect employees to meet yet they are not happy unless you are doing 110% or higher so they can raise those rates next time when up for review. Eventually rates will be unattainable for most causing them not to take breaks when needed for fear of not making rate and getting written up and  eventually fired. Horrible, horrible , horrible work environment!"
bad,I felt very replaceable even though I worked very hard and made an effort to support my fellow employees. It seemed poor performance was rewarded. My schedule was changed without my consent which is why I left.
bad,This place is a joke and could be so much better if they hired real management. They treat you like kids and let horrible people get away with anything. I felt like a number and scared to go to work with the type of people there acting crazy and using foul language all the time. People would actually threaten you fighting for the job they wanted that day even though it was posted for you to do the job. Very stressful.
bad,It is very hard and tiring sometimes they can be unfair but the pay is worth it.The breaks are not enough but the job keeps you fit and active so you don't need the energy.
bad,"It was a great way to make relatively easy money, but the amount of walking and long 10-12 hour shifts make it hard to want to stay in this field. Management is lacking, they only care about numbers not the individual, but it is a huge corporate entity so no surprise their. Job security is low, i got laid off because they overstaffed in the peak season, when i applied this was not advertised as a temporary position, and I applied as a full-time employee. Got an email saying they appreciated my help but no longer needed my services at this time and would encourage me to seek their company for employment in the future. That was a big negative on my end."
bad,"hard labor unfair and unsafe conditions demoralizing absolutely not worth it. no work life balance, though the benefits and pay were very nice, always on time, and very fair with vacation and time off."
bad,The management here sucks they are running the building down to the ground. They don't know how to talk to associate. They never let the inside associates advance to other jobs they would rather bring in outsiders instead of promoting within.
bad,"Management pushed too hard from short staffing, threatened right ups for not meeting quotas. Discrimination against pregnant women, lack of communication, policy’s were not followed per management and injuries resulted to employees"
bad,Team leaders apathetic at best.  no incentives.  Management turnover rate ridiculous.  Temp workers came in making more than direct hire employees.  Not very helpful staff.
bad,"It is very difficult to advance to any full time position in the company. The knowledge, skills and experience that I have in a lot of different positions with this company mean nothing because I am still behind a lot of the employees that I have trained and have less knowledge, skills or experience then I do."
bad,"Very high turnover rate. Only work here if your looking for something quick. No advancement. Drivers work in rain, sleet, snow, tornado for only 15 an hour which is not worth it no exaggeration. Ups fedex pay their driver 18-30 to work in those condition. Dont do it unless your passing through jobs and really need a pay check. Management has no structure make up new rules and guidelines everyday. Every week its something new you cant do anymore"
bad,A place to work if u like working long hours with short breaks and minimum time for yourself. Co workers were friendly but management was not very good at all.
bad,"Amazon is a fast-paced environment, management is a joke at times, people who kiss butt are usually promoted. Great money for college students who need some pocket change, you cannot survive off of the weekly pay if you have a family to take care of."
bad,"Unrealistic quotas, cannot move to different positions. 1st is a verbal when behind in their quota to move product. Product quota increases every two weeks. Then, two write ups, and your out. "
bad,"Es muy bueno porque para la empreza amazon es un importante tu segurida, te capacitan para cada area que te mandan siempre te preguntan si tienen una duda y te la resuelven muy bien"
bad,"Long mileage with no extra pay"
bad,Typical ten hour shift. Short breaks. Management crosses over with other areas of work daily. Lack of basic communication makes days longer. Keep to yourself.
bad,The Amazon Fulfillment center is a terrible place to work. Your every move is monitored. You are penalized for using the restroom if it is not during your break. It takes over 5 minutes to walk to the restrooms so your 15 min break is basically spent walking to break room and back with 5 min to sit down.
bad,"The floors are all concrete and employees have to stand for 10 hours with only a 15 minute break you have to run to if you are in a further side of the building. And a 30 min lunch. You have to be back from each break early so you can have a scan in before break is up, and cant start running to break until you scanned an item in the last minute you were supposed to be on the floor. I had to have surgery on both feet this job messed me up so much. And when I went on medical leave they fired me. Amazon uses an outside company to run its leave time and there is no communication between them. Because there was a date wrong on the paperwork ""no one could help me"". Working there damages you and then they through employees away."
bad,"Amazon is a fast turnaround kind of job, 5hey hire whoever applies and expects management to weed thru, if you have your own opinion then they welcome your resignation."
bad,Without saying anything negative id prefer to just say i disliked the job. no room for advancement and no job security. i wouldnt recommend this job to someone whos looking for growth.
bad,As a customer point of view it's a wonderful company but as employee it has a long long way to go to be able to survive. Only 2 breaks over 10-12 hr shift walk time is part of breaks wich consists of 5-15 minutes. Very poor leadership and HR department is there for the company not for you.  The company management does not treat employees with known disabilities or service veterans fairly.
bad,"We're only humans. "
bad,"Cons:"
bad,"It just wasn't for me, that's all i have to say regarding the matter. this is very annoying to be forced to answer all these questions about amazon!!!"
bad,I was injured at Amazon due to the high rate expectations. I worked with a lot of people who was injured and you work in very close proximity of people which makes it difficult to work.
bad,"You come into work, then clock in, go to your work area, see your job for the day, work till the first break. If you have to use the bathroom you have to hurry up and go either during breaks or you might get written up for time off task. You stand on your feet all day unless its break time."
bad,"does not matter your speed in moving items, dont work here. 11hr, tons of speed walking and your ""15"" min breaks and lunch are not actually 15 min. it takes you almost 5 min to get to the breakroom/outside to get your phone or to get to the bathroom. you need to be scanning your next item right at the end of your break, so that means after 5 min you need to put your phone back and walk another 5 min back to find a scan gun and walk to the floor you need to work in and be ready to scan at the end of YOUR 15 min break."
bad,"If you get sick, in the hospital or pass out at work due to a medical reason or them not allowing you to slow up they will terminate you and/ write you up"
bad,"Is very stressful job, poor management, HR is a trash, no one care about you, the managers treat you like a slaves, there a lot of favoritism and racism."
bad,"Employees have no clear leadership, so the loudest and most obnoxious employees try to take control without any knowledge of what they're doing which results in chaos. Employees that are talented and have skill don't get recognized as management is busy socializing with each other. More people are cut back on a daily basis to save on cost per package. It's impossible to keep up with the packages on the conveyer belt and you're typically surrounded by a wall of boxes on all sides which is extremely dangerous if there was an emergency and you had to get out. Employees are extremely competitive due to tracking software that determines the top 3 stowers. I can honestly say that I hate some of my co-workers. They're heartless and mean. The pay is good for the Boise area"
bad,"If you like working like a slave for minimum wage this is the place for you!"
bad,Was fun to meet new people and make new friends!But they are people what they work for 5-10 years there and they don’t have any iddea to do the work!The staff all the time work more then them!Some managers they don’t deserve the job!If you more then 5 minutes in the toilet they gonna ask you were you been!!!!Not all they are like that!But some managers they are really with the head in the clouds!!!When they don’t need you they just fired you with no reason!New people have green badge and the permanent staff have blue!Really hard to become permanent(blue badge).Some blue badge they believe you are a minion(green badge).And they over work you!
bad,"Working as an Amazon Warehouse associate is one of the most difficult jobs you will ever do. The repetitive lifting and bending isn’t good for your body and will most likely lead to long term disabilities. With Amazons current setup of their distribution warehouses, it’s clear that humans are expected to be able to function as robots. This job needs to be automated ASAP. It’s not suitable for people to do this job safely or efficiently."
bad,"I definitely am disappointed with my on boarding and recruiting experience at Amazon. I was never told that my role & responsibilities would be significantly more strategic than the day to day work. They confuse marketing with merchandising. They are also offshoring a lot of our work, and my entire team is concerned that we'll be laid off soon. There are 4 people on my team, none of us have any goals. We're told that they will flow down in May, so we'll basically have 6 months to align our work to the business goals. There are also 3 open job reqs on my team, and no one knows what they could possibly work on because our team doesn't have enough work to do as we offshore our work. Its bizarre and a terrible greater team culture. To the point where people don't say hello in the hallway. You will only receive good mornings and greetings if you're a higher level because people need your help getting promoted."
bad,"Place so big, by time you make it through security you break time and lunch time is over. Fast paced environment. You have to keep up your stats. nice coworkers."
bad,the job is what it is...they changed the ops procedure for handling inventory which put alot more stress on the job i had..i felt i could not continue under these conditions without high risk of back injury among other things. also the job gives no satisfaction of accomplishment at all..your just a mule hauling freight and we were treated that way..l.just not for me..i need more.
bad,I worked part time for 6 months so far and was promised during peak season to be moved to permanent by January. Still waiting as are the others hired with me. I wanted to apply for other jobs outside of the warehouse but can't do that unless converted to permanent. No chance for advancement and the culture is pretty much work like robots and be happy you're earning $15 hourly. Many big corporations are paying better now and have better work cultures too. I'm leaving in a couple weeks for a better opportunity.
bad,You basically get fired for doing your best. Everybody is rude and the HR doesn't care about the employees either. If you actually have a life then this job isn't for you.
bad,"People were getting let go day by day. Fun environment, as long as you did your work. Attendance is key. Missing a shift is bound to get you fired. I worked 3 days which wasn't bad at all. Always on your feet, never sitting until lunch. If you have a bad back, bad knees, anything involving standing this is not the job for you."
bad,"You have to make sure you have time to work here. There will be times where you are extremely tired but you have to be at work. It pays well, but you have no balance"
bad,Very stressful place...no organization...you work hard and they show no appreciation...T.O.T is not perfected (time off task)  they need to go back and evaluate this T.O.T....you have to meet a ridiculous rate with all kind of barriers in your way...no appreciation for hard work...insane place....Amazon name is to hyped. ...the workers are being treated unfairly
bad,"It's a very chaotic atmosphere. Management is young and it shows in the way that they do things. The people that work the hardest are not usually given the props and positions they deserve. But some people enjoy the high school like atmosphere."
bad,"The work at amazon was ok, but it seemed better suited for young adults looking to include on their work history. The best I would say about anything related to the work and benefits there would be ""OK"". Nothing stood out as great, especially compared to other similar jobs."
bad,"Initially when I started the jo paid well and was worth the hard daily labor.  Now my pay has been cut down and hours as well. It just isn't worth it anymore.  management does not keep their word from when they hire you, I was told this was a full time position with benefits, I have a wife and baby on the way.  Now I have been cut down to 4 days on 4 days off, at $15 an hour with  no benefits."
bad,"I have worked for Amazon directly multiple times, still not impressed by anything with the company. Still get worked too hard, for too many hours a day, by the time you get home and get to sleep, its time to go back to work."
bad,"Adequate pay, poor management, oppressive security, inexperienced middle management. Definitely a ""high school"" culture, very clickish. Remember you are just a body. Managers don't care about you. If you leave they can get 10 more people to take your place."
bad,"no real structure to the job as was a temporary placement. no one seemed like they knew what to do on the temporary agency staff, just seemed to go along with it."
bad,"Ho visto persone che si davano da fare che non gli è stato rinnovato il contratto, tutti tramite agenzia con contratti a scadenza eccetto i menager (capetti) e Leed (capetti reparto) gente senza spina dorsale e con le risposte imparate a memoria per ogni cosa che i lavoratori lamentano, poi la cosa divertente sul giubbetto hanno scritto ""ti posso aiutare?"" e quando chiedi qualcosa ti rispondono che loro non sono capaci e devi cercare tizio/a (notare hanno le radio ma ti mandano in giro per l'intero magazzino a cercare la persona e da un lato all'altro ci metti 5 minuti). Se sei una persona che si impegna e fa il proprio lavoro e gli avanza tempo ti mandano ad aiutare altri che francamente se la prendono comoda, ecco perché senza spina dorsale invece di svegliare chi batte la ficca fanno fare i salti mortali a chi fa il proprio seriamente. Disorganizzazione ai più alti livelli assegnati ad un ruolo costantemente spostati e fare lavori doppi, perché? cosi ottimizzano il personale ovvero le regole sulla sicurezza tipo i pacchi sopra un certo peso vanno presi in due gli EPAL vanno sollevati in due, ma se il personale è sottodimensionato per mandare avanti il lavoro ti tocca farlo da solo e al diavolo la sicurezza e se ti fai male la risposta è pronta ""sei tu che lo vuoi fare"" ovviamente perché se no non ci rinnovate il contratto e se non avreste questa arma di ricatto le regole sarebbero rispettate alla lettera e non riuscireste a far partire i pacchi in orario con così poche persone nei turni."
bad,"Je déconseille fortement cette usine !! le jour de l'intégration vous liés des amitiés avec ceux qui sont au ""DAY1"" et 2 mois aprés vous voyez que ces fameux collègues se font dégager 1 à 1 jusqu'à ce que ce soit à votre tour. Sans parler de leurs fin de mission, il vous appelle sur vôtre scan ou ordinateur et vous dépose dans une salle pour vous dire "" Il n'y a plus assez d'unités"", alors que durant le briefing ils vous disent "" grosse journée avec 200 000 unités"" !! Enfin bref cette usine est une usine d'esclave !!"
bad,"Not a fantastic place to work in but handy before christmas for an economic quick boost. "
bad,"My co workers and I can barely eat a solid meal on the job due to the excessive amount of deliveries and time expectancy of the daily route. They work us through unsafe weathers and throw a fit if we cannot meet the expected time of completion. The consistent 10 hour days of nonstop physical activity severely wears and tears the body and mind, leaving minimal time to rest and regenerate before the next shift. Not nearly enough time for a life outside of work if you want to make enough to barely get by. This is a cruel and unappreciating line of work with little benefits."
bad,"Your success in the company depends on your ops manager / sr manager. If you have a bad manager, you will have a bad experience. HR is not very responsive to complaints about bad managers. If you have a good manager, you can succeed."
bad,"It's all about rate and nothing else will stop or supersede that! Make it or find a new job................................................................................"
bad,"no room for advancement"
bad,"The hardest part of the job, Management, If they have work they will go after you, if they wont, they fired you with stupid excuse..simple as  that. The Best think you can make friends to keep your stress out of it."
bad,"Amazon doesn't tell you the complete truth about everything, they tell you just enough to get you hooked the beat around the bush when you question them about Company policy.What they give they take away.The Management has no management skills or people skills, Amazon hires kids right out of college with a Bachelor Degree in whatever ,it could be a degree in janitorial or maybe in Art, but not the skills to manage 50 to 150 or more associates.The average associate only makes it 30 sometimes 90 daysbefore getting fired because of Rate or quiting because they have been treated so badly.I could go on and on.I was in a position as a Trainer, and seen first hand how bad associates were treated, I stood up for them and took it all the way to the top to try to get this changed, and was told Amazon would make some changes.In the 2 years 1 month that I was their I had 5 GM. Amazon finally just decided to make a manager a new title and put them in charge Facilties Lead."
bad,"In the public eye Amazon looks like they are doing great and they're creating alot of jobs in Houston but from the reality point of view they're just trying to create this fake image for public relations reasons. I was hired as a temp employee for the peak season and was told multiple times that there will be plenty opportunities as long as of course I do my job and work hard. I had perfect attendence had no points (one way they grade your attendance) and came home exhausted after busting my butt 4 days a week for 10 hours.They seem to be cool when they need us but when it started to slow down without any notice they started to call us via phone or we would find out at the door that we are no longer employed. So much for working hard. "
bad,"Au départ, on nous donne l'illusion d'être important, puis on déchante....Les managers vous infantilisent (ils vous expliquent comment être gentils, propres, ne pas refiler vos microbes ou même comment dégivrer votre pare brise) tout ça devant une équipe qui écoute admirative. Des petits jeux histoire d'être gai et enjoué... mais la vérité, c est une boite interim qui vous appelle dès que votre ""prod"" baisse, ne cesse de vous envoyer des sms pour vous rappeler que vous appartenez à la secte. Vous êtes rémunéré au plus bas (pas de prime de prod, pas de prime de panier, pas de prime de poste) et on garde vos congés payés et IFM jusqu'au terme de vos 3 contrats histoire que vous n'ayez pas l'idée de vous barrer avant (vos IFM ne seraient pas versées) Bref ce travail vous convient si vous vous contentez de 1200 balles, si vous êtes un bon mouton que vous aimez la vie en communauté."
bad,"Upper management does not listen to those that do the job.  Constant changes without following proper procedures.  Zero work life balance.  Shift changes without notice and zero regards to family or religious obligations.  The pay is not to bad but benefits and stock options were cut to justify a raise.  In the end total compensation is actually a few grand a year less.   Work is boring and mind numbing.  You cannot have music or your phones or any contact with the outside world regardless of the 50 plus hours a week you spend in a prison looking warehouse.  Even simple suggestions to paint the bars to appear less like a prison is over ruled.  You are expect to meet unrealistic goals in a robot fashion, if this disagrees with you well there's the door.  In addition dont expect to advance ever.  They will tell you 100 times a year you will but they never intend to do so."
bad,"Amazon is a place that you would have to work there and experience the working conditions for yourself. Everyone is different so what may be cut throat to me, may be tolerable for someone else."
bad,Policy is all about numbers they do not care about the safety of their workers. Management has no respect.  They work you until your half dead. Not a good place to work.
bad,"The days varied, depending on new hire orientation or direct hire events. I learned how to use various systems. The hardest part about the job was working long hours and weekends. I enjoyed meeting new people and learning the new systems."
bad,"The work itself is not that bad. Slinging boxes, picking inventroy or somewhere on the shipping line it's going to be work but it's not unreasonable. There are probably people much older than you there and doing it just fine. It will take 3-4 weeks for your body to get used to it and even then you will have some sore days. "
bad,It’s just basically doing same thing over and over and they expect you and push you to exceed the given rate . It was supposed to be fun but there is no real relationship between managers. You just had to work. For me I think you are not paid enough with the physical work you do.
bad,"Unless you are in the good old boys club, you won't promote.  Mid-level management is the problem, not the solution here.  Your team will make or break you and management will make or break your career."
bad,"Worst job I have ever had. Training is terrible. Pay is ever worse. I really think that Amazon is a fantastic place to buy, but not to work. The system is terrible."
bad,"50- 60 hours mandatory overtime sucks. You have no life and pretty much give your kids to a sitter during the holiday times. If you are a stower be prepared to be on your toes. 6 write ups in one year. And each one has it's own calendar year. Oh yeah they expect you to keep the same paste and rate no matter how heavy the items are for all 10-12 hours a day. Unless you are a favorite, you don't really get to cross trained to move around and become more advanced. They say Amazon cares, but they just simply don't."
bad,"Working at Amazon was like working at a glorified sweat shop. The training they gave us on day 1 was bad; half of us didn't know what to even do at our stations. Management was very unhelpful when we had problems management would ignore us. Favoritism was rampant if you didn't pucker up to management you would be given the most physically demanding positions. Attractive female coworkers were promoted to ambassadors even though they were performing badly."
bad,Great place to work for young people for fast money. But it was terrible getting things done with HR they’re not there to help you at all.  I would’ve enjoyed it better if they looked at us as people and not numbers.
bad,"Terrible place to work, put a request to change shift from nights to days and so far it's been 6 week and instead of changing shift I've ended up with a disciplinary for asking question about why it hard for them to tick a box. They dnt care about health needs or anything that's going on in life as long as their pathetic robotic targets are hit and apparently 5 minutes is way too long to go to the toilet nearest toilet is like a 3 min walk and if that's getting. Leaned then it's all the way to the locker room. only good thing is the wage, pathetic useless management and HR are just as worse, you ring them with an issue explaining your manager has done nothing to help ya with the issue and they in their genius decide that sending the manager a request to deal with it is a bright idea they're jst useless too waste of time having them on site, messed my Holidays up, wage hasn't been correct since I started"
bad,"Hard work decent pay but management treats you like a number. No work life balance possible because of shift times, and no incentive to work harder! Don't recommend as a carrer"
bad,"Most work days are just completely drones with nothing to do. Decent pay. Main issue is that the management is completely biased towards eastern europeans being eastern europeans themselves. They allocate some of the best jobs such as ICQA to them even when positions have been preassigned anyway. Furthermore they easily allow overtime to them when other workers of other races often aren't allowed any overtime at all. Worst part is that they even communicate only in their eastern european languages, with only a sparing few being able to speak any fluent english."
bad,"Don't waste your time with part-time seasonal.  After the two week training, there's no work for you.  You're in their system but no work schedule.  Waste of my time,  they don't train you you train yourself and other co-workers are helpful when you ask them questions but they have rates to keep up with so don't bother them to much.  The work is heavy picking up cases of water, drinks to stow.  I learned not to work  there again."
bad,Would never go back. I gained 30lbs and nearly had a stroke while working there due to the stress and terrible schedule. Good thing I had great insurance if I needed to go to the hospital due to work.
bad,"Intense working culture, did not have the feeling of support from team. Would have wanted more guidance from mentor and teammates working on the same project, was not given that guidance."
bad,"Si vous n’êtes pas motivés et n’aimez pas l’effort physique prononcé cette entreprise est à fuir, c’est un travail dur physiquement autant que psychologiquement, pour une première expérience ça peut passer mais si vous souhaiter durer au sein d’amazon Il faut avoir les nerfs solides. On vous traite comme du bétail travail à la chaîne en soit le travail en lui même n’est pas désagréable il y a toujours pire mais ce qui est dérangeant c’est le management autour, a peine forme on vous envoie déjà vous perdre dans des endroits que vous ne connaissez pas. Vous avez constamment peur de faire une erreur ou fauter et vous faire réprimander alors qu’en soit ce n’est pas de votre faute mais c’est le manque de formation et d’informations. Vous aurez peut être la chance de tomber sur des managers et des employés bienveillants mais vous aurez peut être aussi la malchance de tomber sur des personnes qui se prennent pour des pdg tyranniques alors qu’en soit ils n’ont aucune qualification élevée au sein de l’entreprise. Faites attention à vous et à ce que vous dites et faites profil bas. Préparez vous à devenir de vrais petits soldats épuisés par la fatigue."
bad,"The Amazon campus feels suffused with enormous ambition to be or do something or anything, fueled by the breathless, unquestioned assumption that Amazon has succeeded because its employees are in some essential way better than those at other companies."
bad,Work at Mc Donalds better benefits and pay. Amazon is a Whale and swallows up everything in its path to make more money. There is no reason why they cant pay their workers living wages
bad,Amazon has a huge turnover.  Managers are not the most friendliest or helpful at all.  You are not allowed to have a water bottle near you and god forbid you are late because of an accident on the highway.  They will fire you for being late.
bad,It’s okay the money is good to many young workers a lot of drama no job security my grandfather died and a mange threw my obituary away that I was told to bring in as prof I’ve worked for them over a year
bad,"not a good environment, poor management, poor employee care, poor balance of life and work, poor opportunities to advance, poor pay wage, poor compensation"
bad,The difficulty of the intern projects varies much from team to team. I've worked in a database team called the Redshift where C/C++ code are extensively used. For someone who likes low-level system programming and optimization this will be great place.
bad,"I would come on shift, log onto the intranet, begin work orders and complete my assignments.  The job culture was to treat the maintenance dept. as bottom feeders back in 2002"
bad,"Monotone Arbeit, viele Anrufe, ein klassischer Call-center Job eben"
bad,"They ask for too much and pay nothing...."
bad,"Be prepared to work with a group of people you cant talk to. Very fast paced.  Management micro-manages you while you work, all they while being in your way while they tell you to work faster.  You can move up if you blindly follow rules, even breaking safety rules to boost productivity."
bad,Need to develop more andvance robotics to replace the humans that they want to be like robots. Human behavior is unpredictable and not everyone comes to work at 100% we all have different issues. They should not expect you to fit perfectly in their “box” of expectations. This giant conglomerate of a company needs more flexibility when dealing with their personnel
bad,"Salary is very bad compared to the work that we do. Regular associates get paid 11.50,  (PA, Process Assistant) they get paid 13.25 extremely stressful you have to work 11 hours as a PA."
bad,Horrible Leadership in the HR Dept. Lack of experienced Business Partners. Bad attitudes across the board HR BP’s to ICQA short Manager during the day hours. Unrealistic deliverables to the team and no buy in support from Operations. Play the favorite game when moving people within the company. If you are placed under a toxic BP and or Manager they will provide low to mid scoring during performance review time to prevent you from transitioning on despite how Great you truly perform. Must be one of the good ole boy’s to stay afloat.
bad,They will make you work your huttnoff and then throw you to the side like trash. Management has ridiculously horrible communication skills and have no idea what they are doing. Nobody is treated fairly because management has their favorites. It’s high school all over again with a bunch of children.
bad,I've work there for almost 4 years that place is gone downhill due to constant change of management and low standards of new hires. The work culture is horrible and the warehouse is really dirty when you actually get on the floor. If you need a temporary job ASAP you want to work for the time being but if you want a career in Warehouse  don't come unless you are a suck up then you'll have easier time advancing than everybody else.
bad,The location was amazing and the place was nice. They had poor management and not a lot of things to help hurt employees. did not have a plan layout for where employee go  for emergency .
bad,"Amazon offers some great things for their employees, but the culture can be difficult.  There is not a lot of transparency, but there is  a lot of bureaucracy, and a lot of process and 'rules' to follow that often get in the way of actually getting things done. The focus is also too internal, not taking information, data and/or ideas from outside of Amazon into consideration.  While they pride themselves on being innovative and challenging, many existing processes and philosophies are not evolving with their growth, and subsequently impacting their ability to be agile and productively disruptive.  Amazon has become such a household mainstay that they will continue to grow and be successful regardless, so the machine will continue, but without any real change to their culture and internal processes change and innovative will be a slog."
bad,"I'm grateful to have a job but Amazon is modern day slavery. Employees are not valued and the turnover is obscene. In 2 years I have seen at least 40 people fired. These are people who worked hard too. Mistakes are not tolerated. If they identify you as someone they may have to assist a bit, you will quickly be worked out the door. I have never worked at a company where people are so disposable. Most people I work with have been there an average of 2 years. I only know of a handful of people who have been there over 3 years. Most people are either fired or leave before 3 years. The pay is not a living wage and the CEO is the wealthiest person on the planet. I am looking for another job because the culture is terrible and I hate feeling like I can be fired on a whim. Go to Microsoft. At least Bill Gates is a decent human being. Bezos is greedy and does nothing to help the people who work for him over what is legally required, he doesn't help the community and he doesn't care about making the planet a better place or helping less fortunate people."
bad,"Pros"
bad,not challenging. When you express your interests and strengths they do not listen. it is a repeated day to day. They should really hire in people to the areas of their expertise rather than just filling positions.
bad,If you are over 40 that had said that they will not promote you. They will tell you that you need to work overtime at the last minute and expect you to stay late.
bad,"I worked at the Amazon in Etna Ohio. The Management is horrible and they don't make employees feel appreciated. Employees are constantly pushed to pull there numbers up even if the work load is slow and no matter how hard you try, your rates are never good enough. You work 10 hour shifts with mandatory overtime sometime as much as 3 times a week. Employees are worked as if they are machines and written up for there numbers not being good enough. I will never work there again and I would not recommend to anyone even if they were desperate for a job."
bad,"Too many people in management. No one wants to give definite answers to the simplest task for fear of stepping on others ""toes"".  Then either upper management or another department comes into your work area and rarely askes input from workers on what would be in the best interest for your work stations.  they simply go in and make changes that  make your job more complicated."
bad,"Amazon is an interesting company. They like to show outwardly that they are fantastic to work for and with, but on the interior, that just is not the case. I have heard many dreadful stories about working at Amazon. Mine, is not too bad. I started at the company in the late summer/early fall of 2016 at a part time position. They say there are opportunities to move up but there aren't really. They only let you work a max of 25 hours a week (30 if its like Christmas time) because they don't want to give you benefits. There are no fixed hours and everybody has to fight for the shifts when they are posted. Most shifts are 5 hours so they don't have to give you a 30 minute break. I get paid $15.30/hr but I rarely get more than $200 a paycheck. You are not important here. You are expendable."
bad,"A multi-gazillion dollar corporation warehouse runs like an amateur mickey mouse production (no disrespect to Micky Mouse)."
bad,"This is not a fun place to work. You are a statistic and only looked at as a number. Unless you are in management they do not learn your name at all. You do not get paid enough for the amount of work that you do. Management cares more about numbers than the quality, efficiency and safety of your work."
bad,"Hard workers are not recognized."
bad,Certe la paye est tres juteuse mais le stress qu'on nous donne est tres intense.
bad,"The work involves non-stop movement for 10-11 hours a day for 4-5 days of the week. In most situations within the company you are considered replaceable and this is frequently shown by the movement of employees through a given position. Stock options are heavily advertised, however good luck staying the two years until you receive it,"
bad,"I began working here after having been assured that my education would play a key role in deciding factors for advancement. This is 100% untrue. Amazon doesn't care how educated you are, advancement is based on seniority and favoritism."
bad,Amazon didn't pay you enough for the work you were told to do. Managers expected a rate to be followed even though the stock boxes were full and you were given large items to stow.
bad,It was good pay and there are great people but as they say in orientation their attendance system is designed to fail. I was fired during my orientation within two hours of employment with them. You start out with 50 UPT (Unpaid time off) and 20 PTO (Paid Time Off). I ended up in orientation negative 90 hours. Proving their system failure chances. Their human resource team is lazy and refuses to work with you with anything including your schedule for home life complications. Trying to get a schedule change is close to near impossible and if you have legal documentation to get your schedule changed keep several copies. They will lose it or misplace it. I learned if you are willing to worry about whether your going to have a job the next day or not this job would be good. Pay is good benefits can be good if for the right person.
bad,"Ne příliš náročná práce, avšak s malou možností povýšení a neustálé přesčasy"
bad,amazon would be better less micro managing. there is nothing fun about amazon if you go to use the restroom you will automatic get time of task you cant get your totes or other equipment that you need for your station with out gettting time off task.
bad,"Se trabaja con empresa de trabajo temporal, no pagan pagas ni vacaciones"
bad,"This job really isn't what I thought it would be. "
bad,"They are a cliquey bunch, you either fit in or you don't. They always have a watchful eye on you. They do give lots of help to improve, but you have to speak up. If you go digital, just beware they are some of the vile trolls who will stab you in the back and talk down to you. I would not recommend unless you really love amazon and you show the love to them every moment - if not - byebye."
bad,"The co-workers were great, but management was severely lacking. Too many chefs, one kitchen. Problems are expected, but the number of unnecessary problems were through the roof. Extreme favoritism."
bad,"Supervisors were lacking. There was no empathy for employees, there were ""benefits"" but had to jump through hoops to get them. It is too black and white."
bad,Worst management ever. Employees get VTO (voluntary time off) because the lack of organization and to avoid getting write up for not making production rates. Managers get promoted based on write ups.
bad,"targets to hit could be better, as far as the work goes it is quite easy. very good with health and safety. managers too young with no life experience. good canteen with free drinks. lots of micro waves and lots of cold storage for some where to put your food. free safety boots but very uncomfortable. top of the range working equipment. free parking. long hours"
bad,"$12 an hour starting sounds good, but unrealistic quotas and liberal with time off. 1 minute late results in an hour of Unpaid Time Off being taken away."
bad,"Poor management, work life balance and cultural.  Everyone for themselves.  Not a great place for people with young children.  Very long hours.  Averaged about 60 hours a week.  Lots of turn over.   It's a place that is more about perception to work."
bad,"Great pay but always in the same job every day. Rated tasks everyday that have high expectations. Only select few are actually trained in other jobs. Majority do the hard work every day. Every time you turn around they take something else away. They act like making even the smallest concessions to make your job more enjoyable are a huge inconvenience. They will tell you when you get hired that they develope people and care about their employees but they don't. Management changes constantly and can't be relied on to improve anything, just make your job harder. And they don't allow music."
bad,"ok place to work as far as basic jobs go. dont buy any of their bs there is no room for advancement unless you make the right friends. Very physically demanding as ""industrial athlete"""
bad,Annoying and ever-present micromanagement. No appreciation for any kind of self-development. Opportunities for career growth are based on contribution and ability to contribute is not dependant on individual
bad,"Managers don't Listen to improve processes and run around power hungry and lost on whats going on. HR is a mess and are no help, issues with managers bullying people never addressed"
bad,"The hiring team and even some more enthusiastic higher ups will emphasize how this job is ""all about the culture"" and how they want to create a ""great work environment,"" and everything seems great the first couple of months you are there and then you start to see it is all talk, no walk. ""The higher up you go, the less they know"" is what a shift lead told me. When I spoke to different titles of management, I found that they were right. It is hard to get questions answered and even harder to get correct answers directly. If you are open to HR or other management about any concerns or problems, I estimate that 1/5 times something is done (and that's if you're lucky). They are always making new changes to cheapen their costs, but it makes it incredibly difficult for workers with cheap materials and such small space to work with. There is also cost loss indirectly blamed on employees when it is due to their poor management and planning from corporate. The job positions also imply that you need to be like a robot with how they track productivity and bathroom breaks."
bad,"Poor management, very few options to move up, most people work less and get paid the same as those who work much harder, favoritism abundant, no rewards for site achievements."
bad,"If you need a job this is a place short term, if you want a career look elsewhere. pay maxes out fast and before you know it you'll be burnt out and ready to move on."
bad,"The management of this particular site just plays favorites. The only way you can do other jobs in the building is to kiss their behind and they will like you. I have worked there for 5 months and learned multiple jobs in the building but always get picked to scan. While other people do the same job week after week and day after day and never pick a scan gun up, extremely unfair. Scanning is the easiest way to get fired and written up while the other jobs you are not tracked for how many boxes you scan, you just do the job, which some people don't do. They just talk and half behind while the scanners literally break a sweat trying to clear the lane and still get written up for not having a high enough scan rate. I can only say this for this particular facility, however. Also security just watches youtube and play computer games all day."
bad,"I applied for this job in March of 2017 and got a call for an interview in oct of 2017. At this point when I applied I had found an agency job, but disliked it so I left it mid sept and amazon called me two weeks later. When I went to the interview that was located in a suite, I realized it was more of a presentation than a personal interview with at least 30 people there, When they handed us a schedule they said it would be 6 hrs a day after peak. So I figured I would take it and had to wait an obnoxious two weeks before they called me. I had also worked for their main competitor and knew they needed people right away, but I didn't lose hope, so after the recruiter called me he gave me an ""on call"" position that was $17 an hour, after protesting to get the normal $12 an hour job I signed up for he reassured me I would get the hours, but the person sounded reassuring, so I figured why not. I like my co workers, but for the week after black friday we only worked 8 hours, then 12, then 8 the next week. The only week there was a full 20 hours was the week before christmas, however there was 20 of us on call and whoever responded first to the company texts got to go in, so in total I worked less than 30 hours for a month, what also upset me off was when I applied for a position in two other warehouses my apps were denied, because I was still working there, I tried contacting someone, but they gave us zero contacts or info for finding an actual position after peak. Overall, when I heard amazon I got excited because it is a world renowned company, but it eneded up being a major letdown.I"
bad,"Working at Amazon can be stressful It is a churn and burn company though and though. The workers are treated poorly ""disposable badges disposable people"" Been with them for five years have seen the churn many times over both in operations and management."
bad,"I am driven and intelligent, but if you are not willing to throw others under the bus, you may not be cut out for this place. Average life-span of an employee being appx. 18 mo., this also applies to managers. This means it is hard to have committed managers that have the necessary skills/experience to stick around. Bad, inexperienced managers enable the cut-throat culture to become toxic and alliances form and continue."
bad,Over worked and under paid.  Quick turnaround. Different departments do not communicate with one another which makes everyone else job hard. Overworked
bad,The job hours were strenuous and dehumanizing. There was very minimal consideration on health and well-being of the employee. There was only on occasion lunches provided by staff management.
bad,"Very fast faced, cut throat, staff ranked(now unofficial), difficult to work in this environment for long time unless you find a golden key to work around . "
bad,They dont hire you for your experience they hire you because your a body to them. Under paying their people for what they have us doing. Dangerous to work around no experience operating heavy equipment with 2 hours of training. State of the art equipment inside and equipment that 50% of the time don't work outside.
bad,The other hr team didnt take nothing serious and it was very bad working there. The mangement always messed up witb the sruff they did . And noone there took there job as a job
bad,"A decent tempary job and nothing more. The work is redundant, and when it isn't its stressful.  They are very liberal with and encourage you to take unpaid time off when available."
bad,Overall a good job. Lind Drive and distance from where I live. Seasonal job. Looking for job more permanent. Had great benefits but not that good in management.
bad,Amazon made a lot of empty promises. Many of the managers although they had degrees were not actually capable or did not know how to lead. This made my life at Amazon very disappointing.
bad,only thing good is that the benefits are with kaiser and the dental and vision are great if u have kids . how ever long time term no. fast paced and during peak month which is oct -early jan u wull be required to work over time. yeah you clock in the $$ but it doesnt add to your life and not seeing family and friends. pay is 11.75 day shift and night shift 12.25
bad,They told me I would become a fulltime Amazonion and made me learn every area and then they cut me 2 days before Christmas cause they no longer needed me and said I can apply for one of their other warehouses if I wanted to at the beginning of the new year...i wouldn't recommend them to any of my friends looking for a job...
bad,"a true waste of time but good for the winter."
bad,Too strict requirements and high targets for such a salary. Managerial team of non-appetizing.Lack of motivation and bonus system. Corrupted Career Stair System.
bad,"Worked here several times, pays good but all very performance based. No human element or leeway, agency workers very slow to help and often dont/forget or lose what you need them to do"
bad,"It's not  a good place for people with anxiety and depression disorders. The noise level of the warehouse was sometimes enough to bring me to tears. My feet ached every single day because the floor was so hard and the mats they had down did nothing to help, the best comfort I got was standing on bubble wrap. The need to be ahead of plan or whatever goal of stuff you needed to sort was crippling, and my anxiety wouldn't let me take a minute to drink water without the crippling fear I would fall behind and never be able to catch back up."
bad,I started working for them 8 years ago and it was a very good company to work for but over the years it has changed with the pay getting closer to minimum and workload keeps going up.
bad,"Poor management with lack of experience and too young."
bad,This Job was okay as far as pay and benefits but the management is bad. This type of job has a high turn over rate due to this tot mess that is not quite right. but its a job.
bad,"Very poor management filled to the brim with inexperienced recent graduates who have never worked in a warehouse environment before. I would really not recommend this job to any person who has worked in another warehouse setting as you WILL be frustrated with the managers. HR is also very poor and cannot help you with nearly any issues, mostly for the same reasons that the managers are poor."
bad,"Worked seasonal,   was terminate  for missing 4 days.  Never missed a day.  Called HR was told they would take care of it.  Never called me back ever. Was not allowed to come in to get taken care of."
bad,Lack of Advancement excessive workload both physically and mentally along with very low pay scales. Management is very young and not mature enough professionally.
bad,"Mandatory 55 hours a week, unfairly high targets and a confusing and uninviting agency with very poor communication skills. You are brought in with around 80 others each induction and after 2 weeks 80% of them will have left. The company does not care about you in the slightest as you will probably quit after a few shifts."
bad,"I always had lack of communication or appreciation of what you do.  Promotion of the least qualified employees, which left the high potential employees out.  Interview process to advance confusing and unfair"
bad,"I worked at Amazon for 5 years. I was a ambassador, PA( associate manager), packer, rebin and induct. During my time I watched them treat people like robots or numbers. The respect came from regular employees not management! Managers acted like you were dirt on their shoes. If you missed production by 1 or 2% you get written up or fired. Horrible place to work unless you like to be treated like dirt!"
bad,"I find the Amazon help desk to be less than helpful, unwilling to do more than pass the buck."
bad,"I had a great experience at Amazon and made really good friends. I am so grateful for the experience. I learned how to work extremely hard in a faced pace environment, making sure to work in a safe organized manner, leaving no room for error."
bad,"Amazon was great when I first started but is slowly going down the tubes each year. At first I could see how amazon's ""culture"" to be a company with the most customer obsession. I have been with the company over three years now.  Just like any other place I guess, It's about making numbers. Push as much out of the warehouses as you can. Most managers act like they care but it's all about how much we can push and raise the rate until everyone is struggling to make it. I heard a manager say ""if they aren't sweating they are not working hard enough."" I been to a few cvg buildings and the outcome is the same. I done it all over the years working for this company. On this side the customer, associates, safety, and quality don't really matter,. Quantity of work going out is what they look for. HR is for managers and not really for the associates when it comes to favoritism and conflict of interest they take the managers side. There are managers that still have their job after getting caught in the act for breaking some of these huge policies. Oh yeah, ask an amazonian what the saying ""loose your temper, and loose your job"" means. That don't work for managers that are in the ranks, another failure for HR. Just because they apologizes for their actions doesn't mean it is okay to lash out again. So, there is so much more I could tell you. If you need a job until you get a real career, work here. They will hire just about anyone in anything (the door is always revolving). This is a little heads up on what  you're going to go through. I am currently taking interviews else where. Amazon"
bad,"The communication sucks, management sucks everything about this place sucks. they are very short noticed. They state that feedback is important, you place it. they do not take it under consideration."
bad,"Typical day for most includes working for ten hours and walking between 15 to 25 miles a day. Having to keep a constant pace or getting a write up, also fear of write ups if off task for more than a set amount of time each day for the whole day. So bathroom visits start to come under scrutiny. Advanced has nothing to do with previous work experience and cannot move up until with company for six plus months but not to a higher permanent position until two years. However new managers fresh from college with no experience at all, are hired at almost double the salary of the next positions. Advancements are pushed by friendships and not skill sets as well, as having seen many unproductive associates pushed to advancement into higher positions with no strong skill set or matching work numbers."
bad,"On my last day there, I was slammed with nothing but angry callers, which was intentional. They control what types of calls employees can receive. They were up front about this during training. As a result, I would NEVER, ever come back to this employer. This shows a great lack of respect to the employee, and to the company as a whole. It has tainted my view overall of Amazon, and I have a hard time purchasing anything from the company. "
bad,"I am very glad that I have a job, however, this is not my ideal place of employment. My work does not feel valued and the standards are too stressful to keep up with."
bad,"when its busy, because a lot of employees called in. I had no break for over 3 weeks. But managers would smoke by the door on their breaks. It was hard to swallow. I reported that I saw someone stealing, and that person got promoted."
bad,"Amazon has great benefits, but they are poorly managed.  The production rates are constantly raised and no job security.  You can lose your job there within a week if production is not met.  Management does not care, as production (in the name of customer service)  is only increased.  Turnover is at a all high and there is no concern for hard work."
bad,They had site managers. For my position there were about fifteen site managers. There for there was no one to call if you are sick or running late or if you wanted any kind of direction. It was kind of just all over the place if you wanted info on anything.
bad,"Co-Workers were fun and easy to get along with. There was ice machines in break rooms. Had ping pong tables and basket ball hoops. Would have games though out the year for better morale of the workforce. Would have blood, food drives to help the community."
bad,"Really though, I mean it. Its not worth it unless it is your absolute last choice. They don't care about their workers at all. I've been injured multiple times and according to them it is just ""normal wear and tear"" after a 50 hour work week."
bad,"Would fire an employee for any excuse. Don't value workers. Poor management. Rules don't apply to everyone, only the chosen ones. Don't understand employees, all they care about is numbers. Lack of communication. Most people don't stay in Amazon for more then two years, except the chosen ones."
bad,Amazon has many great benefits for full time employees but that is the only perk and its not worth working for the company. The workers are underpaid for the labor they do in the returns department especially compared to other companies.
bad,"Job is terrible, You are just a number to them. They expect you to work nonstop as such as a robot would at a fast pace with accuracy. You will be on your feet all day 10-12 hours 4-5 days a week. They will fire you for going to the bathroom because it is Time off task. 15 minute breaks are actually 5 minutes. Managers are racist along with just wanting to fire people because they get rewarded for the most terminations."
bad,"A Terrible agency (PMP Recruitment) , would NOT recommend to anyone unless you are desperate for money and is your last resort. Took me nearly 3 weeks to receive my weekly pay."
bad,"If you can work at corporate, then you might be ok. Corporate office is located in Seattle. The warehouses are a joke. You are constantly on your feet. If you are in the warehouse, even if you are in HR (lower end of HR),  you are in the warehouse. Not temp controlled, very micromanaged, minutes/seconds are counted, etc. Pay isn't great. You will work all holidays. It doesn't matter if you are assigned the other shift. They will tell you mandatory overtime."
bad,"In order to be promoted at amazon, you have to be liked by other co-workers. Discipline, Integrity, Diligence, Performance, Respect, Leadership, and Loyalty are not respected in Amazon."
bad,"A horribly monotonous job with little to nothing to break up the day. Whatever 2 step job they put you in, expect to be doing the same 2 steps, 10-12 hours a day, 4-6 days a week, 52 weeks per year until your body aches from doing the same movements over and over again."
bad,Get ready for a job where you have to beg for job supplies on a daily basis. There is no direct supervision. All concerns are texted to faceless people over an app on your phone. There is NEVER a day where you will have everything you need to complete your job the way it's supposed to be done. It's a wonder how this company has managed to keep afloat.
bad,"I would highly recommend not applying for this job if you are looking for job security and a fair, honest equal opportunity workplace. They get you with benefits but don't do anything to address actual concerns."
bad,"Pay is decent for job requiring minimal qualifications, but is capped after 3 years. Insurance is excellent. Stock options available eventually."
bad,"We were forced to work consecutive overtime hours. Our well being wasnt cared for. treated like animals. Management was not great at all, these people had no experience and were given their jobs."
bad,"Travail ingrat, aucune considération pour les employés. seul la production compte. Interdiction de parler avec les autres employés.  3 minutes autorisés pour se rendre au WC"
bad,"When I started there, everybody complained about how they disliked a few certain jobs, for example, Flexpac  Everybody for the most part agreed it was the worst job and they would never do it, esp. for $12/hour. Well,I continued on, hopefully it was not as bad as everyone said it was. Well, it was. They were right. Definitely not worth $12/hour."
bad,"I worked as a CSA for 1 year and the journey was so good . being a executive i worked with various departments and learned many new things. As being a part of amazon, I gained a very good experience."
bad,"Associates are highly expendable."
bad,"Its a decent job to have to make ends meet, but there is no job security and alot of favoritism. The culture is not safety oriented because the employees arent held accountable."
bad,This was a very demanding work environment. The management team was not very supportive with helping introducing process changes to the Associates in my area. I did enjoy the challenge of leading an area successfully.
bad,Lack of Knowledge amongst the facility. To many Chiefs and not enough Indians. Environment was horrible. Management did not appreciate their associates.
bad,"I would not recommend this job to anyone. You're constantly doing the same thing over and over again. You're expected to only do your job and not talk to others. Your break is 15 minutes, but you have to be back to your gun and scanning by the time the 15 minute bell goes off. Also, be prepared for them to watch your clock in times. Even if there is a long line to click in, you will get written up for clocking in a minute after you're suppose to."
bad,management cares little about employees and deems work all for their advancement and recognition. workplace culture was rough lots of drug use and fighting as  well as destruction of property and theft.
bad,stand in the same spot for 12 hours getting limited break time back hurting and feet hurting. Take product off assembly line and scan it into warehouse and scan product into warehouse
bad,Engineers work for an immense amount of time a day. They are hard-working and are extremely skilled. I have worked with a bunch of awesome engineers there. The management sucks. Their attitude towards the engineers is horrible.
bad,"What is there to say about this company? Well, they lie to the employees on a regular basis, treat the employees like numbers on a spreadsheet, and everything else makes it feel like you're working inside a prison as an inmate. 10 hour work days and you have to ASK for PERMISSION to use the BATHROOM. It's literally the worst company I've ever worked for and I highly recommend no one ever put themselves through the absolute torture of working there."
bad,"will never work a factory night shift job again. hours were ridiculous and it consumed my life as soon as i started, but i did enjoy meeting the many people that worked there."
bad,No work life balance at.  It was a 24/7 365 day job!!  You do learn alot but have very little training. things change fast with out notice and you have to adjust on the fly. T
bad,"i got a position here which started straight away. had 5 minutes of training and was expected to meet ridiculous targets instantly, staff were horrible, atmosphere was horrible. The only good thing there was the cafeteria."
bad,"They claim that each employee is important and that just isn't true. This company is so huge that almost every employee, unless you are in management, gets lost in the mix. They have constant mandatory overtime."
bad,A typical workday includes various functions as it pertains to inventory control quality assurance.  The merchandise is tallied and accounted for by thoroughly tracking inventory using a scanner as the primary tool.  Problem solving entails searching via computer the correct product code when an error is indicated and supplying the accurate information to products.
bad,A nice place to work at the money is great but is greatly has its downfall when the managers does not really respect you as humans and adults. Do not get into a habit of using your PTO .
bad,"too stressful at times, constant schedule changes. dispatch and company office dont know what they're doing and a lot of favorites and work weekends as well for the whole year never get a weekend off."
bad,"Amazon is a great company, look at the stocks and epic growth they achieve. However, the management staff exhibit bullying behavior and your only recourse is to call an ethics hotline if your onsite HR staff is not will to help you. You will lose your job if you stand up for anything right, and it is best to have a go along to get along attitude so put your standards aside and pretend you don't see the wrong doings and bad/bullying behavior. I love the job but hate the politics and the lack of accountability for management. Amazon is obsessed with customers, if only they'd bring that obsession to their employees! Management is overall poor and cut throat, bullying behavior is the norm and there are more politics than in Washington DC! They should be ashamed of themselves!"
bad,The environment at this workplace is a bunch of managers right out of college who act like they want to know ideas from more experienced people but never listen. They lie to get you to work different schedules. The online hub is a travesty of web development that makes no sense considering the company started out online and yet can't keep their own hub working properly. It ends up firing people on default and not fixing it. With all my experience they never let me move up to any type of position like a forklift operator.
bad,It is a aggressive company... it is difficult to strike the work life balance as people are expected to work long hours due lack of efficient decision making
bad,"It's a company you join when you are ready to give up your life in exchange for learning and growth. Lots to learn, definitely the best part is working with some very bright people."
bad,"Long hours, you never get recognize for the hard work you do. management never knows what's goin on. They write you up for things that is out of your control. Not really a good place to work unless you are in inbound."
bad,"Must be on your feet 10 hours a day. Must work extremely fast. Much like working out for 10 hours straight with 2 ten minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch. "
bad,"Long hours with pay that does not correspond to the daily mental and physical frustration of the job. As a temp worker, my experience was anything but positive. Full time employees constantly create conflict with others and the job culture is terrible."
bad,"on feet 10 hours a day for 11.00 hour to start. "
bad,Not a very good work place and unorganized. Don't get full 4 hour work day as stated when applying. Desperately needs new management. Misleading. Do not waste your time.
bad,Good Pay no job security. Harsh manual labor. They may pay you well but because of there terrible turn over rate you could lose your job at any time for no reason at all.
bad,Amazon may be a good place to work for 20 year olds who are fresh outta college and are hired on right away as a Tier IV position but anyone else about the age of 35+ will find it very difficult to move up
bad,"If your looking for a culture are that silently promotes working 18 hour days, then this is the job for you. I went into attaining a t another Fulfillment Center and had a Manager tell me specifically as his #1 advice to ""not trust anyone"". Certainly not what I was hoping for,"
bad,"Management was horrible, not really sure of how to complete any job functions. HR was even worse, never were able to answer any questions for any employee. The pay was OK but after paying for health plan and taxes you seen maybe half of it.You do not receive sufficient break time. DO NOT RECOMMEND."
bad,"Wages are poor, kept reducing our salary, not enough routes\shifts for most drivers. Promises always broken, vans issued were always taken away for poorer quality. Got very depressed working for Amazon in a short period of time through funds and getting in to debt thanks to being put on stand by ( no routes)."
bad,"If you want to work somewhere where you feel appreciated and work and just go home, this wouldn't be it because it is always something new and it isn't positive."
bad,The best thing about Amazon is the benefits. The offer the best attendance policy in the area. It is not a easy job. Rate requirements are too high. Management has their favorites and often over looks qualified associates.
bad,"typical day at work is loading up the truck with packages and delivering packages to designated areas."
bad,"you work hard for 2 months, do a good job, work 10 and 12 hour shifts just to be let go after Christmas. I am disabled, and no accommodations are made."
bad,"a typical day at work, management is the toughest to deal with and being safe is #1 in general. Workers are very sloppy at amazon fresh LAX6 and aren't committed to working well. Most enjoyable is the benefits but not management when it comes to hourly rates, lots of rules and very strict on them, termination is daily part of the work environment."
bad,"I had fun working there. This place has terrible benefits, and no job security though. I would not recommend this place to work. No potential for longevity."
bad,"Amazon is a very busy, high demand place to work. It is a high pace, high energy place. You will push your body physically beyond its limits. It is best for people in excellent health and preferably younger. If there is an accident or incident, the department called AMCare which is staffed by paramedics address the issue immediately."
bad,"Long work days, sometimes 11 hours a day. Mandatory overtime almost 3 times a month. As a student, it is very hard to balance work and school life. Advancement is hardly encouraged, very unorganized management team."
bad,"Understood all aspects of production."
bad,"come in work hard and get the job done to my fullest and always safe at my job. alot of the times you just work to hard and you never are appreciated and now adays you come in to work and you never now if you are going to have a job or not they are taking alot of volunteer time off and there is no work trying to figure out what is going on and no one will tell us anything so i am kind of scared for that, i am just ready for a change in my life."
bad,"e un posto di lavoro,si va a lavorare per percepire uno stipendio"
bad,"Amazon is a widely recognised company serving to Europe and worldwide the work conditions are above standard but the environment to work in is dismal and below average. The management is shocking and if they don't like the look of you or do not like you they will try hardest to get you sacked by dishing out warnings when they are not even your manager, certain departments are a pleasure to work for and would help you out as best as possible."
bad,"Ils faut toujours avoir les gestes et postures controlés par les managers de Amazon. "
bad,"Decent pay for easy work but do not expect to enjoy your time here. Awesome benefits but the toll this company takes on your family and private life is harsh.  The atmosphere created is one of a highly disposable workforce, where hard work is unrecognized and slacking off is the norm.  I have a very highly refined work ethic.  Unfortunately I am only one of a few who can say this at Amazon Fulfillment. The mandatory overtime during the holidays is exhausting and unrealistic.  The promised bonuses are all but mythical as this building has never made its productivity goals."
bad,"This company does not care about the entry level employees who break their backs to get shipments out. It's a stressful, unhappy environment."
bad,"Promised the world when you start and they do not deliver. One person tells you one thing and another will tell you the exact opposite, Leaving you to decide who is right and who is wrong. Had 20+ hours of time messed up on my check that HR NEVER fixed for me and I reminded them every couple of days and was told I was creating unnecessary tension in the workplace. I can only speak for the Obetz facility as I hear nothing but good things about Etna."
bad,"This is a good job for those that don´t take their work too serious that don´t have a drive to develop. You just don´t need to start questioning things or making suggestion because if  Amazon is a lot of things, they are not "" vocally self critical"".  Also there is hardly any assistance from management in your development. They just throw you in the water and if you drown, it is your fault. Most managers will try to blame agents for system issues and the moment, you mention feedback that they do not approve of, you are stigmatised as negative. However, Cape Town is beautiful and if you don´t take the job too serious, you can manage."
bad,"Hires mid level managers with no management experience who are focused on analytics and do not have a fundamental understanding of building teams, caring for people, and creating a positive work environment."
bad,"If you kiss butt a lot can move up."
bad,"Mangers depend on a computer to monitor your work, as they play around with other associates or just disappear. Also the hr team and medical team can careless about the associate unless they're dying; if you get sick and start throwing up at work with no hours, too bad they're going to make you stay unless you want negative hours."
bad,"The particular site I worked at was not adequately staffed since day one. This caused a lot of strain on staff with daily tasks, reports and case load. First site I worked for was great, however the last site was severely lacking in all areas. It depends which site you go to as to the individuals success. This company is very metric driven and does not put the needs or care of the customer or associates working for them ahead of the metrics. Their processes need significant improvement internally. Otherwise it was a great experience at my first site, which is how most of the sites should be run."
bad,Besides my outstanding accolades & work review with this company I have nothing positive to say. I would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"Many leadership positions are filled with very young people who are often still in high school it college mode. They make people PG, etc... if they are friends or dating etc.  It's mostly a popularity contest and not about hitting your numbers with most leadership. If you pack (and cheat and break rules like cherry picking for large quantities), you will be applauded and rewarded. In The end, people who work hard and stay close to their ethics won't go anywhere. There is no point in bringing it up to leadership because they will make up excuses for everything."
bad,"A company that has many benefits but consider the employee as a roboot."
bad,Management is difficult and unfair.  Work and staff moral is low. Very strenuous and tiring work environment. Difficulty taking a break to use the restroom. Excellent benefits.
bad,"I enjoyed working there but to a point. They didn't give you very long to go on a break, I got shouted at for not clocking off when I did and there is CCTV to prove that. If you have a day off and they change roles you have no idea where you're supposed to go if you're new. Co-workers were okay, friendly and supportive."
bad,"If you cannot work in heavy heat and unrealistic expectations, do not go to Amazon."
bad,I have not been with amazon long and I am already looking for another place of employment. Ten hours on your feet with very little breaks is not something I can get use to.
bad,Will fire u for anything. Like not making rate for 3 days. Managers are rude. Pay is good benefits are ok. Hours are good breaks should be longer.
bad,"The work itself was straight forward with a lot of manual handling. sometimes extremely heavy items. Fast pace. I felt it was a conflicting environment due to the language barrier. ( English as a spoken language was not being observed)"
bad,"The company hires children who act like children. No one supervises certain areas ever.  You are required to push yourself to the breaking point.  Once all expectations are met, they are raised.  The company pays decent money but not nearly enough,"
bad,"Amazon CHA1 facility has some serious management problems. It's a job if you need a job, don't plan on long-term. The turnover is massive. "
bad,"Pretty much just like every other warehouse job, Pretty cool people that work there but over all i was there for one reason and that was just to make money"
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of picking packages all day, walking miles and miles. I learned how to use a scanner and how to work at a fast pace. Management was rarely seen and I worked at my own pace, as well as co-workers. The hardest part of the job was keeping my sanity after walking endlessly, and the most enjoyable part was exploring what Amazon.com had for products."
bad,"I was involved a lot with the operations team and associates, no development plan for anyone really. worked in multiple buildings in the so cal region, same everywhere."
bad,"I could write volumes on how awful it is to work at Amazon. It is and it isn't. I was there for nearly a decade and I learned a tremendous amount. I played a major contributing role in delivering the largest global data center expansion in history. I could complain, but I won't. I was free to leave at any time. The fact is that working for Amazon is an experience unto itself. Some people can hack it, most last about 18 months and are ""managed out"". I wouldn't go back, purely because the work/life balance is so far out of calibration. Beyond that, I've never worked so hard in my life."
bad,To work for Amazon is like being a slave and all you are to them is a number.  You are treated unfairly as well as its a target driven workplace
bad,if you think you can move up your wrong try and they use you till they can replace you with a temp you trained just to pay him less . mangers don't know your name and don't care the people are great just trying to live doing warehouse work for retail pay yeah ask for good pay safe Ha Get it Done LOL
bad,"although the employee's are nice, management sucks here, they are only worried about themselves and play favoritism. You do not receive your entire break. Please don't get sick here because they will tell you to drink water and send you back to work. (vomiting, diarrhea, who cares infect the entire warehouse with your germs.)"
bad,"Amazon doesn't seem to care much about their temporary help. They just wanted bodies to fill the spaces needed for peak times. The expectations were also unrealistic. 100% was not good enough. Many times employees were punished by not giving them the tools they needed to be faster and more productive when most of the time it wasn't employee error, it was equipment failure. Especially the scanning guns. They never worked right. And if your supervisor doesn't like you for any reason, something as simple as a personality clash, the employees are well aware. Amazon shows EXTREME favoritism. Horrible place to work if your temporary help. I have heard it's different if your a full time employee of Amazon, directly hired by them and not through a temp agency. But I never had the privilege of finding out. Couldn't take the horrible treatment long enough to find out."
bad,"Lack of knowledge in all around depts., campus hires are not effective in depts. where experience and knowledge of profession is needed. Management is two faced, there are just a handful of great managers. Your name on a board written by a disgruntled associate, ""defines"" your job ability and perception of your ability to your higher boss's."
bad,"One set of rules for some people, another for others. Unrealistic expectations of how fast work should get done, you can only achieve the targets if you run and running is strictly forbidden due to health and safety."
bad,I applied for full time and turned out to be seasonal. The pay was good. No bennifits since it was a temp job.It was not that far for me to drive.
bad,"In close to 3 years at Amazon, I had the opportunity to work with bright, capable coworkers but also very incapable leaders.  The most frequent measure of an employee is how long they are online and how often they ""reply all"" to make sure everyone knows that they are online.  This is disappointing for so many reasons.  Personal time is seen as optional, that you somewhere signed an unwritten agreement that coming to work for Amazon meant that you understood that you were forgoing having a personal life, family included.  Many employees will share that they are only there to have Amazon on their resume for two years(if they could make it that long), get out from under the payback periods for the relocation and/or signing bonus they took, then they were going to leave as soon as they could.  This mentality is fully accepted by managers, HRBPs and most co-workers, because the focus is on moving forward, with minimal attention paid to retention.  Attrition is rarely regretted, which has proven to create an overall environment in which the majority of employees have accepted that Amazon is a temporary layover only, not a career destination.  For a company that focuses so heavily on ownership, this culture does not embody ownership, it demonstrates resignation and failure to engage employees in a meaningful way to create a culture that drives loyalty instead of a constant feeling that team members are always ""one foot out the door."""
bad,If you have a request due to incompatible shift patterns they will have you fill out paperwork and then pretend it doesn't exist repeatedly.
bad,"Not a good place to work if you have kids and want to spend time with them. Work/life balance is poor. The expection for most roles at Amazon is that you will work 60+ hours per week. When you draw the line at 40 hours a week, you will either get a poor performance review or will get managed out."
bad,"4x 10 hour shifts with mandatory 10 hour overtime. rediculously high rate to meet. most boring job ive ever had. management loves complaining about your rate. some co-workers are cool but then you have those team of douchebags who expect you to get out of their way immediately. nothing fun about this job, 30 minute lunch flies by in what seems like 5 minutes."
bad,"The leadership lack people skills, all they care about is getting the work out and not the employees. In the beginning they make you feel good about yourselves but soon you come to realize that all they really care about is trying to get the most out of you for the cheapest amount possible."
bad,"terrible place to work, hours are unsociable, breaks are to short and the management is very bad. Only pro to working at Amazon is the pay."
bad,This company only hires a certain group of people. They only take their time with a certain group of people. They don't have medical benefits and their management is horrible.
bad,"Good company but management & managers are poor, they don't have good goal & not a people developers( where I worked), need to improve a lot,,,...."
bad,for a huge company like Amazon there's no structure what so ever. Everyday I dreaded going to work. Other smaller companies offer better pay and hours.
bad,"O trabalho da recepção é muito agradável, não é tão difícil,porém requer muita atenção e responsabilidade.Foi uma experiência que contribuiu para o desenvolvimento dos meus idiomas falado inglês e espanhol, devido ao contato direto com os hóspedes ,além de conhecer os sistemas CMNET e DESBRAVODOR. Enquanto a gerencia não tem influencia, uma vez que a diretoria passa por cima de suas decisões. Referindo-me aos meus colegas de trabalho, são pessoas trabalhadoras e dedicadas , mas os mesmos estão insatisfeitos devido a atraso salarial e falta de benefícios. A parte mais difícil do trabalho é fazer varias outras atividades que saem completamente da sua função, e a parte mais agradável é fazer suas atividades com amor e dedicação, e no fim do dia ver que tudo ocorreu bem."
bad,i went in  to this jobing hoping for progression and stability but i was wrong
bad,"APLE low wages dodgy compulsory accountant 70 per day 55 after tax for 10hours. If you take the van home APLE charges you for petrol. On top of that if you break the speed limit you get fined half a day wages. "
bad,To work at Amazon they prefer no brain. Associates have become just numbers and ones they only want to pay $11. Most Area  Managers have never had a job before Amazon and are allowed to continually regurgitate ideas that have been proven failures. There is absolutely no promotional opportunities and most associates walk around worrying that it will be thier last day
bad,"Lazy Management, too many slackers, Hard workers take up more slack than is necessary. Treat employees like garbage and terrible with overall correspondence. HR and LOA teams are worthless,"
bad,A typical Day is stressful you don't learn a lot but the coworkers are what make its bearable hardest part is dealing with unorganized management and leadership dealing with hardly any communication lots of safety hazards and bad HR seeing hard works get fired over small things
bad,"This company seemed like a great place to work at first, but after time went by your employment gets worse.  They don't treat their employees very well, there is little or no concern for employees. After you have been in there employ for two to three years they start to try and get rid of you. They find things to write you up on even if the mistakes were someone else.  When something happens within the warehouse the employee is blamed for it they pass the buck a lot, to make themselves and managers look better.  Managers do not tell truth they lie, and HR is just as bad. There is favoritism, its all about who you know, not what you know,  you work 4 ten hour days, two ten minute breaks and a half an hour lunch that's not much in 10 hours, all positions besides management and HR you are on your feet for 10 hours a day, and they have rates for picking and stowing sometimes there hard to meet if you don't your written up so many your out the door. And there is little advancement, a large turn over for help,  there in a constant state of reorganization. I only recommend this employment to people who are in between jobs or need medical insurance or if employment is to hard to find in your local area."
bad,It wasn't bad. Just a job and nowhere close to being a career. The management would communicate poorly and expect their front line leads to clean up the mess. There was little room for advancement.
bad,This is a very repetitve job same thing day in and day out. With Amazon being a billion dollar company there is no incentitives.
bad,".A typical day at work will be when we have many people in the building."
bad,"Amazon work is a typical warehouse work, which I bonded very well with and was very successful at. During my time at Amazon I met all my targets and was almost flawless; however, after Christmas which is the busiest time of the year in there, there were far to many employees to work available ratio. This situation resulted in many employees lay-offs, which the company considered normal with zero hours contract."
bad,"I work at the Patterson Amazon as a contract employee. Typical day isn't so bad but it is stressful and now the warehouse morons want us to start scanning as well! Those idiots have the manpower to send their own people out to do it. Last thing I need is to be slowed down with their BS."
bad,"Very physically demanding, fast paced, Needed to scan so many boxes or totes /day or you got told about it."
bad,"Good company to work, Good Support from the seniors, No much scope for Learning and Development of Skills. Salarywise ok good"
bad,"This is a small agency that tried to bring in more people and grow but struggled to learn how to manage new employees. Everything was very micromanaged and not a very positive environment. This was probably the hardest part of the job and made it difficult to want to go into work most days. Amazon has great clients and they are nice to work with. Other co-workers are still good friends of mine to this day. It was a true learning experience in management styles and the treatment of others! They did have very nice benefits and competitive pay, nice kick-backs from clients and a well stocked fridge with wine!"
bad,they are to focused with the numbers if you dont make rate your gone they dont care for the reasons as to why you didnt make rate
bad,a terrible place to work for temporary staff as you are on a 48 hour contract which can be terminated at any point including mid shift
bad,"My day begins working the in bound Trans Shipment Stow team. Unloading one or two trailers from the Chattanooga F.C.. Then onto off loading up to 6 trailers of inbound cargo from Ky and Pa F.C.'s .During my day I train new Lift drivers in a class room setting. Stressing Safety above all other functions in the warehouse. They are graded on test for new lift drivers before going into the F.C. to operate a lift in  the training area.The drivers are shown how to operate the controls , maintain a safe working area and how to ensure the safety of their coworkers."
bad,le travail est très pénible est ont nous prends tous pour des voleurs potentiel c'est le bagne il faut toujours faire mieux et il y a beaucoup de favoritisme 
bad,The people at this place our great but i would let go of the management team and rehire. They require you to work like a slave and aren't worried about you as a person or your quality of work their just worried about their quota.
bad,"I love Amazon, the people there are fantastic and very helpful. However the pay is very low and you never know what your schedule will be from month to month."
bad,Trabalho normal.
bad,Although they are a really big world wide company and talk a lot about health and safety they do not practice this.
bad,"I start the day with streches, safety tips, and quality tips. This is all done as a group with one of the management team on the dock. I love the people I work with, side by side on the dock. The hardest part of the job is 10 hours standing on concrete but this is over-rode by the awesome people that work on the dock."
bad,"Management is not at all good here, no job security, specially for Chennai location, management people are very rough."
bad,"Great job for seasonal and students who come home on school breaks. But not for people who have families and enjoy spending time at home with the family, The pay in okay but the drive is so far and they literally work you for every cent. If it makes sense or its too much like right, it will not happen in Amazon unless it benefits them. We already have short lunches but with all the walking we do, we do not get a full 15 minute break nor a full 30 minute lunch which I'm pretty sure is illegal and they can care less. Managers are very inappreciative... It makes you very tired everyday especially during peak where they extend the days but you still only get two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch which only feels like two 8 minute breaks and one 20 minute lunch and its ridiculous! Im just so over it!!!!"
bad,"Pick Manager, Outbound:"
bad,Poor management. Micromanagement. High turnover. Everyone for themselves. No team players. Really don't care about the employees they only care about production
bad,"At first, was lead to believe that I had an opportunity to advance into leadership.  Absolutely not the case.  When applying for promotion, they will only select one person.  They do not show fairness by interviewing a pool of applicants. Recently, a shift assistant was selected during peak.  They decided they didnt want to do it anymore and stepped down.  After peak. The same position was open and instead of giving the leadership role o someone who truly wanted it, they gave it back to the person who stepped down.  "
bad,"Man muss aber unbedingt den Standort beachten, da es gravierende Unterschiede gibt."
bad,"If you're fine with being complacent in life, this would be the job for you. The job is repetitive and tedious. The long 10 hour shifts are draining and boring. The 15 minute breaks aren't actually 15 minutes because you have such a long walk from your work area to you locker or break room that your breaks are only about 5 minutes."
bad,"Amazon is a very good organization and management/people are not good or employee friendly."
bad,"Working for Amazon is a fast paced, fairly high stress environment, with fairly good pay, some benefits and low chance at advancement. I took the job, attempting to rise to management... working from the bottom to the top with a bachelor's degree in Sports and Business. I worked as hard as I could, But was reprimanded for not working fast enough. packing or picking items with an hourly quota, made the job stressful. I finally found relief... if you could call it that, on the Dock; packing trucks to the brim, hour after hour for a 10 hour shift, straight with only short breaks.. there was no quota, but it was constant, physical work. It is a good job if you handle the workload, but the last I heard they took away stocks and other bonus for hourly employees. Take the experience for what it's worth."
bad,"They clearly want to burn you out and get you out of there within a 3 year period, before your physical problems  cause them workman compensation issues and other aliments that will happen in repetitive jobs like this. Highly competitive rates keep everyone at odds with each other not allowing a true team environment."
bad,"the job is good when you are on your 13 week probationary period "
bad,@ Amazon they don’t Care a Gnats doodah about personal all they care about is their end of shift work results if they have been met or not. If met there’s no thanks or gratitude shown but woh protect yourself if their targets aren’t met
bad,"I did not like working in Amazon, no work life balance, yes you will earn money , but that comes at a cost. If you can find decent job with good salary than go for it ."
bad,"This job was a good fast place to work in , very easy good schedule and weekly pay, the work never stops there is always something to do , the training is lacking a bit but overall it’s a good experience"
bad,It’s growing so big managers step all over each other trying to get to the next position. The Sr.’s pin the managers against each other who’s had a negative impact on the culture
bad,"unorganized. schedules go out late, bad neighborhoods for some deliveries. nice people though. "
bad,They treat their workers horribly. Would never recommend anyone to work at amazon. Culture is pretty bad. Extremely high turnover job. No incentive to work hard.
bad,Amazon only cared about the end results. Injures happened on a regular basis due to them wanting all packages delivered on the same day. Looked at you unfavorably when deliveries were not delivered
bad,"Very exhausting but gives an edge to having a job experience, management sucks at understanding associates they don’t have the interest of associates in heart. Amazon is cultureless and the hardest part is the unfair advantage to some people they’re racist"
bad,If you have a degree you'll get managers position. Management and young and childish. Interview is easy but if you apply for anything once you start your expected to have a hard interview. Good place if you bow down and kiss butt. Hard work on the body
bad,I was pregnant and had a lot of issues towards the end of my pregnancy and they did not care even with doctor notes and my doctor calling them. They never wanted to let me off when I had doctor emergencies.
bad,"When I first started Amazon when it first opened it was a great place to work, friendly and honest. As time went on you start to notice favouritism is rife! All different nationalities that only help they're own. Then some became leads then they spread into every department including management and HR not because they worked hard it's because of where they are from. Most of them ain't got a clue what they are doing or just lazy. If your British you will struggle to make anything of yourself there unless you kiss they're backside daily or flirt with supervisor/leads and managers. HR are useless most of them can't understand basic English and instead of helping associates they help the managers"
bad,Arrive at warehouse at agreed time block. Wait for unhappy Amazon employee to bring a rack of packages to deliver. Fill vehicle with packages. Drive to package drops using Amazon delivery app. This is for Amazon Logistics which can usually be illogical.
bad,"All they care about is rates and getting product out of building and to customers  "
bad,"Even when making rate they would yell at employees to go faster and go above rate, I was never introduces to my supervisor and only found out who he was when I got my new hire paperwork in the mail."
bad,"The employees at Amazon are great. However, the PA's and Operation managers are overworked and sometimes it shows in their treatment of the warehouse associates. HR is the worst they will not tell you anything until you ask, often suggest you quit instead of helping you."
bad,"Good temporary job.  Would not recommend as a long term job.  You get burned out quickly. "
bad,Management not very supportive and couldn’t get onto the Dora system they use. Not very people management. Very much work and if you are lucky you might have some social life.
bad,Die Vergütung klingt zwar im ersten Moment gut aber leider werden die Arbeitszeiten an großen Events wie Black Friday von 10:15 Beginn auf 7:45 Beginn gestellt.
bad,"supporting fulfillment employees and operations managers. warehousing environment, industrial relations, employee engagement mergers and acquisitions."
bad,"Plenty to learn, lots of smart people, and some really interesting challenges. "
bad,"I worked at the fulfillment center in Joliet and the work wasn’t hard it just not being able to sit and the management not caring about you if your sick or anything is in humane. And am care is worthless, it’s literally a joke and a wast of time to go."
bad,"They'll give you money to work but they will work you continuously."
bad,"Bad experience, cut hours, managers are selfish and dnt want to see you succeed  at all.  Flex schedule is an excuse not to give hours and block out too many from picking up shifts."
bad,"My time at Amazon was not enjoyable, I developed permanent damage to ankles due to being an picker. Company is far too much focused on hitting targets! When I was there last in 2014, i informed the organisation I could not do a job standing on my feet as my ankles were constantly swelling, and they did not want to know!! When I informed them I can know longer do this job and pressed them for a sit down position, example being an office job, I was informed there where none available!! It was either picking, packing or go!! Because of my feet constantly swelling, resulting in pain killing injections in around my ankle joint and both sets of heels!! Painful!!"
bad,I’ve been here a year and you would think they cared about their employees especially the ones that been there a while..I’m currently pregnant and no matter how many times I tell them I can’t do much lifting I still find myself lifting heavy things favoritism is really BIG here pretty much have to be up management butt and do a lot of dry snitching on other people to be a favorite.Hr never help with your problems and act like they don’t know what to do
bad,Lavoro notturno mensile sottopagato troppo raggiro di personale e poca prospettiva di carriera
bad,"Bad employer, no work life balance or welfare policies, management with no leadership skills and over worked employees, never suggest working for Amazon"
bad,"Most 20-29 year old people are working in ALL management levels while ALL older and real older people are working in heavey, extremly heavy labor positions many at 10 hour days. Amazon does not encourage bathroom breaks because they're so very far away from most stations So if anyone does go they will NOT be able to make quota goals OR TEAM quta goals, so your team will hate you and eventually you will be fired. So drink less water then dehydration happens esp.with no airconditioning! But actually Amazon does not care, because YOU ARE REPLACEABLE!!!  They DO NOT CARE HOW MUCH WORK EXPERIENCE YOU HAVE, they do not care how many years of supervisory experience you have EARNED...no-sir-ree!  The 20 year old, unseasoned, no actual job experience, no leadership experience, new college grad is going to be your boss,  tell you how fast you need to work and how you really should skip the bathroom because it effects productivity. So you should keep water to a minimum...and lunch breaks will NOT truely be your allotted time because you have to walk a mile just to get to your station and up 6 flights of stairs to make the afternoon meeting of group stretching. "
bad,"Ho svolto il ruolo di Driver (Corriere) Amazon in provincia sud di Roma. Il lavoro viene reso stressante dai dispatchers che ti chiamano di continuo perchè sei in ritardo nelle consegne non tenendo conto di quelle che possono essere le problematiche quotidiane (condizioni ambientali, traffico).  Si sono verificati casi di mobbing da parte dei datori di lavoro."
bad,"On floor things will be rosy , but your colleagues at your lever have to compete with each other so they will have all rosy pictures for their managers and super managers."
bad,Kündigung erfolgte innerhalb der Probezeit ohne vorherige Abmahnung oder Gespräch
bad,Hated this place ... you were just ferried back and forth like soldiers ... I could imagine prison being like that ... just not for me at all ... glad I left!
bad,They expect you to deliver faster than you possibly can in rural areas. They work in the dark and I is hard to find the addresses to deliver packages.
bad,The turnover rate is extremely high. They have no job security or respect for employees at all. Working for Amazon is like walking on egg shells there is absolutely no job guarantee at all.
bad,Amazon does not care if you have a family. They want you to work constantly all day. You get two 15 minute breaks and a half hour lunch. It is not easy work either. You are standing all day long and I don't think I have even seen a chair in there besides the break rooms.
bad,Severe disconnect between main office and workers on floor. Too many managers trying to get promoted and have forgotten the people who work for them. Serious mistrust issues rampant throughout the facility
bad,"If you are injured on the job, they do their best to not help. They will snatch up your puny amount of paid (PTO) and unpaid time (UPT), and force you into ""voluntarily resigning,"" so you may reapply there in 3 months' time frame. However what they don't tell you is that you are listed as ""terminated"" when this happens, regardless. HR department sucks and their ""MyLeave"" team is a complete joke."
bad,"Mala filosofía de empresa, muy competitiva y no se trabaja en equipo."
bad,"Allein schon die Werbung ist die Größe Lüge!"
bad,Worked 4.5 years there and never had any issues with projects handed down to me. I even created my own initiatives there and built some pretty cool tools. Never got promoted within those 5 years and never got feedback as to why.
bad,"Work colleagues that I worked with were great. "
bad,"I was actually pretty excited to work for Amazon. I looked forward to something fast-paced and a pretty decent schedule. Seasonal Fulfillment Center with no interview. Training is horrible because you're expendable. Other staff treats new employees terrible. I have no issue with the job, but everything else. Be prepared to walk A LOT. Breaks are a joke. 5 minutes out of 15 is gone just trying to get anywhere. Moral sucks and no one helps you. They're nasty to seasonal workers. Sure, they do cute things, but you have no clue what's going on and if you ask? You're treated like a child."
bad,"Amazon is not a place i would consider a career path. The benefits package is a joke to say the least. The pay is not equal to the long hours that are required. Management gets the higher pay rate, lower level managers that have no experience receive 60k a year while the actual people doing the work get paid below $14 an hour. Just remember that you are easily replaced and they have no problem or compassion for anyone that goes against the amazon ideal."
bad,"Management is terrible.  They only care about production and making the customers happy.  You get hurt, they want to give you an ice pack and then send you back to work in 10 minutes.  Will write you up and fire you over not hitting high goals even when production is low."
bad,"Delivery partners for amazon is the biggest trouble. They're renting a van to you, but when some one hits you, you left to pay thousands. Deductions deductions deductions. Managers are good till everything's well. Terrible place to work."
bad,No advancement opportunities.  Discrimination on race and age for advancement. Expectations high for management.  Staff shortage at management level. Not open to ideas. Did not follow their own principles especially at management level.
bad,"KeinProblem, kannst mal eben 6 Stunden ohne Pause durch arbeiten. Nervig ist auch die Arbeit am Samstag. Kommt noch im Weihnachtsgeschäft muss man 6 Tage arbeiten."
bad,"Sometimes only yard switching, sometimes driving.  Typical 4-10 hour days in a work week unless in peak season.  Managers know very little about the truck driving Industry, as it is new to Amazon.  Also, supervisors are all only there as a stepping stone for advancement, meaning they just don’t care about any drivers. They only care about their scores.   The pay was pretty low for the industry capping out at 18.65 / hr"
bad,"A great learning experience , good documentation practice. Good project management exposure. Less leadership direction, clarity and help . Great leadership principles to adept . Agility. Importance to quality and customer satisfaction."
bad,"The management bled money for amazon and the whole logistics and delivery department should do well with a complete efficiency assessment and subsequent overhaul. Frequently people were underpaid and overworked, stole ideas and claimed them as their own, and the health of the worker was never more important than the product being delivered. This is the least efficient warehouse I've ever worked in."
bad,They stated you would have a job I worked 70 hours a week but after 90 days they let you go then you lose your 401k that I paid into the job  so they stole my 500.00 I PD into I would not trust this company and since I was let go and I lost my 401k I have never bought anything from AMAZON!!
bad,"Is a really stressful job. You are on the go all the time. Overtime is mandatory, they offer you to go home when the work load is low. Work area is really far from restrooms and timeclocks, most of your time is wasted while you getting from place to place."
bad,I understand that we were hired for Seasonal or Temporary Assignment but some of us left other jobs to come to Amazon with the hope of a New Career Start. It's bad enough they didn't help us try and get on with any of the DSP and what's worse we can't collect any unemployment let along apply for it.
bad,"Worked there for almost 3 years. Impossible to advance if you don't have ""friends"" to help you getting a higher position. Constant stress about hitting the targets and overworking other people while the ""favorites"" are being put on indirect tasks so they can chill and talk. Took the offer and never looked back."
bad,Long hours !! Everyone is depressed. Strict about time always have to be working or you can get fired for time off task (tot). You have to come back from breaks and lunch or you can get in trouble for that.
bad,"At first, Amazon seems like the place where you'd want to work for the rest of your life. Everyone is so nice, the job is so easy, you feel welcomed and appreciated. THEN BOOM. Peak season hits. All of a sudden people are getting written up and fired or quitting left and right. Management doesn't care about anything but their numbers. Numbers and stats that have been proven to be out of the employee's control. You end up working 11 hour shifts, six days a week with hardly any time to recover from the intense physical stress put on your body, yet still expected to perform just as fast and hard for weeks on end. Moving up within the company is a joke. Favoritism and brown-nosing are the two priorities for upper management when it comes to promoting. It really sucks because Amazon does have potential to be an awesome company to work for, but they do not do anything about employee concerns and seem to forget that their employees are humans, not robots."
bad,"It's a job. I have a degree and there was no advancement in sight. Favoritism is used for all promotions no matter how hard you work. Ultimately, you're expendable and you know it. Don't expect your manager to provide praise as they only talk to you if you don't make rate. New hires every couple of weeks make it hard to work in a safe environment and to get to break"
bad,At first when Amazon Flex came to my city we more than enough work but as the months past they slowly stopped using flex drivers.  Then one day all the Flex jobs just disappeared and I found out it was because they found a better contract delivery service to deliver for them.  They did not bother to warn us at all.  Dont bother with Amazon Flex.
bad,"The pay is nice, the employment is always up, but you're not valued or listened to. They hound you to get off the clock unless they need to exploit you on heavy days. Speaking up about unfairness is met with passive aggressive retaliation. If you get hurt here, good luck."
bad,"Give employees more much deserved breaks. Be more considerate of workers being on their feet all day, add more perks for the hhardhardworkers on the team"
bad,"Working at Amazon overall is suited to the young. Very long periods of standing and repetitive motion for older people will cause muscle and quite severe joint pain. They pretend to care but overall, all they are concerned about is productivity."
bad,"whilst working there  you just get on with your job do your best but there are always one that  picks on you and think that they are in charge of you and telling what you got to do and how,they dont like agancy workers there,think they jealoius and envious off you ,was picked on and bullied a lot and not a nice place to work for,i would not reccomend any my friends to work there"
bad,Managers are poorly trained and don’t care about hard workers or people that go out of their way to help. They like to berate their employees and you will never be recognized for your hard work.
bad,"While the compensation is great on paper without a work life balance which you will not have, you will be working less than minimum wage. While big on ideas there are often consent changes without communication. Management choose favorites and often protects them from accountability."
bad,"I work at the DET2 location. No interest in developing any of their level 1 employees, you're treated like a number there. poor upper management......"
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"I had a lot of issues with management, and work/life balance. I was also working in AMZL which can be the reason why. If you want to have time with family and promotions that are fair then I wouldn't suggest this position for you."
bad,"Don't be a “stower” at the Amazon warehouses in Clear Brook, VA.  Training wasn't the best when starting and didn’t improve much the longer you stayed on. Once you learn the different jobs it's fine, but very repetitive. Write-ups were given out like candy with awful storage systems, rampant favoritism and malfunctioning scanners, to blame! You're basically there until you rack up 3 write ups, then you get fired, which is why there is a high turnover in employees. You are under constant pressure to perform at a high rate of speed to meet your quota. The quota is high, but obtainable, except during peak time, where there is no storage space available (we were at 102% capacity and received write ups and verbal warnings for not being able to stow merchandise), but you are still held to the same quota. Lots of management turnover, so the ""feel"" of the shift could vary quite a bit depending on who the manager or AM was. You know coming in that the days will be long, since you signed up for a ten hour shift.  IF YOU START THROUGH A TEMP AGENCY, I feel sorry for you since you will be treated as a second class/tolerable employee, and no matter what you due or how long you work your but-off, it is hard to go from a white badge (Temp personal) to a blue badge (Amazon personal).  Bye the way I was a blue badge but some of my coworkers were white badges, and they had a heck of a time with the same things that I didn't have to worry about."
bad,Decent wages and benefits but the production far outweighed the workers. we were treated like robots and this was not a very safe place to work. Lots of accidents and people hurting themselves.
bad,"I was promised at least 3 hours a day of work for my part time position. I was lucky to get 2.5 hours. Work was strenuous and I was really close to hurting myself through moving heavy packages on the receiving lines. Stretches were done at the beginning of every shift, but it wasn't enough. Management was extremely young and inexperienced and there was definite favoritism."
bad,"A choisir entre devenir un robot ou se faire lobotomisé le cerveau "
bad,"Cadence de production stressante"
bad,It's Amazon. Most people work there for the brand. It is not a great place to work. Lots of bureaucracy and people coming and going all the time. Including management.
bad,"For warehouse work, they will hire anyone who passes a drug test.  They do not even ask for work history.  So, the majority of people hired are people who don't really care.  They also hire in bulk...meaning they hire a group of people and hope that some stay employed.  Example...there were 17 in my group.  One got up and left during the first day of training, three didn't return the next day, and after about a month and a half, it was just me and one other person left."
bad,Eig gutes Geld aber nicht unter den Bedingungen 👎
bad,Bag management... you can do a good job for months but if you make 1 mistake or don't make rate 1 day they write you up or threaten to. That's terrible motivation
bad,"Il lavoro in se è piacevole e remunerativo (lavoro e paga adeguate), la pausa per il pranzo è troppo breve e non riesci a staccare in maniera adeguata. I problemi veri e propri nascono dai manager e dalle influenze che hanno alcuni dipendenti indeterminati su di loro. Ho assistito e conosciuto situazioni imbarazzanti. Gente con feedback negativi (tanti) che passavano come indeterminati solo perché erano parenti, fidanzati e amici intimi... meritocrazia zero. Puoi essere il migliore nel lavoro ma senza un legame con i superiori non riesci a emergere e vieni tagliato fuori con scuse banali. Vieni spiato nei social e se scrivi qualcosa che non rientra nelle loro ideologie diventi un marchiato. Ogni settimana c’è un pagellino che viene inviato a tutto il team dove ci sono i risultati settimanali di tutto il gruppo di lavoro rendendo pubblico il tuo operato in maniera degradante e accrescendo una inutile competizione che viola la privacy. Esiste un social network aziendale che se commetti un errore vieni sputtanato pubblicamente a tutti i dipendenti...Il bagno poi può essere utilizzato solo nelle pause programmate (ogni due ore) vengono inviate email dai manager dove si viene inviati a trattenere e non usare il bagno usando anche toni sarcastici e provocatori."
bad,"Amazon slave drives its associates. No one in the warehousing business can compete with their pay and benefits, and it gives them the freedom to do whatever they want."
bad,"As a temporary delivery associate don't expect much from working with Amazon. The cost of living in California is high, so the pay was not fair at all compared to the same job and pay in other states."
bad,"They took away paid time off among other things.. no pay raises!!!!!!!!"
bad,"They work their employees too hard, with expectations that less than half of the staff can meet. Advancement opportunity is based on seniority, not talent. Fair pay and benefits but it wasn't for me."
bad,I don't care for it much it's slow most of the time I live an hour away from work and on Mondays I have to drive for 2 hours cause of traffic the people takes way to long to respond back to my questions and needs
bad,Warehouse environment is harsh. Expect to be on your feet 12-13 hours a day normally and this can increase during peak season. Area manager role is very challenging
bad,"i would not recommend Amazon. there is nothing to say.  they don't care about there employees. they fire people faster then you could say hohoh. there health benefit. does support there works, plus they don't sick day. most of us had to work with the flu. so what else do you want to know."
bad,"Management is absolutely terrible."
bad,"The first 4 weeks are considered a learning curve for new hires.  I was told during orientation that nothing would be held against new hires because it's a learning curve.  I was written up for missing items, yet no one else who is in my new hire group was written up for their missing items.  Management seems to be real shady towards those that came from other major companies.  I refuse to answer management questions about the previous company that I worked for.  I've only been there a short time and already looking to move on."
bad,Working here is like being in high school. You have people talking bad about other people going to HR secretly telling on you all the time if they don't like you it's super ridiculous has nothing to do with the job you were hired for. Honestly if I were to know what I know now I would have never applied.
bad,"If you don’t like working 14+ hours a day, this job is not for you. I missed every Holiday with my family since I started with this company. Advancement for Minority’s is non existent, unless your the token. Compensation sounds good when your getting your offer, but don’t fall for the illusion. Only thing you can hope for is trying to survive your four years to get your stock payout and get out !!!!!"
bad,only 15.60$ per hour but the kind of job is like a robot super repetitive work and super tiring!!always working out worst than going to gym.sweating a lot!body aches always in pain!always have to lift more than 60 pounds!!
bad,"If you are looking for a place for good benefits then Amazon would be a great fit. However that would be the only reason to get a job there. Amazon is a giant revolving door of employees. Most last less than 6 months. Management is terrible. No communication and and time spent with Level 1 associates is minimum. Job advancement is almost a myth. Managers are constantly changing which brings in mostly inexperienced leadership which results in most work days being chaotic for no good reason. The hardest part of the job is making it through day to day without feeling like you're losing your soul. Get treated like you should be a robot, not a human being. Feels more like prison while you're there and then it does a work place."
bad,"Two days of class work, two days of ride alongs, then you get your own routes with van, work phone. Didn't learn much. Job is simple, pick up your vans, find your packages, load them, go deliver. 30 min lunch break (non paid), two 15 min breaks. Hardest part of job is not hitting the vans into anything on routes. Most enjoyable part is clocking out ."
bad,"No room for growth unless you really want to make Amazon a career."
bad,"I used to rave about working for this company. I really did love it! I worked for Amazon for over 3 years and in that time I watched it go from being a company with managers who cared to managers who didn't even know your name, you were basically a number to them. I worked from home doing customer service and went from being with a manager for over a year to being switched from team to team, from department to another department without any warning. Once they raised the pay from $10 an hour to $15 an hour, if you had a bad week on your stats or survey's you'd get a verbal warning...ONE week not several. It's like they're looking for ways to fire people. Your performance does not matter, it will not help you get promoted to another department or position, it's all about favoritism and who you know. It's a good stepping stone and it's convenient to work in your pj's but I wouldn't look at this being something to do long term"
bad,amazon works their employees to the bone with no real room for advancement and the management show clear favorites to certian employees. The human resource department employees are often very rude when asked to help with issues and very seldomly get anything resolved without having to go back multiple times. The only good thing i can say about working for Amazon is the pay rate and benefits are good
bad,"everything is great with managers if you are hitting your targets which are unrealistic, can be done but not easy. toilet breaks timed, with lunch break you must be leavin at a certain time and be back at a certain time otherwise you get put on an adapt which is basically a warning"
bad,"Quick paced work enviroment with lots of lifting, loading and scanning. Pay is way too low for the amount of work you do. This is a job i would only recommend if you needed a first time job for high school."
bad,not the best place temporary job for sure don't get stuck here. management is not considerate of entry level employees don't think its job stability  because turn over is drastic
bad,I've worked there for 2 and a half years and I've learn a lot. I didn't feel comfortable advancing my career once I found out how poorly management was treating regular associates. Workplace is demoralizing to come into. Mostly hire new associate and terminate veterans.
bad,"Management is bad, they just focus on the business side, don't care about engineers work. They fire people when they are new. Workplace is good though, there's many food trucks."
bad,I worked 70! hrs a week and was expected to fall in line with all Ops demands regardless of the impact on their associates!  Worst HR Job i have ever had! they still force rank all leaders and want to fire the bottom 10% every PM cycle!
bad,I liked the job but the culture was bad. Hardly there was any breakfast for the employee and the fun and work culture was absoulutely gone. They take the Frugal priniciple so much that somedays even lights were switched off to save money (not purposely but they used to go off once or twice in a week). Hardly any employee perks and all they want is work work and work.
bad,"the job itself is boring but great hours. most of the people in the warehouse are nice, theres a few that just seem to want to moan and blame our team for no reason one in particular that cursed us everyday, little bit miserable."
bad,"This was a work from home position so you did the training from home as well...*deep sigh* They were late sending me my equipment. The training was horrible! Most of the training modules did not work. I was just advanced without learning much. They throw you to the wolves once you're out of training. Thank goodness I'm a quick learner but it was ridiculous! I rarely had anyone to answer the many questions I had, keep in mind, I didn't learn much in training. You're hounded about your metrics/ performance. It's hard to wrap up calls quickly when you don't know what you're doing. Anytime you have a system issue, they automatically blame you. It can't be the equipment or their server, Ever! I feel that was the reason I wasn't offered a permanent position because they didn't send me the proper equipment and I was off work for 6 days. My manager was very hard to get ahold of. She'll send out company emails but wouldn't answer any questions... I really felt on my own.  I did the best I could with what they gave me. A company of this caliber should be more organized. I was not the only person that had the system issues that were going on. Lastly, IT department... USELESS! They'll troubleshoot (ask you too reboot) and ship new equipment... When you were off because of this, you didn't get paid! My manager told me that I was eligible for rehire... Really? Lol!"
bad,Alot of stress no hopes to be promoted. Hard work gets u no where. They said it will be fun but all they care about is money. Manger's don't care about u
bad,"Your rate depends on who your manager is and if they like you. Once you get pigeon holed the only way out is to quit or get fired. You go out because of stress, the ERC recommends a shrink who won't answer their phone. It's pass the buck till you fall off the cliff."
bad,"The place is a nightmare to work out, higher management have no people skills and are often from mexico or outside of the UK, people are punished for being legitimately ill (I witnessed someone physically vomit on site and he was given a final warning for not working and not being allowed to go home). "
bad,"Great experience working at scale but otherwise a gladiator school. Very political, management not leadership. Bar has not been raised--retail is C team at best."
bad,The managers favor certain employees and treat the rest like trash. They let the employees that are lazy and don’t work just stand around to talk. All the while the hardworking employees are constantly pushed and overworked to pick up the slack of others. No ones ever knows what’s going on. I hate how they don’t give you at least 1 day to notify you about mandatory overtime. Even HR favors people enough to over look reports on the person.
bad,This job is great for those who looking for part-time work if they are in school or looking for a second job.  The pay for full time starts at $15 if they're hiring full time.
bad,Managers tend to be kids straight out of college with little to no actual work force experience. I see a lack of connection between employer and employee and from that combined with the low wages builds a builds an overall aura of unease and discomfort. Minimal opportunity for advancement is presented to the tier 1s . Take this job if you need money but don't take it seriously  because they have no problem locking you out at any moment.
bad,Very bad pay no training no help at all the company makes u learn on your own you will never get support from anyone unles they’re ur buddie other wise ur on ur own
bad,U have 2 put away 2000 pieces A day regardless of Its sizes ..also u might have 2 put away big items and have no space..you still have 2 keep your rate .
bad,This job is extremely harsh on your body physically. The demand for output is high and the envirenent is stressful. The Managers do t really communicate very well and the turnover rate is astronomical.
bad,I love the people that work for Amazon but their Management and Human Resources Team sucks and some of the rules that Amazon really puts hard workers at a disadvantage especially if they commit one offense. Not given the opportunities to redeem themselves
bad,"maybe it's not all amazon buildings, but the one i worked at was such a god awful place, i will also blame this on me starting around peak. An average day at amazon will be walking through the parking lot which is about a 10 minute walk unless you like to get there about an hour early for parking and even then it's not a guarantee. you finally make it inside/ to the gates you have to find a spot to put your stuff unless you're lucky enough to have a locker ( most new employees wont and it sucked) after that you usually wander over to the employee break room which i will say is actually nice(you can get a lot of good stuff in there but it is on the kinda expensive side) then as it gets closer you will usually follow the heard of people who just like you,were waiting for VTO but didn't get it( just in case you do decide to work there VTO is basically unpaid time off because they had to many people show up that day and they usually give it out about 30 minutes before your shift starts which is great if you just really don't wanna be there). Usually everyone will hit up the vending machines to get gloves and other stuff then walk over the their area for stand up which is the last time you'll really be able to gather your thoughts before the soul crushing work starts, i don't know how it is in all sections but i worked in AFE, and there almost everything counted against you, you have a rate, which may not seem so bad at first, but almost anything can knock you down from a good rate. when you're new the rate you're supposed to hit isn't to bad, but say for instance there is a slow"
bad,"it would be ok if we could just go to work and work not have to be constant have to be worried about making rate. Working there has broken the body down, due to the fact that you have to over work the body in oder to meet the rate."
bad,"The ""factory"" is set up so that there is never a place to sit down. Ten hours  a day standing on concrete. Your break is 15 minutes, and it takes 5 minutes each way to get to the break room."
bad,I would some this up like this. When you prepare your self to enter the gates of hades bring a lot of ice. You know that you will learn a thing or two on how to deal with greed and how to move amongst people who share the outlook of getting money but really ask yourself what is Amazon's true mission: is it for the good of the people... or simply a hack that exploits capitalism's worst loopholes. BE PREPARED!
bad,"At least it is the case for my location, the managers have a hard time communicating.  I would be in a Safety position at this point if they had not talked behind my back and come up to me. Instead I hear that the other person gets the job soley cause some people felt I was poor at communication. How's my grammar? Not bad. So just take away that if you are a born leader and you feel that your hard work will pay off and you will get that advancement... don't hold your breathe, just find a different job with another company. "
bad,"- A lot of autonomy in strategy / making decisions"
bad,"This job is exhausting and people who work here deserve at least $17/hr. "
bad,"Not much to say, n/a "
bad,Pay was Good but working during holiday months provided a manic work environment. The management teem seamed to do there best but as I was there as a seasonal employee I was starting with over 400 new employees. Overall good seasonal job.
bad,"Long hours without end, a culture of finding who is guilty for errors in the processes that can´t be justified to the client by managers, who are also so pressured that they pay no attention to their teams. Generally overstretched staff in the JLL account and a culture of endless emails with long chains and far too many people in copy.  No team spirit at all."
bad,"No work life balance, especially for managers. Management is not appreciated whatsoever. zero mentorship or guidance from your leadership team.16 hour days, 4 days a week, on your feet the entire time with no breaks."
bad,"Ambiente caotico e mal organizzato, spesso maleodorante questo perchè la politica amazon è di assumere CHIUNQUE possa fargli comodo e lavorare da schiavo senza lamentarsi.Non parlo di discriminazione, ma dell'igiene personale di molti lavoratori stranieri.  Consentono l'ingresso a tipi loschi, e infatti si sono verificati numerosi casi di furti.  Quelli di magazzino sono stati puniti, i furti invece negli armadietti del personale IGNORATI. Nessuna tutela. Contrariamente a quanto si dice NON è affatto un azienda meritocratica, anzi, fa strada non chi si fa in 4 piuttosto chi è simpatico carino e disponibile. In breve, sei solo una login da utilizzare nei periodi di picco"
bad,"Poor communication amongst staff members; try to critique an associate who works for you and you will be disciplined.  Lots of favoritism for certain religions and cultures from days off, to special rooms.  Bathrooms were filthy.  HR function is poor at best and they are as afraid of the associates as everyone else.  We had people from corporate walking through the aisles countng how often managers said ""hi"" to their associates.  Told management they needed to learn some of the words in other languages.  Had to send a report to upper management each day outlining what you said and how you ""engaged"" associates.  No advancement opportunity unless you were of a particular culture (lots of people who were promoted not based on merit but based on their religion or country of origin."
bad,This is not a good company to work for more than 3 years. After three years there is a cap on the hourly raise. The management is poor and very unprofessional.
bad,"No matter how you explain the issues with Amazon, they will not listen to anything other than basic requests (coffee machine, cleaning supplies needed, etc.). Bigger issues that affect the workers and their ability to do their work on time are never addressed and updates and other new policies always make it harder. Repeated trips to the same location when one could have saved time and energy, passing locations that you will need to turn around repeatedly to go back to numerous times a day will always be the norm. A terrible navigation system that can't find streets, or properties and lumps many stops together even if they are nowhere near each other."
bad,Typical day started with clicking in and going over how bad the warehouse inventory is then we stretch for about 2 minutes and the manager tells us to go look at the stations board for our jobs then we would all start clapping for some reason and then go to our stations. It was very unorganized and managers don't help they just walk around yelling or on their phone.
bad,"Mgmt sets impossible goals, refuses to to repair faulty eqpt., does not even attempt to communicate, does NOTHING to resolve problems or remove barriers, exhibits obvious favoritism. MDW2 is a haven for liars. Little of what mgmt states is true. They have removed ALL incentives. They DO NOT know anything about the jobs we actually do. They expect employees to cross train in all depts with NO pay increase. Unsafe acts are encouraged daily to achieve ""their numbers"". Very high stress level for the meager wage they offer. I actually feel relieved to be terminated after a false report by 3 of their favorites."
bad,poor management with not much sense of directing a team accurate. You will find it very difficult knowing what is to be expected from you unless you do your research on the company to which it treats employees as numbers nothing else
bad,"I was a stower- my scan gun didn't beep enough for them."
bad,"I would work the night shift. Oversee yard health, what the other shift hand off was and needs to go in/out of the building. The weather was the most difficult part. Horrible management."
bad,Management  HIGHLY POOR in every aspect it cost nothing to be respectful to anyone in life . The advancement is terrible I’ve worked there for 2 years
bad,Prepare to transform in a robot when working here. They bleed every sweat out of you. No proper storage for your items. Your coats will be hanged amongst everyone else which not hygienic.
bad,"Takes literally 10-15 minutes to go for the first break depending what floor you are in, if you are in 2-4th floor they will send you to first break 5 minutes later, which is meant to be 15 minutes but by the time you walk all the way to the main canteen the break has already finished. You can't sit and have a meal normally without rushing, especially if you are a smoker you don't have time to eat at all! By the time you wait in the queue to pay for you food, then get to your locker and get your personal belongings there is only 10 minutes left of your second break which is mean't to be 30 minutes, which is absolutely ridicilous! They always find a reason to start at you and send you to pick desk, managers are extremely rude and never listen to what you have to say! They only care about their orders, one of the managers had said to me there is 5 minutes walking time which is absolute nonsense otherwise I wouldn't have got 25 minutes late! If it's your second or third day, they expect you to know everything already. Also, one of the managers had fired me for no reason without any warnings or explanations as of what I have done. Tiring hours, Do not reccomend. Temporary position. People are awful and moody."
bad,"Poor communication between management and staff, Poor management overall often attempting to send people how due to hiring too many people and no planning of the workday by any form of team lead or management."
bad,The company draws you in with decent pay and ok benefits but you will definitely be overworked for 10 hours a day. They don't have sympathy for any hardship you may encounter.
bad,"Man bekommt gesagt , dass es keine Akkord Arbeit ist, "
bad,felt like they pushed the employees too much for what they wanted to pay. HR Team was never really any help and the managers were not very helpful when it came to problem solving in the warehouse
bad,"I was very disappointed, I expected a well organized environment with better pay. "
bad,"Amazon was the most difficult job I had to put up with.  The HR and the management there was not treating me right.  I had some trouble with the co-workers and was not fair how the problem by the HR was treated and overlooked.  "
bad,Amazon could be a decent place to work if the shifts were not so long and the quotas weren't so high. The work is not hard just tedious and fast-paced.
bad,"Like I said every bad thing you've likely heard by doing a 5 minute google search. They except you to be more efficient than the robots, and baring going through a check list of the bare minimum effort don't really give you any support to do the job. They'er only really better then working retail at Walmart by virtue of your not expect to help customers on top of your all but impossible quota.  "
bad,"E stata un esperienza di un mese nella quale ho imparato molte cose, pero con un ambiente di lavoro non tanto coordinato e con molte problematiche amministrative e di management, che uno non se le aspetterebbe da una tale azienda"
bad,They terminated me after going in the hospital. They allowed the point system to accrue and now they are investigating. Its taking them weeks for something they did. Management is a joke and HR is elusive. no job security or decent opportunity to advance.I felt like an invisible employee.
bad,"Always Changing, Depends Who Your talking to that Day, Write Ups, All the Time !!! They Fired Me said for Sexual Harassment. Don;t know who I harassed or when. They Never told Me. Or Showed Me ??? Just Suspended Me. And then let Me go. Not even a Fare talk or warning."
bad,"Amazon account health team has the potential to be one of the most diverse and enjoyable experiences and your Amazon career. Just a few caveat you must understand about the department and the way things work. The managers make a strong effort to be inclusive to most specialty groups (LGTBQ, Women, elderly, Hispanic)groups. But one specific group has been constantly Passed over for promotions and special type of projects that would lead to aforementioned promotions. And I personally heard several people be told by management oh I forgot that you worked for the company in their meeting to talk about promotions. Amazon warehouse positions and managers are leaps and bounds better than the corporate offices when were talking about equality across the board inclusiveness across-the-board and everybody's work being the main factor that gives you a leg up on promotions and advancement."
bad,"This might only apply to the Denver, Colorado Flex delivery but getting schedule for a shift is a nightmare. Because everyone keeps waiting for time blocks to show up and just keeps tapping on their phones in hopes of being the first to get the block and pickup location they want. For me that was too much I have other things to do than stare at my smartphone 24/7."
bad,"They treat workers like machines. Very little flexibility, even when a massive snow storm made it difficult to get to work on time.  High turnover.  It's easy to get fired."
bad,"Well i worked at amazon in one of there new buildings in mountainhouse.I quickly became a star employee there but that wasn't enough to move up the ranks.What im basically saying is hard work didn't pay off and people that was moving up alot of them was lazy or the interviewer just liked the person for some reason,even if he had the skills or not and i think that's bad for business.At my time there i seen alot of my co-workers including me passed up because a new employee that the manager or the pa knew and they use that leverage to get there friends to the next level even if they couldn't handle the entry level position.I actually liked working there and i just couldn't take that anymore so i left.Also the HR and the managers all work together.Nobody has your back as an associate if you would've seen the work i put in there an honest person would have help me reach my goal of becoming manager.I would do wonderful things there because im a peoples person and im willing to teach.Also i was the first ambassador of that building.I trained over 40 employees in a few months time."
bad,The culture at Amazon is that of every man for themselves. There is no team and you are graded harshly even on things far out of your control. Very cut throat. The managers will lie to you about indirect jobs and there is a lot of favoritism. There is limited room for advancement and for most people none at all. The job has a high turnover rate and you are considered a seasoned veteran if you can keep your job for 2 years or past  their peak.
bad,"Amazon is great on the consumer end but working there you endure just work, work, work breaks are too short that goes for lunch to and when i worked there pay was trash for how much was being done my whole team could beat every floor at picking in the little competitions or in general and still 11.25 till you reach a certain time there plus those 4 days you work feel like they won’t end because of how long the day is there"
bad,"I am still employed there not sure for how long. They are constantly on you about your rate. They come to several times a week, & if your fast enough they write you up. They never praise you their always telling to work faster. They time you for how long it takes to get your cart loaded, on your breaks etc. You do get to pick your own hours but their always changing the shifts & the shifts are not the hours you want, & you pick the shift 2 weeks out. I would only recommend this job for someone young. Not the ideal job for an older person"
bad,Management has no understanding and you will get to talked to about things that aren't even your fault. There is hardly any hours in the facilities right now.
bad,"I was forced to sign things I didn't understand, there was a pallet about to fall on me and before it did I tried to fix it and was yelled at for my conveyer light being on. I was tired and sick one day and needed the money and had to stand at a cross section of a line in one place for 5 hours and i leaned on the rolling line for suport real quick and one of the managers noticed yelled at me asked why I was leaning on it I told them I was sick and threatened to send me home with no pay. Continued to yell at me about her grandmother dying."
bad,"Pay is good but working conditions and environment is terrible. Very noisy so much so they give you ear plugs, canteen is so far away once queued up no time left to eat. You are constantly monitored on performance"
bad,"I worked at Amazon and they give you a set schedule for about the first 2-3 weeks before they cut that off, and you pick up your own schedules. While that may sound ideal, setting your own schedule, there was a constant shortage of hours, so that didnt quite work out for me personally. This was not a full time job and it fluctuates frequently. Some managers are really nice but some kind of treat you like a number so its kind of 50/50 there. I wouldn't personally go back to working there but if your just looking for some extra hours, then i might recommend it to those kind of people."
bad,"We had a manager come in straight from college instead of promoting someone who knew the job. Gave little warning to an entire warehouse change, going from an inventory warehouse to a customer returns one. Rate changed on an almost monthly basis, all time was recorded - if you took more than ten minutes between scans your managers would get notified, the warehouse had two water fountains for the entire warehouse, and it was a big one. Parking was hard, and during the holidays it was a full mess with hundreds of temps, six days straight of 10+ hours, and police ""directing"" traffic into and out of the warehouse. The warehouse was also filthy, everything was covered in dust."
bad,"I would never work at Amazon again,because the General Manager don't care about if you have back problems or don't care if you done hurt yourself on the job.They will tell you to go home without pay."
bad,"The title says it all. The company gives out great benefits to it's employees but makes up for it by paying less than any big name company out there. For my area, living wage was $14.75/hr. We were paid $11/hr"
bad,"You do as your told, with no music, can't talk to anyone, and your bathroom breaks are recorded. "
bad,"This is the most unfriendliest place I have worked at. Most of the people act like they are better than everyone and don't respect anyone at all, especially the security who treat you like you did something wrong all the time and are downright rude to you when you try and show them what is in your pockets and yell at you even when you don't deserve it. The managers don't seem very helpful and don't make you feel like you can go to them when you have a problem or concern."
bad,"Étant déjà venu une première fois et tout cnetair bien. Passer j'ai. Voulu y retourner car j'avais aimais mais ma deuxième expérience était la pire, tout avais changé, le management, les exigences, les condition de travail..."
bad,Management were cool. Hated having timed breaks/ it would be better if they were a bit longer since you are there for 10 plus hours a day. Hated having time off task if you were having a rough day it was held against you. Minimal incentive to perform better. Rewards for doing better weren't enough to be motivational.
bad,-A typical day of work includes lots of receiving and physical demanding activities. Management are just new and work process needs to be adjusted properly. Environment is friendly with multi-culture. I guess the hardest part of job is the long hours per shift and most enjoyable is the rewarding 3 days off (if applicable) with medium benefits offered.
bad,"When I first got the job, I was really excited to start working. I had really high hopes for Amazon. As I started working it was nothing like I had anticipated. The hours were fixed and I was unable to work around them. Also, the training was very confusing and super fast. There were many policies to learn in such a short period of time. I worked out of Washington State. Going into the New Year the minimum wage went up to $11 and Amazon did not seem to like that at all. I got a letter saying that my assignment was ending, which coincidentally was after minimum wage went up. They seem to not want to pay their workers a fair wage, especially since the job is difficult to do."
bad,Amazon has good benefits but the hours are long and you have a new manager every couple of months. It's so hard to keep track of who's your manager. Working 11-hour shifts takes a toll on your body. You have to meet the rate of 100% or you get written up. After 3 write-ups they fire you. This job is very fast paced and is not for the faint of heart.
bad,Amazon could use some fine tuning at ATL6.  They have some of the worst process assistants which need help with how to approach respect and motivate employees.  There are way to many employees which causes flex down only allowing you to work 3 hours for the day which happens a lot so many weeks you can be at 15 total hours of work for five days.  You definitely need to be part of the “favored” group in order to be trained to do something besides scanning.  A vast majority of “favored” employees don’t go to were they are assigned on the daily roster which significantly contributes to preventing cross training.  There is a culture that requires a scan rate above 130 and this culture teaches you can do it but you need to grab a lot of “jiffies”.  This often leave the majority of the large packages untouched and the process assistants will come to male employees telling them to pick up large packages;  it would be better if computer scan rate were changed to factor larger or heavier packages as more than one item in the caculations.
bad,Amazon might be the best seller in good and such. But as for a company to work for oh dear that's a whole other thing entirely. Just need to see the whole articles about Amazon and television reviews. Those say it all to be honest.
bad,"You would think that a company with this kind of money and growth would be like working with a Google.com, think again. Every working day something went worse. Money decent, hours horrible. Does not matter the position you work, it will not be consistent work-flow. Upper management, or those who never stepped foot in facility make frequent, unwarranted changes that don't seem to benefit customer, AMZN, or DSP staff."
bad,"Management seems to have no idea what's going on and picks on specific people, while letting others get away with anything they want. Culture is awful."
bad,Culture is very unique with an expectation to work between 50-80 hours a week depending on the season. Amazon insists on the highest of standards and requires you to adhere to them.
bad,A really fast pace. To work with in the warehouse in Amazon meet new people good hard worker s in Amazon  great manager Brent .l learn allot good things
bad,"Poor work life balance due to incompetent workflow."
bad,"I was okay when I first started,  they have some of the best training.  I worked in receiving as a warehouse associate, was trained on damages, and problem solving and became one of their best problem solvers on the shift but was promoted to a processing assistant after a second go round because when I bid on the job the first time I was never told if I got it or not, or why I didn't get it.   Got promoted after the second go around but it was only a dollar raise so $12 for solving receiving problems,  auditing, and handing damages which wasn't really worth it.   My supervisor was okay but I was not happy that he tried to get a person that I trained to problem solve promoted before me when we applied at the same time and i was the one she came to when she couldn't solve a receiving problem, yet I was the fastest most effective problem solver.  And if they needed another problem solver in any other area, i was the one that sent because they knew i would do the job right. I felt like there was some racism with that."
bad,"Even though I was hired for a 7:30 am - 5:00 PM shift, after my first day orientation, I was told that the only thing that they had was 6:30 pm - 5:00 am available. Please make sure that if you can't work the hours that they want, it may not be worth the time and effort!"
bad,work was hard and when you go on brake they would count your walk time to the break room. manager suck never could find him when i needed help. however he always found me if they had a problem by stating it in front of everyone.
bad,You have to account for all your time while on the clock.  If you use the restroom it's time off task.  The bad thing is that you can leave early using unpaid time off. The workload increases because there's less people for the workload.
bad,"it was not a bad as a job but management was not the best, A really big improvement needs to be taking place specially with third party companies working for Amazon."
bad,"Management does not seem concerned with a relationship with workers. Mostly focuses on productivity & discipline. Although highly important, not experienced with the fact that all areas of management is important,not just a few. Usually the case when companies hire from within. Having a Bachelors degree gives one the ability to use more than just long time with a company as your only experience in management. The other attributes a layman person would not be able to apply. Longtime workers do add loyalty and care for the company, but when dealing with co workers, can only apply job functions and rules, not much else. A manager with a Bachelors degree brings more to the table ."
bad,Expected to pack 75 items per hour and restroom trips will negatively affect production.  Equipment failure counts against your production.  Employees experience physical injuries due to repetitive physical work.
bad,"While I personally was able to exceed expectations during my time at Amazon, what they demand versus what they pay is entirely unreasonable to the average person. This company is not friendly towards those with disabilities, and leaves no room for those who simply want to come to work and get through a normal day. With a packing rate expectation of 60 packages an hour, only those who are physically advanced can achieve or exceed that hourly rate. For what they demand, they should be paying their employees at least $15.00/h. "
bad,"Great place to work if you are desperate. Not enough pay for the work and time you are REQUIRED to put in. It is slave-work for the avg. person. You'd better be in great shape, this job will drain your mind, body, and soul. it is very lonely in a warehouse full of people you aren't allowed to talk or have music."
bad,"Amazon is by nature a fast paced environment. It's not for everyone. You have an hourly ""stow"" rate to adhere to. However, other factors can effect your rate. Such as the pace at which the packages come your way They can come slower than usual (because the people unloading are going at a slow rate) or it can come rapidly (the manager might decide to flood the belts with packages in order to get the truck unloaded and move onto the next). Management is fully aware of this. They have to meet their goals, and if it's at the associates expense...so be it."
bad,It was very stressful and I wasn't allowed to get water before trucks had to be loaded and I almost passed out twice on the floor and had to go to Amcare.
bad,Working environment is typical for a warehouse setting. The management is knowledgeable of their role and is willing to assist you.The hardest part of the job is making sure you are working at a steady pace to complete daily production.
bad,"They treat their employees like we are robots"
bad,"I actually loved working in the warehouse. I worked 4 days and had 3 days off. I worked for almost 1 year, but Amazon decided to cut everyones hours, and I was unable to make that adjustment due to living expenses. The managers on site were nice, but they had to always answer to corporate. While I always hit my nightly goal, many good employees were let go or written up for not reaching their nightly quota. While the managers were concerned with their employees, the actual company is not and is all about numbers. You are a peon."
bad,"I learned that Amazon isn't all it seems to be."
bad,"I have worked for Amazon.com for over 8 years and they are lacking career advancement opportunities! Also they seem to be in desperate need of constant employees as the turnover rate is terrible. This is due to the harsh working conditions, low morale and lack of career advancement!"
bad,"The good things are: you are working with smart people, you get pay really well, you learn an abundance if you are fresh out of college, and sometimes solve cool problems."
bad,"Not sure what the responsibilities of my managers were. Write word docs? Collect reviews? Either way, we would have been just find without him. Also their mentorship program is worthless."
bad,"Due to the high amount of people coming in and out alongside the constantly changing staff, it was horribly managed. No one had a dedicated role and would go randomly around trying to figure out what to do."
bad,"It depends on your site, but if you choose operations at Amazon's fulfillment centers, pray you get a decent Sr. Manager and GM. Otherwise you will be miserable, your health will fade and you will be blindsided with unattainable improvement plans."
bad,"over worked and not flexible with my health problems which it only made worse, was forced to clock in and out for bathroom times due to chrons and was penelized with my rate for having bad stomach days"
bad,Your  are overworked and treated like  easily replaceable and altogether under appreciated for your work But the pay is nice I give you the chance to work as much as you need to today if you need to pay something off or do something to get money it is very helpful
bad,"It's a job. That is the only good thing I can say. Middle management is kids out of college who just don't know what they are doing yet. The company lies to associates and is constantly changing the work specifics. It gets confusing. The evaluation process is horrid. There is a lot of machine and technical malfunctions that can affect individual performance. But if you can't prove it, you will be written up or fired. That's a heavy, stressful fact of life there. All of the jobs are physically abusing. 10-12 hours pounding on a concrete floor; up and down flights of stairs, high noise level because of surrounding machinery. There is a broad distrust of all management. Fake appreciation from management who, in all honesty, just don't get it and are frankly paid too much. Loyalty is not rewarded. It's always ""Day One,"" which is exactly the problem. Doesn't matter if you have been loyal, worked hard and even achieved well in the past. What matters is what happened today. Having a bad day there will cost you your job. I can't think of any time I joyfully came to work. It was just a job. Not a place to stay long at all. It busts your spirit and wreaks your body."
bad,My manager was away on leave and I got written up and fired because she didnt communicate with my current manager.  There also was no way to deal with outages the company had.  pay rate was very low as well.
bad,"Like most tech companies, it's very secretive. However, most workdays require you to be out at job sites with little to no interaction between coworkers and less with your clients. That alone, wears on you very quickly. You use your own vehicle and equipment, and the reimbursements are poor. Benefits and compensation packages are subpar for a company of this size."
bad,"I would not recommend to anyone seeking for an opportunity for career advancement.  I have my degree and started for this company anticipating room for growth and opportunity. Even if you work hard and set yourself apart as an incredible employee, it almost always goes unnoticed. Excellent employees are left carrying less motivated individuals with no compensation for their work ethic. The whole warehouse suffers due to certain individuals not being held to a higher standard. Because of this, no one other than area managers make a reasonable amount of money."
bad,"Over worked no bonus schemes and no time off allowed. "
bad,"Working at Amazon was one of the most aggravating experiences I have ever had.  The breaks were too short(they say 15 mins but Its 10), and its not worth it money wise. Unless you're getting a salary based pay working as a FC associate is making the bare minimum for the amount of work you do. It is also very dull and boring (unless you like working alone most of the 12 hrs)because you're rated each second so they would advise you not to speak to anyone."
bad,"For a non management job, it's just that... a job. Mostly physical labor. Management involvement on the floor is superficial at best, giving face time but no follow through. Work environment is best described as ""high school like"". Advancement is more based on whether or not you're friends with your manager rather than work ethic and ability to perform your tasks."
bad,"While there are definitely some positives--great pay, endless creative freedom--the pace and relentless nature of the work will burn you out very quickly. I've witnessed multiple grown men crying as a result of the stress. Further, there is no real opportunity for formal training--even when you are completely new to a domain."
bad,The management there was not great. They didn't help me advance or invest time into me. Instead there were multiple cliques and if you weren't in one then you weren't worth their time. Probably the worst workplace culture I have been a part of.
bad,"Breaks are too short and the supervisors are what I would call ""monitors"". Very analytical process; run by people with computers. That is all I have to say, about this."
bad,I enjoyed my time at Amazon.I met a lot of good friends which I still talk to today.I learned how to work in a face paced warehouse enviornment. Amazon also pay their employees very well.
bad,"Overall pretty good but not my style of job or culture. It is made to seem like it is semi-fun and friendly. The managers are usually on your case about packing very fast. When injured managers may dismiss the case and not put in a report to get out of doing paper work.  Steady job, steady paycheck but you're a human robot and if you slow down you're fired"
bad,"Working 10 hour days, on your feet, lifting heavy items non-stop. That's a typical day at Amazon. The worst part is, you're timed on everything. Amazon doesn't care about the quality of your work, they care about your numbers. Meaning how fast you pack or unpack items. If you take a bathroom break, your numbers drop. If you don't pick an item and put it in a box in 9 seconds or less (no matter how big or heavy it is) your numbers drop. It's extremely frustrating and exhausting. Also, don't expect to last very long if you like to have any kind of social life outside of work. You'll be too pooped to do anything once your work day is over."
bad,"Amazon is a fast growing and innovative company. At Amazon, you will work hard, have fun at times, and make history. The biggest perk about working at Amazon is the compensation - good base pay, bonus, and RSUs. The biggest consideration you will have is a very poor work-life-balance. Be ready to work very, very, long hours (12+). Some of the Management team can be very abrasive."
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"the entire job was very stressful and fast-paced. management didn't care about you, just your numbers and if you didn't perform you got 'training' which was basically just the management telling you to scan faster and stop talking to any one on the lines."
bad,"The associates there were great, the main reason anybody stays. The turnover rate is about 20 days because of the insane workload and horrible management. The tiniest quality errors will get you right ups, and the management will not even try to learn your name knowing how quickly you will get fired and how expendable you are."
bad,"If you aren't into the rush, being monitored 100% of the time, managers asking why you need to go to the bathroom, mandatory overtime, and constantly being told that you have to hit ridiculous margins and make up for work that was messed up by another employee then this job is not for you. Most people quit due to health issues (stress, muscle damage, exhaustion, etc.) caused by the long hours in a hot and very stuffy warehouse, but if you make it through a year (most people don't make it past 3-6 months so that's why they are always hiring) of working there you get a share of stock and some college bonus. If you do plan on working here get hired after the whole Christmas holiday rush or at least a couple months before it because those mandatory 12 hr shifts back to back (if you aren't use to this kind of work) will hit you hard."
bad,"The hours are long, and it can be pretty intensive labour at times. The management can be nitpicky about how fast or slow you're working and they are constantly keeping tabs on your performace."
bad,Nice work environment. Training is typical for a company with poorly trained management.  This company does discriminate for age in selecting cross training.
bad,"It's decent if you know it's a basic labor job. It's frustrating though seeing others not work near as hard as yourself yet you're treated, viewed the same way. So it's not a very motivating environment."
bad,"Orientation was completely lacking.  The training is often brief and not well explained.  I was left asking numerous questions.  The lunar landing program that new hires must attend was not communicated well and the difference between personal time and UPT wasn't explained well.  The picking job is INCREDIBLY physical, and after a month of working there, my body still hadn't adjusted.  It is monotonous and exponentially boring.  Stowing isn't horrible, however, I would not recommend trying to meet quota.  Take all the time you need because equipment malfunctions happen CONSTANTLY, which leads you to be written up since you are only allowed 7 mistakes per every 1400 units stowed."
bad,"I was not allowed to choose my schedule and therefore had no balance of life and work. They chose an overnight schedule for me, on my husbands days off. I never saw my family. Never had time to do anything. Including sleep, or grocery shop."
bad,The pay was very good for the job especially the night shift. The job was not mentally demanding but very physical and often times our managers would deny us our breaks across a 12 hour shift. Health and safety are talked about often but not many measures are actually put in place to help enforce the discussions.
bad,its a job that is quick paced and the brakes are not really much even if you ask to go on the late brake managers are stricked you never get acknoledge'd for your hard work you do.
bad,"Everyone except the managers are idiots (that is the culture)."
bad,Working the shipping dock wasn't half bad. Work schedule started off okay. Never asked for cross training. Was told to do it or leave. Packing pace was too high. Good training but pace was too much for the 40 hours start I was moved to. Change in schedule was also no choice take it or leave. I was moved around but not given a chance to chose where I wanted to work. Others were.
bad,the place was too hot and noisy.  u had to stand up all of the time.  It is repetitious where certain parts of your boy hurts. some managers dont work with you and just want to write u up.  Its hard to get promoted
bad,"poor management team, and lack of training. Best part of the job is working my fellow co workers. Worked 4 10 hour days, with no over time given. Long days with only 2 10 minute breaks and 1 30 minute lunch"
bad,There is huge number of people working there there is standing work 2 week off 5 days working pick and drop facilities 9000+of + overtime + full secure place
bad,"Very fast paced, you are going to get in shape,or else lol. I was in the pick dept. The elite of amazon, probably the most  toughest dept. You are rated meaning you have to pick300 products per hour and when you go to the bathroom the clock does not stop"
bad,"When they say they have ""Health Benefits"" they mean they put an extra $9 on the end of each paycheck ""to help with medical costs"""
bad,will not keep you on after 3 month period no matter what you do promised oppertunitys and then get no were. never correctly paid and did not easily solve wage problems
bad,Environnement de travail assez agréable. Les employés sont super mais les colis sont parfois lourd et le travail est assez fatiguant.
bad,The hours are considerably long with only a very short lunch. The lack of management communication. There are friendly people. When needed help from onsite HR or higher up the lack of knowledge showed greatly
bad,"Workflow was fast paced which was fine but constant nagging from management about rates gets old quick. especially when you're a new hire. Overall, I would only recommend the company for part-time work."
bad,"Chaotic workplace. "
bad,A lot of work for not enough pay.  The y are very strict about staying on task. You work a lot of overtime hours.  The management know very little about the job and do not take advice from the people who are more educated about it.
bad,"Took away stepping stones to advance any further than entry"
bad,The job is great. The pay sucks. The managers are straight out of college and have no idea what they’re doing. Extremely difficult to advance from bottom up. No work/home balance.
bad,"Opening of new order process center (warehouse).  At the time, my immediate supervisors and management were new.  Some may have worked for Amazon previously, but, not in these positions.  My immediate supervisor had no Amazon experience.  Now, this was over 5 years ago, but hardly anyone ( even those with Amazon experience ) had a clue as to what was going on, or what was expected of them in starting up this new distribution center.  I personally  know of at least one person with 10 years Amazon experience who left after a year at this new facility because of upper management not having a clue.  And he moved here from Reno, NV for his position!!"
bad,"lots off people made redundant and then more people hired for agencies to go permanent options but then also made redundant because of performances , performance targets go up every month been four times since started. long hour shifts 10 hours with lunch brake only 45min as have to walk in lunch break to get to canteen so takes off lunch break."
bad,Job culture is not very comfortable. No time given to develop individuals. Consistently in firefighting/reactive mode. Very micro-managing management.
bad,Don't bother. It's a trap from day 1. There is no advancement. They hire people fresh off of an associates degree for anything over peon before hiring internally. Most of these people have never had a real job until Amazon and clearly don't have a clue what they're doing or how to interact with people as a manager.
bad,"The pay is low and i worked from home so anything happened where you couldn’t log on to their slow VPN it would be YOUR responsibility. I would have to cut my lunches and breaks short just to be on time logging into their system. I initially picked my shift then i was moved and they picked my shift for me which was different start and end times as well as days off which i did not like. Your retention depends on ONE question “did i solve your issue” and people would answer no for things outside of your control. It was a little lonely at times not being able to interact with coworkers unless it was messenger or in the team meetings over the phone. Some calls were weird, it’s okay for a temporary job but i wouldn’t see myself doing it permanently."
bad,"When you get a bad manager, and there are many, life is awful.  Everything at Amazon is top down, so bad leaders will block all work and suck out your soul."
bad,They care more about the the production than the employees. Employees are under appreciated. Constant increase in production rates. Also management is usually unavailable for your questions. If you have no time left to cover a date that you need off then you can't take the day off or you will be terminated.
bad,Picking pendant 12 heures préparer des commandes dans un très grand entrepot.
bad,If you are on restrictions they still write you up for not making rate. Rate is hard to make because you are on foot all day picking and  have to get from one end to the other in less then a minute. Amazon doesn't pay well for the amount of work that you have to do.
bad,Other warehouses have better pay for fork lift driver's. They hire using temp staff usely which is no problem but not much pay is offered even as a full time staff.
bad,"There is no culture for the mules, only management on up. The employees are over worked for a measly 17.00hr. There are to many things to say bad, rather you experience it on your own. Its a job, that will suck the life out of you. Example,,,it takes you four minutes to walk to the cafeteria, you get thirty minutes to eat, but remember you gotta get back to ur station so another four minutes means you have a twenty two minute lunch before 3&1/2 more hours to next break."
bad,"Long hours, poor work/life balance, not a stable job, does not provide a living wage, everyone gets write ups, high turnover, place is run by unexperienced/recent collage graduates.  Its a set up to fail job with very flawed policies."
bad,"Low pay for job performance expectations.  Constant management turnover.  High turnover amongst employees, due to demanding work rate based review system.  Not enough staffing due to atendance policy of Voluntary Time Off in providing adequate number of employees during shift. Therefore you maybe required to the work of two individuals because management seeks to reduce labor costs by having the least number of empolyees during off peak times kf year.  No raises, even though the company has record profits.  Bonuses based on the total building making 105% of management productivity goal.  One department could fail to meet goal and no one would recieve bonus."
bad,"Wages were good but working hours were exhaustive and unnegotiable. Near-impossible targets, minimal break times and poor job security. Worst company I have ever worked for."
bad,"At first I liked working at Amazon for the first month, then they expected impossible production rates especially when you're a picker. Management was okay. I got sick and had to go on a medical leave due to cervical cancer. They terminated me, because I couldn't cover my days I was sick. I'm disappointed. If I apply now they won't rehire me."
bad,You have an unpaid hour break for seasonal positions. It isn't ideal for anyone who doesn't like downtime. Overtime is rarely as available as they describe and if it was available it was offered to all of the part-timers before full time
bad,"Overall, working at Amazon was fine. The job can be tedious and repetitive and the work can be very stressful at times.As an employee, you are expected to be on your feet for ten hours a day every day for four days a week. (More if mandatory overtime is called.) While physically draining at times, the work is not mentally difficult. The working conditions during the summer months, however can border on the inhumane. Temperatures in the warehouse can reach up to 99 degrees Fahrenheit (37.2 degrees Celsius)."
bad,"I really didn't think the management did there job very well there was a lot of communication breakdown."
bad,"Staff very unprofessional, there were lack of hours once the holidays were over which made it difficult. During peak season staff was very pleasant and there were plenty of hours plus overtime."
bad,They fired me for having the flu. They are not considerate of employees personal lives or the circumstances in which they have it. I am disappointed in my outcome with this company.
bad,Spending 6 years with solid experience did not effect them to promote me but to higher others and ask me to get them trained by me. It really made me feel stagnant.
bad,I was there when the company realized that they need to change their culture. Unfortunately our building was last to join the party. Terrible manager.
bad,"If you really, and I mean really need a job. Fine, come work here. Don't say I didn't warn you.  Yes, the benefits are nice and the co workers. But that's really it. You'll be working so hard thinking you're doing a good job but it's still not good enough.  Job security?? What's that? Not here. Right before your 2 year mark or before the holiday season, it's the purge for firing people. They just let go of someone today for quality. How can you get quality correct if they want a certain rate from you? Ridiculous. Look elsewhere, you'll thank me."
bad,"Je trouve que les manager de Amazon choisissaient les candidats potentiels pour passer en CDI, fallait juste être copain copain avec eux e,g boire le café ou fumer une cigarette "
bad,Amazon can be a fun place to work. Several job functions with package scanning being the most prominent. It is a fast paced job and every shift has a volume goal to achieve before end-of-shift declared.
bad,"Management claims advancement however when time comes for movement it does not exist."
bad,"Amazon is somewhat a good workplace, has great management and culture. However, their rates for expectations are extremely high and employers are forcibly driving their employees to increase productivity."
bad,"Amazon can be a good learning ground. There is a variety of businesses at Amazon to choose from and one can move in between teams easily. However, if one is caught in a bad team it can ruin ones career. Company is becoming middle management heavy and most middle management isn't great. Expect blame games, lack of visibility, unclear ownership, and lack of work-life balance."
bad,"Happy, fun at Peak season yet crazy busy, had fun with my team and enjoyed the things we accomplished. Liked My PAs the most...HR horrible and can be rude at times, they never had answers to any questions I had."
bad,The managers (especially Plant Mgr Collette) communicate badly. You don't know when breaks are of when shift ends. You have to rely on word of mouth. They had a ton of seasonal come in for holidays and also a lot of day on people left. Well then they tell us if you need to alter your schedule please put in request. Well 90% of request ps by Day one people were denied. I attempted to switch from Tuesday night off to Wednesday night off so I could attend classes. I was denied but seasonal people were hired in with Wednesday off. Collette is very moody and negative. The stories I could tell about her..... It's not a very fair place to work. Also they are bringing people in now at $1 less than in September.
bad,"standing on feet 10+hours"
bad,The management was horrible. they never took time out to see what problems was going on they was just quick to fire you for any giving reason no matter what it was. for Ex. The shuttle bus being Late may cause your termination.
bad,"DMI2:"
bad,"It has the poorest turnover rate I've ever seen. Lots of firing and quitting and lots of hiring as well. That is a sign to not work there. Typically the day starts with me clocking and going to the End of Line section to scan and stack boxes for 2 hours only to be relieved by a 15 minute break that starts as soon as the bell rings to send us to the break room. But with the warehouse being so large, half or more of the break time is spent walking to said room. The most enjoyable part of the job is clocking out, the hardest part of the job for me was bending over constantly to pick up boxes and stack them. Especially when the line you're at goes faster than usual and no one wants to come help you."
bad,Amazon is not a good place to work because the hours aren't the best. The management is also pretty bad . They would talk down to you like you were a child and stupid. There is barely any room for advancement even if they tell you different.
bad,"It's fine,it's hard work long hours. Work culture is rough and no room for advancement, it wasn't a great fit for me, very strict policy guide lines. It's great"
bad,"Tons of overtime, with very little work life balance. Management are driven by numbers blindly with out any perspective or meaning. Blame is constantly being shifted without any real knowledge of problems."
bad,"Si quieres durar en Amazón olvídate de trabajar mucho, cumplir, esforzarte y ser serio con tu trabajo. Gran error, te exprimirán al máximo y no durarás mucho. Para durar mucho tienes que hacerles mucho la pelota a los supervisors, a la gran mayoría de ellos les encanta y si eres mujer, más todavía. "
bad,if you don't mind having a life or like to get yelled at by managers that don't even know what they are doing there in the first place go ahead and apply. Do your research... the turn over for employment is very high. There is a reason why people don't last there. That's also including managers.
bad,"I’ve worked at amazon from the beginning of 2017 and just quit as of  12/27/17"
bad,"You get scheduled with 4 hour shifts that may flex up or down. During the regular part of the year you can only work up to 30 hours per week, but that's only if you flex up each shift."
bad,"Poor management, constant turnover. There is a reason they are constantly hiring/firing. Training is minimal and inconsistent. "
bad,"Worked out of the Amazon depot in Norwich (UK) as a driver."
bad,"Prefer manufacturing, too many lazy people are kept around and they slow down your job. Most of the men there care more about talking with the woman than they do about their jobs. The 3 min walk it takes to get to the lunch room is counted along with your breaks and lunches as well as the 3 minute walk back."
bad,"your crammed with a boat load of information about the job"
bad,"Working at Amazon was an unenjoyable experience all around. "
bad,"To much pressure on the employee to hit daily targets"
bad,"Work hard so management gets the glory and praise. no raise in 5 years. finally given a .25 raise. Favoritism, unfairness, 8 minute breaks, micromanaged, rate always increases, quantity of quality."
bad,"You can work at your own pace, but management is poor. They're constantly firing people while constantly hiring people. This job is great just to help pay bills, but I wouldn't recommend this being your main job."
bad,"One of worst jobs I ever had the turn over rate was disgusting management set you for failure I have nothing good to say about "
bad,Not worth the time. minimum pay with a lot of hours. Management really needs work. Be prepared to do the same thing everyday with slim chance of moving up or changing roles.
bad,"I worked as a fulfillment associate in the summer of 2017. folks have complaining about the breaks being a joke which I can somewhat agree to. I can tell you that this is the type of job where your feet will feel very sore, your legs will feel like they are going to collapse, and it can feel like a long day where time goes by slowly depending on what management assigns you; the day will go by very quick if you get assigned to picking."
bad,"Doing work for amazon.com for over 6 years now has caused a great deal of stress to my health as well as my body.  The environment is very unhealthy for people as many factors throughout the day can determine how long you are off your base task for, however you are given a verbal, or written warning anytime your off task is greater than 30 minutes in a day with no chance for explanation.  The amount of stress during their holiday ""peak"" season is also no joke.  mandatory 60 hour weeks for anywhere up to 5 weeks in a row.  You will also be sent to other departments you don't normally do and be told to try and keep up with the people that do it all year long."
bad,it takes one manager to completely ruin their team and that is what amazon is great at in whitestown. Issues rarely get resolved. If youre looking for quick easy money amazon is the place to be. You get sucked in by the extremely good benefits you forget a little how much you dreaded waking up and walking into that place.
bad,"Very stressful workplace, inexperienced managers and associates not properly trained to fulfill their tasks. Associates after first week if not doing well are able to be terminated and not retrained. The trainers inexperienced and most people learn as they go or they get left behind and terminated"
bad,"Managers do not have the skills to run a department,or effectively communicate with employees. there was no enjoyable part of the job because you were constantly moving and if caught taking a 30 second breather you were threaten with a write up."
bad,I hate it there currently seeking for a better opportunity . It’s very unorganized and they treat you like your less of an human. So I wouldn’t  really recommend anyone to work there unless it’s just for extra money
bad,"Working nights was good money and paid weekly. Affected my social life, the work was very boring, all the staff seemed down and depressed, management don't really seem to care."
bad,Can work toward a path.  But terrible top out pay. My building trains new managers right out of college. So obviously that means most have zero people skills.
bad,"If youre thinking about working for Amazon, think again. Specifically CVG2, you get told all kinds of good things before you start working, then you come to find out its all lies. you have no advancement opportunities,  the Management do nothing for you. you can be the best processor in the building and still get to Advancement or positive feedback from the management. the place is a joke plain and simple."
bad,"All calls are negative, lack of advancement, work culture is high stress, management only contacts you for negative feedback. Unable to get people to respond to emails sent for Did I Help You."
bad,"It was okay at first. It doesn't seem to hard, but overtime it gets harder and harder. They don't promote within that often. The job is extremely physically demanding. Bottom line, it is much harder than it looks and sounds."
bad,You come in and you have to make your rate everyday if you don't think you are fired after a certain amount of times missed. You have to stand for 10-11 hours a day and you get three breaks
bad,"Issues with paycheck, didn't get paid for 2 months. Wasnt going to continue for free. After 2weeks of no pay I started to question HR. They kept making excuses."
bad,"Pros-Coworkers are great to work with, HR people are very helpful."
bad,I took this job because I had bills to pay.  It was ok. There is not too much career advancement here.  it is a warehouse job and everyday you will feel like a warehouse employee.
bad,The company has poor management. They treat the workers just like numbers. Theres no job stability with this company. You can be fired for any and every little thing. Its ran like a prison for the most part. Very relaxed for management and support positions hr learning safety facilities it departments. But everyone else the actual workers are treated like numbers. Management put favorites in positions even if they're not capable of doing the job. And someone else is.
bad,Its a very fast paced place. I walked 15-20 miles a night. If you get sick they dont care they will just replace you. Its mainly for college kids to work. The turn over rate is unreal.
bad,"I worked at 2 different locations including one of the newer locations in Etna, OH and just recently for the one here in Phoenix. Etna's location was just lacking management that had no clue what they were doing. You also didn't get paid much to do the jobs I've done and most people at Amazon up in Ohio has to do on a daily basis. Now in Phoenix they have management but if you aren't perfect you're out the door. Also, the break times were really screwed up, saying that you got (2) 15 minute breaks and a 30 min break and you had to make sure you left on time and for back on time. Which means you got about 8 minutes of break."
bad,When I first start working there. It was the best place to work ever..... I love all the manager they treated you like someone.... Now I go in because its a job and I have kids at home... They do not look at how hard. And they do care about your safety....
bad,They want alot but dont show that its a big deal. Management was pushing to be fast and quick but would get mad about errors.and break time are horrible.
bad,Management does nothing but sits on their behind. Expect you to scan a certain ammount of packges and shoot threats about you being fired. The co workers were okay. Didnt have an issue. Ohh and its HOT
bad,I was only a seasonal employee but I don't even think anyone there knew my name. It was so repetitive but it was nice money. The days went by as slow as possible.
bad,I started in Nov. during peak season and it was very hectic. The longer i stayed the more i disliked it. they call mandatory overtime last min. the working conditions are inhumane. Standing and packing boxes for 10 hours a day is miserable. they don't allow music or cellphones in the building so your mind goes numb. It motivated me to look for a job I enjoyed because i was so miserable.
bad,"Amazon has a lot of oppertunity if you are the right person, the environment is closer to a high school. If you are the kind of person that was popular in high school and can hit the minimum rate requirements you will go far! "
bad,"You stop working for more than five minutes on the clock and you're out. The glass ceiling is already made aware to you on day one so with no promise of a promotion, the good ones leave first and all you're left are workers with no motivation."
bad,"Started in november as a temp, it provided me with income and was a 5 minute commute from where i lived, I would say it's okay for short term stay, i wouldnt say it's anywhere that offers security or many opportunities for advancement."
bad,Over all a great company but manager need a lot of training. People are not giving proper training. If you learn quickly you are moved from area to area to pick up the slack of other employees .
bad,"I joined Amazon because the benefits, pay and promise of advancement but soon realized most of what the company portrays is smoke and mirrors. The pay ($12 for third shift warehouse associate in NC) isn't really worth the draining, soulless tasks you are assigned. Management continually pushes for improvement and expects high numbers but doesn't give any useful incentives, high performers get ""swag bucks"" which you can use to purchase amazon memorabilia (how useful). The only real incentive is high performing warehouses get a monthly bonus but you must have good attendance to qualify for 8% of the bonus. The lunch is only 30 min and there are two 15 min breaks, one at the beginning of the shift and one at the end. For those working in universal receiving, there is a time limit you can spend not doing your job and those who constantly go over 7 mins will be talked to by management, however they don't realize it takes at least 5 min to walk to the bathroom. They speak of opportunities for improvement but this really entails working more hours a ""superficial"" position without a pay raise. It is possible to rank up but it honestly isn't worth the time and effort they ask. The most enjoyable part of the job is pay day, it is rather nice that they give you the opportunity to leave whenever you want so long as you have upt to cover it but overall what this company requires you to put in and what it puts out is NOT worth it. Please, please look elsewhere no matter how desperate you are. I am still working here but will jump ship the second a better offer comes my way."
bad,"It's pretty much like working at a sweat shop."
bad,"Long days ,Short Hours"
bad,"Amazon is a zombie town, they treat you like robots and expect you to run for 10 hours in within the time set between each item needed to be picked. good for extra cash however not long term!!!"
bad,Amazon is a short term opportunity. It is very hard to move up the ranks unless you know somebody. They will make you work harder and harder every day that you work for them. I have learned a lot of things such as having patience and working as a team member and a   leader. Management don't stand for what they want from you. They have there favorites that they prefer to be nice to all the time.
bad,Expect to much from un experienced and elderly workers on the second week of work. If you fail to meet rates after the first four days your subject to write ups and possibly termination
bad,Working for Amazon is an old fashioned concept that can have you unemployed in the drop of a hat. All employees are employed on a temporary basis with a very small opportunity of being made permanent. Daily targets are in most cases very difficult to meet and failure to do so will have your employment ended without notice.
bad,"it had it good points and bad, It felt like know mater how well you worked you really did not get recognized for it. And way to much favoritism its all about who you know"
bad,"It's a warehouse job where you are little more than a number to them. Management never does what they say they are going to do until, its pointed out to them or HR. When you need a manager they are hard to find they always seem to be in a meeting. They want you to help them improve the working conditions but when you give feed back nothing gets done or you are left feeling like you are getting targeted if you point out problems."
bad,"A typical day's work is unbalanced in my opinion. The workload is either slow or fast, no in between."
bad,"Amazon is a very numbers driven place. Management only cared about their numbers, they treated people like garbage. Coworkers were great but the environment was terrible. The workplace culture is suppose to be about customers but in reality they wanted through put more. Imagine working at a place where they want you to store 600 plus pallets a day but you only have space for maybe 50. That's stressful and very unreasonable. That is the hardest part of the job, dealing with management. I learned that Amazon is a very cheap company when it comes to their employees. The most enjoyable part of the day was clocking out and going home."
bad,working for amazon would be a great job if it didn't treat their employees like expendable pawns. overall working there matches my work style but I need permanent placement not temporary.
bad,Pay is ok but not compared to how much work you are required to perform. You are treated like another number.................................................
bad,"This company is not for everyone. If someone is driven by being a work-alcoholic, enjoys low pay, A LOT bending, and doing the same job everyday then... good for you! Enough said..."
bad,słabo ocena mierna złe zarzadzanie i nie fajna atmosfera
bad,was a great job if u like the city in like being around people for the time i was there i had a good time but just couldn't do it anylonger due to my foot
bad,"I signed up and was approved for the day shift, and without my consent I was switched to night shift. I had already left my old job when I was informed of this, and I was given no option to transfer back to my originally agreed upon shift. I had to accept that job because of my bills, and it had very adverse effects on my health."
bad,They love their customers but have no regards for their staff. The benefits and pay are great but your job isn't guaranteed from week to week. If you make it 3 months you're doing good!
bad,Long hours 50 hrs plus of work per week. Floor Associates can easily get your fired if you don't document well. HR will always take associates side over management. Very political when it comes to promotions. Be sure to make a lot of friends in upper management.
bad,When you come into Amazon they make a lot of promises and tell you what you want to hear. But within the first 6 months those things will change.  The job requires you to work 10 hr shifts which is not bad but you do not have a option to work 8 hrs you have to work 10 hrs four days a week.  When they require they will require you to work 10 to 12 hr shifts five days a week.  When your schedule changes and they require you to work overtime or a additional day they will give you less then 24 hrs notice and expect you to beable to adjust your schedule. In the beginning they say after you are there a year they encourage you to further your education and Amazon will help you and accomondate your schedule.  That will not happen they will cut your hours or they will tell you that they can't accomondate you and each site has there own say so.  Compensation hourly wage will be low and they will try to combine bonuses that you will not usually receive.  They will compare wages to local retail companies instead of warehouse jobs.  Advancement does not happen the only way you can advance is if your a buddy with the boss.  That is one issue with management they play favorites are they are just thrown in there positon and come around threatening to write you up or fire you.  The culture is good if you only look at the relationship you have with your co-workers.  But if you are looking for it as a whole the moral of Amazon is low and you feel like your in a prison and its all about what is in the best interest of the company and in there next breath there all about boosting moral.  At one
bad,"some of the things that i learned working with amazon are very hands on, but the management was not my best part about working there. The work was not at all challenging, and it was very stressful just standing in one place for 10 hours everyday."
bad,My experience was not great I can only say for my self there is little to no chance for advancement if u have a family u have to give a lot of time .no time for anything else money is dissent but you work your butt off for it.
bad,Amazon is a great place to work.  Excellent place for someone to launch their career.  If you are single and crazy about work then Amazon is a good pl
bad,Hard work does.not have any influence on you moving ahead. They pay for school and I took advantage of it and they offer to but you out for 5 grand to leave the company after graduatiom
bad,"The management here will throw you under the bus for anything, and they don't take the workers experience into consideration at all. Managers will come up with their own ideas about how they think things should work without ever having done that job process themselves, then write up anyone who speaks out against them."
bad,"The Amazon Fulfillment Center was a decent place to work at.  I had to either gather orders all day, sort boxes of incoming orders or load trucks for outgoing orders."
bad,"the harder you worked they wanted and hardly no good praise from the managers."
bad,"I enjoyed my actual job but the amount of overtime was a lot.  They would call mandatory overtime with very little notice.  They would tell you at lunch the day before.  During peak (holiday season) we worked 5 11hr days or 6 10hr days.  You were on you feet the ENTIRE day so having time off was very necessary to recover.  Management was hit or miss, policy was only followed when they wanted to.  I worked there a little over a year and I had 7 different managers.  Some quit some were fired and some transferred.  There was no consistency. Great benefits but pay could be a little better considering the demanding work."
bad,If you can't keep up with their constant changing productivity quotas you will most certainly be let go...NO JOB SECURITY WHATSOEVER.  Pay was decent.
bad,Lost weight good for your health high expectations o real chance for advancement. unreasonable expectations. hard to meet goals always changing minimum rates.
bad,"V Amazonu jsem pracoval z nouze, jako pracovník jste nahraditelný a pakliže není špička neostýchají se vás vyhodit za chvilkovou sníženou produktivitu, která už je tak nesmyslně vysoká bráno v potaz platové hodnocení a podmínky v porovnání s jinými zeměmi. Již jen při oznámení, že jsme nejvýkonnější neautomatizovaný sklad (s tím, že jiné sklady pod námi byli větší nebo automatizované taky) jsem nabyl myšlenek, že něco musí být špatně když se stále norma dodržovala. I přesto, že na české normy bylo platové ohodnocení poměrně vysoké, ukazuje to na jediné, buď se musí slevit na pracovních nárocích či zvednout peníze. Od té doby co tam nejsem jsem slyšel že se platy o 15 Kč/h zvedly i tak si myslím že se jedná o výsměch. Kdyby tam člověk svou práci dělal poctivě tak ji ani není možná stihnout (pokud chce i dodržovat zdravotní a bezpečnostní normy). Pro práci musíte být taky dostatečně hloupý aby jste se nechal uchlácholit vedením. Nejhorší ze všeho bylo pro mě jak degenerující práce byla, je to slušně placená otročina, ale stále otročina."
bad,While working at Amazon I experienced late checks and sometimes all of the money was not there. There is a lot of heavy lifting of packages in small vans that cause you to strain your back.
bad,"oftentimes it is hard to work for a huge corporation, they do not care how many people they have to hire and fire. Everyone is disposable, I would rather work where I have job security"
bad,"The overall experience was not great. Long hours, no time to do anything. My whole life was Amazon. The managers were terrible. They were very disrespectful and very rude."
bad,"A typical day at work was so stressful and brought on massive anxiety. This is a company that rules by fear. There is no job security and unless you are a manager you will get scrutinized for everything you do, They are a negative company that will only tell you what is bad and not what has been done well."
bad,"Good training and facility,good expereince,but poor system which hinders you to meet their targets,one hour you can pick 50 hours another hour you can pick 20 items due to congestion,one item in isle and change of duties in a day more than once which causes not to meet their targets."
bad,"They offer great benefits right off.  They give you a learning curve to pick and make rate; however, they accelerate it quickly and when you cannot make it, you get written up.  I requested that they place me with an employee that is making rate so I could see how they operate.  They advised that they would; however, that night I was written up again and terminated.  I was walking out and another person was walking out with me.  I asked him how long he had been there and he responded with which time.  This was his third time working for Amazon, and each time he had been terminated for not making rate.  They make it impossible to succeed."
bad,"Travail à la chaîne, peu de reconnaissance, peu de salaire. Des managers et un grand patron qui demandent d'être rentable très vite sans avoir eux mêmes pratiquer. Nous n'avons pas les mêmes responsabilités, mais de la reconnaissance et un salaire plus important ne serait pas de trop étant donné les bénéfices dégagés..."
bad,"Working at amazon you will either hate it or dislike it, you only given 40 hours contracts, harsh points system where even if you are sick you are given 1 point or half a point if you last two hours into your shift and then leave. If you rack up 6 points you are sacked. The warehouse I work at, have airport security who are very strict, you aren't allowed simple things like watches/smartwatches and if you accidentally bring them in, it gets escalated to management and most likely get points for this. The management aren't understanding and you are always treated like a robot and rates are the only time that matter to them. If you don't have a job and you applied for amazon its better than nothing but if you have something else lined up you may want to reconsider choosing amazon."
bad,daily you work to meet goals and targets.It is asif you are thrown into the ocean without prior knowledge on how to swim and tasked with surviving and swimming to the other side.
bad,"Management was a joke unless you were young and willing to be friends you did not move up in this company. Managers will warn their picks when they are due to be drug tested to save them yet terminate the people who work hard and show up every day for rate issues,"
bad,"the supervisor at the location in commerce was horrible and never their, and would people sign him in when he wasnt going to show."
bad,"Amazon.com was a place of previous employment for me. During my time there I was told on a daily basis that I was replaceable. I also, noticed that favoritism was a huge hinderance when a task needed to be completed. I did, however, learn practical protocols, safety procedures, and how the company operates. The management I felt was below competent and abused their power often, and because of poor management practices, the work culture suffered. When it came to job difficulty, my personal problem had to do with the distribution of work. For example, when it came to working the lines, workers who were the manager's favorites were given high priority jobs that would boost their rates. The consequences of this action would offset be the average scanners rate. Overall, the thing I enjoyed the most about Amazon.com was the people I met during my working shift."
bad,"Très physique, marcher + de 15 kilomètre par jours en étant en pick."

bad,Everyone there is a rat as it is part of their culture. Everyone is dispensible including management. Not a job for a career. They like training  newbees and loosing money in the process. Most of management do not have a clue and expect you to do their job and your own. They are only there to critique your performance. AMAZON IS A JOKE! Do not trust anyone! You would be better to stay to yourself but that is fround upon. Keep your back to the wall. Your just a number. Make quota or be fired. 1 month or 5 years they could care less.

bad,"""A glorified high school masquerading as an employer,"" is how I view them. "
bad,very poor management and unorganized work spaces made this job difficult and no human interaction during the shift made it even more unenjoyable  because i am a people person.
bad,I only did this job for the season and was trying to go full time with the company but they denied my application even though i when above and beyond for them. They use people to get the holidays done then get rid of them like yesterday's news. I dont recommend this place of work.
bad,"Kiss your work life balance goodbye. Working 14 hours a day is the norm here. Breaks are discouraged. Management is a top down blame game. Coworkers are helping you get through your day, if they are not too busy trying to out compete you."
bad,"Not the best place to work at far far from it. The work load expected for an individual to do daily is just too much. The break patterns are unfair as you have two 15mins break and one 30mins, but it takes you atleast 5mins to work to the canteen so you basically having two 5mins break. to be fair I can go on and on and on is just not a fun place to work."
bad,"Traveling was the big issue wasnt worth the money. Good long hours though kept you busy."
bad,"Management seems to be very new and unaccustomed to running a large business. Directions are often in conflict with other managers directions, "
bad,"Amazon is not a place for hard workers, simply because they don't honor you for your work ethics. They rather honor brown nosers before true hard workers. I know this because I been working there for over 3 years and I see this happen all the time. I'm a prime example!"
bad,"I worked at Amazon for a few months, as well as Integrity Staffing. For one, they are very unorganized. They provide very poor training but expect high rates with little errors. I only got trained for 5 hours on my first day and the other half of the shift I worked in the MOD. I got fired for productivity, which was due to poor training. I learned how to  perform my job better while I was on my final write up and getting retrained, however it was too late. I asked managers several times to move me so I wouldn't lose my job but nobody seemed to care. I worked there for 2 months and got fired. Managers were very rude to me as well. One manager told me if I didn't speed it up I was going to get terminated. I really didn't enjoy my time at Amazon, I feel like they didn't give me a chance."
bad,"Working for the company four years, Cvg3, I had a good time in the beginning. Moved around learned different tasks....but was not able to move in the field that I wanted too. Trying to find ways to move on then resulted with me leaving the company. The only thing I can say is if your a hard worker, you will be annoyed with the company or just management in the building. Amazon has great perks but those perks become nothing in your field you try to advance in. Just be careful and watch yourself. Give a company two years or become miserable. 10 hour shifts sun thru weds, weds thru say or Mon thru Fri...off weds. Only work four days but an extra day for overtime. Good luck to all."
bad,"Awful place to work,1/2 an hour break in a 11 and a 1/2 hour shift.If you are desperate enough to work for them GOOD LUCK."
bad,good stepping stone job if you want to learn about logistics. not a career stop for most. advancement is difficult after a certain level
bad,"A day to day work would be picking products but the hardest part of the job was we had to hit 100% pick rate every day what was inpossible to do every day you worked there. "
bad,"This place is a slave shack. They want work, work, work, and thats it. They dont are if your sick, have family issues, or you are on your death bed.."
bad,One of the worst places I have ever worked. The favoritism is an ongoing issue with the PA's and Managemen. They just turn a blind eye to it because they are too busy on Facebook and socializing with other employees. Seniority means nothing to them because they will promote someone (brownnoser)  that's only been there a year or less over someone that has years with the company. The environment reminds me high school with the constant gossiping and backstabbing that occurs and the lack of respect associates have for each other. The warehouse is filthy and the bathrooms are always a mess mostly due to bad bathroom etiquette from employees. Breaks are entirely too short and they count walking time as part of your break. And make sure you don't go over the allowed time for using the bathroom or you may have to cover it with personal time.  DONT WORK HERE!!! YOU WILL HATE IT!
bad,"The employees are worked to death with faulty equipment and harassed about 'making rate' but nothing is done about people cherry-picking carts, blocking aisles, putting items in wrong areas, stacking items in a dangerous manner, etc. "
bad,Management aren't held accountable for there actions they give out write ups like candy the stress of the job is not worth it nd the vending machine prices are crazy
bad,"I was a picker so the day consisted of walking, bending, and sorting through incredibly messy and stuffed bins. From my experience as a picker you are just a number of how many items can be moved from that facility in 10 hours. Meaning regardless of the quality of your work the management only truly cares that you were able to move 1000 items or roughly that amount in your shift. This gives no incentive to actually make sure bins are efficient enough for quick time. Alot of synergy is required to work at a place like this, and I found that 3/4 people could not care less about that at all. The hardest part of the job was staying motivated enough to keep moving around the 8 hour mark of being there preforming the same tasks endlessly. I found that amazon dangles what are to be seen as benefits in front of you, to then, turn around and give you no time to use the benefits and working conditions are so bad they dont intend for you to stay long enough for your 401 k. Again this is for warehouse working not for the office jobs."
bad,management does not care about their employees' barriers and issues. Each employee is viewed an just a number and easily replaceable.
bad,The job was pretty basic being a stower. Just putting items away at a fast pace with little to no mistakes. But the only catch was there was no job security. Multiple people would be fired daily because they couldn't meet the high demands of the company. the shifts are long and you aren't allowed to talk to anyone the entire 12 hour shift.
bad,"Worst job ever. I highly do not recommend this job to anyone. Complete and utter disregard for their staff and to add insult to injury, the high hours and low wages are totally ridiculous. Often times working within the facility we often face the threat of having our job one day and not having it the next therefore I choose to look for higher and more stable work conditions. The company offers great benefits, but the management doesn't allow you to grow. Favoritism is definitely a thing that takes place at the facilities."
bad,"Management was a joke. stowing in HRV one day and they keep most of the bins locked. A floor manager asked to to stow large items because other employees couldn't to put them, so i did. I got them all stowed. The next day i was wrote up because my numbers weren't high enough. So i learned quick, no space to put the items, take them back and drop them off at trouble shooting. They wanted zero errors, so you stowed 800 items in a day and made one mistake, they copied a pic of the item and again wrote you up when it was their computer that couldn't keep up when you scanned the item. I liked stowing, the concept of the job was not bad, but management at SDF8 was horrible. You had to go to stand up, where all you heard was negativity every single day. They had their pets of course who most people knew never made the numbers and never got wrote up. I was on third floor east one day and they brought around 52 write ups for people. Because the place was so massive a 15 minute break was usually 5 minutes because the distance you had to walk. i'm 57 and i've never seen such a high turnover in employees anywhere in my life. Sorry i just don't see 12.00 an hour as good money working under those conditions 11 hours a day. I saved enough money to put a down payment on a truck, and after my fourth write up, i walked out. 3 weeks later the HR department called me and asked me if i was on leave. *smh* I told them i left 3 weeks earlier, they said can send us your resignation and why didn't you give notice? I said i did, you notice i'm not there and hung up on them. What a joke."
bad,"If it wasn't for them hiring poor management with little to no experience in the field and I just don't mean warehouses, I mean never had a job before type experience. It might actually be a good place to work."
bad,Just no comprehension of easy they make things twice as hard as it needed to be they expected more than what could be accomplished.
bad,"All work, no play. They'll run you ragged here. The only thing I liked, sort of, was the maternity leave policy. Can't listen to music, can't talk to your neighbor while working, gotta stay moving at a crackhead pace, short breaks, no room for advancement. The 10% discount is a joke. Management will harass you about numbers, rates, etc. If u don't mind getting dirty for 40hrs a week, a bad back, and sore feet amazon is the place for u."
bad,"Working for amazon sucked. Always stress their workers, replace them as soon as possible. They claim to "" care "" but they terminate you quick. This place is filled with favoritism. The HR team is a joke, they never know the answer to a question."
bad,"Worst place i have ever worked for. The hours and benefits are'nt bad, but management is terrible. I worked here for about a year and a half, was trained in every process available in the warehouse. they switch out their area managers on a 9 month basis and if you dont buddy up to them when they switch you can forget about doing anything ither than day one associate tasks. all and all basically high school"
bad,pay took ages to be paid when I had an injury working onsite it wasn't run very well by ceratin people that worked there and I wasn't treated very well after I had my injury don't think I would work for them again
bad,"job is ok benifits are what keep people. hard to get a fair advancement opportunity . long hours. some managers can be unfair, plus side is the benefits and time off. the monthly bonus is ok to."
bad,"great co workers but management and leadership can get rude and abusive. it is an easy job to do but whilst having to deal with getting a constant ""speed up"" message on your scanner it is abit stressful."
bad,"Work in stow- everyday have to put items in bins which already are almost full, but still expected to make rate. Top shelves of bins have products falling onto floor (sometimes hitting people). Another associate told member of safety team ,was told our building has million items to get stowed so we have to do anything we can to get put away. Evidently safety no very important. No pay raise in 5 years. Managers change deptartment or leave every few months. Sometimes we do not have contact with our given manager for weeks ay a time. we are setup for failure, but management expects success. favoritism-don't get me started."
bad,"All our employees were hired as 1099 independent contractors despite a very rigourous non-negotiable schedule, high risk and personal costs involved. Minimum wage plus tips with no benefits. Amazon eventually cut our contract, laying off the entire force with zero notice."
bad,This company has such a high turn over rate because of Amazons treatment of it's employees both temp and full time is so sub-par that no one really wants to stay to long most just come in for the busy time of year through them and then leave.
bad,"This place is one of the worse work environments that i have ever seen when it come to harassment and favoritism. The managers here are all reckless and are not in it for the personnel that work under them. Far as hectic as a work place gets this is one of the most disorganized buildings i have had the displeasure of being in. The coworkers are just as bad sometimes as well but i have to say one thing that has got to stand out. You know it is bad that every coworker has the same modo. ""If it makes sense it is not amazon."""
bad,"the only thing that was good about amazon was the benefit package they offer. as far as anything else the management or the people that work there, you can hardly find anyone that is worth taking care of a problem. you can never find a manager when you need one. the job for the most part is easy unless you need to be put on light duty then hr pretty much refuses to put there."
bad,if you are person who can walk non stop for upto 10 hours then you are made for this job. Almost 25-30 km of daily non stop fast paced walk will certainly peel your weight off but you will certainly be left with frequent foot ache.
bad,Very poor leadership. 40 to 60 hour work weeks. I walked over 20 miles a day. Leadership never had a clue because they change to much. You are easy fired.
bad,"Role was fine, projects were interesting but had unrealistic deadlines causing too much stress every day. Culture-wise- people are too rude and consider it part of direct feedback mechanism. Backstabbing and blaming is part of the culture. The best part of the job is that you get to work with young/smart people and can learn if you reach out."
bad,Not bad for temp employment always new things to do people seem to be o.k. to work with.Hated the long drive.But the paycheck was nice.
bad,"I met a lot of my now friends from there so that's a plus side. The downside is that it is a lot of walking. I am a fitness enthusiast and I would never prescribe anyone that much cardio. It can be detrimental  to your joints. "
bad,your oon your own you cant even find a supervisor or manager when you need one and if you do ask there vere mean and rude also the employees hired thru amazon are extremely rude dont help with anything you get blister from so much walking even with the best shoes its too much and timed by seconds.
bad,"I would only recomend people who have litterly no other options go here. The pay is ok and the benifits are really good. Where everything goes wrong is with the ""leadership"" nothing wrong with having someone or some people in charge, but having a team to be in charge causes alot of confusion."
bad,"The hardest part of working at Amazon.com is recognizing that you are just a ""number"". As long as you show up to work and achieve the goals that the management has given to you, you will be successful and be able to continue your employment with Amazon.com. If you are looking for a career that makes you feel valuable, uses your talents and knowledge, and truly cares about you as a person, then this is not a job for you. At Amazon.com, you are easily replaceable; as they hire new individuals almost every day."
bad,Très difficile d'avoir à faire avec un manageur ou un leader.
bad,"I wish not to review at this time.  I have mixed emotions right now about my sudden departure from the company.  Overall, the company provides a wonderful service."
bad,"Mid management is very cliquish which is turn makes moving up hard if you do not butter up sups. I believe that upper management knows and allows it."
bad,"an average day i ether work in trucks build walls with boxes or building pallets with boxes , also build pallets with totes. i sometime load trucks with P.I.T. I learned how things work and why we do what we do. management isn't that great, very unprofessional. my co-workers are ok, most of them enjoy standing around talking and dont pitch in to help each other unless told to. the hardest part of working is not being able to do anything bout people slacking off. the most enjoyable part of the job is helping others and teaching them new things everyday."
bad,Low pay and high expectations from management. I enjoyed the culture of the employees. Employees were friendly. The manager that hired me was promoted to a different position before my start date. The new manager had different exceptions than the hiring manager I interviewed with. The new manger implemented a pilot training program that was different from what I expected. The Company is over rated.
bad,aucune évolution possible . pression psychologique. temps de pause restreint
bad,"After being hired on as a temp during the 2014 peak season (Christmas time and New Years) and keeping a flawless work record with no points against me, I finally was able to apply for the conversions process to become an Amazon employee during March of 2015.  We had been told by HR that our jobs would most likely be kept as the same shift (days and shift schedule) as we currently had, all though we had a small chance that our shift days could change.  Upon entering into the conversion process it became very clear that Amazon uses nepotism to allow existing Amazon employees to take your work shift from you if they desire a different shift and then you get stuck into whatever unwanted shift is left. In my case I went from a Mon-Fri day shift to being offered only the night shift from 6:30 pm til 5 a.m. Thurs - Mon. even after filling out all the shift preference forms and explaining that I was not available for that shift.  I was told by HR that it was the ""Finance"" dept. which chooses where we are put, then told it was the ""customers"" who ultimately have input as to where we should be placed, then finally told by the head of HR that it was just ""random"" !!!  Three different stories.  I also received an e-mail with the new shift listed, then received a second e-mail a day or two later with a different shift offer which I signed and excepted only to show up on my orientation day to be told it didn't matter what I signed or excepted already because I was now assigned to the night shift. "
bad,"I was assertive before I came here and now I'm aggressive. This environment forces you to be scrappy, fighting for the limited resources that exist. It's ok to be lean and employ an environment where people are inspired to be resourceful. But when you have hundreds fighting for the same thing the result is ugly - hungry games style! Also, everything you learn is specific to Amazon so there is no best practices knowledge being obtained. On the upside, you can move around more quickly, every year."
bad,Its a job. Not a place to call home. Amazon doesn't want or need you to succeed. They do not hire you. You have to apply for a job. Even if you are working there now.
bad,"As a picker, management stresses ""rate""...a mystical number only management knows how is derived( algorithm ).  So you are constantly told you are not doing enough in numerous numerical categories.  If you satisfy one category, they get on you about another category.  This would be a tolerable management style if this  mystical ""rate"" was evenly attainable by all the employees, but it is not evenly attainable from all employees.  The computer picks a path for each employee.  Some paths are easy to meet and surpass the expected rate.  Other paths are impossible to meet the expected rate.  Some employees always get the good paths, while other employees toil under a system that feels rigged and unattainable.  In addition to being a hostage to the whims of the computer's path, the picker has to navigate other employees from other job departments.  These other jobs include stockers, quality control, electricians, etc.  You are expected to weave through these other employees, who always seem to have time to stand around and talk, and get your ""rate"".  Once you navigate through these employees and arrive at your item destination you have to sort through bins to find your item.  Unfortunately, your expected rate does not include finding the item.  Most often your item is buried amongst many other items, if the item is even there.  This means you now have to scramble to reach the next item even more quickly to try and make up the lost time finding the previous item.  On top of this, management stresses ""Safety First"" and ""Quality before Quantity"" which are impossible if one is to make"
bad,"I pack stuff in boxes, nothing technical here but, i do  pack with efficiency and compassion even though the job is hard. I like the people."
bad,"Amazon Fullfilment center in Murfreesboro,Tn. was a disapointing work experience.  There was little to no training on new tasks and hard work was rarely recognized.  My co-workers were all nice people and easy to get along with, but management was very reactive in nature and not able to answer a lot of work related questions."
bad,"Inventur, Qualität der Waren überprüfen, Probleme erkennen und lösen; Arbeit ist sehr eintönig und langweilig; keine Weiterbildungsmaßnahmen werden angeboten..."
bad,They want you to hit what's called rate which is usually 400 units per hours but they put you in places inside the warehouse where items are stuffed into bins already and they want you to find room for another 400+ items to be stuffed into bins. One word to describe my time there Miserable.
bad,Culture assumée de la rotation des effectifs. Difficulté d'évoluer en interne.
bad,"The communication between employees and upper management is very poor. There is more rudeness, disrespect and yelling between upper management and the people below them that you never know who you should listen to. Hours are insane and you can never switch your shift or see if your shift can be switch due to schooling. If your shift no longer workers for you, you just have to quit. Benefits are non-existent."
bad,"Unskilled labor "
bad,"I had actually gotten hired through SMX ( employment agency). I knew this job was too good to be true, but thought i should give them the benefit of the debut. On orientation day, they went over all the basics, but seemed to leave out some vital information. There must have been at least 70 people crammed in the room for orientation this day. Nothing was EVER mentioned about how much time we had to learn our assigned positions. On our second day, (our official first day of hands on work, alone) after our shift, an Amazon P.A. (manager) told us not to worry about our ""numbers"" and to focus on ""quality."" Starting my second week, i had a SMX coach approach me to discuss my ""numbers."" She assured me my numbers were not bad since i was still new. She also mentioned that all employees who were starting on their second week were on ""learning mode"" and that we had a month to learn our position. Come Wednesday, i got a write up for my ""low numbers"" on my first week! I told the coach that i was told by another SMX coach that i had a month to learn my job and that an Amazon manager even told a bunch of us at a little meet up after our shift not to worry about ""numbers."" This coach said that i wasn't suppose to be told that cause it wasn't true.Long story short, it's a load of crock. SMX says one thing while Amazon turns and says the total opposite. They also encourage you to refer your friends and in return they will give you $25. What they also fail to mention is that as long as you and the person you referred last a whole thirty days, then you'll get your $25 referral. All in all, find"
bad,"You work for 10 1/2 hours for 12.75 an hr. They push you to work as fast as possible to make their rate. IF you can't make rate then they end your assignment. Basically you sleep for about 7 hrs each day and work the rest. Not much time to eat or relax. You work 4 days a week, but they trick you by giving you madatory overtime to work the days you should have off. So, good money if you like working a lot of hours and super fast."
bad,would go bin to bin to make sure that none of the inventory in missing or see if any thing is damage
bad,"The recruiting process was a bright rainbow, the job (culture, politics, nonsense, etc.) was NOT the pot of gold."
bad,"If you are lucky enough to have a good manager in a good org, you can have a great experience. This is very rare here. Almost everyone I knew the entire time I was there was overworked to the point of exhaustion. It was not uncommon to receive (and be expected to reply) to emails at 10pm on a Sunday. You are always expected to be available. Sick days are not sick days. They are days that you *only* respond to email from bed. Almost all of the management team will tell you that they believe in work/life balance, but take this with a grain of salt. If you clock out at 6, you will not be promoted. And if you are not promoted after 2 years, they will start to make moves to have you removed."
bad,You must be fast on your feet. It hurts so much! The rate is WAAAAYYYYYYY too high for the paths giving on your scanner. Management seems to act as if they can give writtens for a tiny bit off the rate expectation. You gotta be the Flash to please Amazon's three sections most importantly productivity.
bad,"To start, most employees enter Amazon through a temp agency and if they are in the right place at the right time (usually holiday season if you survive the rat race) then employees will get an offer to apply to become ""converted"" as a full time amazon employee. Temp associates and Amazon associates do the same work except Amazon associates get benefits, and raises until you reach the capped raise in your tier level (will speak more on tier levels below)"
bad,"I'm hoping to make this review as comprehensive as possible so that future Amazon Warehouse Associates may know exactly what they're getting themselves into."
bad,"Management is not up to Par and avg lifespan is 2 yrs before burnout. The golden handcuffs called stock is  a suckers bet at Amazon because it is part of your salary when review and raises come but you can only sell it 2 times a year when everyone else is , driving down the price.  Total circuit job"
bad,Amazon.com is typical of any warehouse work environment. It requires medial work with long hours and lots of overtime.
bad,The clinic could see between 4 and 35 patients a day for work related and non work related illness and injuries. I had 8 different managers in the 5 years I worked there. The last manager became  a micro-manager and this was the hardest part of my job. I established and kept the department organized and was given no recognition for the hard work put into the department. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the associates and assisting them to get better.
bad,"This is only a job for marathon athletes. I worked in stow, which amazon will outright tell you, it's the hardest position they have. Pushing around a u-boat with 12 totes full of goods and stocking those goods into bins all night/day. Especially difficult when stocking larger items when there is nowhere to put them, cause all the bins are already full. Go, go, go as fast as you can! Ambassadors, or  ""coaches"" down your neck every hour. And breaks-what breaks? By the time you get to the break room, you immediately have to turn around to start trekking back to scan an item at the precise moment to avoid being written up for being late. Same with lunch. It's all rigged- managers can change your rate depending on if they like you or not. All the blue badges are nothing but butt-kissers on power trips. The work/life balance does not exist. On your off days, your body is hurting too bad to get out of bed, much less spend time getting household chores done, or spending quality time w/ family. I was so overworked and dehydrated, that even eating became a challenge. I do not ecommend working here, especially if you are a woman over 35-it's just too physically demanding, hot and overbearing."
bad,"The company is careless. And because they are a major online retailer (the Walmart of the internet) they feel they can do whatever. I would come in at 630pm and start my days. We would walk more like a light jog through out a million square foot warehouse. it would be so hot, and injuries through the roof that no one reports because the managers want their incentives. I messed up my back from walking on concrete for 10.5 hours. the most gruesome hours and I couldn't function made me cranky. The policies literally change everyday, and HR isnt held accountable for all their errors. People work for the money, but its not worth my body falling apart in my 20s or me being depressed. Ill work at mcdonalds and take a 3.50 pay cut just for my sanity. by the way I was diagnosed with major depression after being at this company."
bad,"The hardest part of this job is that you may have to walk up to 15-20 miles a day. "
bad,"Amazon.com pays fairly decent-they try to stay in the 50th percentile of employers in the area-and the benefits are great, but the building I work in has turned in to a military style, work like a machine, don't think just do, sweat shop. Avoid if at all possible."
bad,"Amazon was a fast paced environment, and it was a physically healthy job for myself."
bad,"a typical working day involves managing product and process improvements and i have learned that through hard work you can go up in the job and start a professional career."
bad,"A great place to work if you are in a transitional period.  A bad choice if you are staking a career on it.  Long hours with little to no intelectual stimulation, granted it is warehouse labor. I am essentially a flesh and blood robot taking orders from a handheld computer.  Extremely tedious. I'm sure it would be different if you can hang in long enough to become a process assistant or administration but those jobs have limited availabilty.  I foresee alot of Amazon's current labor force ultimately being replaced by automation.    Company has a brilliant business model.  Might like it better if I could get off weekend and/or 3rd shift...maybe in 3-6 months....(sigh)"
bad,"Start the shift scanning your badge to clock in, go to designated work area then area manager tells about the night we will have and how many packages we have to handle for the day then we all stretch. We go to our areas after we break from stretches and begin stacking, organizing, and wrapping packages onto skids and send off to trucks. "
bad,i was a smx coach i trained a lot of people i handle termination and anything that needed to been also paper work.
bad,"I cannot say for all of Amazon, as there are many departments, but the department I work in is very negative and what is expected is absurd. Many do not last long, management is poor, lack of direction and defined goals, within one year I had 4 managers and team restructuring, change in position without my consent, and multiple coworkers suffer from injured wrists due to intangible metrics."
bad,It not a bad career but if you are a family man as I am its not a job for any family man or women its 10-12 hour shifts and alot of manatory overtime which means you won't be able to spend alot of time with family also parking is a joke specially during holiday seasons The only thing I consist is great about the company is the pay.
bad,"I was laid off from it, I had no complications but it was under contract and my time was up. But they gave you no benefits or compensation also security was really poor."
bad,"Amazon Wouldn't be a bad place to work for if it weren't for the management. I was there for 6 months and went through 4 managers. Well when i left there i was on my 4th manager. "
bad,"As stated above, DO NOT GET SICK. At least not for a few days, especially with no health insurance. "
bad,"they do not promote within,poor working conditions,poor pay raises,mismanaged,poor training,high turnover rate."
bad,"The pay is under the wage scale, the management is every changing and the work is like in the 1950's."
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job is: I am able to walk around and check out all the cool items the job has to offer to it's customers when they are placing orders. With that being said it also give me great ideas for gifts as well.
bad,"I learned how to work at a steady pace and yet maintain a good quality product to satisfy the customer. My co-workers made the experience even better, they always maintained a positive attitude which made going to work everyday a joy. Management was excellent they really did a good job about caring after there employees."
bad,"First I would clock in and then walk right to my station. I would take boxes off the conveyer belt, open them and put the materials that were inside on a cart and scan them. I learned that warehouse work can be very taxing. Management was good but also strict as they should be. My co-working base was very diverse. The hardest part of the job was stand for multiple hours and mandatory overtime. The most enjoyable part of the job was the paychecks."
bad,"a Lot of work, not enough pay, my fun moment has been because of the people i worked with."
bad,I liked the benefits but they do not treat you like an adult at that company
bad,"Amazon pay is great, but when it come to everything else they need to work on a lot of area. The human resource dept is the worst i know at this company. They all talk about each and everyone in this company will throw under the bus. The General manager is the wost one in this company, he will walk around and make the employee life miserable. if you dont go along with what they want, you will be railroad out of this company, no one is on your side with this company. They company spread lies. Worst company i ever work for"
bad,"Great team building opportunity and professional introduction to the company. Amazon is trying hard to change it's culture, unfortunately it is not embraced by many older leaders within the organization."
bad,dont like the magement the money is rubbish for what u are doing overall not a very nice place to work
bad,I just went around grabbing different items to be shipped. I you could listen to music.
bad,Putting things in boxes.
bad,i worked hard everyday often times i did major projects on my own with a billion supervisors hoovering over me the only plus was a 1st shift M-F job schedule until that was eliminated
bad,"Good place to get management experience for new managers, but the culture is very negative with very poor work-life balance. There is very little room for promotion."
bad,"Would have liked to continue with Amazon but at a different facility. Management has to be different and set a positive atmosphere and culture. It starts at the top. Favoritism, lying on associates, horrible managers made it difficult to want to go to work. Very unfair practices. Not enough working equipment. Morale was low. Great location but poor management. Met a lot of great people."
bad,They put numbers before employees and safety doing the job goes right out the window after your standup talk about safety want you to give 110% then threaten to write you up if you’re 1 minute late or on time from your 10 minute break which is a joke you have people coming in the break room before your break is over yelling how much time you have left worse than a prison
bad,Horrible simply horrible a lie the whole time lay off without notice...just a terrible employer with no regard to the individual. Your just a number Management doesn’t care at all.
bad,"Only thing good working with Amazon was the pay. Otherwise you feel unimportant, overworked, taken advantage of, stalked. Being watchedmakes you feel uneasy while only trying to do your job. I unders we carry alot of merchandise at one time worth thousands but this company cant trust their employees, let alone themselves smh just terrible."
bad,"After 12 years, the company culture drastically changed. People were treated as if they were human capital. Forced overtime, hostile expectations, and lack of respect destroyed a once amazing company."
bad,"They treat you like a number, If you don't move like a robot or fast enough, you will be Involuntary Terminated, so don't leave your current job if you are not physically fit to work as a stower"
bad,"Amazon will hire for a dream job and in less than a year, they will assigned the employee to some other dept for a completely different team. The employee either accepts or gets terminated. It's horrible."
bad,"Salaire trop bas en vue du travail fournis "
bad,"i found it to be a hard place to work as you only get on 30 minute break and there is no set finish time,you finish when everything is done and can be there up to 12 hours"
bad,I have start working there at the start they were very nice then gradually they became bad and use there worker like slave giving out to adult like they were kids and pressure everyone to finish quicky with a customer
bad,Have to be prepared for long hard labor and 10 hour shifts. Honestly wasn't for me. Doing long hard work no matter what position you have and no communication.
bad,"I've been working at Amazon now for 7 months mostly because I'm still looking for another job. If your looking for a job when you are just getting out of highschool or working while you are in college like me, it's fine. However the managers do not give much care when it come to employees. I've gone over three weeks with no work because they don't consistently release shifts for employees to work, which leaves you with no job security and weak financial stability"
bad,"Try to speak to any team member of that company about pay, hours and benefits. Get their opinion about daily routines and the routes. Days can be from sun up and go well past sun down."
bad,No one here that are hire ups for not care about the employees they can care less if we are in pain nothing they allow some associates do what ever they won't and not get in trouble but jump on the good associates IND8 was the worst place to work I rather work in retail then to work for Amazon again
bad,"They have rotational shifts, and no weekend offs. So, if you are a person who does not have/ want to build a personal life, then Amazon is the place of your dreams."
bad,"Jax2 launched in 2017 with great culture and opportunity to advance. A change in GM and Sr Leadership completely destroyed the culture and became nothing but a political race of how many people one person could step on to promote themselves. Employees became nothing but numbers, reports of harassment and targeting went unaddressed by HR, promotions were based on personal favoritism instead of actual qualifications and competency. Mandatory overtime destroyed any chance of a work/life balance. The pay was decent but not when you were doing the next level's work for less pay. Can you promote quickly? Yes. But it depends on who you're friends with and how much you're willing to lie and cheat to win. From hourly associates to salaried managers, if you weren't buddy/buddy with your next level manager, you became a scape goat and were treated like garbage regardless of how well you performed. It wasn't always like this, but this is what the current culture of this building reflects. It was disheartening to watch it start great and take such a drastic nose dive over the course of two years. I was grateful for the opportunity to meet and work alongside some really great leaders in the beginning, but they bailed because they were smart. I'm much happier not working within this company anymore. I now have my life back, time for my friends, time for my family, working in an environment that isn't toxic like jax2, and finally gaining appreciation for my work ethic and morals. Overall the mission statement for the company is great, but it has to actually be applied to mean anything , and"
bad,"early start late finish, not very good communication ,limited training ,"
bad,It’s ok company to work for needs some improvement but overall ok. I like the people that I work with. Need to care more about employees safety and not about products and productivity only.
bad,Boring repetitive tasks and zero communication of change. But if you're looking for a simple job where you clock in work and then go home and don't think about it until you clock back in you can't beat it.
bad,"the managers are not professional and the work conditions are toxic. The hours weren't steady, lunch breaks were limited less then 15 minutes. amazon talks work safety but that seems to be a myth."
bad,"Fun Workplace, Stressful  Management"
bad,It’s a joke they don’t value employees! Lack of communication. They love people that are try hards . They don’t allow people to move up. They will find anyway to get rid of people.
bad,"Worked there and gave it 100% was always acknowledged for being a high performer. Went negative on unpaid time off, by 1 hour and was terminated. Even though I  took off because of a viral infection...."
bad,"Very fast paced but it gets monotonous quick.  It is a good job if you are looking for something quick but it is difficult to move up unless you fall in your manager's good side, it is very easy to be overlooked and to become part of the herd.  The company simply focuses on numbers and percentages, you will become no more than another number."
bad,management needs work and better pay they took out all of the benefits away if we had our raises it would be better and they need to fixed the management
bad,Fast paced. I feel that this position as well as all positions at Amazon are geared toward younger people. Long hour's on your feet. For a 58 year old person such as myself this is painful.
bad,Don’t like many of the “team leads” there. They’re power hungryThere’s no semblance of fairness it’s like a palace politic fest there. Job culture? Poor. Nobody really likes the job. Most people chosen to promote  are based on favoritism. Very bad policy almost primeval
bad,They don't practice what they preach. You can be highly educated and years of work experience and passed over because of being a cuacation. It's called reverse discrimation.
bad,Management needs to be involved more with getting employees praises instead of criticizing them all the time. No positive comments on work performance.
bad,"First of all let me start by saying I loved working for Amazon, AT FIRST.  But then I started having some medical issues and submitted for a temporary medical leave which they denied, even with all my proof of my medical, apparently they didnt see it as serious, mind you I ended up needing a blood transfusion. They fired me about two weeks later saying I never called in sick or anything and missed to many days..which was a lie because I did submit my absence.  Then they rehired me and fired me AGAIN a month after that saying I abandoned my job and VOLUNTARILY QUIT! Which I did not. Needless to say, amazon is an awful company to work for. They treat their employees like slaves and will fired you for literally no reason and then turn around and say YOU quit just so you cant get any unemployment or help."
bad,"This used to be a great place to work until Management (specifially at the Newark Ca location)  forced a new contract released in 2016 on employees that would make it easier for Management to let staff go.  "
bad,"Managers and shift assistants pick and choose who they support and development for advancement. Managers do not interact with all associates. Station Manager and shift assistants give you ""amazon"" verbiage and placated speeches with no follow-up or merit."
bad,A typical workday here is hectic and task oriented so its easy and stressful at times but overall if you have lots of energy its a great place to work at.
bad,"Mauvaise expérience,l’entreprise certes a un long palmarès mais elles ne consiste pas en une progression ou autre ce genre de métier c’est comme l’armée c’est un métier alimentaire on travail pour subvenir et non pour obtenir ce qu’on désir."
bad,Great opportunities if you’re in the right field. IT in Amazon is only help desk at the facilities you rarely get to do any Engineer role jobs. Benefits are amazing but you work way more than you get payed for.
bad,"Repetitive work, not the greatest management neither the greatest work culture once onboard. If you need the income it will be a good source of income but of you're looking for a bit more than income may not be the best fit."
bad,Die Manger bei singlepack haben selber keinen plan was die an aufagben haben jeder ist cheff einer redet so der andere so
bad,"no place to be, you run around 8 hours per day to pick and scan articles. Stressful and unrewarding work. Bad pay, waste of time. Did not expect more. They did not pay the hours you worked because they have their own special system. HR was useless."
bad,"if you are willing to work hard this place is for you,onlt two breaks of thirty minutes each, plus the attendance bonus."
bad,There was a lot of time when you did more work than needed for the day and you’re just standing around but your not aloud to sit. Also I worked a 11 hour shift but i only got 45 minutes for break total. Lunch 30 and 2 breaks that are “15”  minutes but it’s more like 5 because if your break starts at 9:00 to get to the break area no matter where you are it takes 3-5 minutes to get there. So now it’s 9:05 but you have to leave  at 9:10 because the next item you have to scan has to be at 9:15 and amazon is a big place and it’s hard to get to a new area in less than 5 minutes
bad,"A typical work day includes besing resoucefull and adaptable, to fill any roll needed for the day. You must also be ready to work yourself to the bone to  sure goals and workflow standards are met. The job is very easy, the only obstacle is making friends with some of your peers."
bad,"Amazon expects its employees to be like machines and work as if their body is at 110% 100% of the time, and if you fall short for even a week you could be facing termination. There were several weeks where I was stressed to push my self even when I was sick and felt like I was going to fall over I'd highly recommend STAYING away from Amazon because its built from the ground up to have a high turn over rate, they don't care about you unless your able to push above 100% all of the time. The only true slight positive is Amazon's benefits. They are decent enough that you can use them as you need them in general"
bad,"Amazon is purely production minded with little to no regard to its employees.  There are ""daily"" quotas to be met.  Favoritism runs constantly to the less productive employees.  Schedules can change at the drop and no notice.  Also, during slow periods, workers are involuntarily sent home with no pay."
bad,Poor HR skills poor communication with upper management  there is a lot of favor to friends. Management is terrible they don't communicate and value there workers
bad,"a typical work day, everything, I dont want to participate in making comments about this company standard working hours in different career fields. to"
bad,"Really fast paced job. My skill set is in loading and unloading wagons, but I was put on picking. Don't think I was utilised well at all. Even though we were promised a 9 month contract, I was told we will be let go after peak period"
bad,"They a lot of policies that are not discussed in detail. I enjoyed the coworkers. The traveling was a bit much for the pay. Overall, the company provides opportunities, if you are able to log on in the internal website."
bad,Should be more attentive to people working abroad.
bad,"Entreprise qui travaille avec des salariés qui sont j24 sous stresse est pression."
bad,"It was okay to work there, but too far of a commute for me. The job agency they had at the time had Inexperience kids overviewing. They didn't help much"
bad,"Amazon is a hard fast paced job. The hiring process was fast, I was immediately brought in for a drug test and registration, after my background test was complete."
bad,It was a Full-time position that paid $10 hour no paid time off only (8 hours unpaid time off) or sick days a lot of mandatory overtime that they would schedule at the last second.
bad,"Bringing military leaders into a warehouse is not a good idea. That type of mentality that is ""do as i say"" and not willing to accept feedback is a hostile work environment. You are never going to be good enough and will always fail."
bad,"Bad organizational leadership, leads down to unorganized team and correction of errors to occur within the data center space. It is a great environment to network and meet others but among the worst for growth and development."
bad,"A typical work day as a stower, you will be isolated and expected to make a rate which is almost always unattainable unless you cherry pick (which they tell you not to do)."
bad,"A fast-paced work environment, with little chance to rest during work times.  Has well-stocked breakrooms/lunchroom.  Breaks and Lunch are only times allowed to sit down.  ALL time is tracked, from clock-in at beginning of shift, to final clock-out, to ensure productive work.  Less-productive workers are written-up, without any regard of difficulties, and several write-ups can lead to termination, even if doing your best."
bad,The work environment was the worst. People were rude and disrespectful. Believed they were entitled. While I didn't mind the long hours it felt eternal going to work everyday I worked there.
bad,"A typical day at work: Stand around waiting for work to arrive, then race through it to beat the clock."
bad,"This is a job for kids getting right out of high school, is very strict you don't even get a 15 minute break your break is more like 8 minutes and you have to be back on the floor"
bad,Hours not good at all. Management straight out of college no experience in the industry whatsoever. Pay sucks. For such a BIG company they have a lot things to make better!!
bad,Schlechte bezahlung - job nicht sicher - sklavenarbeit
bad,Unfortunately this job isn’t for someone who has a family or other commitments. You work 10 hour shift anywhere from 10-12 hours daily. Very little incentives and overall moral is low. Advancements are very few.
bad,"Taking calls, Emails and chasing packages."
bad,"I worked from home, using my own brand new computer, and their technical uploads intuned to my computer.  My last day working for Amazon was the last day my ever computer worked again.  I had to go out and buy a new one.  The company refused to accept responsibility or acknowledge that my brand new three-month-old computer internal shutdown had anything to do with their technicians wiping out my entire system. Very impersonally."
bad,"It's a terrible deal.  Yes, you can publish your ebook for free, but then Amazon takes up to 70% of your profits!!  It is impossible to make money with free ebook publishing on Amazon."
bad,I had a bad experience there and I think it is wise to keep it to myself. I was a stellar employee with a perfect record ( was never written up ) to fired over something I did not do.
bad,I was one of the 1st group of people hired on into the newly constructed building. The pay is far below the warehouse and distribution standard in our area. I worked there for 3 yrs just long enough to leave with my fully vested 401k. The work is very physically demanding. The first year that I worked there they had numerous incidents of employees passing out on the floor from exhaustion.the company lies to it's employees consyantly. In the packing area you cannot get a straight answers on what the minimum rate  required. I wouldn't go back to work for them unless I have no other work opportunity available to me
bad,The work wasn't too hard. I learned more about being part of a vast team of other talented people. The most enjoyable part of my time in Amazon was the people that I worked with.
bad,Manager was two faced.  Sorters cheated the stats by only grabbing small sort items or Jiffy bags then going to the next aisle.   Told management they did nothing
bad,The schedule that they offered me didn't fit my schedule to take care of my children too much hours. Evry day I was working from 9am to 21pm.i developed my ability skill in this area.
bad,"Training wasn't the best when first starting.  Once you learn the different jobs it's fine, but very repetitive.  Lots of pressure to perform at a high rate of speed.  Strangest time off system I've ever experienced.  If you're late 5 minutes you may as well wait the other 55 minutes before clocking in, because they will dock you an hour regardless.  Best part of the job is that it's physical and you can cut some weight if you're looking to do that.  Lots of management turnover, so the ""feel"" of the shift could vary quite a bit depending on who the manager was."
bad,Amazon seriously need to step up their game for the work environment they have created! They also need to change their rules on time off. They wont except doctors notes! Regardless if you're seriously ill. they will fire you!
bad,"In my case I had worked mon, tues ,thurs ,fri as a picker. The ten and a half hour shifts are split into groups of three with 2 half hour breaks in between. The work rate expected is very fast and almost definitely won't be reached in your first few days. For some it might take weeks. The job is pretty demanding physically but they do a good number of mandatory stretches to make it a bit easier. The pay is above minimum wage and if you get hired as a permanent employee the benefits are pretty good. Overall, if you can take it physically and mentally, it can be a half decent"
bad,Did not like it much. did not learn anything and the company does not respect you you are another number to them. The rates they want you meet are not reasonable.
bad,"Manager turnover is high; when a new manager takes over project priority changes, processes change - new manager means new rules.  My particular manager with JLL does not appreciate employee ideas or suggestions."
bad,I worked here as a contractor the entire time and it was very difficult to try to get a full time job. It made it easier for them to schedule you when it was convenient which led to a lot of uncertainty with your job and when you would be working. Initially I learned a lot and really enjoyed the team but then after a couple years it become purely metrics focused and we were put in very stressful work conditions.
bad,hard work fast paced                                  managers do not know how to talk to people. safety is an issue only when it comes to productivity. things constantly change without notice
bad,"Amazon treated most people like cattle it’s very hot in their warehouse , no water on the floor , not allow to help co/workers in need , not enough hours to allow you a living this company is only "
bad,"Was entry level for 9 months, and after amazon increased its minimum wage to $15/hr, I can safely say that the work/life balance, compensation for work, expectations, and really everything expected of you is incredible. Problems arise the moment you accept more responsibility, however. The ""work like a robot"" mentality starts to become overwhelming, and with hardly a pay raise to go with it. It wouldn't be such a glaring issue if those that did start to move up actually made a dollar amount more than entry level that was worth noting."
bad,"Work 4 hours a day. "
bad,"After increasing minimum pay to 15.00 hr, there was an obvious increase in productivity scales to compensate. Co- workers were enthusiastic and worked well with others, team players."
bad,"A bizarre place to work.  Everyone is obsessed with and judged by being a certain ‘level’.  It’s not good enough to just do your job, you need to create something that makes the Amazon machine more efficient.  Then you rotate to a new job, and customers and co-workers are just left in the dust.  And then getting promoted is super political.  And your bosses my be practically children.  Everything is arbitrary, etc"
bad,"Salaire non avantageux, sécurité minime sur certains postes, avantage carburant et déplacement nul, évolution tu peux toujours rêver, tu es un salarié intérimaire et rien de plus, l'humanité et aussi peu présente"
bad,"This job is good for non-social people since you spend most of the day alone delivering. 15$ pay and flexibility is decent. However, Amazon suffers from severe disorganization, glitchy delivery app technology, and incompetent warehouse workers. Ware house workers perpetually fail to provide all packages for your route or mix up routes. The drivers are often blamed though we have no roll in setting up routes. "
bad,"nessuna possibilità di crescita, nessun supporto da parte dei responsabili"
bad,"I lasted about 3 months when the dread of going to work got to the point i couldn't force myself to go. The business model is built on labor exploitation and there's no way around it. Some people were able to maintain extremely positive attitudes about the job which i found to be really sad in a sympathetic sense.  No matter what task your assigned to your expected to work at unrelenting speed and your every move is tracked by a computer that compiles insanely complex charts of every second from clock in to out that are then gone over by the ten managers above you and if you're ""time off task"" is off by a little from going to the rest room or stocking your stuff you will get talked to and warned by the whole lineup of managers above you office space style. They try to get people pumped in the safety meetings by having everyone do the most abbreviated stretches possible like in middle school gym class, it was very odd. I started the job just before peak season and i wouldn't wish that on anyone. They put these ""peak"" brochures and magazines everywhere in a ridiculous attempt to brainwash employees into thinking that the forced overtime hours are awesome! Cause we're spreading smiles to kids on Christmas. They seriously work people to near death in the 5 weeks leading up to Christmas and the shifts are 12 hours 5 days a week. They showed their appreciation to the employees for their part and sacrifice in producing huge piles of money for Amazon with an Amazon ""peak"" t-shirt, no cash bonus which i wasn't expecting but come on. 15$ an hour isn't even close to a livable wage in my"
bad,The work conditions was horrible the rates they set for works was unrealistic management was on a power hunger very disrespectful. There us a lot more that I just rather not talk about this time
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"I lost all respect for Amazon when I found out how they hire. It's really easy to get fired too. You can get written up for pretty much anything. I'm getting married in October and they gave me a hard time about getting the time off I need. I was really sick my third week in. If you run out of time off, then you can't have time off. Makes sense right? Well, I thought I would be able to go home, with my fever of 102. No. They said I can go home but I'd be fired. Not my fault they didn't excuse my time like they said they would originally for my wedding, instead, they make me use all of it, now I have none left. Preplanned events don't seem to matter. They have their own agenda, management is all about themselves, and you'll just be another number. They claim to care about safety but it doesn't seem like it."
bad,"My job title at Amazon was a 'Packer' I had to package 52 items an hour, and if i wanted to go to the toilet it was known as ""idle time"" and the management timed these toilet breaks."
bad,Repetitious 40 lbs dog food bag lifting and boxing. Minimum 70 per hour. You are a machine not a human. Hunt down your own supplies all while being treated like the no skills required idiot that they see you as. Process assistants only make $1.50 more per hour.  Two 30 minute breaks and the rudest HR. Random drug tests. People wheeled out on wheel chairs daily from heat and exhaustion. Fun!
bad,"Working for amazon, even though it sounds great because of it being a international company, is just a nightmare. Your are not an employee, you are a slave."
bad,"Typical day of work is very fast paced ...Some times good sometimes slow,"
bad,"Amazon is a great company, I am just not the type of person who likes work production. Its hard on me physically. Its a great just just not exactly for me."
bad,I found that the work was very physically demanding and the production rate was unfair and unrealistic to how jobs were to be done. They say that they Will make accommodations for disabilities but I was put on medical leave until they found a place for me and I have been out for 6 mo now and now work position has been found yet.
bad,Temp  job. Hours were tedious. The allusion is given that the job is part time when it honestly is not. The job requires a full  time 24 hour commitment.
bad,"Is very hard work. You do the same thing every day. Always looking to see a way to get you terminated. When you get a FINAL warning it stays in you for 30 days. pray that you don't get another one because if you do, that's it for you. Another thing you get this thing called UPTyou get 20 hours of UPT each quarter. You can use these hours ant way you want bt if you go NEGATIVE, your out."
bad,"There is a constant drive to perform, management is sneaky and untrustworthy and there is a lot of bias and favorites. The hardest part of the job is showing up and the most enjoyable part of the job is going home."
bad,"when I worked here I at first absolutely loved it but then as the hours and days went on I started to feel increasingly worse in the cramped spaces and tight rules, this place did not allow any sort of entertainment within its walls for the 10 hours you work here, coupled with the hour long drive this place was dreadful at best"
bad,Always putting pressure on workers to perform especially the Tom team manager mr niral always telling lies and always want to be the center of attention
bad,"I was hired straight out of school. I was extremely proud to work for the company given its reputation and great pay straight out of school. However, I soon found myself desperately looking for another job very quickly. "
bad,"bad company to work with,10hrs shift heavy work less pay! good benifits,average in managing things,safe and secure for the associates,less chances of growth"
bad,I did not enjoy working for Amazon. The work was very hard and they have unreasonable production standards. Breaks are not long enough and when you go to use the rest room it negatively affects your production totals.
bad,"The culture used to be fun and people loved coming to work.  I don't know what or why, but it changed rapidly and for the worst! At first you were judged on performance and ability to lead but it became about brown nosing to get promoted!! What's worse is that direct management had no backbone to stand up to upper management when things got bad."
bad,"Too low of pay and overworked. Pressured to do 100% all the time, punished if rate drops below 100%. If you knew managers well you could get out of picking. Bouncing from floors and sides far too often."
bad,"management were really bad, played favorites and were rude to those that were not there favorites ie giving them the task that no one wants to do and such"
bad,Literally will work you to death. Won’t be able to do anything on your off days because you’ll be exhausted. Expected to keep rate no matter what. Good luck with restroom and water breaks. Training is short. Got fired for having a rate of 97/100.
bad,"Great pay and benefits, however amazon takes advantage of its operation managers forcefully. Prepare to work hard, not the hard that most people would associate with a challenging job but so hard that you will burnout in a year or less for some positions. You will learn alot about lean principles and get called out by your supervisors constantly when your not hitting unrealistic numbers."
bad,"Numbers/rate driven, unsafe at times.  General apathy for employee concerns while stating they care."
bad,More of A temp job .high turnover rate for employees I never worked at A place that was that bad on the turnover rate they put to much pressure on people to make the rates and if you dont you get wrote up do that three times and you are out the door so alot of people are fired are they quit I stade until I found something else but I did not like seeing how treated the employees at all .
bad,"I started my time at Amazon hoping for a well paced work environment where I could make good money with just some basic exercise. What I didn't expect was just how badly the employees are treated. It's drilled into your head on day one that you are temporary, and that they can and will replace you at the drop of a hat. "
bad,"Not a great place to work.   They overwork their employees and are not concerned with their safety.  Other departments might be different, but in the warehouse  look out"
bad,"Must meet rates, accurately and quickly... Break times are short. The time it takes you to walk to break room counts as break time. Great benefits. Hard to have a personal life outside of work. 10-12 hour shifts every work day; on your day off you just want to catch up on sleep."
bad,"I've heard that depending on what warehouse you go to the environment can be ""worth"" it but where I was it was bad. We didn't have any AC , and that might not have been a problem if I didn't live in Miami and we were in the spring (almost summer) months. If you do well, just expect them to expect more and more out of you each time. The managers and employees can be really chill people, and that's probably the only thing that helps, but at the end of the day this job kind of sucks... It's been over a year since I worked there, but I wouldn't go back. Only reason to work there is if you need some cash quick (they pay weekly) , you like a physically demanding job, or you simply have no other choice..."
bad,"Great benefits, no advancement opportunity, depending on your manager/department. Definitely alot of flexibility, and great benefits, but if you are a person that works well with structure, this is not the place."
bad,The run you into the ground. Very hard in the body. Their holiday season you work 5 12hr days with 3 breaks and a 30 min lunch. Their breaks are 10 minute plus 2.5 minute to get to the break room and back to your station. Not enough break to recharge when on your feet that long.
bad,Impersonal all employee/employer relationships handled through an 800 number. Overhiring leads to drivers fighting for routes each day or working in the warehouse if they even have work. Schedule hours don't mean guaranteed hours.
bad,"Imagine meeting the perfect guy, then finding out he is a narcissist, has bad credit, married with children, financially dependent on his wife..Amazon"
bad,"Everyone stands... ALL the time"
bad,"They did have a lot of mandatory overtime which didn't allow me much time outside of work. it was good because I needed the money, but they only offered me seasonal positions."
bad,"Be prepared to do a lot of standing , breaks are 10 min . It says 15 but you get 2.5 min of walking to and from break . "
bad,Makes sure you can keep up because if you don't they will constantly remind you that you aren't. Everything is about numbers to them. And I think they sometimes forget that we are human.
bad,"Lots of favoritism there. People got tired of doing the same thing every day. Management was terrible with communication and such. Short breaks, lot of hot days in the warehouse. Leads did very little."
bad,"Once upon a time it was amazing, the best job I'd ever had, and the last company I thought I would ever work for. Then the corporate shenanigans started. It went down hill fast, along with the stock options. "
bad,Very fast paced job. The lunch time was very minimal considering you are there for almost 11 hours daily. No sick days. Nice co workers management not so nice.
bad,"I felt as though the role you want you won’t get as they need a lot of packers. I was often put on the large items packing station and found it difficult to pack these. Therefore my targets weren’t being hit, I just found myself fed up in the end. They’re not understanding, they aren’t interested in building good relationships with their staff."
bad,"Not enough hours per shift. Management only advance individuals they have relationships with, instead of the best knowledgeable employee. This creates a divide on the shifts and in the company."
bad,I worked thru the peak season and was given the hardest worker award. I was hired for one position and ask to work in another in two weeks. I was being certified for their pit training which I was a current Forklift Instructor . They thru me into another position to floor management which I excelled at and started training other associates.With no discussion or warning was told I could no longer continue doing what I was doing unless I went to another department and learn to train other people in something I had observed and didn't want any part of.
bad,A lot of walking and you gotta make rate and you only get so much of paid time off and if you don't make rate they write you up and then they re train you.
bad,"bonne ambiance au sein de l'equipes"
bad,"One of the strongest aspects of Amazon that appealed to me was its emphasis on career development; the company insists that it is eager to hire good Amazonians and not just people who expect to stay put in their current role forever. Yet I joined a division that was experiencing a huge growth spurt, and that dynamic siphoned the attention of management away from staff needs and development. Moreover, I was ""volunteered"" to participate in a limited-time program that did not have clearly stated objectives or purpose. I did not feel my concerns were heard. When the program was then extended in perpetuity, I was expected to be a permanent participant, despite my misgivings and poor fit and despite my request to be excused from the program. These two reasons are why I ultimately, and regretfully, left."
bad,No se en que se basan a la hora de las renovaciones de contrato.
bad,"management is not very professional, Employees are not very friendly, there is a possibility for advancement only if you are friendly with management."
bad,Nous sommes sur exploités. Et on finit souvent en retard.
bad,"At Amazon it is a very stressful work environment. Their only goal is to make rate which sometimes is almost not obtainable by the average or skilled person. Training is usually 2 days and if you dont meet rate or quality expectations a write up is eminent. You will be trained for one task but sometimes moved 2 to 4 times a day to different departments and expected to make rate and quality expectations often with equiptment that is in poor condition, malfuctioning, of not working completely."
bad,"Management only cares about hitting their numbers. They don't care about the employees, and their is almost no advancement opportunities. With almost no filter of who they hire, there are tons of useless employees who skate by doing the bare minimum. Because of that, the employees who are above average are held accountable to pick up the slack of others with no compensation."
bad,"If you want to loose weight, work alot of hours, elbow to elbow, be exhausted and in pain then it's the place for you. If you don't like where they place you, too bad you are stuck."
bad,CVG 2 was a good place to work at for the first 2 years or so then it went downhill. I think the managers need to be more assertive when it comes to making decisions on who should stay and who should be walked out the door. Human Resources has too much power there. The benefits were excellent.
bad,"The job itself is not hard.  It could be stressful when you had to deliver everything for that day, but also not be allowed to have overtime if it were not peak season.  In addition, if you asked what to prioritize, the managers there would not give you a clear answer, they would just reply that you had to deliver everything AND get back by your scheduled time off.  You are not considered a full-time employee, but casual/seasonal, even working 40 hours a week."
bad,If you’re looking for a temporary position Amazon is the place for you. Favoritism happens at all companies but Amazon is a company you will NEVER advance in this company without brown nosing and letting them over work you. Hourly rates arent impossible to make but extremely difficult when even using the bathroom for a few minutes can drop your rate and immediately get you “coached” or written up. After the holidays this company looks for any reason to fire anyone. You are a disposable body to Amazon.
bad,The pay was low  for the role I was in. Training was not able for my role and department and  had to teach myself how to run department then teach managers and associates.
bad,Very repetitive with no opportunities to to excel and move up the ladder in the company.  Not allowed to listen to music or do anything other than lift boxes for however long your shift is so it gets boring easily.
bad,"Typical day would be an intro team meeting"
bad,"Amazon is very unorganized, don’t care about anything but packages and numbers. We be out here busting our butts and for what. I’m very dissatisfied with the company. We don’t get any kind of benifits, and it’s a first come first serve, there is days when you get there to get your route and if your late by even a minute. They will send you home."
bad,"I don't recommend working for Amazon. The literal definition of unfair. The job itself is not difficult at all, tedious but nowhere near hard. The expectations, policies, and the way things are handled are perplexed as well as undeniably and unreasonably unclear. I can honestly say no employee had an actual understanding of the ""goals"" placed by management. Their sole concerns are high-speed productivity and flawless quality.  If legal actions could be taken against Amazon that and ONLY that is when safety is ""enforced.""  The wellbeing of employees isn't a factor for them. A few pregnant co-workers experienced miscarriages due to outlandish expectations implemented. Policies are abruptly introduced and constantly changing every week. I personally never received a direct answer on what my ""goal"" was supposed to be. If you aren't moving at a lightning quick pace at the same having NO errors then you are at risk for being in the ""bottom 25%"" resulting in write-ups and ultimately termination. People have lost their jobs not because they were doing their task incorrectly, but because they weren't as swift. I could understand this crudely competitive policy if all were given the same material, alas the material is never the same. Management is very good for being indirect or vague about how the goals are measured, and what the goal actually should be. That is a result of the material being completely different, ranging from items small as a chapstick to an eighteen and a half inch box, and everything in between. Let's not forget the quantity of these items is completely at random"
bad,"Took about 3 weeks from when I was hired to start Day 1 on the job. It was really fast paced however when feels like a worker bee in a huge nest. In other words, you are disposable at anytime."
bad,"Since i have worked in india as well as in canada  i can assure you that the news of horrible work conditions are true. "
bad,Amazon was a good place to work. Easy work and the pay was decent. Just after peek season was over the hours was not there anymore. And management just didn't seem fair with everyone.
bad,"The shifts kills your body, you're always tired. They allocate 18 days paid leave for the year, but never approve it. You have to be a good modern day slave. Best believe there is always someone looking over your shoulder to get you fired at any cost. Also, if you are Christian and would like to use the prayer rooms, the muslim associates will always complain. It is so stressful and strenuous that more than 90% of people leave the company within 3 months."
bad,"I was a Blue badge, packer, and full time employee. I worked 4 days on 3 days off."
bad,"Very fast paced environment. Some aspects of the culture are definitely broken, no one is happy there. No work-life balance at all. Low diversity and compensation is extremely low."
bad,"Worked here for 2 years just about, if you’re new prepared to be hassled by managers. Some managers are nice and some just there to blow some air. Breaks are about 6 mins long basically and they say it’s 15 mins but they end our break early every time while some managers stay for their full break. no room for advancement you have to get on a managers good side doesn’t base off good works."
bad,"15 dollars an hour.  Nearly impossible rate of productivity to hit every week.  18 miles a day, 10 hours, having to walk to, find, and scan a pick every 30 seconds on average."
bad,"It's a little too politically correct. If an employee isn't doing his job, there isn't much you can do about it. You, as an assistant manager cannot say anything and if you do, you'll get in trouble. They hire a lot of undocumented immigrants that cannot even speak English so they have to have translators on the floor."
bad,"If you're comfortable with change, then apply.  I had five supervisors the entire 7 months of my employment.  You get tossed around, and they treat you just like a number.  They force you into new roles, without even asking.  For someone with anxiety, I would stay away.  The plus was the flexible hours and pay."
bad,"It is a warehouse environment and ask former employees of what their experience was and move on from there."
bad,"Lack of advancement ."
bad,"The company stresses rate and productivity to the extreme , either you make the rate or you are written up and eventually terminated. "
bad,I use to love my job. It has become more corporate and less customer service focus.  I still like the people I work with but it is all about grinding away and not about the old philosophy of have fun and make history. .
bad,"Great company, good technology and very high customer focus. However overall culture is very poor, low value system, and unprofessional management due to immature managers, reason why very high attrition. Success comes only if you are able to project yourself personally"
bad,this  place doesnt care about its employees stressivle work enviroment i really dont like reviews this is my opinion of my work experence at amazon others will differ
bad,"I worked at amazon for 2.5 years, mostly as an ambassador meaning I did a lot of their training. It was a great job until management changed and then things weren't so great anymore. Left for what I thought was a better opportunity. I'd say if your just looking to get paid a decent amount for part time work and don't care how you're treated it's the job for you. But if things like favoritism, getting yelled at for things out of your control, and no growth really mean something to you, avoid Amazon."
bad,"hard work non stop long gaps between breaks if you get one at all "
bad,"The job itself is manual labor, It's not terribly hard but its tiresome and fairly unsafe considering that you're expected to constantly lift outside of your power zone with no load-stand. The management is so laid back that it feels like high school. All the ""cool kids"" aka management favorites sit/stand at the pick desk gossiping for the majority of the shift. They don't do any work and they don't get reprimanded for it. If anyone other than the favorites attempt this they're told to get back to work or questioned as to why they're not working. Policies are constantly changed without warning and seasonal workers are treated like they don't matter/exist. They constantly tell you that safety is their number one priority but it's speed. They only prioritize safety when district managers are around. The workspace is cramped and unorganized. It's not a comfortable work environment by any means."
bad,"I worked at the fulfillment center since November 2018. It was pretty fun working there, especially lifting all the heavy packages that other employees would just leave there. The hours were great because they were four hours a day 5-9 AM, leaving the rest of the day off. "
bad,"I signed an nda I'm not aloud to go into detail. for the entry level warehouse worker it was stressful. not for everyone. the amount of hours piled onto you is insane. Especially near holidays. Pay is great, as long as you don't compare it to the pay-rates."
bad,"Amazon has many divisions.  I worked in a fulfillment center.  I was sneered at for working at an ""FC"" at corporate interviews.  Amazon uses it's name and the possibility of advancement due to company growth to hire employees into positions that are very poorly paid when compared to similar jobs in the industry.  Their hiring and retention are abusive of their employees and result in turn over rates among both floor workers and management of well over 100% a year.  Most floor workers do not understand the metrics used to determine whether they will get to keep their jobs.  They are hostile to workers with disabilities as well as toward older employees.  No company with that high a turnover rate could ever be considered a good place to work.  You work 10 hours a day, four days a week with occasional mandatory overtime..  On the other hand, their benefits are good,  The only requirements for an entry level job is to be able to breathe, pass a drug test, and not have been convicted of a felony.  It's great as a backup or ""in-between"" job.  They also have part time jobs and will work around students' schedules.  They have education and training benefits for those who have been there for a year, the few that last that long."
bad,"If your looking to work for amazon.com then you need to know that getting employed by this company is easy! fill out the application pass the drug test and your good. Its also easy to lose a job at amazon. with Amazon.com your  employment is measure by a point system . If your points go down for any reason late to work,didnt meet your quota then your fired. To add to all that everyone there considers you as a number."
bad,I would preferred to work under a better management which could have been more flexible planning schedule . I would not refer friend because i did not have the best experience
bad,couldn't stop but to use the rest room for break and lunch . it  was an experience I don't want to do anymore I learned working in a warehouse wasn't for me
bad,"If this was my last option of work, that would be the only way I would go back. Managers that we started out with were just openers, when they left they were replaced with younger managers that didn't treat their employees right and had their favorite ones that had it easier then others."
bad,This was a fast pace type of job. It was ok but I thing the rules and management needs to be on the same page. They tell you one thing then you get in trouble because you do what they ask you to but its wrong.
bad,"Too fast paced- permanent nerve damage from opening boxes at breakneck pace. Breaks were limited, job security was laughable. I felt disposable and invisible as an employee. I don't think they even realize I left."
bad,"While the work is very exciting, the environment is not very collaborative, many people are focused only on getting their own projects advanced forward, therefore is hard to make progress at times working across multiple teams."
bad,"It was a temporary job to fill the christmas rush. Met a lot of good people but the environment wasn't great. "
bad,"Under paid for the labor that is performed daily. They offer volunteer time off but job is still in Jeopardy! If you are not a favorite employee or the supervisor pet you will not get promoted. Supervisor are too young. They be should be trained first. I'm also an Amazon prime customer. I figured since Amazon treat me great a customer, I know their employees are treated great! Wrong!! Amazon could be a great place to work if all employees get treated equally and promotion are given based on merit & hard work."
bad,"Just about anything management can do wrong, is exactly what happens. Training is lengthy and mostly uninformative, 90% common sense safety practices. Your entirely metrics based performance reviews are usually reported inaccurately, and don't be surprised If you're up for review and your manger isn't even looking at your metrics. Expectations are unrealistic, not because they're impossible but the system is terribly primitive and the equipment provided that is absolutely necessary to complete the job is unreliable at best. The hours are long, the break time is insufficient, accidents aren't sufficiently addressed if at all, and promotions most typically come from outside the company. Oh, and you'll often see managers pretending to go the extra mile when their superiors are around."
bad,"Amazon is a great place fir someone who is single or has a significant other who has the ability to move but if you have children or a spouse that can’t leave, then you should look somewhere else.  Having a degree seems to also help move you up quicker, as there were plenty of managers with degrees but who were completely incompetent. Without their Tier 3’s to do the real work, they would fail, and regularly did. The Tier 3’s are the driving force, where the rubber meets the road, and are severely underpaid and unappreciated. Short of being in the demographic I named above, I wouldn’t suggest working here unless you’re the second earner for your family, or are starting out at the Operations Manager level (L-6), as even an L-5 area manager makes as much as I do at my current employer, but is salary and works 50 hours a week (I work about 42)."
bad,"Be wary of fast despatch employed by amazon"
bad,"A typical day was stressful because it is very fast paced & you never know when you will come in and get terminated. "
bad,"the company for some people was a good fit and for others it was not, I was one of the people where amazon wasn't fit for me, no formal training and no followthrough"
bad,"working for amazon was ok, i was only there to pass time as im in university, it is not for me but oh well it may be for you, so try out for yourself."
bad,"•	Communicate clear instructions to team members."
bad,Literally jam packed vans with packages with limited time to finish. I was forced to do a different route every day causing officiency to run poorly. Would not recommend.
bad,"If you want to move up you have to be mean. Managers can't manage, they only come out of their nice offices to write you up or fire you. They don't know your name and they don't care to look, they only remember because of the laptop they carry around to find you and write you up. If you can't make rate, good luck keeping your job."
bad,It’s a job where you need to read the contract carefully there’s a no discretion clause AND work when they tell you to work stated in your papers. You must maintain a goal otherwise you hear it from 2-4 different people. You have to have reliable transportation because if you’re late you must either use your unpaid time off or make it up throughout your schedule. You really have to consider being away from your family because you literally give your life to this company until they find a reason to get rid of you. The Human Resources aren’t the same as the ones you call so they both contradict each other.
bad,I did not work directly for Amazon. l worked at an agency that had Amazon is a client. There should be some way to indicate that rather than 'required' questions to move to next page.
bad,"Especially large team members, leading to cross intervention on same projects. "
bad,"Bottom tier associates will be taken advantage of my under qualified management. You can expect to be in a lot of physical discomfort while working here. Also, if you find yourself in a facility that is near or greater than 1,000,000,000 square feet, you may be so far from the break room/lockers/vending machines/smoking area/bathrooms that you will spend your whole break trying to get there. You will be written up if you are two minutes late from break. Three write ups and you will be terminated. Surprisingly, I am still employed after 4 months... I am of the minority that last this long..."
bad,"Poor management."
bad,"Very fast paced job that requires a lot of moving merchandise."
bad,Amazon is only good for the money and benefits. Everything is unorganized and poorly ran by inexcusable people.The work environment would not be that bad if everyone worked as a team and properly understood their  role.
bad,"only thing i will say is there was a bomb threat while i worked there, us as employees saw the bomb squad and police onsite, but we were never evacuated and when we brought issue to management, they said a center in oregon decided an evacuation was not necessary"
bad,"I had a very bad experience working at Amazon, don’t recommend this company. The management and overall culture/values are very poor and clearly not human."
bad,"The Amazon fulfillment center only hires part time and more often than not for a ""seasonal"" or temporary work position. The work is often heavy built and hard to do work, save that the warehouse role is good for being a light nothing throw away work job. All you do is sort packages and lift. I have learned nothing meaningful for the work role no been near heavy enough work to keep the mind growing, either... nothing but  boxes to lift. The management team is pretty self centered and not positive toward the youngful staff, as a team. No work spirit! No positive vibes from the management! No promise of encouragement for work mainly! I would not further my life to work here again!"
bad,"Worked here for 3 years. The work here is extremely dull, and depending on what you do, can be hard on your body. You WILL be standing and constantly moving/squatting around a small area 10+ hours a day."
bad,"Management lacks fairness and also no job security"
bad,"I had a graveyard shift with amazon and I couldn't adjust"
bad,Non mi piac3va molto era un po'  una confusione il metodo  di lavoro
bad,All about their self play spend some of the money that they spend on products to pay the people that work for them they never really do anything like that they always just always worry about yourself
bad,"I have already stated my basic evaluation of Amazon. It is sometimes somewhat disorganized, making significant computer system changes with no warning and inadequate training for these changes. In one case changes were made with virtually no training and the system changes did not work for the location."
bad,Management conducts shady and probably illegal activities to only certain employees that they find suspicious or weird. They expect employees to be chauvinistic while being critical within themselves which is completely contradictory to themselves. They are pretty strict on working hours and on following standard Amazon protocol.
bad,I wasn't a good cultural fit at Amazon. I really enjoyed the work but it was a brutal work environment for me. Very noisy work environment and an awful commute if you don't live in downtown Seattle.
bad,"Ne pas travailler  chez Amazon  sûrement pas avec PROMAN, salaire modifier heure de nuit passé en heure de journée  sur la fiche de paie etc..."
bad,"You clock in and go straight to your appointed area after that you are on your own. Picking up heavy boxes by yourself, no one is helping you, no one communicates with you unless you are going too slow for them. The warehouse is weather controlled so if its hot outside than most likely it's a dessert in there but their is a water station avaiable to you."
bad,"Working in Amazon to get experience is excellent but that's just it and nothing else more. Salary is too low, you'd work as a horse there, they'd point you out if you call sick and for some emergency things, you'll work 12 hours/6 days sometimes in peak. 4 hours intervals between break."
bad,"I worked at Amazon during a warehouse launch, so my experience may be unique to that, but my manager was absent more often than she was present, and we needed her desperately. In her absence, my team was left uninformed as to expectations, but held to those expectations anyway, and punished for failing to meet them. I know people who work at Amazon currently and love it, so there's always the potential that my experience was an unusual one."
bad,I enjoyed the fast paced environment as well as the ability to do my job with out anyone breathing down my neck to do my job. I could work at my own pace with no issues.
bad,Felt unfairly treated by the end of my employment.  A company shift change was pushed thru and I had to decline work because it did not fit into mu schedule.  I felt forced to take a buy out.  then in one month the changed again and I could not go back because of buy out. They were poorly managed and were trying many new things to make the company work.
bad,"Management cares more about numbers than the worker's health especially during the peak season, work ethics of a worker as long as the numbers are right you can keep a job or safety of their workers hang overs and boxes are all over the place but they expect you to get out of the OP and remove boxes from the floors and take to the nearest Amnesty bin and still keep up with your rate and put 40 - 50 boxes per cage even though alot of the time you'll only be able to put roughly 25 - 30 or less sometimes per cage."
bad,I wasn't properly trained but they threw me in the fire with someone that has only been there for a week to train me. They penalize you for mistakes that could've been avoided had they trained you properly.
bad,"In most cases, you will work like a DOG and sometimes be treated like one. The new pay still doesn't cover the work of stowers and pickers, HARD jobs!!"
bad,They do not pay a fair wage. It is not competitive at all. For such a large company you think they would do better for their employees. Christmas time is a nightmare.
bad,"Amazon is a great place to make money and gain some experience. However, attrition is extremely high after the first year and it is a cutthroat culture. Management is a serious area of opportunity for the company as there is not a significant focus on developing employees. You have to do that for yourself. I have had 7 managers in less than 4 years, many of them lacking in professional experience and with extremely poor interpersonal skills. If you are considering accepting an offer, here are a few things to consider:"
bad,"The people who work here are very under paid. I am a direct hire, and in my opinion we should get paid as much as a truck driver by salary. They don't invest in their employee's and treat them like trash. The reason why the union is yet to infiltrate is place is because they make it where you can't bring your phone in and collect information concerning your experience as a legalized slave working there. They make it hard also for your transportation. If you believe in moving up in the ranks this isn't the place to be."
bad,"I worked for Amazon for a grand total of 3 shifts. In that time I got paid ~£480, this included the paid training. The company provide polycarbonate toe-capped boots, these have little to no inner sole and terrible ankle support. This, in my case, resulted in ankle swelling so bad that I struggled to walk after my 2nd shift and had to finish early multiple times due to this. The last shift I ever did very nearly resulted in me crashing on the way home. Why? Because it was painful to brake. The management generally treat you as if you're disposable, as you are. Conversation is discouraged and while they try to keep friendly, everybody who works there seems to be miserable. In the time I worked there I achieved virtually nothing due to an ongoing technically flaw with the handheld scanners. All of the totes we were told to process apparently contained customer orders."
bad,"Ants can build their little city in 24 hours. Amazon, wants 87,000 packages moved in 4 hours. So, they want you to hurry up and they yell as much. If you stop to see if your scanner is broken, you may get written up. Every time you stop, to use the bathroom or get a sip of water, the safety person or your supervisor wants to know why you’re not working. They give you a 10 minute break that they say is 15, but because it can take you 5min to get back to your post, it’s 10. If you’re there for 10 hours, you get a 30min break. They expect you to eat a full meal during that time. Lastly, they changed the clock in time, so if you were 6min late instead of 5min late, they dock you for the entire hour; Or as they call it.... a half point. "
bad,Working as a picker for Amazon was an extremely tiring job. You're constantly on the move and don't really get any breaks. Its just a huge factory and you're moving around collecting items for shipping. The pay is decent though.
bad,recently they took away all the benifets that made this job worth keeping so if you can find a job that pays 15 dollars take it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,"I worked there and i would not go back. I learned that the amazon i worked at was more for young people."
bad,"il faut s'accrocher et ne pas avoir mal au pied, courir et ne pas parler"
bad,"Rough and tough non stop job, the packaging area is the absolute worst area in the entire facility. Very poor management, ultra high expectations... They want you too keep going higher and higher, only care about numbers. Managers straight out of college have no idea what the job actually entitles or how it is to actually do the job... They always get on your case for low numbers... Usually the people are nice and fun but that doesn't matter when you have poor management and when you know the corporation really doesn't care for you... The packaging area also has the highest turnover rate possibly in the state than any other place, hmm I wonder why... gl to everyone who joins their team"
bad,Amazon appeared to be a position that was only temporary and not permanent. The supervisors at the Dupont location were not professional and the permanent workers were negative in the work environment.
bad,overworked for less pay. The communication is limited. There's no structure. You working different jobs without the proper training. And there is favortism among the ones who been there. There is no equal oppurtunity there.
bad,"I worked at a fulfilment center for a year starting as a seasonal worker during peak. From my experience the amount of work isn't worth the money. They barely give out any time off (80 hours unpaid, 48 hours paid per year) and management barely has any care for any tier 1 associates. I wouldn't recommend working here at all."
bad,A typical day started at 1 am and ended at 8 am. Once you walked through those doors you didn't have a break until you left with constantly moving to Sort packages
bad,"Amazon loves is customers, not its employees. At least in the department I worked in.  I left for a job closer to home, less hours and almost double pay."
bad,"Per quanto riguarda la sicurezza nulla da dire era tenuta in grande considerazione,per il resto ritmi pazzeschi,pausa quasi inesistente e stipendio basso."
bad,"First, I am a previous employee of amazon. I worked for the company for 12 months.  I worked in ICQA.  I was a lead training ambassador.  I trained close to 300 people.  I did my job well, and actually took pride in my role.  I also was a problem solver.  Until to day I was released,  I had NO blemish on my record. No writes-up of any kind.  never stole from the co., no sexual harassment allegations, no security breaches, no insubordination, no write up of too many errors or productivity, or anything to the such.  And I'm not trying to say I'm a perfect person. Like anyone else I've made mistakes.  I was released because I exceeded my UPT. Not by a lot, about 2-3 hours. I tried to fight for my job and even tried to appeal, thinking since I had a good work record w/ no write-ups, the co. could see some value in all the hard work I've done in the past year.  This was to no avail.  so to me and other, no matter how much you do or how long you manage to stay, one mistake and you will be fired."
bad,"Good place for quick money. I would recommend staying there until you have found another job. "
bad,"In all honesty everything is cutthroat here, you may make friends here but in truth, they are more or less after the same job as you and won't hesitate to do what they can to get it. Don't bother going to your Supervisor and talking to them about moving up and what you can do. The second they feel you are going after their job, they will get you fired and spread rumors. This is first hand experience."
bad,"A decent job if you're willing to work hard every day to make rates. They will notice if you do not make rates, and you will be written up and eventually let go if you cannot reach their standards. There are chances to move up in the company, but they are very rare and hard to achieve, even if you are one of the hardest working people in the warehouse. Some positives, benefits are nice and start day one. And starting November 1st, a $15/hour minimum wage is being implemented. That's about it for the positives. Be prepared for long-shifts, short unsatisfactory breaks, the constant threat of being written up for numerous reasons, not being able to have your phone on you or any music, and being stuck doing the same thing for sometimes months on end. They will preach about being a team, but in all honesty could care less if you quit or get fired. If you do end up going for a job in a warehouse, I would recommend that you do it temporarily while still looking for another job. The stress that comes with this job is hardly worth working there. Please check out and consider other places first, as Amazon should a last resort."
bad,Dont work here unless you need the job. The richest man in the world (aka the CEO) does not care about your progression or growth. You are better off becoming a server at a restaurant.
bad,"I worked at Warrington through an agency as a picker."
bad,"This job is ok if you’re desperate or in between jobs and you need some extra cash. It’s very easy to get a job via one of the two Swansea based agencies, just apply online and then you will be invited to a recruitment event. It took around 5 days to get a first shift confirmation. You get training on day 0, which lasted around 4 hours (you get paid for that). On your day one you get trained and support from Instructors. Overall my first impression was positive. Negatives include very long working hours (10 hours on your feet) you have to arrive to work early (I’d say at least 10-15 before), the place is very busy with people always rushing everywhere, changing and locker room very busy and crowded. Very short breaks (2 paid 15 min breaks) and one 30 min unpaid break. But because the place is so big and it takes at least 3-4 min just to walk to the canteen, then you have to queue to buy lunch. So it feels more like a 15 min break. Permanent employees with their ‘blue badges’ are treated differently to agency temps. Most of them won’t even speak to you as they consider themselves superior. The job is boring, you have to meet targets so no talking. No music either, so time goes very slow.  Managers and team leaders are constantly going on about targets (which are printed after every break and displayed for the whole team to see). If you are fast, target driven and don’t mind repetetive work then this job might be for you. Overall 2/5 from me."
bad,"Amazon warehouses are very divided, poorly ran and lack effective means of communication and motivation. Employees are seen as just numbers and disposable to most of the management and there is an evident issue of favoritism and a lack of motivation for those who come to work to actually work rather than socialize. Its very hot in the summertime and the expected productivity levels are difficult to obtain without teamwork. There is a lack of policy enforcement and a false sense of job security. If you aren't cozy with the right people, your job will be difficult and stressful. The upper management cares more about making numbers than anything else. "
bad,"Great company (by reputation), horrible management. Amazon has an amazing set of leadership principles. The issue is that leadership warps those principles into a means of forcing the maximum amount of work out of employees. This went to the point of some employees committing suicide. That's when I decided to leave."
bad,"Management working to attain their team goals, no consideration for individual workers. People are considered expendable. Managers do not bother to learn peoples names, partly due to high turnover. Managers ""know it all"" and won't listen to suggestions to improve processes and safety."
bad,"Il lavoro di per se è faticoso, ma giustamente remunerato. Il problema è invece che alcuni aspetti sono dannosi alla salute e vengono ignorati. Si lavora nel in alcuni settori sotto uno scanner per barcode per otto ore consecutive; tale attrezzo emette delle radiazioni che dopo alcuni giorni fanno sentire I loro effetti, come assottigliamento della peluria (capelli inclusi), sensibilizzazione e bruciore agli occhi. Inoltre si deve guardare di continuo un monitor per visualizzare I prodotti da scansionare, senza che ti facciano fare le pause previste dalla legge cioè ogni due ore per chi lavora ai videoterminali."
bad,"make you clock out at breaks "
bad,Highly demanding work environment. Work life balance is the least of the companies priorities. Company promotes a 3-4 day work week but company will make it a 5-6 day work week along with expecting more. Peak season are 60-70 hr work weeks.
bad,No time for breaks after the half mile walk to a break room. Environment was lacking considerably. Other workers goof off when no one is around. Constantly criticized for any mistake even though they want high volume completed hourly.
bad,"manager non respectueux des travailleurs, horaires très pénible, entreprise difficile d'acces car mal desservie en transport les WE"
bad,I did not like working there too stressful manager was not a nice person and with bad attitude did not train me very well at all and lots of the time found myself just standing around
bad,did not like the management style i dont know what your looking for or why your asking me this but ill just keep typing until the script is accespiable
bad,"overall excellent work experience, great pay, long hours, short half hour lunch. great for young people in 20's. overall great first job experience for anyone."
bad,"If you are in your early twenties this could be the place for you. If mid twenties and up, move on because the cap pay is extremely low for what you do ."
bad,"Lack of understanding for ones life and their need to care for family. Constant change with NO proper communication between management and employee, lack of follow thru when needs of a employee have not been met."
bad,This job gives you good benefits and nice amount of pay but it’s impossible to make that a long term job. Very high turn over rate. Short breaks and no good water
bad,"I'm used to working in Fast Paced environments and enjoy that however, the culture in this company is beyond stressful for a high paced job. Not recommended as a long term job."
bad,"First, I will talk about the pros. The company offers nice benefits, like 401(k), paid vacation, etc. It also offers shares of its stock to employees that can be accessed after working for a specified period of time. Employees who do not drive can ride in one of the shuttles provided by Amazon for free. The dress code is really lax; they let you come as you are as long as your apparel isn't too revealing or doesn't contain obscenities. Also, Amazon did not take issue with employees leaving early for the day. I could have left work early every day for an entire week and as long as I had UPT or PTO to cover it, I was fine. That gave me a feeling of freedom I had never experienced at other jobs."
bad,I started off as Tier 1 & sometimes I wished I stayed in that role. I got promoted & after I got promoted I saw all the mess & nonsense that I really don't want to be a part of no more.
bad,"Associates are underpaid and over worked, Management only cares about company metrics over everything else. The most enjoyable part of the job is leaving for the day."
bad,Productive place. Always something to do. Associates work hard and have fun standing in one place for 10 hours a day and walking around picking items off shelves.
bad,"The benefits were great!"
bad,"Management was friendly; however, I wasn't looking for friends, I was looking for advancement. No disrespect, but it appears that management had their favorites... Just not the hard-working professional ones. It's time for me to move on and again no ill feelings towards anyone. Thanks."
bad,"There were good days and there were bad days. I knew people that worked there for over 5 years, and people that did the job for 3 months every year."
bad,it was a very demanding and face paced job with not a lot of room or opportunity for advancement and since I signed a non disclosure agreement I would prefer to not discuss my experiences at this company any further
bad,More favoritism to the high level senior level. no advancement. they rather hire outside people. Low level treat like a kid. Manager hire their lazy friend to work there.
bad,people come and go like you change underwear. pay is ok but hours suck. i had just found out i was pregnant and was in and out of the hospital . they didnt care they let me go. they talk all about they are flexible with their workers but really they only care about their numbers and such.
bad,"its a long work day with boring managers. sometimes its hot in there,the people there look sad or mad all the time, your work goes recognized.  i feel underpaid ."
bad,"Was nearly written up for not ""positive positioning"" situations where the only difference was that we were never given absolute answers as to why problems were happening. Even if we saw a pattern, and everyone else in your department did as well, you had to never be honest when you know that the 1% chance they will get their item is only 1%."
bad,"This job does not give enough hours to be able to pay and keep up with everyday needs. On the other hand they underpay you only get a ""ten"" minute break and you must reach a multitude of requirements that could be difficult to reach on a slow and hot day. That does not stop management from criticizing your days work."
bad,Taylorism at its best. I worked for amazon for two years and by the end of it we were being tracked by the second and accosted for the smallest amounts of lost time. It was so bad that a much needed restroom break could seriously threaten your job security.
bad,"Working for Amazon Customer Service used to be great. Side Lead, Ops, and your Team Leads would make your time there better considering you will at some point get yelled at and likely degraded by a caller. Back then it was a competitive place to get converted; on average 1 in 3 people were kept past seasonal. It was always a great accomplishment if you were able to get converted at the eligibility date. "
bad,"The Job wasn't for me the Staff wasn't friendly and the environment isn't worth the money, the amount of walking and blisters you get are beyond. the lac of trust the employer shows is not appealing"
bad,You were required to work long hours and 6 to 7 days a week. Always had to work on your day off. A typical day was 16 hours or more. the warehouse was hot on your feet most of the day
bad,It was not an enjoyable experience. The management is not clear on the policies. When work is slow they will ask for volunteers to leave but don't make it clear that goes against your attnedance.
bad,"It was a horrible job, no one was nice and i really didnt like the structure of the management. everyone was treated poorly.  I was glad that I was able to get out of there."
bad,The training/management staff is upbeat but the rest of the crew is pretty miserable and most new people are only there for a few months max. Returns is one of those places you can barely make it through a day without wanting to leave.
bad,"There are t many factors in play where you are able to get fired. You have to basically be lucky to get good work, or know certain people. that is not how a job should be."
bad,"If you can be perfect despite having issues that are out of your control this is the place for you. They expect 100% for a rate and quality when stuffing items into bins that seldom are the correct size you need. There is rarely enough space in the bins and if you have a single asin(pallet with the same items), just forget about it. Oh, and management is hardly around if you do have problems so pretty much you're on your own."
bad,"Very fast paced and required to meet quota, I always was above quota. The managers were disrespectful to a lot of employees and would call out quotas on the intercom and names of those not meeting quota.  The job required long periods of standing, heavy lifting and timing."
bad,"personally i think Amazon is a good company to work for if you are in a higher position, lower level positions tend to be a bit more strenuous due to the size of some of the plants the walking a physical demand is a lot."
bad,"You have long hours "
bad,Work there is long as you can but still look for another job because they will let you go 2 to 4 weeks from your start date and write you you for one mistake
bad,"There seemed to be constant conflict between managers, leading to daily changes to procedures.  Change isn't a good thing when there are so many changes in a process a routine is never established."
bad,There's no room for advancement. You're stuck int he position that you were hired into unless someone else leaves. Very gossip. Bad managers lay blame on  whoever comes to mind instead of themselves.
bad,"no comments"
bad,Working there is like working at any job initially. You deal with those around you and it gets the bills paid. They have great services. Amazon is but one of many jobs.
bad,no recomiendo para nada es muy cansado y muy malos managers
bad,"Seemed like managements only job was to go around threatening employees jobs. Lack of compassion towards employees, was an over all bad experience....."
bad,"Management is constantly changing and everyone talks behind each others backs. Too much drama for being a work place and they even started monitoring our bathroom use. People seem to think its a place to find a mate. Even the management and HR date each other. Not very professional at all. Most people stay because of the stock options, healthcare, and the pay but its too much for anyone to handle mentally."
bad,"You will quite often have to fight to get a scanner that works correctly. Instead of having one type of standard cart that simply works and can fit down the aisle without issues, it is basically alphabet soup and some types of carts simply slow you down, which hurts your rate, which results in a write-up. You will never see mgmt picking with you and I have only see mgmt packing once (they love to hold up that desk of theirs though). Picking is by far the worst job in VRETS, especially if you are picking multi-slam, warehouse deals, or LTL. Temperature is not always at a healthy level and people have been known to get dizzy and/or black out. When I was hired, I was not offered the option of picking or packing, we are forced to do both. No one in their right mind would choose picking, as you will be worked to the bone, due to insanely poor paths and constantly power walking to try and beat the timer on your scanner and keep your rate up."
bad,It was alright if you like hard physical work. I wouldn't get to excited. After all it is an entry level job. What more can I say. It's like a dog trying to catch his tail. Your never going to ketch of with like. In other words the company stores owns your life.
bad,I enjoyed my time there co workers alike but knew it was no long term solution for myself wanted more money to take home didn't like the pay scale also.
bad,"Very stressful and fast paced. If you are a senior citizen, this place is not for you. if you have ailments, they will put you out in the pasture like cows, and bring a young worker to replace, and the young ones either lazy or dont want to work, end up either quitting or get fired. The older ones needed to be treated better are usually the ones who will stay the longest, but this culture dont see this...look how old Jeff Bezos is!!! He wouldnt even make it on the production floor."
bad,"There were days in the summer where we had to work in 115 degree+ temperatures. Job security was always an issue. Due to low productivity, you weren’t always guaranteed your hours."
bad,i will say  the only good thing i can is the schedule. You have the option to change your schedule but the b ad part is the pay and he management. It is also very hard to move up within the company.
bad,"Great people, but no real structure to their systems. Everyday you will be lost when it comes to the operation or the personnel coming in. Expecting people to do more without being compensated."
bad,I would never work for this company unless I had no other option. I would rather work in fast food. This is legalized salivary. I felt under paid and most def over worked. I could not do school and work here no could I be a mother to my child and work there becaause they will drain you!
bad,"All money isn't good money. At Amazon their is a lot of fraternizing between management and employees. Which leads to favoritism in the work environment. I've never worked somewhere that treated myself and co-workers so unfairly. There is NOT one person we the employees can to talk to about these problems. HR tells the managers what's was said and by what employees. My co-workers and myself contacted so many people, even from other Amazon facilities hoping they could help. Nothing has been done."
bad,"If you need something part time that does not require skill, and if you can follow basic instructions, this job is for you. The requirements are to be able bodied, willing, punctual, and willing to work for low pay. On the other hand, there are few, if any, hassles."
bad,"I lasted 2 peaks and a year in a company obsessed with rates, Which was effecting me both physically and mentally. Some of the management were better than others in terms of empathy and people skills, compulsory overtime 40+ hours over the Christmas period resulted in not seeing your loves ones even more so due to being exhausted, and having too start an hour earlier plus work your normal day off. Finishing on a positive you will meet many new people and make some friends."
bad,"On vous raconte les premières semaines que c'est la qualité qui prime sur la productivité alors qu'en fait, ils vous jugent sur tout et décident de vous virer aussi facilement qu'ils vous recrutent. Manque de franchise."
bad,"Physically breaks your body down. Repetitive work, short lunch and breaks, inmature employees ( not the young people, the OLD people 40+), no recognition for your hard work."
bad,"I started like anyone else picking up on the requirements and meeting co-workings, the only issue I've had with work is the pace not everyone has quick hands and the follow up re-trains are not on point"
bad,"Good pay and benefits but employees are not valued and treated as machines. Better to work in fields like IT, Safety, HR etc. and avoid operations if you are looking for any sort of work life balance. Company provides no training and no development support"
bad,"when you first start working their the managers try to make it a fun environment, but don't let your guard down and become relaxed, cause when you do you end up getting terminated. every January they do what is called a sweep of employees where numerous employees are terminated and a whole new group is hired."
bad,"Warehouse gets hot in the summer; they cannot control the temp "
bad,"The job was very stressful in that you work on your feet 4 hours per day non stop except for a 15 min. break in between. You had to scan and pack so many packages/boxes per shift. It was ok, but temporary as my background is in accounting, bookkeeping, data entry."
bad,Just work hard and a very quick pace when it comes to working at Amazon. Amazon is a well respected place to work just the pace is what literally drained me for only working there for 3 months
bad,"If you want to be your feet for 10 + hours a day, enjoy heavy lifting and mind-numbing repetitive work, this is the place for you! Compensation is not worth the time and pain."
bad,"Very stressful work environment with management that simply doesn't care. From area managers to the GM, they all dont care and pretty much ignore you while putting you to do the same job everyday with little to no regard of its effects on your health. horrid,  dont work there."
bad,If you are looking for job security this is not the place for you. The company constantly changes its policies and management does not communicate efficiently with associates. The managers do not treat the employees with the respect they deserve. The benefits are good but the work life is stressful and high-paced.
bad,They make you feel very expendable. Like a product in stock that fall and lands in amnesty. Rates are unrealistic to there free space. I seen a woman with cancer get fired for not meeting production in picking. Extraordinary employees getting overlooked because of politics and favoritism. Night shift and day shift are ran the same but standard work processes are very different. Best of luck.
bad,"Lots chaos due to high turn over, lots of opportunity due to chaos and constant new initiatives. Not a good place for those with families or those who want a life outside work. You will constantly be underfunded and over worked."
bad,"You'll never move up unless you kiss butt. Work as hard as you like, be the best at what you do, but unless you are good friends with the managers or open your legs or mouth you'll never move up."
bad,"I can't really argue with Amazon's business model. It has proven to be an enormously efficient engine for generating profit, and promises to remain that way well into the forseeable future."
bad,It's a sweat shop. Constantly wanting more and more from you at no extra reward for you. Once there peak season is over so are you. they no longer need all the people they bring during peak.
bad,very clean and well kept place to work but lacks any empathy or understanding for difficulties at work and always asks employees for opinions then blatantly ignores them
bad,"All it is about is about the numbers, "
bad,They have a lot of perks and bring in food for the employees.  They are very unorganized and don't have any people skills.  There is no way for a candidate to get a hold of anyone .. you are referreed to go to a website where someone should be able to help you but they don't.  They also will assign you a shift that doesn't work for you or you will wait for a long time for that shift to be available.  No communication between the management.
bad,Very Fast paced environment. Always risked losing your job if you were too slow. High demands of productivity. Not a job recommended for the lazy or weak.
bad,Typical day is your start out with all the associates and stretch before you go to your work area. I learned how to pack items properly and what items go in what boxes. The management wasn't too bad most of them were friendly and nice. The work place wasn't too bad most people were nice. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with the numbers. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.
bad,Very TOUGH place to work.  Work long days for some of us five days a week eleven hour days.  EVERYTHING is counted and measured then graded.   If your team is not preforming write them up have them dismissed.
bad,"Too much turnover equals a low amount of knowledge all the way around the company. Everything is constantly changing and no one can keep up. Too  much turnover.  They want more words here. Maybe a great start to your career, but everyone seems to level at the latest once their stocks vest."
bad,"It requires a special type of person to do this, but organizations vary. There are good apples and there are amazing teams and members. Trying to raise a family and working here is tough."
bad,"work culture Is like working in a mill in the 1950's , so serious, just do you work and go home. No warmth or feelings of a work family... You don't make the hrs.  promised, they send you home a lot once they meet their quarter instead of sending you to a different department to work and gain a new skill."
bad,"not a good place to work for a career"
bad,"Don't underestimate the demands of this job.  Typical shift is 10 hours and every minute is accounted for so be sure to use the washroom only during break time and always keep tab of the time.  It's a fairly independent job which pits colleague against colleague (Helping new employees is discouraged as it wastes time).  Many workers divide into language cliques so if you don't speak any of the major languages you might feel a little lonely depending on your shift."
bad,Very intensive work. Lots of benefits and okay pay but you borderline sprint for every dollar. Cut throat times and items picked per hour must stay high. The computers controlling amazon is so advanced that it knows when youve stopped moving inside the warehouse for an excessive amount of time and alerts a manager to come see what you are doing.
bad,this is a good temporary job. is fast paced and can take a lot of energy. management is very focused on productivity and meeting deadlines. they can sometimes be unspympathic
bad,Was my first ever job it scared me to ever work again but I found my way out  meet a lot of cool people there some became my closest friends good luck
bad,"At Amazon you have to meet numbers that are slightly to high and if you go to use the restroom your numbers will go to low and your manager will tell you that restroom breaks can only be at certain times. Also, Amazon finds reasons to fire people so they can replace them with new people at a lower pay rate."
bad,"Its cool when your first start, you really feel the burn, peak season is a monster, but working with a great team makes it better, good pay during peak."
bad,"overall the experience was okay besides the fact of the breaks not being long enough, and the long periods of standing and walking through the warehouse. the management was very understanding."
bad,My friends and other people kept me going there as long as I could. They are so strict there. You can’t get a break in without some coming to tell you about your numbers or if your have a bad day or suck someone would be over your shoulder to tell you about your numbers
bad,It was an easy work at home job helping customers with their online orders.  They even shipped you the main equipment needed. The Training was all online and remote which was great.
bad,I was cited and docked pay for a missed follow up and was later given an award for the extra work I had put in to one customer. A typical work day would be clocking in within 5 minutes of the mandatory time sit down and take phone calls for 9 hours.
bad,"Amazon.com is a good company to order from, but as a former worker of a distribution warehouse employee, I just didn't like the way they handled their employees."
bad,"hard work, long hours 9-13hr per day"
bad,"i love to work but when they no longer need you, you are literally thrown out or given the bare minimum schedule to say that you are employed but it is nothing you can live off of."
bad,A typical day at work starts with loading your van with a lot of parcels waiting in a big traffic in the Dartford depo.Around Christmas it was a mess there was a days with 140-160 stops and more than 230 parcels that was the hardest 3 weeks in amazon.If i have to be honest there were some enjoyable days with low number of parcels and a lot of friendly concierges but not everything can be good so when it comes time for salary every single time something went wrong  and i've got half money than my manager said i'll get.So i've got lied a lot of times and i just left them because of this.My boss was Bulgarian and he lied a lot of people from our company with a lot of money.
bad,"obscenities,discriminatory language with other   "
bad,"During peak you work 55hrs a week. After peak (holidays) there is very little work, and you may work 0hrs per week. They hire you on as permanent,but this is really only a seasonal position."
bad,"Absolutely horrid. the culture, the way the management treats people, what they expect from people, absolutely horrid. if you really wanna know what its like to work at amazon go to google and type in face of amazon"
bad,I grew to dislike working for amazon. The managers were awful and extremely strict on their employees making rate. It was so easy to get written up. My issue is that they never gave you a chance even if the problem isn’t your fault. It’s a just a temporary job to make fast money.
bad,Amazon has a lot of perks and  the reason for this to motivate employees to achieved there goals. The job becomes very repetitive after a while and boring.
bad,"It was a hard job, the team leaders/supervisors showed they did not care about employees. They did not care if you were sick or needed to leave work early because of a sickness"
bad,"Fast paced,  thought it was a picki order job..its not, you scan boxes put on pallets, shrink wrap and stage with pallet jacks..No Tow Motors.if you try and explain to some of the workers how to stack the pallets,  they give you attitude or totally ignore you. They don't think of safety just worried of their scam rates. You are promised at least 4-5 hours the days you work.. which is not so. When you are done , you are done even if you are there for only 3 hours.. so you have less pay in your check.Most I'd the Supervisors are awesome.. but there are 1 or 2 that work you hard like it's a sweat shop and there are alot that are disabled on the floor , then get harrassed. Especially on Wrap down which is 3rd shift"
bad,"At times this place was an exciting place to work for.  Most days were very challenging.  As a company, amazon does little to make the employees feel appreciated and gives the vibe that each employee is a ""number""."
bad,"As an it technician, I am re-imaging windows 10 laptops, troubleshooting various peripherals, re-configuring user accounts, resetting end users passwords."
bad,The job roll itself is sometimes quite rewarding but the management have been drafted in from all different backgrounds with little to no logistics experience which causes some issues. A lot of new ideas implemented but never really followed through. Feels like a lot of rational decisions are made without thinking of the consequences
bad,"we double check all the parcels, put all parcel inside my van and get a direction by computer sav-nat. We need to make sure all parcels are deliver on time. i'am be learned the customer service is the may issue every day. As a self employed, i also learning how sent TAXES returne to my accountant."
bad,"Its a job. Nothing more, nothing less. Politics play a big part in the mgmt hiring process. If you do go to amazon, go to the dock. You can move around a little bit."
bad,Very poor conditions for workers 
bad,"Amazon is a heavily costumer focussed company, which is great for the costumers. However the work conditions leave much to be desired, the ventilation is poor, which in a job that requires gratuitous ammounts of physical activity causes quick exhaustion and over heating. The management team often seems to know just as much and in some occasions even less then the associates know about what's happening in the company. There have been numorous complaints about HR being rude. Morale often appears to be low."
bad,"A part-time warehouse job that I used to pay the bills, but there is some bias when it comes to promotions and different department switches.If u need quick fast money its a good place to work but the doors are always turning when it comes to people getting fired and hired."
bad,"Simple work, nothing to complicated, no one pays attention to you unless you're not scanning. Fast pace work, HR is good help. Mind your own business."
bad,"Mauvaise boite, travaille a la chaine. "
bad,"Worked there for over three years and produced good numbers for them consistently. Had over ten managers during that time and most of them had very little work experience let alone management experience. Always having to impress someone new who is half your age is difficult when objectivity is not the top priority. Worked different shifts, different positions when needed, and did everything they asked of me. Was constantly overlooked for training that would help advance my career. Worked my butt off for them during one Christmas season only to be given a bad review because I had saved time off and took a month long vacation  a week before Christmas."
bad,"Nice place to work. Nice price. Hard work, enjoyed the job.  A lot of hours to work and good pay. Working  seven days a week. great pay check. Nice place. I wish I can do that again.  Got tired everyday, please."
bad,"I enjoyed the challenge of creating custom product descriptions for vendors. Written in Amazon's customer-friendly, ""honest-broker"" voice, these descriptions added value without overt or aggressive promotion. Selected from an assignment queue, each assignment was completed on a tight schedule using available image assets. I found the team friendly and the work satisfying. However, my brief experience in Vendor Services was interrupted by a serious injury, necessitating a switch to another role at a different employer."
bad,"Je n’ai pas trop aimer, les bouchons, les horraires, pas une bonnes ambiance"
bad,Things seem to be out of order at every which way and every night that I return to work. I feel as though it is the blind leading the blind. They seem to be expanding far and fast thus leading to cutting out various key things within certain warehouse.
bad,"Hard work!!! The pace is extremely high and you need to be able to keep that pace if you want to be considered for advancement. Amazon takes care of there employees with different perks like orca cards, company stock, gift cards etc but if you don’t have a 4yr degree your not going to be able to advance into a leadership position.  You won’t have to worry about getting hours because there’s always work to be done but it is very hard work and the pay doesn’t match the labor and you can only advance so far before hitting a ceiling."
bad,"At my facility,  they allow the men to barely work and have the female do all of the man power. Very little room for advancement. Very little communication between leadership, hr, and associates. Favoritism is a major role here."
bad,"Long hours, mandatory 50-60 hours during Christmas time."
bad,It’s very easy to get fired at Amazon if you don’t make rate or to many shorts hardest part about this job is very physical and stressful trying to make rate without having shorts also on your feet for 10 hours a day. They have very good benefits .
bad,"Mon expérience chez Amazon n'a pas était très satisfaisante pour cause "
bad,"Very cut throat and uncooperative culture. Working with other teams was always difficult and unavoidable, only ever looking after themselves. This attitude tended to trickle down from the top. My skip level manager loved to say all the time, ""Your problems aren't my problems."""
bad,"continuous streams of boxes and jiffies to sort, the work flow never stop until no more, very stressful job on your feet all the time, very physical demanding not ideal for long term"
bad,"Hard work and a stressful environment. Every day you are physically exhausted. If you like intense work then this job is for you. Back work environment, hot and loud."
bad,"You spend your entire day in a silent box, no music and you're not allowed to speak to anyone. You also don't get benefits unless you're a blue badge. During peak, you're locked in, you can't ask for time off. Even if your wife is giving birth, your only allowed to leave if someone dies. The HR's are great, best thing about this job. The culture is pointless, they put balloons up on certain days and act happy, but you only really experience the ""culture"" 0.01% of the time you're there. The hardest part of the job is not driving yourself to the point of insanity with how deep you sink into the thought that your life is slowing passing away inside that boring box. The most enjoyable part was clocking out. If you're a social person, I'd recommend you stay away from here. Also, if you have any sort of skill like design, sales, or even customer service, I recommend you benefit from those and find a job in those fields. Working here you'll quickly discover, you'd rather work part time exploiting your skills, than working what seems like endless hours here, for what in reality, isn't even that much money. Well it's definitely not worth thousands of hours of your life."
bad,"This company surprised me the pay was horrible,you work like a dog and get paid like a Slave!!!Amazon is a Billion dollar company,I expected better.....The saying goes you get what you pay for...."
bad,"This job fulfilled a purpose for some time. I guess it was useful on a temporary basis for paying bills. But, ultimately, I do not think that I really liked the job that much."
bad,"WOrk days are busy days.  was ok untill went to ten hour shifts then took another day on top of drive time they won't pay you for.  You have to walk a good amount up and down stairs.  If you have to have a knee brace i don't think you should be able to work there.  Your feet will get blisters, after a week off, and the cardboard really dries your hands out. Fifteen minute rest times are short and you should probably just take them in the isles.  Cause as the time you walk to your rest area and back they are only five min."
bad,"They hire several in for this position each year and make promises of keeping you on and giving you a full-time position after you help them get through the Christmas rush.  This is a carrot on a stick dangled out in front of you or better yet a lie!  The department is very cut-throat and if you're doing a better than the normal job you get singled out to be gotten rid of because you are a threat for getting promoted before those there before you.   Some in HR are two-faced and will lie to you with a big smile on their face.  Very cut-throat staff in the Amcare office, they will set you up just to get you out of the competition."
bad,"I learned to operate a stand up hi lo the job is not hard but everything is documented and you are required to stay on task every minute your on the clock if not you can and will be fired, this job has a high turn over rate."
bad,"Not For PPl from Streamlined Company"
bad,the people i work with are good people.  management is in need of a back bone and not bend to people that don't work.  and if you  are a woman you will move up quick.
bad,It was a fairly unorganized warehouse. The biggest issue I had with Amazon was the faulty equipment. They would expect us to make rate but our equipment was never up to par.
bad,"I've learned that this job is stressful, they over work you for the amount of pay you receive, the breaks are lousy and their policies are a joke. They are strict and by the book with their policies negating the fact that each warehouse is different and has different problems. It is modern day slavery and they need a union!"
bad,"Amazon is a nice place to work most people are cool some showed  favoritism but I didn’t care I just went to get the job done , they work u a lot and don’t give a long enough break & they don’t have  sympathy  of the personal things u have to deal with"
bad,i time at amazon was horrible... i was not pain on time had to wait over a month to get my first check... my manger did not even know the shifts or if i even workeds there
bad,Would not let any of my friends go near that hole worst 2 years of my left where spent at amazon. Would not go back even if they paid me $20 an hour or even 25.
bad,You got to many people trying to run this place . people are getting fired left and right . the Manger don't help like they say they will and they write you up for stupid stuff that's not your fault .
bad,I was employed through a third party company called Staff Management. Unfortunately they weren't very good at managing us effectively in a number based environment they failed to tell you your numbers until it was to late to make a positive change.
bad,They provide a lot of paid time off and benefits but to work on your feet 10 hours a day is exhausting even to those in the best of shape.  They have a revolving door job culture and do not care about employees.
bad,"Very developing company, but a very demanding company. This job is ideal for someone who has nothing else going on and want to make Amazon their life career choice."
bad,"lack of communication, disrespectful leaders and ambassadors, no growth, stressful environment, hostile environment.  Treat associates with no respect.  Unfair practices"
bad,"Bland daily briefs"
bad,Very unorganized. I would advise you to qork their if you have to and get your money and get out. You will not last long. I didn't even last 3 weeks with all the extra work. Get another job or better yet get your CDLs or go baxk to school!
bad,Amazon will pile more and more work on you until you break. I worked here 4 years; beginning in the Sort Center Operations. I changed to Seattle as a Project Manager -same story. I hated life and I was glad when I got out of there.
bad,Run away from this company as fast as you can. Work life balance is not very good at all. it may seem like a good idea at the time but it isn't. this concludes this review.
bad,"Amazon isn't what they say on commercials. They start you at base pay depending on what location, like Wisconsin (Mke1, Mke5) $12.25. Not $15. False advertisement I'd say."
bad,Very poor work environment; cut throat and very stressful. I learned that unless you are tick skinned you don't work in a call center environment.....
bad,"You are basically a number on a spreadsheet and just a another cog in the machine called Amazon. You were required to work mandatory overtime ranging from 10 to 11.5 hours with minimal breaks. They state that you have 15 minutes breaks; however depending on where your workstation was within the warehouse and travel time to and from the break room it is more or less a 10 minute break. Oftentimes everything felt rushed, I never had enough time to and enjoy my meal at lunchtime or just sit down and have a snack at break even using the restroom you had to hurry up. I found it depressing how I entered the facility when it was dark outside and left when it was dark and of course you are allowed during lunch to leave and go outside but keep in mind that lunch is only 30 minutes and travel times to and from places are long and Amazon micromanages its associates to the very second."
bad,"You would have to meet a quota everyday and if they weren't meant, well bye bye job. I would meet the quota but the job was tiring and it was to high to meet."
bad,"It is very fast paced.  They watch you and evaluated you every day to see if your are working fast enough, if not they write  you up and threaten to fire you."
bad,Amazon was a fast but stressful environment  I was 18 when I first applied for the seasonal job and help me with financial issues but I️ would not recommend anyone to work there
bad,Management is ok depending on which location you work at. Weekly pay only around peek season is when they do a lot of hiring and after it dies down you are more than likely to get laid off.
bad,Working in logistics it was a very slow paced day with short bursts of high intensity and high stress moments. The attitude is very cut throat and out to get you. They are very unprofessional in the training you receive upon arrival. I went through no orientation and was not scheduled for any training. Everything I learned how to do I had to learn through observation or asking a coworker how to do something. I did not even meet my manager until my 4th week on the job.
bad,"managers need more training on how to handle people , and getting their products and vehicles up to date. other than that its a very nice place to work . good pay , flexible schedules ..."
bad,"Amazon can be a fun place to work over the holidays but its very competitive to be hired on to permanent employee. Many of my coworkers as well as myself, felt as though Amazon wasn't the place for them after a year of working there"
bad,There were very short breaks. Hands were always cool  and the management did not care for our safety. Keeping up with the pace was too hard. We did not ever make the quota for the produce.
bad,"Working overnight, 10+ hours. Compensation wasn't adequate for what was needed. If you weren't an amazonian you were treated differently, mainly looked down upon."
bad,"Enjoy your life with purchase in Amazon  per"
bad,they use you up then dispose of you i would noooot !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i think they should convert workers whom demonstrate great work on a day to day basis not make them wait
bad,"Poor place to work, treatment terrrible, it's like a modern day plantation where even if you have to use the bathroom its counted against your production."
bad,"Amazon is the type of workplace where, if you're desperate for money and you don't really care for the stuff you have to deal with it then its perfect. I personally would not work there again for the solid fact that i was poorly treated and was punished for being a hard worker. They put me down for my upbeat attitude and put me down for trying to move up in the workplace. They hire people with business degrees and no work experience to be managers and will put you to blame if your manager does something to hurt your job. I would not recommend working here if you want to work in a fun environment where you can enjoy your job and try to move up because Amazon is not the place where you can start at the bottom and move up."
bad,This will work you so hard for so little made you stay over every day during peak season . this was a very stress place to work all the cared about was numbers not the staff
bad,unless you want to constantly have someone breathing down your neck and getting written up for things that are completely out of your control don't do it.
bad,"This job was very stressful. I would get bad anxiety EVERY TIME I got there. Sometimes you'd travel wayyyyy out there just to be told to leave Cuz it was too many people on the shift. Parking was always packed and it was a lot of immature people working there, they hired anybody who could pass a cheap swab for drugs. Defiantly not for me a single mom of 2 very small kids."
bad,"Worked off hours (3p-12a) worked a lot of hours, management was poor, culture was low morale, did learn a lot regarding systems and strategic analysis"
bad,amazon is not a challenging job. They have a high turnover rate and i believe it will only work out for people that is coming right out of high school more than it will help people who want a career job
bad,"To fast for me, to demanding, I would think this is more for the young at heart. You need to be in good shape to work there. It's a lot of standing on your feet"
bad,"they make big mistakes and the delivery driver must pay for that . is unbeliveble.      we as drivers,  work like 13 hours per day ...we do every day 100- 130 mile driving."
bad,"the management team did not know what they were doing. lack of commununication. they always wanted more, and they put people where they knew would fail and leace them there even if u asked to be moved."
bad,"It was a very stressful, physically demanding job causing one to feel almost as just another worker for the company, I never met my manager and felt almost lost since he warehouse is so big"
bad,"In all FC's the amount of work is unbalanced, area managers may put you on rate and work very hard to meet it, or they may put you in direct moving stuff around relaxing but it get boring after a while, rotation of jobs never happens no matter how many time you ask because the rate of quiting the jobs in first weeks very high and most associates quit like me get fed up and quit after a year or so. I don't recommend advancement or what they called it you getting same wage if you moving pallets around or problem solver which is very stressful job for most people, if you are lucky and get to process assistance position the amount of stress in this position not worth the money. In my FC driving pit is a must in bc min wage of driving pit same wage as process assistance however they justify low wage by having what they called great benefits its great in states but in canada all get basic healthcare and most other warehouses offer full package even the worse one offer extended heath package. If you have week to waste try it your self and see if you can have fun as Amazonian say"
bad,"Did you like high school? If you said yes, than this is the company for you. Prepare to be extremely over managed and paid the same as everyone else working a minimum wage job give or take two dollars. If you like sitting in a chair for 8-12 hours a day dealing with extremely difficult customers than this is the job for you. Middle management is a joke, as they set unrealistic expectations for new employees, and your co-workers will try to gain points to stay employed by acting like your friend while reporting you to HR for any nonsense they can come up with. Imagine a bunch of monkeys throwing feces, but doing so with class, all to keep their mediocre lives entertaining and the managers looking in the opposite direction of them. lol this is a job that 85% of people leave within the first month on the floor, 10% like my self struggle to meet expectations and unrealistic standards, 5% are phone gods who probably have medical enhancements making them kill it on the floors."
bad,"Richmond site has poor management.  No HR on site to ensure that managers are acting within acceptable company and state law parameters.   Received 1 day of training when hired told that we would receive 3 days of training.  High turnover rate. Mangers not adept or consistent in instruction with work direction.  No mechanism in place for capturing work hours if a badge is lost or inadvertently misplaced.  High turnover rate due to poor management on site."
bad,Too many people working on one shift. Numbers to meet is outrageous. Got 3 floors to pick from and maybe even have to go to the other side of the warehouse. Temps are never working. Even with all the cameras everywhere.
bad,"Although I learned a great deal there, the culture is not conducive to a positive work experience. The benefits were excellent, however the local pay scale was below average."
bad,"People are not friendly to work with, everything is unorganized and a mess. The hours are good but they encourage you to take Voluntary Time Off so they don't lose money by having you work. It's hard to make rate because of the lack of work and if you don't make rate you are terminated."
bad,"People choose by themselves to be in this kind of place. Thats not too bad, but at the same time it nothing good. People are thinking less when working in there."
bad,This is not worth working because it over works you for no reason. We are doing day shifts work because there is no work for us to do. People there don't do their jobs when others do.
bad,"the layout of the pickface when i was there was all over the place, making pickers take un orderly routes which were pointless. "
bad,"only hires people 4:00 am - 9:00 am only part-time I wouldn't really recommend it because of that, very hot a/c doesn't really work its not that bad if you absolutely need a job though"
bad,"Huge work load"
bad,"weekly production rates not right,  extreme heat,mandatory overtime, UPT ,TOT,were confusing, Even after I received a school accommodation, the system kept taking my UPT.  Most of the people in HR were very helpful and so were my AM and PM but  use restroom= big problem for them.  I thought production rates were inaccurate"
bad,"A typical day at work would be getting down to the factory floor."
bad,"Start working immediately with little to inadequate training. Heavy lifting from above your head on portable stairs to the ground. Stacking heavy (up to 50lbs.) products up to 6 feet high. Very large or long packages not easily handled. Division of work seems random."
bad,"bonne ambiance "
bad,"I had a great time working there the people were friendly and easy to get along with.  If they had more hours and better management not someone fresh out of high school who doesn't know what there doing, maybe more people would stay."
bad,"Working at Amazon is no joke! You have to be a very strong person mentally! And this job can be the death of you physically! The pay is not worth the pain you go through working here, and management is awful! You do have room to grow however, if you make it that far. Do you like breaks? Well you better not expect them, because taking one is almost impossible!"
bad,"The Amazon were speeding then slow.. Mostly of time it was slow business so they had to laid me off and only work there for 3 months."
bad,Their company is not what I thought it would be I like it last first but then I got to overwhelming .At times I was ready to quit but I stuck it out . I needed to kind another job.
bad,"Good job for Christmas cash, plenty of overtime. Clean work environment. Must be able to walk at least ten miles every shift, have good footwear. Igf you have back problems, this job will make them worse."
bad,"Mandatory overtime for 3/4 of the year, poor management, only care about numbers, if you are good at one job you will be only doing that the rest of the time. "
bad,Amazon prime is a very fast paced job. You are on your feet your entire shift. Management was very helpful whenever I had questions. The most enjoyable part of the job would be that your work day goes by very quickly because you are always busy.
bad,"Amazon Fresh was a decent place when I first started working there. A little slow and whatnot, not too much work but not too little, just right. That is until they switched the managers, everything then went downhill."
bad,"They go through people very quickly, management doesn't truly care about you, too harsh on certain departments while very relaxed in others. On the plus side, coworkers were helpful and nice, the paid time off, unpaid time off, and voluntary time off was nice."
bad,"if you're really about the money and nothing else, yeah. go for it. otherwise. i would not recommend it. there's not much life left in you after work. and it gets you bald faster than you could ever thought it can happen. don't . it's gonna eat your soul and strip you off your humanity. #corporateAmerica #youalreadyknowit"
bad,typical day was the normal same old day scan boxes until they are gone. good pay and a clean warehouse the job was fairly simple did not involve too much thinking very simplified and and basic work.
bad,"The job itself is not bad, the work is simple and not to stressful.  The part about it that made it bad was the managers and how they ran the building (picking favorites, bad attitude)."
bad,This job was hard. Treated you like robots. Not enough time to eat n not allowed drinks on shop floor. Walk to toilets was way to far aswelk keep avin to sugn in n out every time u move
bad,"management sucks, a lot of favoritism and opportunities  to learn and move up are not for everyone due to that thing in particular unless you kiss their a**"
bad,"The safety is well overlooked, the temperature gets to about 100. Everyone is underpaid, and if you do not maintain a certain speed, you will get fired."
bad,"Zero work life balance, negative culture. Constantly preaching ""team"" but very cut throat. Company is growing too fast and constant management moves hurt morale"
bad,"Amazon has a 10 hour a day four days a week with mandatory overtime during the busy season.  The days can be long and management has a tendency to harass if they don't get there way.  Many young, immature, and disrespectful managers are part of the workplace.  The practice of allowing associates on the same pay scale to ""supervise"" is lazy and dishonest. When overtime is plentiful you can nicely supplement your base income"
bad,"I just started working here IND5 & let me tell you, this is my last day here. They expect a lot from you at once and don't get me started on the walking and the distance. This place is HUGE. The work itself isn't bad but they want you to pick at a rate of 85-95% in an hour and it's physically exhausting.You have to walk from basically one end of the building to the other. You feel like a robot and you just feel even more terrible after work. Your whole body is terribly sore.  You're walking at least 20 miles a day for a four days a week and the breaks are b.s because once you get to the break room you have to turn right back around to get back to work. It's really not a great place to work unless you're truly desperate. 10 hour days for a 30 minute lunch and a not so 2 15 mins break which is really like 5 minutes, ridiculous"
bad,"You walk into work and clock in. Then you go to your designated area and listen to todays instructions. After that thats when the managers become zombies and act like hawks and watch your every movement. Management were poorly qualified for their jobs they never really help you with anything or give you a good explanation of whats going on. The amazon company treats you like a number, and by having the managers walk the catwalks looking down on us made me felt i was on the movie life."
bad,"This job is too physically demanding and they work you for too long.  The job consist of 2 jobs at the same time, which makes it hard on Stowers. They always press you to make rate and give you write-ups if you don't achieve the excepted time."
bad,they have a cutthroat attitude with limited days off they cant seem to have good management or a good hr team. You will be written up for just about anything that has to do with rates
bad,"good place to start working but they will change things daily, they will write you up quicker than ever and they work you like robots  you have to be in a certain click to get any where in this company"
bad,it a OK place to work. i hated working there . the hours was horrible and i didn't like working there.the pay was good but standing in one spot i didn't like.
bad,"All departments must meet quota based off of trucks due in , workload and employees per day/shift."
bad,"A typical day as an IT Support Technician is getting to work, clocking in, listen about all the opportunities that you missed because you are on night shift and have no interaction with your manager, look at the ticket queue, check emails, and then proceed with the daily tasks. "
bad,"The hours are extremely long, especially for a nightshift. Lots of foreign employees who do not follow the rules and have no sanctions given by the staff. Overall, a nightmare."
bad,The the company is overrated and the turnover rate is very high they like to hire young people with no experience they do a lot of hiring around peak season and firing after peak season and cutting hours but peak season is the only time you really can make some real money other then that there's really no real money there to be made unless you're like a higher-up manager I really think all the money that Amazon is making they could pay their workers a lot more and treat them a little better
bad,"The work was very productive, the breaks were very short, didn't have anywhere to sit, standing for long periods of time. Had to walk back and forth from vehicles to work. Sometimes work badges would not work which caused people to be late for shift."
bad,"A very nice company to work for however, very very hard work lifting 50lbs of items that customers order online. Management are just ok. Just like I said very very hard labor work lifting big huge microwaves, bar bells, car tires and car batteries. Lifting 40to 50 lbs bags of dog and cat food that customers order to put onto my truck that we ship out to the customers. 75 inch TVs very hard work ."
bad,Great way to make several hundred extra bucks for Christmas presents but they start letting people go as soon as the holidays are over. Seemed like a nice place to work if you could get on there permanently.
bad,"Amazon is the most unorganized place you can work for. They don't notify you when they relocate you. The managers are rude as for the employees at a higher rank. Lunches were not free, you had to pay or bring your own.Overall it was too far a commute to keep working here."
bad,If you don't mind being thrown in a truck for half the day with minimal lunch breaks and overtime on your days off then this is the job for you.......
bad,"Didn't feel valued, despite being one of the top workers and a go to person. My ideas to improve my work area were ignored, while employees from other departments would come to my area to observe for a week, and make changes that were absurd. These changes would be changed back quickly, and still no one ever asked those who work in"
bad,"The managers say one thing but never follow up with their promises. They say its a good place for advancements but there's a cap off point. You can only go so far then it stops there. You never know what you are going to do. When you are put somewhere you haven't been in a while they do not re-teach or even care to remind you. If you are not making rate we are told during orientation that managers/supervisor will ask you ""What your barriers are? What is preventing you from making rate? Is there anything that will help you?"" but they do not do that at all. You are told that you are not making rate and if you don't speed it up you'll get a warning, or wrote up (depending on your supervisor) after 3 write ups you're fired. If you're lucky though you can talk to certain managers and they will help you and look into what's going on. But don't count on it, as that does not happen often."
bad,Most departments at amazon have a rate that you must get. if you do not hit the rate you will be fired. the rates also keep increasing. management isn't the greatest. they place people in management positions who know nothing about the department and are trained by tier 1 employees(entry level employee). and many of the managers have no experience at managing employees or the work itself. the hardest part is to stay dedicated because there is little immediate compensation. they say that they give monthly bonuses but if the whole building doesn't hit their goal then there is no bonus. also it is hard to advance and to be developed. after 3 years you will not receive anymore raises. and everyone receives the same raise no matter attendance or performance. performance doesn't mean more money or that you will get promoted. performance is not looked at for anything other than if you don't hit rate you may be fired. the best part was the long term benefits and the other associates.
bad,I worked at Amazon for 4 years the company seem to be get worser and worser all about famer risen if you get along with the managers you are ok any mistakes they try and kick you out as soon as possible now
bad,This is a fast paced no holds bar place you will either make it or quit because you are tired and you are treated as expendable so don't make target rate you will be fired.
bad,Not a right place to work for an Accountant. More of IT professional company. No proper planning & management. NO work life balance. No good management
bad,"I am working at Amazon as a stopgap between college and my eventual career as an engineer. While the job pays well, the hours are extremely long, and the months leading up to Christmas are a nightmare. "
bad,"If you are looking for a job in which you believe in being treated with disregard to any form of dignity than this is a job for you. after being employed there for almost three years i was treated like dirt with no regard to age or physical disabilities. i hated being there every day . they only care about their profit margin and people can be replaced with little or no regard. during peak you get overtime to the max, 4 -60 hour weeks, thats 10 hrs a day , 6 days a week, for a month."
bad,It's really hard because you work 10 hour shifts everyday and there they can force you to do and extra 10 hour shift so you can work up to 60 hour weeks which is good if your looking for 60 hours.
bad,"Place can be dangerous. Management pulls pallet wrappers to pinch pennies so pallets made of small boxes, big boxes, envelopes are able to fall over at any time. They get dangerous when six feet in the air and puzzle pieced with all these pieces. Management doesn't care. Easy to take off work when you don't feel well or have something else you'd rather do. Hours are cut back. Hard to pay bills. This is mad money job only. Have another one for staple."
bad,Don't expect to advance or to be treated as value at this place they care about is making money not making their employees feel like they matter. I don't suggest anyone with kids work here because they don't accommodate parents
bad,The day is very long. There is not a lot of opportunity for advancement. It is hard balancing work/life/school balance. The pto is not good at all. Doctor notes are not accepted which makes it harder for single parents if their children have a doctors appointment.
bad,"This is a job, that's it. There is a big problem with communication amongst Amazon employees. Management never has any information for the employees and they have favorites and certain people who can break as many rules as they want without being reprimanded. While other workers are not treated equally nor cared about. Amazon only cares about their numbers and NOT their employees."
bad,"must work to time set goals"
bad,"This position offers you little to no work-life balance. You need to be fully committed to your job in order to succeed. Additionally, their is little on boarding and you are essentially ""thrown"" into the fire."
bad,Management is terrible and treats anyone in a lower position like a dog. The money is decent if you enjoyed being yelled at for not doing anything wrong and feeling unwanted.
bad,Enjoyed working for Amazon but didn't agree with the management plan and only having the chance for overtime at Christmas and not being able to advance in the company as it capped for anyone who hasn't got a degree or if the management team wouldn't let you progress
bad,Experience there was ok. Very unorganized at times. Not sure what else to say as I was fired unfairly. I had a doctors note to excuse the days I was out but it was not acceptable.
bad,"I dislike amazon after I worked there for a year but I was going to school so I didn't want to quit before I finished. Your body gives out, your mind gets bored, and mangers don't give any care in the world about you. I would never work for Amazon again it has cause me some great pain in my body. Lets just say this is coming from someone who loved their job."
bad,"Not a nice place to work, they don't care about employees needs"
bad,They work you like a slave and if you can't make your rate while you are there you start to accrue right up and you can get a write up per week. After 3 write ups you're up for termination and they will give you a write up even if the machines broke down so long as at least one other person made rate that day
bad,It really depends on who the manager is. Most managers look at you like numbers but there are a select few who are amazing. Most of the people that work there are nice and hate it probably as much as you will. HR is lazy. Only rarely will they actually HELP you. Day shift has to usually do all night shifts work and never get to home early while night shift doesn't even have to come it. They were in the process of fixing that last I heard.
bad,"company lay off "
bad,it is good environment to work. cant spend time with your family. with out much experience didnt get manager jobs. good infrastructure. i have learned handle the pressure situation
bad,"Working for amazon as an associate isn't bad if you don't mind long hours and harsh working conditions."
bad,Le fait de devoir marcher sans s’arrêter peut parfois être pénible.
bad,"It's a place of complete monotony.  The rates usually make it really stressful.  You hardly get any holiday time, and often get short notice of overtime.  It's a decent place to work seasonally or for a year, but you eventually get fed up with the monotony."
bad,"This employer offers no training.  When employees start, they are expected to do their jobs and figure things out as they go.  Management really does not listen to employees."
bad,"As a tech company I have heard nothing but great things about Amazon.  However; this was not the case in regards to the logistics and Supply Chain business.  I was fortunate to learn quite a bit in regards to how a large company in the midst of rapid expansion handles personnel issues.  The culture consisted of an underlying... almost unspoken theme of one specific way to get ahead. I believe that there is ample opportunity but it just isn't for everyone.  Management is highly concerned with numbers as they should be however the rapid rate of expansion can swallow you up and spit you out if you aren't in a position to take full advantage of what is offered."
bad,Very unorganized breaks are to short by the time you get to the first of the building your break is finished breaks go by scan to scan. your being timed constantly. Management is misleading and they play favoritism. I had to asking over and over to be trained in the OP.
bad,"You are a number to them, a production target. Nothing more than that. If you do not make production goals you will be given written warnings and then let go."
bad,"Very long hours, benefits on day one but takes months to use them, unforgiving absences. The supervisors arnt helpful on site, I learned more from the people working next to me who did the jobs of there superiors."
bad,"This  was a great experience with the assignment, but integrity was by far one of the worst temp. services i've worked for.  They had a high turn over rate."
bad,learn new jobs new equipment good pay and insurance hours pretty good Management not together on things One will say do this and another will say against policy
bad,Working at a amazon warehouse is very oppressive. The management team was very poor at informing associates about schedule changes. The HR department had miss recorded associates PTO and UPT on many occasions.
bad,"Picker and packer all over the place "
bad,"They tell you that rate must always be at 100% but when you are low on rate and quality they either let you know immediately or up to three weeks later. Rates are hard to keep up if you have heavy boxes that are not open or only boxes as this slows down the stower."
bad,"Working at amazon was fun at first,they promise you all these incentives seems like the perfect job. Until... You start the manual labor nothing is good enough fir them they want u to basically kill yourself just to get packages out.They make it  mandatory  for u to stay a extra hour every day n when it gets to busy make u go home. U work five hours in a no air condition warehouse for a ten minute break!!!! If u a minute late coming rom break ,mind u it takes five minutes to walk from your lane to the break room they scan your badge and send your home. The managers scream at u all day no matter how hard you work to get more packages. They lied and said seasonal assignment ends at the last day of the week in the first week of january but it ended a week earlier.Basically working here is like working in a sweat shop. They dont care about your well being my co worker almost passed out one day they told her to drink some water and get back to work."
bad,I have worked for Amazon in late 2015 in Swansea's Warehouse. It was difficult to work..working about 12 hour days and constantly running around. Yes the work is easy but over 12 hours its painful also the management were disgraceful but the co-workers and the pay were great.
bad,This is a large company easy work but constant moving and walking. The company isn't as open to certain workers as the temp agencies like the lead on.
bad,"Entire year was filled with great learning and exposure with global teams"
bad,"Amazon offers great health insurance and the stock options are nice as well, however Amazon is not a place for single parents; nor is it a place for anyone who wants to have a life outside of work. All before when ships were only 10 hours all of these things was possible. Now that they have it changed to 12 hour shifts this things are no longer possible. Amazon is a modern-day sweatshop. Management are biased and show favoritism."
bad,"This is a very fast-paced work environment with extreme pressure to meet and exceed quotas.  The job requires continuous standing, constant bending, reaching and lifting of items up to 50 lbs."
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job is to lead a team to success and also lead associates who wants to grow with the company so they can take the knowledge I taught them and share it with others to be better at what they do or to make a difference in operations to meet good numbers and to make customers satisfied.
bad,"It was not the job for me being i had a lot of panic knowing school was going to start and it sucked."
bad,"Amazon in Reno is a decent place but very stressful, not because of the work or workload but rather because of inexperienced leadership trying to make a name for themselves. It high on intimidation, you could be a stower over 100% everyday for two weeks, have one bad day and get written up."
bad,You will work until you drop.management owns you & you need the money so don't talk back. Agree with management. Don't talk about anything you don't want everyone to repeat. HR is a joke while managers back up corporate. Customer driven money spending bonus making penny pinching dog eat dog management straight out of college.
bad,The only downfall about working for a school district is that raises and even some jobs are based  on school budgets. So it's hard to stay in a single role.
bad,"The hours did not work with the fact that I am a single mother, looking to make a better living for myself and kids. Had to end up leaving"
bad,Amazon has really good benefits but they over work you and expect you to rush for breaks and lunches. Some of the managers pick on the people there.
bad,Management is all young kids straight out of college.  Many managers and regular employees have vendettas or enjoy to impose power over others.  The managers will believe anything they hear and won't bother to fact check or give the info a 2nd htought.  You will be given performance reviews 1-4x per shift and  told to work faster and with no mistakes.  The environment isn't good for hearing so use the ear plugs provided.  The lowest starting pay is better than average and there are great benefits.  Any advancement or skilled labor can fetch more money elsewhere.
bad,"I was put into ICQA and we basically were left alone after one day of training to be left to count bins. It was awful mind numbing. The place is so big you cant possibly find your way about. I was left to count this huge pallet of more than 1,000 items and the gun logged me out so I hat to put all the stuff back into the pallet. "
bad,Everything about working here sucked.  They don't care about you.  Too worried about getting your numbers and being off task.
bad,"very hard work, great atmosphere, always stays busy just slow in the summer. pay was great during peak season. management was alawys alert and understanding"
bad,"fast pace work environment, on your feet, can not sit down, bathroom breaks are frown upon. you are constantly being monitored"
bad,"Living in Dundee the very early travel to Dunfermline was a nightmare. Leave at 5.30am arrive 6.30am cannot start until 7.30am. Leave at 6.30pm back home just before 8 in bed for 9.00pm. No work life balance during week."
bad,"The work itself was extremely easy with tasks I am associated with such as forklift driving, lifting heavy items and moving at a fast pace. But, employees would be expected to work 10-12 hour shifts with constant work ranging to 3 hours with only 10 minute breaks. I've learned that anyone can be let go easily regardless of personal problems or experience. The only good thing was some of the employees as they were friendly and easy to work with. Aside from that, it's not a place people last very long at."
bad,"I had a mixed experience at amazon. The pay was excellent, but their trianing was severely lacking. I felt a lot of pressure to work faster than I could due to inadequate training."
bad,"Amazon is an ok place to work. They pretty good pay, with great benefits. There some good incentives as well. However, Amazon cares more about numbers then they do their associates."
bad,There are no words to describe how brutal and inattentive this location can be to newcomers. Falsifying their stats and making  accusations to remove employees that are high risk is common practice.
bad,"pretty hectic on a typical work day, met a lot of people and made a few lasting friendships, learned how to work hard, learned to be punctual and the company is a stickler for rules(lateness, absenteeism and rule breakage are severely punished), management was tough with workers , and the company is a stickler for meeting goals"
bad,"Amazon isn't a totally terrible place to work...as long as you're willing to insistently do the same thing over and over and over. It isn't back breaking or really physically challenging, just a fast paced, frenetic grind. Benefits are fairly decent and cheap, and you also get bi-weekly increments of paid personal time, vacation and restricted stocks after 2 years, so that helps. Just not worth it to me."
bad,not one of the best places to work for unless you don't mind working everyday from 8am to 9pm as they'll give you the most parcels they can with the worst delivery route ever.I worked 3 days with them but never again as they're not very helpful at all when a problem does arise not to mention these robbers didn't pay me either
bad,"productive great place to work love the hours,very very clean enviroment human resources very helpful to the employees and their concerns.lots of friends."
bad,"hardest part of the job was standing at work station for 10.5 hours everyday, and didn't get to choose own shift and wasn't easy getting a shift change"
bad,"just another warehouse job, hot during the summer, and cold during the winter. cool people though, supervisors arent too happy to be friends"
bad,Amazon is more into building the company opposed to building people. Not a great place to work at. The turn over rate is extremely high. Would not recommend this company to anyone.
bad,long hours and constant steady flow of work not enough time for break. 10 hour shifts 4 days straight with 45 min total of a break. Not much movement once your at a station.
bad,"Safety first. Work hard, have fun, make history. But unfortunately not everything is safe, not everything is fun, but it is work hard and make history"
bad,Amazon has great benefits however poor management and organizational culture. Experienced workers are not valued and often overlooked for younger workers with less experience.
bad,"Overall the most important thing that kept me at this position was the benefits, the paid time off, vacation time and unpaid time provided to us. I had some great coworkers"
bad,"Extremely hard to get promoted in this place. Everyone's job is so repetitive that it should be illegal. The pay doesn't even account for what other warehouses pay in the area since this warehouse is considered retail and not your typical warehouse. Amazon likes to outsource their managers instead of promoting from within. You're lucky to even have your manager for a few months since they transfer or change their shifts on a regular basis. Some jobs have double standards, such as having a rate in certain departments and some departments not even having rates which makes your job security much harder when you have a rate to meet."
bad,Amazon is ok at times but its has problems in its management. It is hard to move up and i think that favoritism plays a major role in the company. My coworkers are fun to be around. The hardest part of the job is getting management to understand. The most enjoyable part of the job is its benefits.
bad,"Amazon has a great formula for a job.  It's a shame that they consistently fall short making they're employees enjoy being there.  Is it any wonder that they have to hire so many people each year that have never done the job before, despite hiring upwards of 4000 people during their busy season alone?"
bad,"Depending on your department, you will walk about to twenty miles per day, which is not the worst part. Every job is repetitive with very little variation. Pay raises are regular, but they are small at twenty-five cents every six months, topping out after three years, so really it is not so much a raise as a regular cost of living adjustment. Most people work four ten-hour shifts, with three days off. "
bad,This is a good company to work for as long as you lift up to 50 pounds by yourself and do not have to miss work for more than a week (medically necessary or not)
bad,"Working at Amazon definitely was an experience. Before they hired me they had gave me and some others the option of shift preference. Finally when we all came to orientation, took three months to get an orientation, they gave all of us the same wack shift, the worst hours and days. As a stower it's miserable and repetitive. You are ALWAYS being watched, everyday someone random actually comes up to you, interrupts your counting, wants to scan your badge and just walks away without saying anything. So many times I lost my track of count and made errors because of the frequent auditors coming up to all day long it's ridiculous!! Don't even get me started on the rates. For an entire month I made top production, top 10%, no errors at all. I got ZERO recognition for it. Some wack paper Amazon dollars that you can only spend in the warehouse! My manager still gave me a hard time. The rules are a joke, feels just like high school they got a five minute Grace period bell and everything. They give you 5 minutes to come back from break and start working immediately or you get harassed and they write you up for ""time off task"" if you're idle for 3 minutes. This warehouse is huge, It has 3 floors, how can you expect anyone to get anywhere in that warehouse within 5 minutes. The rules make you feel like a robot. It would be one thing if they gave you a little recognition for working hard there. But they don't, they're constantly on you about numbers rates and extra stuff. This place needs better job morale. They nitpick at you and wonder why everybody wants to vto and leave at lunch. I literally"
bad,"Atmosfera zbyt napięta , za dużo ludzi rządzących a nic nie robiących...przykre"
bad,"Everyday is a very fast paced environment. Stack boxes to pallets, cover finished pallets with plastic and ready for shipping. Everything is fine, except that it takes away life-work balance a bit because you're too tired already for walking too much and standing, lifting boxes all afternoon. the hardest part is coordinating with the management. they don't seem to care about their employees a wee bit."
bad,"There are no room for improvements, They will tear you down to point you don't want to work there or they will find a way to fire you improperly. It is all about a number and do not train you completely right on anything, which will give them excuse to fire/terminate you."
bad,"fast workplace "
bad,"10-15 hours a day"
bad,"Cold culture.  You make it or you don't, no investment in development or morale, old boys/girls club mentality, who you know."
bad,"Horaires de travail sont plutôt correct ; le rythme de travail est plutôt très soutenue et il y a des cotât à respecter."
bad,"great  co-workers,  hard place to work,  so many  hours  of standing but after all its a good experience..."
bad,"Fast paced work environment where you learn a lot and work hard.  I've learned various aspects of shipping and receiving, logistics, and operation of motorized pallet jacks and other warehouse machines and tools.  Management puts in long hours to ensure productivity and safety.  Good company for younger energetic employees,  long hours, short breaks but offers a good benefits package and stock/401k options."
bad,I worked Sunday thru Wednesday from 6:30 pm to 5:00 am would find a station log in and start packing. I enjoyed the people I worked with. The one thing I did not like about the job is your basically alone for your whole shift.
bad,Amazon offers decent benefits but low pay.They promise advancement but do not truly guide you to it and most do not make it to management. They hire a lot of fresh out of college managers with little or no leadership training. It is not hard work but it is very demanding. It is a good place to work if you need the experience.
bad,"Amazon sadly was one of the worst employers I have ever had.  The shifts were ten hours long and supervisors monitored every minute of our productivity.  This included going as far as counting the minutes it would take for us to use the restroom."
bad,They burned us out and killed us during peak. After peak we still have no room. Stressful. They were slave drivers and didn't care that we were tired. I wouldn't sugesst to anyone to work at.
bad,"When you first apply you really are unsure on what you will be work wise.  The job itself is not hard at all but for people that does not have the ability to motivate their selves for a 10 hour shift period, the job will not be good for you.  The work environment itself is pretty rough and feels like high school due to the constant harassment of management making sure their rates are above standard and also their TOT(Time Off Task).  They will somewhat try to work with you, but for the most part they will assume that you are slacking off instead of the many other problems to the job. Overtime may be slapped onto your shift at the last minute.  The pay is decent, but the wear and tear of the constant moving and bending for the entire shift is not enough. Also it is hard to fully get out of your position, so if you are a picker especially, you will more than likely be stuck in that position because of the constant termination/resignation rate."
bad,"Just OK for a summer job any longer and you see how terrible this place really is. honestly not a good place to work management doesn't care . supervisors urge you to work through your breaks. they don't give and compliments to the people who work at a consistent pace, only to the one that will do good one day of the week and chill for the rest"
bad,"12 hour days daily minimum"
bad,"The pay is good.  Great even but, the higher ups at amazon seem to think they can throw money at you to make you happier.  The long days, inconsistent mandatory overtime and inconsistent time off cause a great deal of stress.  If you happen to get hurt no matter how little or much, they end up blaming you for not drinking enough water and that it is entirely your fault it happened.  The managers are constantly pushing people too hard so they can get their bonus, which the regular workers don't receive.  Sometimes they would have free pizza but it was always very cold. . . .The most enjoyable part of this job was the paycheck, everything else was terrible."
bad,"The Amazon way is they want you to do something and when you do, Amazon doesn't want it done that way. I truly imagined that a company like amazon would have there act together. Within the first 3 weeks I knew that was too much to ask for. Since that time in November 2014, Amazon has continued its downhill movement."
bad,not to bad to work for when they were in Fernley was ok drive but now they are in Reno would be way to far for me to go and they did not like it that I was a little slow
bad,They have no concern for the associates. The work is very redundant and you pretty much do the same thing every day for ten hours a day. You have to work pretty much all the major holidays. The Human resources department is minimal and only seems to care about the company. It is extremely hard to advance unless you get in good with the managers and have been there for years.
bad,"Amazon, not integrity, is great if you enjoy being a cog in an endless machine of cogs and wheels.  Integrity folks are great considering that they do the best they can.  But Amazon staff, especially managers, are overpaid straight outta college crack pots who could not do the work they are managing for one week.  The work is brainless, the physical demands are extensive.  You will be especially happy at Amazon if you are great at brown nosing and have a talent for looking busy and doing nothing."
bad,"working at amazon was a horrible experience for me I hated my very 1st day. hours were too long , breaks were too short and you could barley go to the bathroom. they act like they care about there associates but they really don't ... I was sick.. unable to stand up straight but I had previously used my time bc of pneumonia.. I had to stay at work under horrible conditions or lose my job bc I had no time. the little 13.00 they pay you is not worth it, it was like a plantation, no it is a plantation"
bad,"overall flexible working hours. stressful lifestyle, very politically dominated industry which diminishes from the actual work space. Has its own 'Amazon culture'."
bad,they are serious about safety which is great but they also bring in to many people and many are left with having to go home and coming from different cities it may effect there commute
bad,"Worked there for a seasonal work, the agency ISS are liars , I was offered a position with Amazon and the agency screwed me over, let me go prior to Amazon doing my background and drug testing, stupid point system, they are there just to ruin lives, and they treat humans as commodity. left there quick."
bad,"Very unorganized, very rude to employees, bad parking, everyday was hassle, i honestly did not like woking here they layed to many people off and terminated the wrong people."
bad,"Working at Amazon was really hard and you be on your feet for 12 hours. They write you up for the weirdest reasons ever. Your body be sore and tired, the bathrooms are NEVER Clean, and the breaks are ridiculously short. The money is awesome, though. But If you can handle fast pace shifts and short breaks with people rushing you, go for it. The managers were okay ( from what I experience ) but most of them are jerks. P.s. be careful what you bring in there because people's stuff be ended up missing."
bad,"10 shift schedules where you do repetitive tasks that are easy to learn. Depending on the amount of work they have, you might have to do mandatory or voluntary overtime going up to 55 to 60 hours a week. If you rates are below their expected rates for the day as a temp, you have coaches from their staffing agencies hounding at you. If your rates are low for the week, you get written up. If you mess up on your task repeatedly, you get written up. After your 4th write up for the same thing, you get fired. After you get converted to Amazon itself, then you get the benefits package and you don't have people hounding you all the time. Most of the coworkers barely passed high school or GED so they tend lack education and judgment. Some of the workers are going to college while working. The management keep feeding you lies, but I guess a lot of companies do that"
bad,"I learned that they're ""obsess about the customer"" culture is definitely not in their employees' best interests.  Management is supposed to be concerned about safety, but most do not follow up on anything brought to their attention.  They also play favorites, so if you are headed to break within your five minute early grace period, they may get on your case, but their friend who leaves 12 minutes early, and comes back after everyone else never gets spoken to.  The hardest part is knowing that you are basically no more than a number to every manager and HR representative in the establishment, and there are 50 people waiting to take your place if you don't measure up.  The co-workers (at the same level as you) are the only redeeming grace for Amazon.  Most of the entry-level people are pretty awesome."
bad,Fun work place with supportive management. All about numbers and exceeding them. phone lines never answered if needed for a sickness or late days for notifying management.
bad,slave labour for rate of pay. unorganised at times and managers again have a preference to certain drivers justice or fairness is required
bad,"The company cares more about the customers than the well being of employees. There isnt any career growth if you arent the ""teacher's pet"". But hey they say ""A closed mouth doesnt get fed!""."
bad,Ask to much of their employees and gives no respect to employees trying to do their best work. If your not exactly accurate with you numbers they will replace you before talking to you about what could be wrong.
bad,"La gente y el ambiente son estupendos, pero el trabajo es muy simple y aburrido."
bad,"Its a good paying job but i would like to further my career and have more job security. A typical day at work is my going from station to station processing orders, its more of a hands on job but i would like to utilize my degree and use my mind a bit more."
bad,"Its Wal-Mart....Low wages. If you don't like it, hit the door because we will replace you in 5 minutes...That's the life of a Wal-Mart Associate"
bad,"Amazon is great with benefits and allowed time off, management is horrible constantly switching hiring managers alot u find that play favorites it's so bad in the ""Mezz"" my area even the white badges are leaving I used to do alot of other task or functions under old manager , 3 new mangers in 6 months time and I'm stuck dormant no growth within the company, they consistently have me packing only ,people are so disgruntled when people come in at the start of the shift there saying the don't want to be there not cause there tired because of management & that's bad. People feel like there getting cheated out of opportunities due to management having there favorites. Tons of people plan on leaving as soon as the other warehouse opens on California St. Due to the fact most people are single parents and 12hr isnt going to provide for a family adequately not in southern California. They need to raise there wages people stress bout bills food thing of daily life necessities and they can't make it on the giving wages you'd hve happier employees. PA's will keep gift cards and not hand them out like there supposed to... I virtually live there and off overtime just to maintain a roof over my head and food on the table with 2 preteen kids without any government help. Wouldn't recommend working here unless college student or here for extra holiday money."
bad,"Stowed inbound merchandise for company inventory,"
bad,I was not happy working for amazon and I would never go back there ever and they should not be around anymore in the uk the staff weren't very nice people to work for
bad,"Amazon is a bottom line company. They do not investigate any incident that slows down productivity to determine what the root cause is and see if the incident has occurred before and correct it, rather ""coach"" and reprimand.  There is high personnel turnover rate, including the site head."
bad,"As a stower at a fulfillment center, the employee turnover rate is extremely high in my department.  I would only recommend working for Amazon if a person is out of work or needs employment for a brief period of time (like the holidays).  The wear and tear of my job accumulates quickly.  I have worked there eight months, and my feet and hands are always sore.  A stower must be able to consistently reach two metrics:  Rate and Quality.  Rate is how fast you work and Quality is how accurately you work.  To reach the rate, you really have to push yourself for all 10 hours of your shift to attain it.  For Quality, a person can make approximately one mistake per day and make quality for the week.  On the positive side, the health benefits are good.  To conclude, if you take a job there, be realistic about your expectations and don't look at it as a long-term opportunity.  Use it as a stepping stone to something better."
bad,I helped wipe functions from the dell laptop so they could be resold.I helped burn new software on the computer. I did learn how to run different programs on laptops and desktop.
bad,"working at amazon has drained me emotionally and physically, if you have loved ones good luck seeing them. between working and getting enough sleep, you'll be too zombied out to have a social life."
bad,"loading "
bad,It's a department store that thinks it's a warehouse.  Breaks are too short. Discount is a joke. Co-workers play around too much and don't get in trouble. Management doesn't have a clue to what they are doing. They train you by showing you how to do it once and then look at you funny when you have to ask a question.  Not a good place to work.
bad,One screw up and you can be gone. My managers were pretty great but as a whole the management at Amazon is horrible. Avoid this place if you can.
bad,Come in clock in and straight to work. We Stretch and here how good/bad we doing.  I learned that no matter what Amazon don't care about their employees as much as they care about the consumer where everything should be equal. Hardest Part about my job would be getting penalized on something that can easily be fixed. ALL breaks are the enjoyable part of working for Amazon
bad,The actual job in the data center isn't a hard one but all the other largely pointless tasks they pile on you to fill up your time get old fast. Management boils down to get rid of anyone who even looks like they might rock the boat in anyway. Some good people work there and keep things going through hard work and perseverance. There is little in the way of real training and most comes from peers and OTJ training. The hardest part is dealing with management.
bad,great benefits and bad working conditions....great leaderships skills gained and training programs. paid vacations. hardest part of job is hours. most enjoy able always something to do.
bad,"probably the most difficult job Ive had, consumes my life. Its very hard to climb the ladder, a lot of favoritism is shown. The pay and benefits is the best part of the job"
bad,"Amazon does an amazing job of dangling a carrot in front of your face to get you in the door, then screwing you. No work life balance or job security. 14+ hour days. Terrible culture. Pays well though"
bad,"Unfortunately, this is not an employer/environment that supports respect, balance, or security."
bad,Only work 4 days a week at 10 hours a day. Making 11.75 an hour but you get raises every 6 months. A lot of favoritism throughout the building and overtime is scattered except during peak season. Very hot inside certain buildings and they wont turn the air on until the beginning of May. Overall its a very easy job for someone right out of high school but the people who actually work hard always get reassigned to do things nobody wants to do.
bad,"I started in November 2014 as production worker. The work was very simple but very demanding at times. I was cross trained to Pack/Pick/Icqa/sort in short amount of time. It was disturbing to see managers doing absolutly nothing but getting on employees nerves. I feel they need to find better management . The work seemed ok at first, then it seemed pety and robotic.The money was not sufficient for the sore/blisters on my feet . I was terminated on the fact i had to rush to the doctor due to a spike in blood pressure. They have strict attendance policies ."
bad,Amazon treats their contractors terribly.  Full time employee's are gods and contractors are shock troops.   It's the only place I've worked where contractors are afraid.
bad,"SLAVE TRADE the only way to describe this company the environment is institutionalized the management is the WORST only allowed to miss so many days every 3 months not allowed to talk during work they prefer you to be in complete solitude and you are required to meet a rate everyday favoritism plays a huge roll in this warehouse hard floors, no sitting allowed not allowed to rest your feet ( something you will want to do working there) timed restroom breaks otherwise considered time off task which can result in be fired H.R department just careless to everything warehouse is a mess only way to succeed is to become ""friendly"" with someone in charge"
bad,I took this job on over christmas while waiting to start back at Indigo. I didn't really enjoy it and wouldn't return. I found the job very boring and non ineresting
bad,"Any job role in this company does not really require any education, qualifications or degree. To progress in this company you only need to be friends with people from higher positions, otherwise you have to work hard."
bad,"The co-workers were very mean, also hygiene for some workd were not the best. Management was terrible. They gave the easy positions to people that were older and less experience workers."
bad,"I hate constantly being told that your not good enough. Amazon will tell you that If your scanner tells you to go from one end of the warehouse to the other side and then back and forth all day long, that your numbers fall low that your not doing good enough and it's somehow your fault and that you should do your job. It's never good enough. Some of the management is great and very plesent and awesome to work with, but integrity isn't that great as they constantly are on your back and telling you that your numbers suck and you need to work harder. After explaining that you had to be sent all over the warehouse they say; ""well I don't know what to tell you, work harder""."
bad,"So here is my review. Amazon has exceeded Target in sales and it is going after Walmart as its next target to eclipse. "
bad,"Amazon is a fast growing company. The workload is intense and as a result there is often a large turnover. This turnover can be frustrating with management etc. positions taking a long time to be filled and work loads being added to other positions."
bad,"Typical warehouse environment, high stress, long hours, very physical.  Managerial structure changes often.  Great benefits"
bad,"bad management, don't pay u all your money after working you so much."
bad,"Might be different for other sectors but i found this a horrible and bad work environment."
bad,"Stressful, lack of work/life balance. Too much demand to do too much. I enjoyed my job as I love working with customers. It would have been much better if they would have reduced their expectations of staff."
bad,everyone who works there just cares about the money because the rules are nonsense.
bad,"very aggressive, disorganized and badly managed place to work for"
bad,"I worked for Amazon in a warehouse from April to October in 2013, it was hard work. I went in as an Integrity Temp. then after a month got accepted for a full time position (and an alluring blue badge). In my 8 months I saw well over 60 people be there for a week or so then leave. It was tough but I toughed it out. Right after I got my blue badge I injured my knee. And because I was a new hire I had to continue working on a knee that actually needs surgery to this day. Their medical team is a joke. The whole persona that they care about their employees is a hoax. I finally quit when my Dr. told me that if I didn't I'd do more damage to my body. Mow almost a year since I left I still have pain from the injuries that ""weren't covered by the signed contracts"""
bad,"As an employee in the amazon fulfillment center, I learned very fast that the system was stacked heavily against the employee. You are expected to be a robot, and only a robot. Slight mistakes are punished harshly and there are mass firings on a daily basis for little to no reason. While the pay is good, you will sacrifice a lot of time and energy in the short term because most employees have a shelf life. You are told this by managers, and you are reminded that they reserve the right to fire you for any reason (including no reason)."
bad,Workers are over worked and under paid. Workers well being is not being taken into consideration.
bad,the competition was fun i loved working there i like a hands on job
bad,"I am not an person who enjoys a slow and boring day doing the exact same thing all day. A different day will give me a change in pace, energy and also my love for a job. I dread going to Amazon on a daily bases, but have no other choice until I find a new job."
bad,"This was a pressure cooker of a job for me.  "
bad,Management and work very unorganized. As a picking associate you can expect to walk up and down three flights of stairs and from one side of the building to the other.
bad,"Amazon is a fast paced fulfillment center.  The job asks a lot from each associate every day, but each year Amazon seems to be taking more and more away from their workers.  It has been years since Amazon has given a cost of living raise despite the cost of everything going up over the past few years.  The revolving door of managers makes the job even more difficult."
bad,"The warehouse scene was not very glamorous, but I feel I was very productive there and I couldn't complain about the pay."
bad,"typical day at work"
bad,"work hard, patience, alright, nice, all the walking i had to do. Having a job"
bad,"1- its a very fast paced job and requires lot of determination, the supervisor and leadership category is very cooperative and understanding."
bad,"Long standing hours"
bad,"It's everything people say it is.  Terrible."
bad,Benifets were awsome. great health care. Managment wasnt nice. The friends you make is what makes the job worth while.
bad,I was not allowed to speak to my fellow co-workers. We had to work 10-12 hours every day while standing and lifting heavy boxes along with scanning those boxes. I did not enjoy this job because we weren't allowed to speak to others the whole 10-12 hours besides lunch and break times. I did not enjoy this warehouse job. I enjoy interacting with others while working.
bad,"I was not fond of this job."
bad,great place to work only down side is it was temp. and I didn't want to be a temp employee for too long
bad,"The managers we did not see that much, our supervisors were very friendly and helpful, co-workers made you feel like you been there for a while and knew everyone. The hardest part was to finish every inventory in a time limit. "

bad,"Amazon is resistent to change and lacks consistency across their network of fulfillment centers. Even in a management role, most duties were centered around hourly tasks in order to keep the operation sustainable due to incredibly high turnover at all levels and rapid change of direction in the company operation."
bad,I worked for 2 1/2 years in this company.
bad,Amazon was target based driven although asking management what an individual workers targets for specific area would often perplex them or so it seemed.they were often unsure as a result it was held against an employee if their target was unmet even although management did not know.their system failed them on a daily basis.
bad,the warehouse isnt very clean!! management dont work well with employee's..... typical day usually is standing 10 - 12 hours on a line scanning boxes & doing other intense things. i didn't learn anything cause they dont teach you very hand on things so. its basically do as you please....
bad,"good work environment learned to be better people person,coworkers were good people,hardest part of job was driving in traffic all day."
bad,Felt very unappreciated. Shifts changed without due notice. Lacks of staff. Lacks of equipment. Poor management. No access to public transport after backshift. Co workers were very unfriendly to begin with making each day difficult. No proper training. Overall a very sad place to work unfortunately.
bad,Personally I hate going to work on my scheduled days. I feel anxiety all the time bc of the way associates are treated. It's AWFUL!
bad,"not a good place to work was treated like slaves and the staff that worked there would be very sarcastic if you did not, meet the targets given even if you had tried your best."
bad,My review of ISS is unfavorable. By far the worst job I have ever had in my entire career.
bad,"Okay company overall. Would never work for Amazon.com again. Shifts are okay, 4 days on, 3 off. Mandatory overtime no matter what you have planned. You work when they say you work. Management will play favorites. No real room for advancement unless you know almost every aspect of every job, and you know the management."
bad,"This job is bull and they don’t honestly care about harassment personal experience. Also, the managers gives no freaks about you. It’s better that you stay to yourself and don’t speak up and hit your rates so they don’t bother you. And you have to kiss up just to move up in that company."
bad,"No job security at all. It cam be very stressful at times. Its hard to take care of your family, or personal needs outside of work if you do not have enough pto , our upt hours to do so, If you get really sick they do not care because they do not accept doctor excusess, So you are forced to come to work and spread germs if you do not have enough pto or upt hours to cover your absence, But if you have a death in the family you need to show proof of that."
bad,The work itself is good. The management needs a lot of attention. Safety is always talked about but they put your safety at risk at times. With the right management this company would be good to work for.
bad,"You get paid well but it comes at a price. You feel like Amazon owns you, not a part of a team. It's all about the numbers, NEVER about your growth. You have to go in with no expectations and do what's best for you bc nobody is going help you. Sink or swim culture, one principal is Learn and be curious, which means... figure it out!!"
bad,The summary explains it all. Would not recommend to anyone who has any ambitions whatsoever. That is all I have to say. They barely give you bathroom breaks and work you to no end.
bad,The work is pure labor and as hard as you have to work the pay isn't very good. There is very little room for advancement so it is my personal opinion that there are  a lot better jobs out there.
bad,More lower level worker input is needed. Management would often make mistakes of extending shifts when this wasn't necessary. Management was also too strict very often in stopping friendships that weren't interfering with work.
bad,"Although the pay is good while working for amazon your life at home is little to nothing. Even on days off, I would be messaged by the manager asking if I could come in. I was working 12 hour night shifts and only got about one hour with family until I had to go to sleep and then wake up for work again. It really puts a strain on your mental health in my opinion."
bad,"One very important thing to know before coming in to work in an Amazon warehouse is this: You are expendable, period. "
bad,"Making the rates that they set is your number one goal while working. Nothing else comes before it. Also, every minute of your day is tracked by management."
bad,"Amazon utilizes a leveling system which act as glass ceilings. Lateral career moves are encouraged. Horizontal opportunities are rare, if not non-existent."
bad,Hard to balance it out between work and my outside life. Bye the time i got home is was time to get sleep before i take a wash or eat something in-between work and sleep. It over 2 hours to travel and sometimes the buses were later on the way back home. the buses also didn't come frequently enough as there was only 2 per an hour from Monday to Saturday and on a Sunday only 1 bus came per hour.
bad,"The managers try their best to understand your situation and accomadate you. However, contradictory information is sometimes given to employees. When I began this job they told me the seasonal position was one for eleven months, later, we were told that their would be layoffs for a certain amount of time. Layoffs happened after that described amount of time had lapsed. It did not matter how hard of a worker you were, it was all up to HR about whether or not you got laid off. The point system can be harsh, and during the black out periods no vto is available. The shifts are always eleven and a half hours long, and even though you may work only three or four days at a time your body does not have enough time to recuperate. And as with every job their is a little bit of lying, I went through training to detect defects in the print quality of shirts. Often, when I would check with assistant managers to see if the defects were too bad or not they often let them be shipped out even though the defects were obvious. The slogan is ""customer first"" however thier were a good amount of shirts I would not have been happy recieving as a customer sent out. However, most of my coworkers were good, kind people who I enjoyed working with."
bad,"Work tasks are simple enough. If you enjoy repetitive physical labor, warehouse work, or just need some supplemental income, Amazon is the place for you. If you're in a place of looking for more out of your life or work you will suffer the boredom, unhappiness, and general lack of motivation that comes from working in a job that doesn't match your skills or talents or that provides any kind of fulfillment, as I did as a sortation associate."
bad,"Amazon is all about the customer, from the moment you check email on your phone at 5am until the you set it down sometime well after sunset.  Sometime during the day, you might get lunch.  The work is fast, dynamic, and non-stop.  If you stick around long enough to have all your stocks vest, you get compensated well enough; but you'll always wonder if you can make it to that next vesting cycle."
bad,bonne ambiance de travail il y a une bonne entente avec les collègues
bad,"The company itself is really only concerned about the external customer but the employee is just a number. It's a fast-paced environment and like many people, you'll start feeling overworked, underpaid. This is a job for someone with no responsibilities as your common shift is 11 hours a day, mostly likely overnight, with one day off on a weekend if you're lucky."
bad,It's a good place to work but the company does not treat there employees well. Managment and human resources are very slow and do not respond to issues quickly.
bad,"Kontra"
bad,pousser les gens a allez plus vite qu'ils ne le peuvent
bad,"Ever since I've started working at Amazon, I've had to spend most of my time working and haven't had time to be productive on the side or for other things I enjoy. The rough work and long hours only leave me to let my mind wander for the 10-11 hour shifts I work and it drives me crazy sometimes."
bad,"Pay is great, but I didn’t care for the culture. It’s never stable. Work life balance is non-existent. If you are a single go-getter with no outside life, this ones for you!"
bad,Revolving door policy lost of good workers due to lack of guidance or communication still good for a start up job for non skilled workers and their non discrimination
bad,"Its a good place for college recruits who have no experience to learn about business as long as direct reporting manager is a good manager who wants to develop new hires. Hours and work volume can be un realistic and everything is a priority so its hard to balance what to do in your 10 hour shift. Volume of work given doesn't take into account how many hours you spend with associate issues, and concerns. You can spend half a shift just investigating an employee conflict but still be held accountable for your work that day even though you just spent 4 hours investigating two associates fighting on the work floor. If you have an office where you can close the door for an hour each day just to get through your 200 daily emails, and take 1 hour to think, you can get some of your work done, otherwise you are on the floor engaging with associates all day long and their multiple issues and have to try and find time to do the work you are expected to complete. Most people work 12 hour days just to get work done."
bad,The way they operate and treat their employees might as well be on a plantation picking cotton. They are quick to tell people what they do wrong. I see it every day with my cohorts. They have never once told me that I'm doing a great job.
bad,Great job for college students and people who have a desire to work. This is not a job for the lazy people looking for a check. You only survive through hard work and dedication.
bad,Very hard to work at this company as a single parent with no help. You did have a set time to work but had mandatory overtime a lot. You could work a full extra day plus an extra hour every day for overtime and could not leave or miss the extra time you had to work it
bad,They complained and want me to do massive amounts of paperwork because I asked for some days off to get medical treatment for a hereditary disease I have.
bad,"If you desperately need a job this is the place for you benefits are good and make good work friends"
bad,"Your put to work with out any concerns to you, they don’t care about you unless it involves work and that’s if you don’t meet the weekly rates, it’s very difficult to meet their expectations, can’t even stop to take a little breather because of time of task and tour rate will go down if you stop for a single second and that sucks"
bad,I wouldn't recommend it for most but some are happy there . I think they have the worst HM resources possible.  I was let go after about 2 years because of a small error on my medical leave forms that I had faxed in after having my wisdom teeth removed.  They denied the leave over month later and I was let go.  Shame.
bad,"A job with many layers to it.  There are many avenues available that a person could take with this company. If you get a good manager, then your experience will be better."
bad,They work you like a dog they mentally and emotionally abuse their employees They show religious differences I can not believe our state allows this😪😪
bad,I was hired in 2017 and instantly became a member of the Leadership team as Titled a Learning Ambassador/ Process Assistant MDW5. And transferred to mdw7 where I decided to leave in 2019 Looking for something Closer to my home. I got tired of training my Bosses with out receiving recognition from my Superiors
bad,"I am a part time university student and was looking for a full time work and applied for several other websites but when I got a response back from Amazon back in July Warehouse near Croydon Surrey."
bad,"Wage was too low for the amount of work in one day. Isolated work, especially working in freezer which caused a lot of people to fall ill or sick even when wearing protective gear and insulated clothing."
bad,"While labor intensive jobs can be rewarding, most of the available positions at Amazon will have you doing virtually the exact same task for 8-10 hours every single day. The best part about working for Amazon is that you'll come to love every precious moment you don't spend within their walls."
bad,"Worked for Amazon on two occasions. Both times, the interval from application to start date was short and first day on site was always about safety in the warehouse. In both warehouses, it was very heavy on manual labor, and you were expected to be quick about your work before being efficient. You're expected to learn the basics of your position and get up to speed with your fellow associates within two weeks, otherwise representatives from management would come talk to you and explain what was expected of you."
bad,"You stand around for hours waiting for a truck to come in. Then you worked at an insanely fast pace to unload packages  and sort them onto shelving so they could be bagged by routes for delivery vehicles. "
bad,It was ok when you were maid permanent but you can be rushed to make targets and always pressed to get things out on time. Money was good but it did get stressful before Christmas
bad,Poco tempo per sistemare la merce sugli scaffali troppo pieni
bad,"Je n'ai pas aimé le principe de travail d'Amazon, c'est à dire la compétition entre employés. Amazon fonctionne vraiment avec un principe américain."
bad,"No consideration for employees with  disabilities , and expectations are too hi for the pay, lots of favoritism and and faulse surveys to cover Unefficiency"
bad,i would not recommend working here. management does not know how to lead or speak to their team with respect. I have witnessed moments of sexism and racism.
bad,"constant overtime. the work is monotonous. "
bad,Their trainging is not very helpful. Everybody is sll over the place telling you something diffrent. Its unfair that everybody is not on ghe same pagr
bad,Amazon offices around the world named as some of the most desirable places to work in 2019. LinkedIn recognized Amazon as one of the most desirable workplaces
bad,Company took bonus and stocks away. Turn over rate was very high. Had 7 managers in one year and HR was not very helpful many situations. Many hires were not professional.
bad,"Must fit into the culture, don't mind lifting heavy boxes, or repetitive body movements (shoulder, wrists), standing, loud machine noise, load trailers in 140 degrees, rush to 10 minute break and 30 minute lunch with hundreds of other employees, 100/box/hr quota."
bad,Worked there for a few months it was okay at the start of employment but when peak time came new rules and management have their favorites. Only like the pay at the time and the overtime.
bad,"Ho lavorato per due picchi. Il primo è stato bellissimo, un sogno che diventava realtà... Sono stata richiamata direttamente da Amazon al picco successivo, senza candidatura, con tanto di complimenti per il lavoro svolto."
bad,"If you can run around a giant warehouse pushing a 100 lb cart loaded with heavy items, then you should do well at amazon. If you are not used to warehouse work then good luck. They use bull horns to yell if you are slow setting up your cart, and working in the refrigerated areas are horrible. Your finger tips and toes freeze.  I see why the always hiring most people dont last more than a couple weeks.  Very unfriendly working environment."
bad,"They hire literally anyone, so the work pool is usually filled with lazy people who make working there stressful and annoying. It's good for a quick job, but do not get stuck there if you're not planning to move up in the company."
bad,les employés sont plus des robots formatés que des employés
bad,"Ok job recommended to younger people it can be hard standing on feet for 10hrs and not enough breaks, but liked the different schedules and close to my house."
bad,"I worked as an SDE I. It really depends on the team that you're on, but my team culture was quite difficult to work with. Significant amount of oncall, Not much recognition from management, and working long hours is the norm. Senior engineers are not friendly, which makes it hard to learn."
bad,"Culture differs significantly from team to team so ymmv.  My colleagues were brilliant, but I had 7 different direct reports over a period of 3 years and there's no amount of skill that can compensate for that level of churn in leadership.  Long-term success requires a delicate balance of skill and aggression."
bad,"When I first started, I got minimal training and was tossed to work before the warehouse tour was even over. I see why there is a high turnover rate for employees because HR doesn't trust the employees they hire. They are very rude if your anywhere from a supervisor or less. They challenge your efforts for advancement."
bad,"When I worked for Amazon, they were so unorganized and didn't have any people  skills.Being physically challenged, they didn't have the first clue about accommodating the physically challenged."
bad,"Changement de poste régulièrement , colis pas très lourds"
bad,work for a third party company with amazon and looking to have an increase on the hourly rate could help due to increasing the packages and the longer routes on a 4 day week
bad,dont even bother applying for a job at amazon Man2 warrington . you put in the hours you will only ever get a start on the 40hr week night shifts. high volume pick rates. good pay and people there was good but the management dont care about you sometimes i just thought they want you to fail 3 warnings and your gone yes sacked. airport style security scanners every time you go to the canteen and leave the building regular drug testing randomly done if your face dont fit then you stand no chance. plenty of VTO
bad,They demand too much of their employees and pay minimum wage while expecting their employers to work mandatory overtime shifts and maintain ridiculous stats
bad,"My previous building 3/4 warehouse, was better managed and more personal.  My experience with the new building is not very encouraging.  Management at the 7 warehouse does not listen to their associates."
bad,They treat you unfairly they want you to work nonstop the managers are rude and if your not one of the favorites your not going to move up in advancement for a higher paying job
bad,"Terrible Management, unnecessary micro-managing with simple repetitive work. "
bad,"Good health benefits and that’s about the only positive about working at Amazon"
bad,This job is physically draining and for the most part it seems that employees are just a number. This place is a huge revolving door and the only way to move up is by favoritism by management. THERE IS NO JOB SECURITY and if you do try to get extra hours they will send you home so you don't get overtime pay. Amazon doesnt care about there employees.
bad,I would only recommend this job if you need to make a lot of money in a little bit of time. There's no job security and management is chaotic and unorganized.
bad,"culture sucks, my manager was not a good manager. the executives are okay, too much traveling to seattle, I was not happy there so I left to a better company."
bad,"Your work is constantly monitored to make sure you are achieving targets anything which prevents you hitting targets such as computer failure is your fault, you are not allowed to talk, your 15 minute break is timed from when you scan your last item to when you finish processing the next item, some managers allow 2 minutes walking time on each side of your break and others are more strict. Leadership here are very incapable often promoted due to having 'close' relationships with management so they don't have the relevant problem solving or people skills to be decent leaders. A lot of emphasis is placed on health and safety although if its busy health and safety doesn't matter. Working hard here and trying your best is not enough as there are lots of but kissers and people who will make things difficult for you to make themselves look better."
bad,"If you are a delivery Driver, you will spend your first hour getting your truck, getting your handheld device and hoping to have an assigned route.  If you don't have an assigned route, you will have to step to the side and wait until all the routes are given out and then take whats left.  Once you get everything done there at the yard, you drive to the station (about 2 1/2 miles away).  Once you arrive, you wait in line for up to 30 minutes till you can enter the station.  Once parked, you look in the assigned area for your route where your packages are supposed to be (sometimes they are not and you must go searching for someone to help you locate them and help pick your orders for your route). Once you have your orders, you load your truck.  When finished, you have to wait until the others are done ahead of you so they can drive out leaving a clear path.  usually takes up to 2 hours.  You rush to your route location and work your deliveries.  you will often run out of time and have to work another hour or two, trying to get out all your packages.  when you return with packages, you can be written up (hmmm.  if you only had those extra two to three hours that were wasted in the station and yard).  If you are a Driver, you are stuck in that position. (No Raises, No Transfers, No Promotions, No Holiday Pay)."
bad,My age handicap and color cause the management team to cause a production issue. Safety is avoided in the area of clean work areas. Dust and unsanitary staircase rail cause illnesses that are being ignored so much. At the staircase entry where a display of sanitizer are never filled.
bad,"Okay job if you can work a 10 hour day and deliver up to 250 packages maximum. Very difficult to work and make 150 to 200 stops in a 10 hour period, for the average person."
bad,"typical day at work would be on your feet for 10 hours a day doing  repetitive tasks."
bad,"I had 5 managers in my first 6 months as a full time employee at the HQ in Seattle. The team accidentally hired the exact same role as another team so there were two people in my position. Therefore, right after being hired, my role was obsolete and I was tasked with finding another way to add value with no managerial oversight. I had no one watching my progress, no visibility in terms of promotions, and was passed between teams for 6 months before they put me underneath the other person who occupied this role (which is fair, she had about 20 years of experience on me). Then after that manager quit with no notice 7 months later, I learned that she had submitted all of MY narratives/presentations as HERS and even had the nerve to write her name on them. I threatened to quit and was instead offered whatever role I wanted. I chose a marketing role and was given another manager. This manager worked us like slaves. By the end, we were working 80+ hours weekly and planned to through the entire quarter. When I asked her for support and proposed a plan to help us accomplish our goals that quarter, she basically said I should suck it up because it was always hard in Q4. Within a month I quit. My managers never had any accountability to actually do right by the people they managed."
bad,"I use the term 'abusive work' to describe how the job is more physically demanding then they lead you to believe and does not pay for the amount of work you do. They expect you to act like robots, not humans. The work is extremely tedious and mind-numbing."
bad,Entweder man ist dafür geschaffen oder nicht und in meinem falle eher nicht.
bad,"It's ok entry position. Not a lot of room for growth or advancement. Everyone is fairly new, there still trying to figure it out also. I appreciate the opportunity to work there and wouldn't mind coming back one day as a mid-level leader."
bad,"C'est de loin la pire entreprise dans laquelle j'ai eu a travailler.Travail de 9h avec 30 mn de pause.Tout cela pour avoir a chaque fin de mois un demi salaire parce que oui!ils ont trouvé une stratégie pour economiser un peu : ils n'envoie pas toutes les heures a l'agence interim qui vous emploie,afin de pouvoir payer en plusieur fois votre travail de nuit.Sympas...D'autant plus que le travail est penible TRES physique avec du stress en aval.Bref,si vous n'etes pas pret a travailler comme un esclave pour un salaire de misere FUYEZ"
bad,I have nothing to say really if you need a job that pays overtime with no work life balance apply here. the give you stocks and PTO but you have mandatory over time you cant really make plans fo the hoildays becasue theres black out dates for overtime its a gamble everyday
bad,"mauvaise ambiance, toujours surveillé"
bad,"Product scanning goals (300 units/hr.) are incredibly unrealistic due to how inefficient the scanning/placing system is. The warehouse is loud and workstations are far apart so pretty much the entire day is spent in solitude where for 10 hours straight, the only thing you hear is BEEP. You cant wear headphones or even have your phone with you so the day is extremely draining and you come home every night hating your life."
bad,"Back to back calls.You have to deal with emails/chats too."
bad,"Here is one of the MOST STRESSFUL DRIVING JOBS around! So that the management can cut cost and make more money, Drivers are over-labored to carry out the tasks of 2persons. No opportunity to grow and I'll NEVER recommend this type of driving job to no one! Though you'll be paid, but would be over-labored!"
bad,"In a delivery station: Complete lack of communication or continuity at every level, strategic focus constantly changing, very stressful work environment, no recognition or appreciation just expectation to do more with little resources"
bad,"I was a packer.  The only thing that matters here in an Amazon Fulfilment Center is speed.  You don't need to speak, read, or write english well.  Interpersonal skills do nothing for you.  College, education, intelligence mean nothing.  Just pack fast and the next day go faster than you did yesterday for 10 or 12 hours.  Management drinks the cool aid with morale attempts that are nothing more than high school pep rallies.  Fair wage-considering other alternatives- and benefits are offered.  Expectations are made clear.  Ok for seasonal part-time wage earning.  It may be difficult for  as a full-time gig for the over 40 crowds,"
bad,"I currently work at the Amazon in Florence, NJ. The first thing you will notice upon entering the building is how depressing it is. I have never seen a happy worker in that building. As a Universal Receive worker, I am on my feet for 10 hours a day. The work is VERY simple but also very boring. This could be fixed with a little music or sunlight, but good luck getting management to listen to you."
bad,Not a good place to work they only gove you a 2  30 min breake for a 10 hours self you do not have time to go to the bathroom it is all work and know fun the message where very nice
bad,Productivity is the only thing that matters. You can never give them enough. They cap pay and there are no incentives for working hard or doing anything extra. You are just a number and will be replaced in a heartbeat
bad,"People hired before you act like they're part of some secret family. If the supervisor doesn't like you, you'll be moved to a more stressful area (the docks), even though you were doing an excellent job where you started. Break room is on the other side of the warehouse, so by the time you get there you have two or three minutes to get back. So you'll even have to rush on your lunch break. Then the mandatory overtime days when ""prime week"" arrives, which is once a month. So it was pretty demanding too."
bad,"I honestly believe it depends on the site you worked at. DHO1 IS THE WORST! Management keeps changing. Schedule keeps changing every 3 months. Youre not allowed to choose your schedule. HR gives you your schedule as what works best for the company. HR is never there and you are forced to call ERC. Impossible to get a transfer to a different location. I would never recommend anyone to come to work for Amazon. No one cares about the million complaints that as been called in to ERC. Management only cares about finishing volume NOT about EMPLOYEES, SAFETY or the work environment employees are exposed to."
bad,"Bessere Verbindungen legen, höheres Gehalt und nicht nur 6 Monats Verträge"
bad,"Amazon is a great environment to build experience on your own. But you will be on your own. The culture is stressful and turnover is high. You will go through multiple managers, multiple titles and lose most of your peers in your first two years. I wish there was a greater emphasis on manager training and employee retention because there is so much potential for a good career here. But ultimately the toxic culture described in the New York Times article wins out. Employees are pushed to do too much with too little. Managers lack support and a total lack of vision or guidance for employees gets sold as a positive, you can make your own way! But the work load and leading your own way quickly becomes too much for one person. And no matter how much money the company makes you won't see help coming. I would not recommend Amazon to anyone unless they begin to focus more internally instead of on expansion."
bad,"Die Mehrheit spricht wieder noch wirklich deutsch oder englisch, vor allem auf Joblevel 1. "
bad,"Culture dies away after Training, Hours horrible as you typically don't have a life unless you're in a day shift. Benefits are decent however pay is decent only if you're in a higher position or constantly work overtime when available i.e L3. advancement opportunities available however very selective and depends on who you know and if they like you to progress. Expectations are very high meaning that any given time you have to make sure the customers satisfied as you can be chucked out of the door over a customer since it's the most customer centric company. Workers aren't supported most of the time and you don't have a say when it comes to that. Decent place to get bread when you don't have it but once something better comes up, go for it instead of this place."
bad,Poor management caused me to leave. Hr is horrible as well. This company is all about how you can benefit yourself even if that means stepping on others to get there........
bad,"Honestly, I enjoyed the people I worked with, but management just see's you as a number. If they want to get rid of you they will. They have a strict no phone policy and a strict break policy. You are on your feet for 10+ hours a day with two 30 minute breaks which is hardly enough time to eat. The pay was okay, but it becomes exhausting, especially around the holidays. They have you working 60 hours a week with one day off, which isn't enough time to get anything done. Overall if you don't mind being treated badly, but like making decent money, then this is a good job for you. Otherwise I would keep looking."
bad,"Only work here if you're amazing under stress or if you really need the money. Ive been working here for a few months now and I completely hate it. I'm only here because I need the money since I'm in school. You take calls all day, and listen to people complain. If you get yelled at you just have to sit there and deal with it. The managers are really nice, but there's a ton of reasons for you to get fired. You can get fired for just about anything, you have to be really careful. They don't care if you're late or if you don't show up. All you would have to do is submit sick time or paid time off and that was really cool. I'd rather work a less stressful job for the minimum wage than to work here. Theres a too many days where I get overwhelmed and want to cry, its not good for your mental health whatsoever."
bad,"Fast-paced production environment. "
bad,"The job itself is not difficult. However, management (and some coworkers) is challenging to deal with. The environment is fast paced and slightly stressful. The benefits are nice, but the over-use of your body due to physical labor tends to take its toll on you."
bad,"My first two years at Amazon were spectacular. I had 3 consecutive days off, great benefits and my manager and team were great."
bad,They want you to work like a slave at a very fast pace for 10 full hours and they fire you for any reason they deem necessary the 15 minutes breaks are a rip off you barely get a five minute break
bad,"Ho lavorato per 10 mesi nel sort center di mxp8, a fianco a mxp5, castel san giovanni.

bad,"hi my name is petros i used to work at amazon warehouse at picking and packing on Christmas time i had some takeaway from this company which is that i have to work hard but i was not enjoin that much because  the job it self and the salary was not matching as i have to pay fro train fair every day "
bad,"This is where middle class dies...!"
bad,"This place blows. If you have to work here, kiss your kids, pets, social life and ability to sleep goodbye. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT GO TO SCHOOL FULL TIME WHILE WORKING HERE! Yes, there is tuition reimbursement, but at what cost if you have to spend the time you should be sleeping for work-- doing homework or taking tests?"
bad,"After being hired it took a month to start the job then was let go do to lack of work, then received a call from Amazon that they wanted me to come back, but I had to refill another application no problem, did that than filed all required paperwork again waiting for what they call KNET a online orientation that is required to start never received it called corporate they don’t know why, all they can do is reschedule which in turn changes the work schedule I was given to all weekends only. No way to contact anyone except help desk associates and their not allowed to give out numbers nor do they know how to fix problem"
bad,"Amazon requires lots of overtime that makes it hard to have a life outside of work.  Management is is inexperienced and changing all the time.  HR was never helpful, even with doctors notes, or for someone like me, someone who has legitimate disabilities, they have no sympathy whatsoever."
bad,"At Amazon you are looked after, but I found it to be like a factory in China, you stand on your own for 10 hours a day. I thought I was a good grafter but it's more to do with your patience."
bad,"This job has great benefits, but the management is very incompetent. The exercise is great but the risk of serious injury makes the job not worth it. The injuries could affect you for life leaving you paralyzed to further your career in many directions. The company also does not put employees first during inclement weather conditions and will not shut the center down during winter storm blizzard warnings etc. There is not any room for advancement unless you want to go into management, working 100 hours a week for salary, forfeiting your entire life."
bad,"I've been in 2 different Process Assistant roles. One was tolerable the other was the worst job I've ever experienced. The management makes all the difference. Sadly most managers are young college graduates with zero leadership experience. You will find very minimal diversity in the ""leadership"" as well.  There are a handful of exceptions, but the age limit for both Process Assistant and managers appears to be 35. As an associate you are not exposed to many of the behind the scenes issues. I would recommend an associate role to anyone in decent health. I do not recommend the Process Assistant role for anyone with experience and self respect."
bad,"i found the culture very unfriendly and over competitive"
bad,"The employees are kept on a point system, for a temp worker it's six points and you are gone with most of the things graded being exceedingly minor. Leave early? It's 1/2 a point and the there is only six points to last the 9 month contract, after which (should you last)  you are forbidden from working there for 3 months, thus ensuring that it is impossible to move forward or attain benefits as a temp. Coincidentally, they prefer to use temp workers for 9 month sessions rather than recruit from those already working there. The job is mindless, which can be a benefit (easy) or frustrating if you are someone who wants to use their mind or feel useful."
bad,"At AWS you work at your own pace , no one chases after you to work and the work place is good. There's pool and nice lounge are to relax. There's a coffee machine , free cooldrinks and monthly lunches. "
bad,Could use more benefits paid days off after a certain amount of time and definitely a more experience manager or management but overall the skills I've learn has been great
bad,15 hr day or 70+ hrs a week. walking and moving all over the building is a normal day. Engaging with Associates and making sure process barriers are removed to achieve financial goals.
bad,"I work here in Avenel, NJ the sorting center.  I am looking for a new job before I leave this place that’s the only reason why am still here. They promised us 15 minutes break but they end up only giving us 10 minutes."
bad,Tendrian que hacer contratos mas largos y gestionar mejor el trabajo
bad,"I was the only one in my department with a Bachelors Degree, but for some reason all the males got promoted to full time jobs when our department was surprisingly relocated to Arizona and I was laid off."
bad,"I was let go after returning from cardiac rehab (heart attack). My top notch performance wasn't the same obviously. Had I been given time to rebuild up to the previous status, it would have been ok. Instead of offering a payout (severance)."
bad,i wouldnt recomend  no one to work here for the work you do and the work contions are  horrible you off task you get writin up dont make rate writin up only the kiss but get ahead the hard workers dont get a head plus u get paid a low wage mcdonalds makes the same as amazon but at amazon you work harder they exspect more yeah now they give you 15.00 a hour but you get no vcp no stocks people work hard for that bend over backwards for amazon and all you get is a peak shirt jeff bezos deserves everything from his diavorcecheater
bad,"You'll learn lots of new things, like data modeling and SQL. You have a lot of freedom to try something, but the downside is previous processes and reports are slapped together and messy. It's not a place to stay long-term (past a year) and I've seen a manager and two other employees leave while I was a contractor here. "
bad,"Employees are overworked for how much we are paid. We don't even get full breaks because everytime we do swipe out, 15minutes of time is wasted on going through security checks. Although the benefits are good, it does not make up for the way employees are treated."
bad,"A typical day at work as a picker, was standing on your feet for 10 hours, doing repetitive picks. It was fast-paced and always a competition to make it to the daily goal. Management was poor but the thing that got me through the work days, was the people that I met. Amazing people that I got to meet, but had to move on to bigger and better things. Moving up in the company was difficult/near impossible, but the people that did, better understood the struggles of the lower employees."
bad,"Everything was okay, but they require a lot of overtime.  Pay is fair. "
bad,I was a normal employ of Amazon.and I could done my duty honestly so my senior are happy with me and they helped me a lot to handle costumers.I was respected my senior.amazon is a good company for online shopping
bad,if you are not a physically active individual you may want to reconsider working for amazon. If strenuous physical labor is something you're into then this company is great for you.
bad,"At the delta location you will be discriminated and treated different if you are NOT from india. They chose the hardest job for non-east-indians while they are just talking and gossiping in each corner. The rates are manipulated by the PAs."
bad,"Seasonal employment if in need of temporary income for the holidays. Hard labor work, guaranteed overtime usually mandatory but sometimes optional. Six 11 hour shifts with one day off"
bad,The culture at Amazon is promoted in a positive manner.  The actual culture once you have moved from the main supervisor is dependent on department and person in charge.  I find most of the lower level management to have biases and they do not treat all employees as equal or fairly.
bad,"Be prepared to do the same, boring work everyday. Most managers are lazy & not available when & if you need them. Those that become best friends with management tend to get promotions, not the hardest workers."
bad,The hardest part of my job was no matter how hard I worked the company still wanted more. I was always over rate but some how it was never enough. Their employees deserve better from the company.
bad,Very long hours and repetitive work. Poor culture based on metrics rather than human beings. Weak leadership that do not take accountability. Under resourced staffing.
bad,"Worked there for three years without much issue. Suddenly I was not able to hit the numbers they wanted me to hit. I went from an easy 120-140% to plan every day and suddenly could not hit over 90%. I brought this up with management, clearly something had to be wrong and I wanted to figure out what I could do to get help. I try to be nothing but consistent and the drop in productivity is explainable on my end. They tout safety as their number one priority but in reality they want hard numbers before quality and quality before safety."
bad,"People there they don't like people from other countries,  not open to different cultures. HR decision made on color, name."
bad,Fun sometimes. Can be stressful.Hardest part of the job is standing 10hrs no sitting. The work environment could be better. Especially the management team which most don't have people skills.
bad,"I worked there as a seasonal fulfillment associate stocking shelves for the holiday season.  It was a temporary job and I was just glad to have one at the time. The hiring process is quick and you can start working and getting paid soon after you apply.  The work is easy to learn but they stress speed. If you are too slow don't expect your employment to be extended.  This is not a job for the diligent types who like everything to be neat and orderly. The mantra is fast and good enough. They talk a good game of stressing quality, protecting the product, and being orderly to help people down the line but I noticed that nearly all their pay incentives were speed based. Stuffers and people who did not care about what happened outside their particularly duty usually won these incentives.   "
bad,"Mentorship was boasted upon in the beginning however trainings for upskilling was main focus. Though unskilled it simply allowed you to be able to assist on the same platform, more of a parrallel move."
bad,"Amazon is an incredibly fast pace company which is extremely results driven. All results are measured by metrics to include moral for everyone from hourly associates to general managers. There is always a ""flavor of the day"" with what needs to be focused on constantly changing (i.e. safety, quality, productivity, etc.) Nearly everyone is a type A personality trying to get a head and prove that they and their team are better in the ""spirit of friendly competition"" however, this quickly turns into a you vs me situation with both sides trying to show how bad the other side is doing. There is no work life balance especially during the ""peak season"" where it is not uncommon to work 6 days a week for more than 11 hours a day as a manager."
bad,"at amazon unless you are a yes person you will not succeed in amazon, people will work off your achievments and use your ability to progress. if you ever and up leaving amazon there is no way back to start your life over."
bad,"Management is the only problem at Amazon as far as I'm concerned. Dishonest, scary. I would come to work on time; never missed, Not happy there, rough"
bad,The production  rates they wanted were offensive!  They wanted same rates regardless of your age.  I was 66 and they expected my rate to be as fast as the 20-30 year olds (the typical age of most in that warehouse). The worst job I've ever had in my life. It's like working on a plantation with hundreds of overseers looking over you.
bad,"A typical day at Amazon is when you arrive you head over to the stand up area where management will assign you a station to pick or pack at. Depending on how good you are with the manager you will placed in a spot that you want to be in instead of somewhere you are needed to be in... Favoritism plays a huge role here between Managers and Associates. If you want to move up in the company, it seems like you have to be a favorite of management. You would think hard work pays off but in this case it doesn't. I suffered two long years at this company with the intent of moving up. No matter how hard I worked to progress my career with this company, in the end it didn't matter because management had their favorites that they wanted to move up. I would NOT recommend anyone to work here."
bad,"Little to no training and guidance, poor management with no personal skills. Work place culture was very poor. The compulsory overtime was very hard for 3 months over the Christmas period."
bad,"Work for the most part drags on. It's the same task over and over day in and day out. Standing on the concrete floor or using equipment that bounces slightly all the time I'm pretty sure has done damage to my feet. The management culture is always upbeat and promising ""chances to move up in the company"" but there never seems to be any. Moving up is hardly a pay raise either."
bad,I worked there and it was okay pay I was 20 with not much to pay for but management sucked and I had to end up leaving because they wouldn't give me bereavement because I had missed too much.
bad,I was fired from a medical leave in which they said they would fix my UPT for the shirt term I was out because my car wreck. Never got completed & had me work 5 months in the negative which disobeys the company policy. Favoritism & managers are very particular who they want to keep & stay around.
bad,"The work is good, pay is good, but very unstable job. The manger are out for themselves by bully, firing, and harassing employee to work difficult standard. They don;t care about you at all, only profit. You are worth less then trash to them that they can replace at moment notice. Good job but don't count on it. Could and will be fire any moment which is stressful if you have kids, bills, or a life."
bad,"Working this position was simultaneously the best and worst job I have recently had. On the one hand, the pay was better than most local positions, but it was for a lot more work than most places would require. They attempt to lure you into the position by offering excellent benefits, but when you look at the fine print it turns out that as a part-timer you really don't get all that much. The thing that really threw me off most was how hard they tried to push their student benefits, as if they were better than anyone else's, when in reality they offer the least financial compensation of any distribution warehouse program I have seen."
bad,"not my ideal job but the compensation/bonus is good. warehouses are not the best work atmosphere or conditions. requirement for associates is robot-like, treat them like actual humans or invest in robots since they're ideal for such jobs. also, the work hours are too long."
bad,"Working for Last Mile Delivered in the beginning was a great job , quick pace job . Great to get along with others. The manager at the time and supervisor was great to work with . After new management and supervisor took over , work became more rigid work . The excitement to for the employees and myself went away ."
bad,The pay is not good for starting out as a Tier 1 Full Time Warehouse associate. The lunch is only half an hour with two breaks and thats not enough time
bad,"Not the best company. Will work you very hard, extremely few breaks, & will write you up for productivity even though there is very little work at the facility."
bad,Was very slow during late winter spring. They were looking to downsize workforce so kept increasing mandatory stowing rate to unreasonable levels. No consideration for my running elevators during christmas rush. That was mt main function but they decided I had to meet stowing rate even though I hadn't stowed in a few months.
bad,"very fast paced, high demand environment."
bad,"Amazon is an excellent first job, or part time job.for individuals just entering the workforce. Unfortunately Amazon treats employees as a ""plug and play"" processing tool. Leadership , SOP, and communication need to be developed and enhanced. After working in the distribution center, I feel as though I probably will not personally buy anything through them.This just my opinion based on what I did and saw."
bad,It is hard to manage your personal life with the amount of hours you are forced to work if management decided to call for mandatory overtime. Plus advancement opportunity is poor because the leadership is more concerned with their own problems or on how to make themselves to look better rather than training the next person to take a leadership position.
bad,"Amazon is a good place for you if you like to be pushed literally beyond your limits ALL the time. Speed/rate is what a fulfillment center revolves around. Nothing else matters - JUST rate. I was a picker. Keyword: WAS. Amazon fired me because I was too slow of a picker. I ALWAYS had 100% quality but that didn't matter because I was too slow. I was not a fast walker because I have problems with my feet. But nope. That didn't matter. They were unwilling to let anyone try any different jobs (just to see if maybe I was really good at something else).. I may not have been the fastest picker ever, but I was never given the opportunity to see if maybe I was absolutely amazing at another duty. Amazon treats its FC employees like dirt but anyone who works in any of the corporate offices or headquarters have the best of the best and have really awesome jobs in so many ways. Without FC employees, Amazon wouldn't exist - we're the backbone of Amazon.com - not corporate. When I started out in my first FC in Phoenix, it was ok - I just didn't like being stuck doing the same job all the time when others had lots of opportunities to cross train. Everything went to **** when I transferred to a different PHX FC. The management of 6 was terrible. It was nothing but empty promises, lies and massive favoritism. I will never go back to work for an Amazon FC. They don't pay us enough to deal with what they dish out. Oh! Phoenix is one of the hottest cities in the country temperature wise. None of the FC'S had air conditioning even though orientations said that all FC'S were ""climate controlled"" -"
bad,"It is a very physical job environment.There is heavy turnover at the Fulfillment Centers."
bad,"Comment devenir un robot.."
bad,"I enjoyed the work that I did within Amazon, but the management and lack of structure made for a stressful workplace. Most things were unorganized and hours fluctuated too much to adjust."
bad,"Been working as a tier 1 for over 6yrs busting my butt exceeding rate .Still after applying and being inclined for promotion 6 times now still in tbe same position very frustrating. Also if you get hurt while busting your tail amazon will find a way to make it your  fault and when you can't work no problem for Amazon because we are all replaceable. "
bad,"Good place to work for  a newcomers as special training is provided"
bad,"Pressure on quota was non stop. Workers developed ways to trick the RF scanners for hourly times. Free food sometimes when it was near expired or day old. Was tricked into working there long term, found out after they were moving from Bellevue to Kent 6 months after my start date. So that wasn't great. Most people were like robots due to stress of job. Constant bickering and altercations and arguments."
bad,"Hours are long standing all day,  5 min breaks (supposed to be 15 min but honestly you spend 10 min walking towards the break room or parking lot) 30 min lunch. The work that you can do varies and it can affect your body for life. Working hard and stressing your body is not worth the pay. The pay is low no doubt . Some managers are good some are bad. Theres good people working in the warehouse as coworkers. Great benefits tho but again i wouldnt say its worth it unless you find yourself unemployed with not that many options then it would do a good ""meanwhile"" job."
bad,I was expecting to fall in love with the job but once I got here and got into the swing of things it wasn’t the greatest jobs. In my opinion you don’t get paid enough for all the work they make you do. You get bounced around like a ping pong ball. Most of the time the management could care less about any suggestions that you make to try to improve the safety of your work environment or suggestions in general.
bad,"Wants you to be a human robot, slavery you are always placed on time limits and penalized. If you pack low for a day you are written up, amazon has no remorse and a quota to fire/ write up a certain amount of people every month. Also offered a pay out after a year"
bad,"Amazon takes advantage of recent college grads and older people in their sort facilities, because they'll hire basically anyone that will pass the drug test, as long as they are willing to work this demanding, unpredictable part-time job.  This is very helpful if you need a job ASAP, as I did, but it also leads to a high turnover rate and coworkers who don't really know what they are doing. "
bad,"Work was overnight in a stressful, poor temperature controlled warehouse. Pay was 14.50 but the job was part time and left you too tired to find more work."
bad,"Very intense and physically challenging.  they were long days in the warehouse, they preferred that you use the restroom on your breaks.  Very hot in the warehouse."
bad,"If you get hired at an Amazon warehouse, be prepared to be worked for every penny they pay you. You have a minimum rate you must meet every hour, and leadership is supposed to give you 3 weeks to get up to speed after your training. They often do not, and will badger you and try to motivate you to pack or pick faster. You are tracked from the second you clock in to make sure you are being productive. Now, making rate was not often an issue for me. It was the dullness of the work itself, the pressure always felt to pack faster, and the way the FC operated in regard to employees that I took issue with. I was with them much longer than I thought I would be, and in that time my general happiness and mood has dipped immensely as a result of this job. Part of it is due to working night shift, I'll admit, but the quality of life working at an Amazon warehouse is what ultimately wore me down and led me to resign."
bad,This is a rigorous position with exceedingly high expectations. This is an ideal position for someone looking for salary and resume building experience but this department offers little in the ways of advancement.
bad,"The environment at Amazon was not pleasant. Many of the workers there did not properly follow the work instructions or just flat out ignored them and management did nothing to address these issues."
bad,"checking emails  running a crew of at least 24 associates running all aspects of the day at a very stressful pace.no sitting down in this warehouse ,you stand for all of 10 hours work home balance is OK."
bad,You would work anywhere from 10-12 hours a day with mandatory 5 days and overtime. Not enough time to do your job. Very very poor management who didnt know what they were doing. They take brand new college graduates who have never worked in their life and make them management in charge of almost 100 people. You get written up for every little thing from going to the bathroom to not exceeding your rate. They forced you into new jobs that you dont want to actually do with no extra pay raise. They dont pay anywhere near what they should for the line of work
bad,Working here is truly exhausting. Your breaks are short because they start the minute you leave your station and have to walk all the way to the break room. You have to work so much overtime just to get a decent check.
bad,Amazon is a fun place to work and they do go out of their way for the holidays to make sure if you are working on a holiday that its as good as it can be. The company as a whole is great it just the Leads that have favorites that they let get away with anything and everything. If your lead doesn't like you then you don't have a fair shot at getting a permanent job and they also move Leads the 6 months  worked there i had 4 Leads.
bad,"Working at amazon is fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to get rather tiring, not many chances to progress forward unless you really get your foot in the door with some of the colleagues there."
bad,en lo personal no es bueno que no te dejen comer y que ni siquiera tengan agua para sus trabajadores y no cumpliendo pero si aprendi mucho al ser lider de operaciones y programar plan de rutas y manejando al personal
bad,"I guess it may be a good job for a young person in their 20's.  I as a 50 y/o have observed the work culture in a 2 mth period-not the greatest.  I'm trying to hang in there, but I noticed that friends are given the easier task.  I noticed that I'm always put in the middle where the heavy boxes are and I'm not able to make their estimated 200 count.  I observed on my other work day, 2 tall young men around 6'4 and 6'0 was brought on my wall and put on the ends where light items come in only, not one time did they get a S5 box which is one of the larges boxes approximately (S5 = 25 x 25) all around and then packed with items that may require being labeled heavy and some not.  I counted that I packed 23 of these boxes along with other boxes ranging in varies sizes by my 1:15 pm break and up on my return at 1:45 pm until 2:30 I packed 9 more of these boxes along with other sizes boxes which means I packed 32 S5 boxes and I packed approximately 15 1BB boxes approximately ( 25 L and 16 H and 24W).  No one is able to maintain this type of flow for a 10 hour day. Staff that lift and pack things ranging from 1 lb to 10 lbs vs someone lifting and packing  1 lb to 40 lbs are not going to obtain the same production rate at all......it's just common sense. It is totally an unfair expectation.  I watched a PA actually hold my badge and switch someone to a front packing easy station and then place me in the middle to a heavy station instead of placing me in an easier open station."
bad,"A lot of long hours, when not meeting targets which is entirely impossible to do so, they sack you from the job! Only good thing is about the money lol"
bad,"I started with Amazon fresh: Pros: 3, 4 day work week, some co-workers Cons: EVERYTHING ELSE (non existent breaks, below zero freezer conditions, not enough compensation) 2 other Negatives: during hiring process wasn't informed job could take up to 2 months to Begin (was hired late July, didn't start until September!!) and wasn't informed job was seasonal up to 6 months until a week prior to my start date!!... Then around December me and 15 other associates were told we could quit, transfer to Prime, or wait a few weeks for business to ""pick back up"" with Fresh. Majority of us transferred but within a month only 5 of us remained with Prime. Prime started out decently with about a 30 hour workweek but by January, February you were lucky to get 25. So now I'm looking for another job because that ""flexible"" schedule is a first come, first serve basis, so all associates are fighting to get shifts. Now the weekly allotment is 24 and you aren't allowed to pick up more shifts even if shifts haven't been filled yet!"
bad,"It was a great work from home opportunity but they extended my temporary status and never hired me, so I could never have any time off or even go to a doctor appointment if needed."
bad,"Amazon is a very competitive environment with your pace being read to the whole department several times a shift, (Top 5 and Bottom 5). Career advancement promised but you just have to get lucky for them to actually follow through."
bad,"Merit is not something used to be hired, your likability and affirmative actions status are more important. I loved the company when I started and now I cant stomach my management"
bad,"I was standing in the same spot all day unless I was gifted the job of unloading packages. Some people were friendly, but it was easy to get behind on your quota if the person who brought you the work you were supposed to do just liked someone else more and brought them the easy work."
bad,It’s an okay job right after high school if you’re not going to college. They treat workers like disposable cups because they know there’s hundreds of people they can replace you with. It’s rare you’ll get your stocks as a tier 1 (everyone basically) after your 2 year mark.
bad,"A typical day at Amazon isn't anything like the incredible place recruiters talk about when visiting campuses all over the world. Area Managers are at the bottom of the totem pole, therefore held accountable for ""tracking"" over 150 employees using ridiculous metrics for an average of 12 hours per day. Yes, you are given the autonomy of the world to develop your team, but how can you develop a team that is given the option of leaving as they please throughout the shift without a single excuse. Overall, it has been a good learning experience, but I'd recommend beginning your career elsewhere."
bad,Stepping stone if you don't move up you leave lots of corporate politics and the expectations for level 1 associates vs 3 or higher is not balanced the people managing come from sort facilities with robots then come to a non sort have ridiculous high expectations applied for many level 3-5 positions had 1 interview and 2 what seemed to be at least an interview for area manager turned into 2 rejection letters ehh appreciate it but yeah I'm over the relationship
bad,"I got injured, which I still am suffering from. And was forced to leave when they decided to take my sick days instead of getting me checked out. I now have to limp at times. When my ankle bends the wrong way."
bad,"10 hour shifts 4 days a week, mandatory overtime can be scheduled with less than 24 hr notice making a 5-6 day, 50-60 hr week. Your labor is constantly being monitored with corrective actions, up to termination, if you're not meeting standards. Little to no job advancement, poor management and HR departments."
bad,I worked as a courier at Amazon to start off they make it seem like a great place to work but you soon find out that your days are followed by 12 hours the volume of 170 drops a day is rediculous with barely anyy work life balance youre told to get on with it after the fuel is taken and the van payment youre left with £300 a week youre better off working for someone who pays you that for working 9 hours a day complete write off no lunch and no time to rest
bad,"10 hour days of very easy tasks. Learned processes of picking orders and counting product in search of error. People are nice, yet many complain about job tasks. Standing for 10 hours a day. Going home."
bad,"Worked to many hours, walk miles literally every night.at a very fast pace.broke down my body and feet literally.no bathroom breaks that counted toward your downtime.you gotta go through metal detectors in order to exit the building or go to your locker."
bad,You go in start your day. Work the tasks and meet the rates they give. Go above and beyond and get no credit for the hardwork you have done. 1 mistake and you get a write up.
bad,"it took almost 4 months for them to train me the right way, 1.5 months to get back from a medical leave of absence (there was no proper communication with their 3rd party team), team leaders lie straight to your face and will change their answer every time you ask. they are filled with propoganda about speaking up for yourself and to ""have a backbone"" but those with the courage to actually do it are usually the first people to go"
bad,Amazon is a good place to work money-wise but the people don't understand their job and will do whatever to save their own jobs rather than do their actual jobs right.
bad,was a job wasnt the best but wasnt the worst . you have the scan so many per minute and they can see it. not enough space for what your doing. your hours were not stable.
bad,"From work perspective, it was pretty challenging but from people management perspective, had a horrendous time with the team that I joined. Should have researched more about work culture before I joined"
bad,This job is not a full time job its temp I needed and need more I want a study pay and a job thats going to be there tomrrow not be there one day and gone the next thay let u go by phone Im a hard worker I never take off unless Im sick Im fast I get productin out ive donr r f scanners picked packed I loaded and unloaded trucks I uased a pallet jack
bad,"Stay away, great benefits but cutthroat culture. Hourly rate tops out at $15 an hour, which will take you three years to reach unless you receive a promotion. They also use an extremely aggressive rating system to evaluate job performance."
bad,It works out fine because of the four day week but way too much chaos on the job. I worked there because I thought the benefits were excellent.I worked in three different departments and in all the managers really didn't know the employees or how much work anyone was doing
bad,"Most people's ""careers"" at an Amazon fulfillment facility are short lived. You make good money and the benefits and overtime are nice, but man is it hard work, and you typically don't last long there. Just about every job is on a Rated metric of productivity. Those who fail to make rate get terminated. Sounds fair in practice, but in reality its horribly unfair, because a million different factors that an individual employee has no control over effects one's rate. They have a culture of ""The bottom 20%"" so when they just feel like changing processes or the rules, the bottom performers end up getting cut. They treat people like numbers and it really shows. Amazon's Turnover rate is atrocious."
bad,Amazon is not for everyone - if you are not Type A and prefer a less then contentious culture then I would not recommend this place to work as it  will drive you into the ground.
bad,"Previous and new managers seem to always pick pretty girls with less experience for advancement over those of us who have been with the company longer and have just as good, if not better stats. A lot of favoritism going on."
bad,"I was employed through Integrity Staffing.I was told it was a temp to hire position,but was laid off after their peak season due to lack of work.I feel Integrity Staffing was very misleading.I was told i would be working at the Indianapolis location,instead was assigned to Whitestown."
bad,"Actually, it would be a great company to work for if, management was better at communicating and other leaders in the building stayed on task and stopped picking favorites, standing around being idle and clueless about their role. They consistently move the strong workers around form area to area to get task executed. Meanwhile, their buddies or not say good workers remain off task and in one spot. There is no structure."
bad,Travail très difficile au conditions de travail très physique.
bad,Amazon has a high turnover rate for associates working at the lower levels of the company. There is little room for advancement. Most of the managers are professional and reasonable. CEO promised pay raise but never delivered.
bad,"10 hours a day with a possibility of an extra 10 hours a day or more depending time of year or required as neededed. Standing is the only optional while working.....Stretching before starting the day and returning from lunch. Language can be offensive due to the atmosphere in a fulfillment center. Requiring lifting of 50lbs or more, with a license required to operate a powered industrial truck (PIT). Failure is not an option as the maximum is two attempts."
bad,"Many of the horror stories about the company are true. Your success and work-life balance are entirely dependent on your supervisor and the culture of your work group. Some managers are great, but unfortunately, many are not."
bad,The job is general during the normal work time before holidays is fine. Pay is fine and everything seems fine. But management is not very good at all.
bad,"Habe als Versandmitarbeiter hier gearbeitet."
bad,"Other than AWS, Amazon is NOT a technology company; it's a retail company that happens to dabble in technology.  It's a great place to work for someone who has little to no professional work experience.  If you have more than 5 years experience and /or experience working for an organization that actually values its employees, however, you'll be sorely disappointed by Amazon.  Amazon has a VERY political environment (particularly in Retail, but also in Digital), where managers focus more on kissing up to their manager than on actually delivering good work.    "
bad,Bout the best place and not the Worst lots of favoritism so hard work usually means nothing and there quick to replace you.        They look for reason to fire you
bad,Policies & work ethics are not the best.  No job security & TERRIBLE BENEFITS!!!!  The employment tiers & management were unappealing to me.  The co-workers most were great to work with.
bad,"Dead end job for most, mindless mundane work.  Low pay.  It's good for some extra hours as a supplemental income but do not think that as an associate it will allow you any financial freedom."
bad,Not a nice place to work at the moment. Lots of trust issues with colleagues. Too much back stabbing. Do not listen to suggestions about improving procedures and processes.
bad,"Bdl5 used to be a good place to work. I had great Management. They left. I went from Associate to Waterspider to Ambassador and every Ambassador demoted because they are changing program."
bad,This place only has it's benefits going for it!! The pay is not worth what you have to do ..working ten hours a day here fills like he'll. And they are not family orentiated ..
bad,A company with too many managers and not enough finance associates. The most enjoyable part of the job is the alone time you get to come up with financial plans.
bad,Would be much better if our pay wasn’t compared to retail. Amazon is a warehouse job not retail job. Would be very helpful if all the departments would make decisions as one instead of doing everything individually.
bad,Typical day was spent doing paperwork that no one ever read but we were required to fill it out anyway. Safety ruled the floor unless it affected operations and nothing was done. In my role we were held to safety standards that did not make sense and people writing policy were only concerned about saving themselves and not what it meant to the person performing the task. Too bad because it did not use to be that way.
bad,"They definitely are the most customer eccentric company. If you love working in a fast paced working environment, 10 hours a day. Then this is the right job for you."
bad,"While working in the field was able to develop projects for productivity as well as excel as a manager.  At corporate, the Director was not advanced in excel and did not understand financials."
bad,"It's like high school, some work hard others just do the minimum. Associates run to HR when they know they are in trouble. No follow through or work ethics. Employees run the warehouse and managers are in fear of getting bad reviews"
bad,It's hard work and low pay. It's ok for a first job but you will want to eventually find a better job that doesn't work you into the ground. Therre are better opportunities.
bad,"Amazon places very little values on their engineers. It may be a good place to come to in an upper management role, but otherwise there is a strict hierarchical structure. There is almost a cult-like culture where employees convince themselves that they have the same opinion as their manager whatever that may be. This may be a manifestation of fear for job security. It seems Amazon aims to burn out or push out engineers within two years of employment and if you do get promoted to SDE II, you will likely be there your entire career. AWS has some of the worst oncall rotations of all big tech companies, partially due to the widespread nature of AWS services, but also due to the failure of management in alleviating the problem. Unlike other tech companies they have zero interest in your mental or physical well-being. They do not explicitly work you to the bone, but they turn a blind eye to it happening. Instead they limit any feedback or mentorship, creating an atmosphere of pressure, manipulating you to impose it on yourself. Managers will set strict deadlines for employees, but freely push deadlines back for themselves if it is in their best interest. Managers have an issue with setting their ego aside. Basically, you just code what you're told to and have little influence on the design. Alternatively, there is the benefit of free transportation around Seattle, but that is about the only benefit Amazon will give you. Additionally, the other engineers are actually very intelligent and genuine people that you can learn a lot from. Some are very helpful and most mean well. However,"
bad,"management is the worse cutthroat bunch of people you work under pressure they pick and choose who have to follow rules and who don't and when you ask questions they view you as a problem, liked what I was doing did not like management, or the mandatory overtime that you had to do"
bad,"It’s hard work, they expectation is high for the work you are performing but the work is not steady. You have to fight to get good work, working in the department I was in, low quality work by again high expectations."
bad,"You're pretty much a machine, hardly any human interaction, with a system that is rather punishing. No one cares whether you're human or not. Just get as much done as possible and perfectly as possible."
bad,"After starting on the peak season and working for up to 55 hours a week I saw most of the temps going home when the work load was reduced (all good here). Since then and in only a few weeks they have sent even more people home and have asked the remaining workers to achieve targets figures that double the initial ones. I am a company worker and I started being told I have to meet a ridiculous target 100% of the time or I will be fired. They put pressure on you saying that if some (desperate, sick) people can do it, everyone can do it and that 'everyone wants your place'. Management only comes to push and things just keep getting worse as more an more people from different positions are getting fired and that is putting more pressure on the remaining workers. Avoid this company and have a thought as a consumer what kind of company you do business with."
bad,"Not my cup of tea.  Standing for 10 hours a day, with only two breaks, it really became too hard on my physically.  It was great to only work 4 days out of 7, but not 10 hours a day."
bad,I arrive about an hour early so I hang out with my coworkers before we clock in for the day. I am usually assigned to wrap the pallets and moving them to the trailer. my manager was always shocked on how many pallets i have closed and open for the fellow assoicates i worked with.
bad,Amazon is not a place I would recommend you work if you have a family to support. The pay isn't equal to the work you have to do and the hours they make you work.
bad,Fast pace and moving around a lot. A lot of running. They don't pay enough for the average family it's not a good job for a long-term thing it's more for like college and school kids and then wants ta can move on that probably do
bad,"On a typical day I would try to pack boxes as much as I could and not try to keep a conversation going with fellow employees all of the time because the work is important and some individuals there can be easily distracted by jokes and folly with co-workers, leaving work undone or no payed attention to. I pretty much kept to myself and did my job as a packer. When the time came to sit down at lunch time, then I was able to express my opinion about the job with co-workers ect."
bad,Stressful job with no good management. As a black person it was hard to feed in with my team in San Marco. White kids at work were with their friends white giving them small stuff in order to have good rate and be promoted.
bad,"Amazon is totally customer focused which is great for the customers, but bad for the employees. You work 10 hour shifts and during peak you will work 50-60 every week. The management is usually horrible because Amazon likes to hire 22 year olds straight out of college who have no experience working as a manager and have never worked at Amazon. Also, rather than spend a long time actually training these managers Amazon just gives them a 2 week crash course on everything."
bad,"Working at amazon in fulfillment was easily the worst job I've ever had, not because of the work but the people and management.  You will not get treated fairly."
bad,Amazon is a fast pace working envioment and can be fun .Just like any job there are up and downs but for the most part Amazon gives you what your asking for as long as you are willimg to put in the work and time .
bad,"Metrics rule everything for the CSA's at Amazon.  When people call in, upset, and you are not able to move the universe for them, they often go away still upset, and your call took too long, and the supervisors are breathing down your neck so you feel like the center of an unhappy Oreo."
bad,A typical day of work consisted of standing for 10 hours a day with lots of bending and squatting. Mindless work scanning items and placing those items in bins. Benefits were really nice though.
bad,"SMF5 is the facility I work for, it's a good job, pretty easy to do and there are around 12 roles to learn. They pay 13.25/hr but, and this is the important part, they only work us 3 hours a day. When we opened the facility on October 4, 2017 we were getting 5 hours a day but now, and in peak time, we still get 3hrs/day. I've worked two days tis week so far and have accumulated 5.5hr/s; they made us leave at 2.5hrs on Sunday. I am angry and feel very cheated out of an opportunity to make some money. Amazon is worse than Walmart due to taking away our bread and butter (hours). At least at Walmart you get 25-35 hours part time."
bad,Data is king at amazon but management fails to see that behind each number is a person. For the holiday season terminations will increase rather than working with associates to break past barriers.
bad,"I enjoy the time off that the company gives you if you wish to take it and the benefits. I did not like the repetitiveness of the job at times, but the employees made it worth the repeat."
bad,"klassische Arbeit eines Arbeiters, ist die schwierigste Sache, dass sie viele Stunden Arbeit stehen. Und was ich am meisten mag, ist kulturelle Vielfalt."
bad,"Area Manager role"
bad,"Don't trust management,  stay in the shadows. Even if you follow standard work flow you will still get write ups. If you can suck up to main management.  Take advantage of all any career options . Try to work in the dock area or loadING trucks. Avoid stow ,pick, you are on rate and will hate it"
bad,"I would not recommend working for this organization as they are all about meeting their numbers and offer no work life balance. They say they are frugal, but they are just cheap."
bad,"Even though I enjoyed the work, I wasn't happy with the management and how they would only take on zero hour contracts.The hours weren't set, even though there were no shift patterns and the hours of work when I had them, were 9am till 6pm.  There were days when I would turn up for work, to then be told that there were no hours for me that day."
bad,Benefits are amazing but management is inexperienced coming straight from college. Long hours tired body and feet but you’ll get use to it after 2 weeks
bad,"i feel that this company hires anybody and everybody they can and runs them thru ""the mill"" so to say. their turnover rate is horrible at probably 300% they dont care about their employees at all unless they are disreguarding safety protocals to make production but the second something happens safety wise its all on the employee for failure to follow safety. but their benifits pacage is the only reason i have stayed as long as i have."
bad,"Company grows to fast for structure to make sense. They do not develop within with the only exception being when they open a new building. otherwise higher interns, and ex military."
bad,Felt like I was in the novel 1984.  Everyone is encouraged to watch their coworkers and report on any bad behaviours.  This creates an environment of mis-trust.  Would not recommend this place except to those who don't mind Big Brother continuously watching you.
bad,This job sucked everything out of me. I became a very cynical manager while working here. The culture in the buildings is nothing like the training and interviews describe it to be.
bad,"NO job security due to flawed policies.  You can be terminated for a single customer complaint, without any investigation to validate the complaint.  You are constantly caught in a catch 22;  if you leave a package and it is stolen, or the customer says they haven't received it, you get an email notifying you of a terminable infraction, yet if you make the decision to not leave the package in an area you deem unsafe the customer can also complain saying that you never knocked on the door or even that you could have left the package because their neighborhood is safe, and again you will get an email.  After you are terminated, you may appeal the incident, but you are not given information about the incident you are trying to appeal.  So your chances of winning your appeal are slim to none.  Amazon warehouse employees are on a point system; the same should go or their drivers."
bad,Make sure you keep your options open working with amazon unless it is a secondary job for extra income they will hire & lay off in volumes I love to stay busy & pretty much you will but alot of professionalism from floor managers 10 minutes break really cause you spend 5 or more minutes to get back & forth to break area.
bad,they fire you for every little thing and have rates that you basically gotta break your neck to get the management is very poor and not helpful and there is a severe lack of communication in all levels of management
bad,"Working at amazon was very slow-paced for me. There is a certain rate to meet while stowing, counting, etc. which is supposed to make it feel fast-paced, but overall it is not at all. It's all robot work with little to no interaction."
bad,demanding and challenging. Data driven and customer focussed. Operations at FC involves working with associates across day and night shifts to deliver on customer orders
bad,"A typical day at an Amazon Fulfillment Center is filled with harsh background noise barely scraping the threshold for irrepairable eardrum damage and manager's breathing down your neck the moment you happen to slow down for a single moment. Overall, the atmosphere is one of a prison with an abusive relationship mixed. The pay and benefits aren't awful for those in poor or unfortunate eductional or financial backgrounds. So an opportunity is there at least."
bad,The job is very stressful if you aren't good at the job they assign you to do. I asked many times to learn to do something different because what I was being trained in was something I had a lot of trouble understanding. The efforts that I put forward went unnoticed and after a while I could tell that management did not care if I succeeded or failed because they no longer tried to help me get better. Amazon is not a good place to work if you can't commit all of your time to it and if you are not good at the job they assign you to.
bad,"Sweatshop working conditions, no climate control. Pay and benefits are decent. No opportunity to plan your life with constant mandatory overtime. All managers care about are your numbers; you are a cog in a gargantuan, depressing machine. About what you can expect for unskilled labor, to be honest."
bad,"Amazon has a lot going for it in my observation.  However the Stower position was a bit of a challenge to me.  It required one meet an hourly rate of scanning and placing items in bins accurately.  The accuracy part was no problem but the rate was difficult in my opinion."
bad,"12.75 an hour is what EVERYBODY gets.  "
bad,They show a lot of favoritism between employees. Everyone is not held accountable to the same rules. Especially the diverse employees. They target one person and pick with that person until they no longer work there
bad,"Physically demanding environment "
bad,Do not go there they expect you to advance and ill only give raises up to 3 years worth of work. The management doesn't care how you feel and will use your own words against you.
bad,great if you wanna never stop moving. in short i know many people that would rather go back to boot camp then work here. money is good. benefits great but no time for a live out side there walls
bad,It is all about the numbers. They don't really care about their  employees. The hardest part of the job was getting a balance of small to large items to stow. I found it hard to get a decent rate.
bad,"Hard work if you actually do what they require of you. So many people slack off at work that they drive us even harder. No HR on site. Horrible hours. I work 5pm to 4:30am and my only other option for hours is 5am to 4:30pm. 11 hour shifts are way to long. many days  can walk up to 20 miles. That's 80 miles a week an hard cement. A co-worker went to the doctor about injured feet and went on workers comp because of foot problems he was having from all the walking and standing.He was yelled at and fired the next day."
bad,"Overall Amazon seems like a great place to be if you are an FTE and if you have an experienced, good manager.  As a contractor, you are definitely treated as second class.  In my case, my manager used the opportunity to become FTE as carrot and stick.  While stating I was the ""best...... she has ever worked with, she would regularly use the Amazon Leadership Principles (LPs) as a tool to threaten me and the other contractors on my team.  As a contractor, you will have no avenue for escalation or mediation if you need help with any concern.   The LP's, in their essence, allow for mistakes and respectful disagreement but, in many cases, the LPs will be adjudicated by your manager.  Be wary of interpretation and conform completely to survive!  Overall it was quite a disappointment for me.  "
bad,"Working in a warehouse is know to be grueling. Cement floors provide little comfort to those who have to stand on it for hours. Working at an Amazon warehouse is being expected to run laps while juggling at the same time. It was never clear who was in charge, with some management never disclosing that they were indeed management until asked. As a worker, you are just a number. The belt does not stop, even when it is obvious it should. I'd never work there again."
bad,Could be a lot better pay for responsibilities taken on and safety not stressed enough. Also barely legal employees overseeing warehouse with bloated egos and little to no real experience.
bad,. High Productivity. Fun place to work. Work strenuoustoo tasking. human cannot work at the same rate as robort. working in amazon will break you dowm.It is not a place to work for too long. They should put people health first
bad,"The job is okay, but is not FT and I don't get any benefits or a decent pay to live on. It's sad I cant get a decent wage from the richest employer. If you're looking for temporary work or a summer/school break job, it is decent. I'm out of school and no longer on my parents insurance. I need a real decent paying job to survive on my own."
bad,Compensation is not suitable for required work. Workplace policy is heartless. No room for advancement. People have literally been there 15 years and are still in entry level positions. Its good a good place to work for students over the summer or christmas break as a college student but do not make the mistake of making a career out of this job.
bad,"Poor management. They are completly crazy over 1 missed minute. They expect you to never take any days off, and if tou do, there are always reprucussions."
bad,"Treatment at Amazon is apolling, favouritism in promotion instead of skills and experience. Penalising the wrong people and letting others off."
bad,"Its a long 10 hour day of the same repetitive motion standing in one station all day. Strict break time monitoring, poor communication and training, everyone is miserable and it is a revolving door job , always hiring because no one stays long. Good for an easy entry job while youre looking for something else because they are always hiring, but not a long term career."
bad,"Facility does not work fluid, too many managers giving you different directions with little communication between them. Problems arise everyday with little to no action to solve them."
bad,wrong site horrible management training is horrible.  They fail to properly train.   You are responsible for mistakes regardless or not if you were trained.  they hire anyone there is no interview process they just seek bodies
bad,"long shifts of 10 hours per day could be exhausting and dull at times."
bad,they show favoritism to certain people. you have a set time to start then when its time to leave for the day they try to make you stay late knowing people have 2nd jobs. they don't care about how nobody feels. they don't do things to excite people to stay. just be careful there cause they have people snitching for them. just be careful cause they snitch to move up when everybody get paid the same amount even if you move up.
bad,Meh its very redundant work. Your co workers help remind you that life isnt that bad. It gets very old. Benefits are what attracts everyone to this jobs so just be careful.
bad,"I used to work at cvs 2 in Hebron Kentucky. The place is good to work but the people that run the place is really bad. I don't know how they become a a manager in the first place. I think if they change the managers , it be a fun and nice place to work. Also the pay rate is so low especially for the people that work at team n mech."
bad,"All they care about is you getting out the work as fast as you can. They don't care if you're injured, sick, etc. The HR staff and the on site ""medics"" are terrible! You just about have to be dying in order for them to even acknowledge you."
bad,"Long hours which are 10 sometime 11 hours"
bad,"This could be a great job for someone without small kids, and I believe their attendance policy could be a little more tolerable because emergencies do arise."
bad,"The benefits and wage were fine.  But management needs lots of work.  They are like robots.  If you have a problem, they will say they will help, but don't."
bad,"It pays well, fast paced, has a on site medical care center. Hardest part of the job is balancing your work and family. Best part of the job is getting paid."
bad,Only good for exposure. Not a long term company. I would not suggest friends or colleagues to this company. Culture was nice and dog friendly. Awesome buildings.
bad,"This is a fast paced, hard core work environment. The more you did the more they demanded!! You must be young and in great condition to work for Amazon Fulfillment Centers and willing to work a lot of overtime and night shifts!!!"
bad,"Management proclaims high safety standards but safety is low on the list. Productivity is top. you must make rate to be qualified to stay. Mistakes are not accepted. Safety is third on the priority list. Various schedules to choose from. People from all walks of life. Be prepared to work with diverse cultures and languages,"
bad,"they did not preform any type of interview to determine skills, they just assigned employees to positions and trained who they wanted to certian types of jobs. shifts vary of workloads and you are not certian of what you willbe doing when you arrive if you are cross trained. work standards varied from shift to shift which caused confussion."
bad,"was good nice place to work only problem was the temporary agency that manege the worker changing policies on hourly pay,was lot of walking fast pace a lot of counting lifting used pda scan"
bad,"The hardest part of the day is dealing with the tedious nature of the job, and managers on top of you constantly. A typical day is spending it on a line and building pallets all day."
bad,"They didn't give us time to work out problems and everything got count against you, when needed to speak to management we only had 15 minutes to do so"
bad,"Amazon has great benefits, but it does not completely compensate for how poorly treated employees are, and how hard you are wanted to work. Would not recommend."
bad,"work/life balance is not good, they give you minimal time off and make you start working the weekends for the first 3+ months, breaks are very short, lunch is only 30 minutes, managers are okay, just depends who you get. The actual work is very boring if you are in  ICQA. the only thing enjoyable is leaving when your shift is over"
bad,"horrible place,you have to working as slave. no owertime,no private life,no hollidays,no cristmas. absolutley nothing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,"Having worked for amazon for over 6 years, i now realise what a waste of life it was , working endless hours and engrossed in development and expansion on the great brand was not worthy, lost touch with friends, family took a back seat . "
bad,They push a rate of packages that need to be put away hourly. Seems like they don't take into account the size of the item or the weight. They have people in direct roles and indirect roles and threaten to fire the people that are in indirect roles. They also have different positions and for instance stowers have to move for pickers but the stower still needs to make rate.
bad,"I don't like company culture of Amazon. It don't treat employee friendly. If you cannot find a job in any other places, you may want to join amazon. But it is not a good place to stay for a long time."
bad,none of the managers had any experience - We the workers did most of the training and the managers made all the money - and the bonus program went from 4 - 5 hundred dollars to 27 dollars I think was my last bonus. Pretty much a joke since the work never diminished like our bonuses did.  was sick for 2 days and went over my time by 15 minutes and was fired after 7 1/2 years.  Not a very understanding company to work for.  Wasted 7 1/2 years of my life.
bad,Management was focused on productivity numbers. Quality of work performed was secondary to volume of packages handled. Management were visible but did not engage employees. In morning briefings they touted lofty goal numbers but failed to explain how it related to employee performance.
bad,"Decent pay for late-teens/early 20-somethings, but no opportunities for advancement or a home life. Amazon overworks employees and will often show favoritism."
bad,"Not a place to build a future, no structure or organization, co-workers very disrespectful, a whole lot of cursing. If you just need a job to pay the bills till you can find something else this is the place to be."
bad,Good company that unfortunately employees young people who act their age.  Management was professional but didn't reign in the inappropriate conversations and behavior by their employees.
bad,"The wok day is very hectic, long hours you're on your feet 11 hrs, sometime 5 days a week"
bad,"Been there for a while now.  It is the worst management I have seen in any company I have worked. You are treated like inmates, not employees. If you really need a job then take it and keep looking."
bad,Working at Amazon was the worst job ever the left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing on a daily basis . However the benefits in which they offered was excellent i didn't want to leave amazon but couldn't take the anguish in torment daily
bad,"The work place was a bit confined for a company as large as Amazon and I felt the layout could have been better. I learned new computer  skills, and how warehouses function.  Management could have been better to a certain extent. Most of the  management were unable to do basic tasks carried out by workers and were at times non receptive to ideas, that would have improved productivity. I enjoyed working with my co workers, especially those of a different nationality. The hardest part of the job was during peak at Christmas due to increased volumes and trying to teach new agency staff. The most enjoyable part of the job was achieving targets and ensuring goods went out on time in a proper manner."
bad,"Stacking boxes, packing items to a conveyor belt, etc. Poor management, lazy, but not all, co-workers. The long hours were the hardest to this job. The best part was being apart of a team, even it it was all me at times, and the fair pay."
bad,"The money was good, The management of handling the money portion was sometimes wrong. The leadership was good. The coworkers are motivating."
bad,the Manager only come about getting numbers and tey6 really don't care about their associates.  The HR department is very rude  and always has attitudes when it come to helping the associate
bad,"Unfavorable place to work. You are just another body to fill a space. Very boring and to meet rates are ridiculous. You are in robot mode, make sure not to talk to one another..."
bad,"I work for them for three years management is sloppy. The place is too hot to work in. The demands they make is way too much, almost like they want to be terminated from there. They pay you little by telling you the benefits are great but they really aren't. Only thing good is the co-workers they are nice and friendly. Would not recommend to my worst enemy even as payback."
bad,work is not hard. but constantly have to be bothered by them telling you rate even when the machines are messing up. Long 10 hours of work. no music or no motivation to keep u going. managers show favoritism and dont do their jobs at all. unorganized and never know whats going on.
bad,A bleeding edge organization which can be fun and exciting however you have to sacrifice your personal life balance in order they can continue ahead of the game.  Huge customer service focus for everything they do which is important but need to learn how to take btter care of employees.  Mangement can suck.
bad,"You see an ad to work with Amazon and it looks great, you are told there is opportunity to go permanent, it isn't true. You never get the full 40 hours a week, usually around 20 due to over staffing so people get sent home with no pay!!!"
bad,"well, you start off stretching so you dont hurt yourself while working on the concrete floor. I got on this job through a temp. agency so, they dont really value you enough to apprecciate your wok, thats just my opinion. Im not to sure on management, i wasnt there long enough to get to know anybody. Its hard to get to know your coworkers because of the envionment, everyone kind of has there own path to follow. the hardest part of the job is getting to and from break on time. Also you have to arrive to work like an hour early to be able to get a good spot in the parking lot. the most enjoyable part is clocking out for the day and going home."
bad,"Amazon.com fulfillment Center is an okay place to work. They work you like a dog with working long hours for minimal pay. The benefits of physically working there do not outweigh the costs associated with this type of manual labor. Amazon benefits are good for healthcare, time off, and having an annual picnic. The management always is new and don't necessarily know what they are doing, thats why there is a high turnover rate with management and other employees."
bad,"Initally I liked working with Amazon because the treatment was equal and nobody was left out. After a while, favoritism set in, the slogan encourages the workers to have fun and we had absolutely no fun, just all about work and getting the best numbers. Have elderly people bust their backs and expect them to keep up with people 18-25yr age bracket which isn't fair and they would get written up or terminated for performance rate being too low."
bad,"Trabalhei por 5 meses apenas, mas foi o suficiente para vê como a empresa anda, acidente de trabalho constantemente! Coisa que nunca vi na minha vida, encarregado que não aceitava que os seus subordinados dessem opiniões e mandavam calar a boca! Gerente que mentia na cara de pau para todo mundo e salário incompatível com a função ""se você trabalhava no terceiro turno simplesmente a empresa dizia que vc não tinha direito a adicional noturno"" outra coisa era a respeito de um rancho no valor de 100 reais que praticamente ninguém ganhava, pura falcatrua, se você atrasava em bater o ponto em 2 minutos já era o sufiente para perder!! Ainda tinha um prêmio de 1 tv lcd que era dado ao funcionário do mês, porém só ganhava o pessoal da administração, sendo que na produção eram grande a quantidade de funcionários, bom mas tinha a parte boa também, como a comida que você podia comer até se empanturrar e os cursos que eram dado na própria empresa e recebiam certificado e promoções também, lá você só não crescia profissionalmente se não quisesse."
bad,The people you work with are the best part of Amazon. If you like being with your family during the holidays this is not the place to work because there is a lot of mandatory overtime around the holidays.
bad,It feels like you are working as a slave. If you are a picker they require such a high rate that mainly requires you to literally run up and down the isles. They don't take into consideration the pick paths that you are on that can easily cause you to not make rate. Its either their way or you are fired. Your two 15min breaks are not considered as that because by the time you get down stairs and get through the metal detectors you have wasted over half of your break. Good place to meet new people though and develop new friendships but the overall experience is a bunch of mess.
bad,"It was nice when you first start, but when you are there nearly twelve hours and only get an hour in breaks total. Then you work super hard all the time day in and out, and one day you don't meet your numbers they make a big deal about it. you have to stand the whole time even if there is no work. No room for advancement unless you are military background it seems."
bad,"As far as the people you will come across on a daily basis it isnt too bad, the problem is management. they fire who they want, keep wo they want and treat and talk to everyone horribly. HR does the bare minimum to act as if they are working and never really help resolve anyones issues and get paid for it."
bad,"Uses a ridiculous model to evaluate employee performance  and the pay is so low for all the things you are expected to do. You have to deal with customers constantly calling in and wanting things for free.  You are trained not to give it away, but at the same time you're telling the customer no, making them angry, and then you have to send the same customer a survey asking them how your service was. Those responses are what determine whether you keep your job or not. "
bad,"Working in an Amazon robotics warehouse you have to make high rates.  It's not the hardest thing to hit but at the same time if you step away to use the restroom or get a drink of water your rates will drop dramatically.  Usually the warehouse is hot and they refuse to open the vents to allow any airflow at all.  If you're extremely lucky you'll get a good manager but most of them are just rude.  If you expect to have full breaks, you're greatly mistaken.  It can take about 5-6 minutes to get to the break room so you can rest for a minute or two before you have to go back to your station.  You're not allowed to sit at your station and even kneeling is greatly frowned upon. One positive of it though is your coworkers are a life line since you're usually working by yourself with only the sound of a conveyor for noise and entertainment.  The Hardest part of the job is trying to keep yourself sane for 10 hours with minimal human contact.  The compensation could be better but as a full blue badge employee you also get full medical, dental, 401k with match as well as discounts at various places."
bad,"Amazon is a hard place to work at. Not that I am against hard work. I worked there for 4 years after all. If you work day shift you go in when it is dark and you do not leave till it is dark or almost dark. Your body aches and after a while you develop health issues. "
bad,"What is like working here: You come in, you work, and you reach your numbers. "
bad,"Well, lucky me, I had the night shift. Get to work at 5:45 pm and leave at 6:00 am. That took a couple weeks to get used to. They are very cautious there about stealing which is understandable. You swipe your ID card, walk through a metal detector and then grab your scanner. I was a picker, so my scanner was my best friend. Then the night crew all stand in a circle and stretch until the clock strikes 6:00! With the scanner turned on, it tells you were to go in this 500,000 square foot building with tons and tons of different items from toys to condoms to legos to ipods, etc. You grab yourself a cart and place 2 yellow bins, one on top and one underneath. The warehouse is organized by numbers (rows) and letters (columns) and colors, that tell you the intersection of the numbers and letters. All of this is displayed on the scanner. So your job during your 12 hour shift is to go around and retrieve these items and place them in the cart. When the cart is full, its placed on a conveyer belt and dissappears and off with the next box and the next and so on. Sometimes though the scanner says to go to row 2, its scanned and put away and then the scanner says row 134. So now you have to sprint to that area. Now I say sprint because the scanner has a timer on it and it you are not down there with time left then the scanner sends a signal to some dude sitting down somewhere else. You get 2 weeks to get the hang of it but after that they start to write you up. first write up is a warning and the next is your fired! And on top of that, they also expect you to scan a certain number of units"
bad,"At my location, favoritism is shown and they don't promote the hard workers with the talent and determination that's needed to become an effective leader."
bad,"Job as many of warehouse works. "
bad,"Work is long hours and demanding. I'm still waiting to get paid for the work that I did, and after trying to chase head office and getting nowhere I went back to my manager who's told me it's nothing to do with him now and it can take anywhere from 2-6 weeks. 6 days work minimum means not much of a lifestyle. Maybe worth doing the job if you have your own Van, otherwise I wouldn't even bother as technology they give you turns you into a headless chicken."
bad,"Amazon was my very first warehouse job, and also my first experience in production. I learned the importance in time management and accuracy. Although I enjoyed the fast paced work, working at amazon was very tiring."
bad,"Anyone who rates this place 5 stars is probably paid off by corporate, a manager or is a spambot. While there are good things, it doesn't come close to compensating how bad it is to work here."
bad,"La sensation d'être exploité est omniprésente..."
bad,"Very productive. Management wasn't really that good. Can get very tiring, but will keep you in shape. If you like staying active, then this is the job for you."
bad,"Make sure you can get to Hemel Industrial estate reliably, as public transport is useless and unreliable. They do pay promptly but if you struggle making the targets they provide no practical advice on improvement and just instruct you to 'work harder'."
bad,"The turnover isn't just high due to unpaid time accruals but alsodue to the unfair work practices and harsh treatment of it's employees. The metrics what is needed for each department changes constantly and employees are often unaware. Information needed to do your job daily varies between managers and if for any reason miscommunication becomes a issue and task can't be completed then the associate is left responsible. Also management and human resources show a lot of favoritism when it comes to department transfers, promotions and schedules changes."
bad,Many employees slack on their daily job which makes it 100 times harder on those of us who work hard to get our job done accurately. It would be nice if management would help fix the issue instead of trying to help pick up the slack of other employees.
bad,"High pressure work enviorment, but can be some what borring at times poor hours and managemnet, which leads to poor work life balance."
bad,"I worked as a warehouse op from September to December and i must say i would never go back. The job as a whole was a challenge, mostly due to being on your feet for at least 10.5 hours a day, 4 days a week. When it got towards Black Friday and Christmas this went up to 11.5 hrs/day and 5 days a week, still with low pay (about £10/hr on overtime days)"
bad,The only thing i liked about working for amazon was the 15.00 seasonal pay other than that the work was hard and very fast pace.
bad,listen and learn everyone is always waiting onanother job to call them.so different in other Amazons triple the money managers are wonderful otherwise
bad,"Management is usually in over their heads with the amount of work stacked against them. A typical day starts with stand up, then moving to appropriate station to begin mind-numbing work."
bad,"I learned how to make boxes very fast , place the items in the boxes tape them up and send them out quickly.The hardest part of the job is the management being on your but about how fast you pack. We have to pack 90 units per hour or we get in trouble.Co workers are nice but some of them dont do their jobs they just sit and gossip the whole time or flirt with the boss.Most enjoyable part of the job is sitting their packing items that i have never heard of in my life."
bad,Working here is not bad as far as the job duties is related.  On the other hand management is very poor.  Managers need to be fair to all workers across the board.
bad,"management was bad since it was a seasonal job"
bad,"Amazon is a great company to work for with the benefits but when it comes to actually working it isn't worth it in my opinion. I clock in at 6:55pm and I am usually not assigned to a station like some of the other people. When I get my station that is when the boxes unload from the trucks. The majority of people do not like working with the big boxes so they pass them along and I get stuck with the big boxes. Because I am stuck with the big boxes my working score is low and I try very hard to catch up. Spoke to my supervisors about it, but did nothing. Also I always see employees dirty dancing or chatting doing nothing while there is a lot to be done. Spoke to my supervisor but sometimes they join in. When my area is full I push the button to have someone come and remove the cart and replace a new cart so I can finish working. But every time they come and they know I can not hear they try to call someone else because they won't write or try to communicate with me. I do have 2 breaks and a lunch break. At that time it is 5:30am and it is time for me to clock out and go home."
bad,"amazon is a boring factory setting with non existent work breaks, a typical day at work is standing still packing boxes for 10 hours at ridiculous rates of speed. My co workers were awesome people, management does nothing but police the environment, and i have learned to not work for a company that doesn't work with its employees that want to work but can not completely due to robotic work conditions."
bad,Managers are very unorganized. Have to worry about position everyday scheduled to work. Work environment safe but very stressful.
bad,In a typical day I would get to work and within the first hour my machine would malfunction or just break down. From my time with Amazon I learned that communication is everything. There was a lack communication between management which in turn led to miscommunication with associates. My co-workers were great. The most difficult aspect of the job was trying to get on the same page with everyone. What I really enjoyed about the job was my co-workers.
bad,This place will chew you up and spit you out. Good pay but very poor work environment.Long Hours with endless mandatory overtime up to 60 hours a week.
bad,"you have no social life what so ever and you can get sacked on the spot for not hitting your targets, they are very target driven which allows no room for quality of service which i find very mentally challenging as well as physically, you have total of 1 hour worth of breaks in 11 hour shifts where you walk between 10-15 miles per night. Also if you have no say on over time if you've worked 44 hours in 4 days and they say your in tomorrow you have to go in so compulsory over time (55 hours per week) most weeks and the job is to physically demanding."
bad,"It was hard to maneuver with the politics at this company.  The C-Level management acted more like a click than a resource."
bad,In-your-face culture and low pay drive high turn-over.  Having Amazon on one's resume makes dealing with the difficult work environment worth it.
bad,"Une entreprise à l'américaine. On a un bobo ? Il y a l'infirmerie. Mais attention il ne faut pas rester trop longtemps à l'infirmerie car la productivité diminue !"
bad,Managers will move employees based off of company needs which demoralizes the group because it prevents them from doing a job function that they like to do for the day.
bad,"Working eleven hour days for four days seemed like a dream in the beginning, but it puts a toll on your body.  The first two days off is all recovery, and then when peak season hits you go to five eleven hour days. it can be brutal on the body."
bad,I would not recommend anyone to become employed with this company. A better management team and system is highly needed.
bad,"I started this business by finding profitable deals on goods then purchasing and selling on Amazon."
bad,Not a fun place to work. 15-20 miles walking and climbing stairs  each day at a very fast pace to make quotas. employees treated as 2 year olds
bad,"The morale is low, turnover is high, and the management team obviously does not know how to operate effectively in China."
bad,"A typical day at worked included working 12+ hours and standing for 95% of the day.  There is an office or two, however it is strongly looked down upon to be in there other from lunch breaks (30 min) and meetings. Amazon runs a very interesting operation and the experience is extremely unique.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the fact that you only work 4 days so you have 3 off.  On that note, you usually squeeze a 50 hour work week into 4 days and the days off normally only include one weekend day.  Management is good and the people are friendly for the most part. The biggest issue is that everyone has so much work to do and are always on the move  so it is difficult to actually get to know your co-workers or your associates."
bad,"This team will kill your soul. They encourage bad behavior (excessive drinking) and leadership goes out of their way to make things more difficult for you so you will burn out and leave quickly. The strategy here seems to be to hire young new college grads and tempt them with stock that won't vest for years, then burn you out with 60-80 hour work weeks before your stock can vest."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of walking more than ten miles a day, and interacting with co-workers and management regarding orders and shipments. I learned that the inbound/outbound warehouse industry is a fast paced and detail oriented environment. Timing and efficiency are keys to success. Management did not communicate effectively, myself and fellow co-workers often completed tasks of management, after several requests, in order to be completed in a timely fashion.  Being a team player and cooperating with co-workers help in the process of getting work done quickly.The hardest and the most enjoyable part of the job were the obstacles, such as misplaced orders, and figuring out what went wrong and finding a solution."
bad,I didn't like this job because of some of the management staff and the work wasn't for me because I have way more potential then to pack items into a box all day
bad,It was a good experience. learning a lot of useful thing in the for future warehouse jobs. Met a lot of people. Walked more than an average person would
bad,"The FC I worked at closed and was an older FC so it's hard to say how it compares to other FCs. A lot of time on your feet on concrete floors. Mostly good people to work with on the ground level. Managers in general didn't really care. It's all about rate, even when it's impossible too make rate or you're pulled to assist them with other stuff. There's not a good work balance so you will either work tons of overtime or be given time off."
bad,"Beaucoup de stress au sein de cette organisation, limite en pause,management incomprehensible, collegues sympa et serviable"
bad,"Worked in Indianapolis for 2 years, knew every area of the job very well, but was never considered for any promotional opportunities despite self-initiative.  If I were to recommend anything to person considering an Amazon warehouse, it would be be prepared for plenty of walking, bending, reaching, and squatting, which will wear on you slowly but surely.  Invest in good shoes."
bad,"Just walking from the parking lot was a workout itself. Hard to find a park and line was down the street in the morning causing me to be late even when I'd been in line for almost 30 minutes. Frustrating, draining, and very exhausting. Co-workers were nice and management didn't do much. The hardest part of the job was trying to get a high rate when u had to stock HUGE boxes on shelves with no room for them. Most enjoyable part is going home!!!"
bad,While working at amazon I was offered a promotion and while I was waiting for my dept and to be trained they fired me because the wear house was too full. They know they are too full and still expect workers to meet high production numbers
bad,"A typical day at work is log into your system and start pulling cases from the lobby to meet the days criteria and maintain your performance metrics. While your at it you will be learning how its like to stretch out your workload so its less stressful and maximizes your productive with minimizing mistakes and system or employee crashes. The management hierarchy is open for everyone to interact on different levels and while you report to a specific manager you will be able to go on the floor and interact with other teams and other managers. The hardest part of what seems to be the greatest job is the rotational shifts that require working hours stretched from 10 in the night to 6 in the morning that is excluding the time for transportation, and when you think it can't get worse the shift changes to morning 8 to 4 in the afternoon in a blink. Which leaves you looking like a zombie at work and productivity marginally goes out the window. Repeat this over a course of time, you end up with a hay wired biological clock that has no set sleep timings or food timings. The greatest part of this job was the energy filled teams that brought in so much of fun while at work it just seemed to be everywhere for that 9 hour shift, keeping you entertained and energetic for some more of those customers to satisfy."
bad,"Even if you are doing a good job, you are made to always feel your job is in danger. I would not recommend it."
bad,"working at Amazon was okay to an extent. The department manager had her picks and was very sneaky and strict. She treat you like young kids. I enjoyed working with my employees and meeting new people, but when it comes to talking and working we couldn't do that. For 11 to 12 hours you can't talk, but like I said the manager had her picks of who can do what."
bad,"I felt thought I had a job in which I would be with for many years, but what I found was, that as soon as a person got sick, and came back to the work force, they would shift a person around looking for a way to get rid of them. which just show me that there was no job security."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was the fast pace.  However it seem everyone keep to themselves employees and management.
bad,"- very sociable job"
bad,"Amazon is a company that cuts corners to destroy and absorb every business in its path. As far as their motto goes ""Amazon is the most customer-centric company on earth"", sure they are very customer-centric about your money. Their warehouses are the new plantations of the US, their slackjawed, knuckle-dragging, bum-kissing management are the unqualified masters lording over their new slaves bought from one of their temp services. I don't know how they make any money, since they have no competent managers"
bad,You will be talked down to.  Upper management is very condescending.  You opinion will not be taken seriously.  Need a complete overhaul of upper management.
bad,"Overall it is a good company to work for, much of upper management treats you as if you are just a number, huge turn over rate, and not enough hours for the number of staff. Long hours and on your feet the majority of the time, but makes up for it in pay. Must be independent and self reliant as little guidance to management."
bad,"Pro: Bonus at the end of each month"
bad,I quickly bought into the Amazon ideals...I very much enjoyed my job as a pack ambassador as well as safety commitee associate. Sadly after a few months all the safety and customer centric ideals that I whole heartedly embraced went to the way side in lieu of production. The leadership at DFW 7 is seriously lacking...I believe a new GM is in order!
bad,was ok to work there but didnt enjoy the fast based atmosphere
bad,Very stressful job at Amazon. They will figure out what you're capable of doing in 50 hours and then give you more. Compensation package includes a lot of stocks which are valuable.
bad,Expect to work long days.  Plan on not seeing your family during the holiday season.  Plan on being on your feet your entire 12 plus hour shift
bad,"I admire the companies focus on customer service and they truly do offer the best customer service I have ever witnessed.  I was excited to work for the company."
bad,"i enjoy my co-workers, & what i have learned. not exactly what i thought job was when hired, & did not know that we are under constant watch via stow gun."
bad,A good place to work for the person looking to do little and be payed little.
bad,"A good place to work if you need money, good wage but very hard work and breaks are not long enough."
bad,"In general you will work hard. "
bad,"They were not flexable with no one. It was a fast pace , busy job. It was very demanding for most people and it was none stop. The pay was pretty good for the amount of work that you had to do."
bad,First and foremost I'm grateful for my job but I'm still looking for another job. A typical day is I walk anywhere from 12 to 14 miles a day.
bad,Crowded workplace which causes employees to fail to complete timed work and goals.
bad,"I rated Amazon on a low scale because the management team needs a lot of work, needs to be more concerned about associates issues. The company needs to treat their employees better and not play games with their benefits. The company itself needs to stop with playing favorites. The hard workers don't get enough credit for the work they do, the managers give the favorite employees whatever they want as the hard workers get nothing for their hard work. "
bad,"ten hour work shifts in a non air conditioned or heated warehouse. breaks every two hours, the hardest part of the job was dealing with the temperature of the building. "
bad,the point system is not a good idea and there was no ac in the warehouse when i worked there.
bad,"The Walmart of internet commerce. To sum up my experience there i'll put it like this. One morning i sat in the parking lot watching people file in to start a normal workshift. Then i had an epiphany, everyone walking in who worked there for over a year had various arm braces, special boots for foot problems and wrist braces."
bad,"Working at Amazon wasn't horrible but It was not my favorite job, and it was a great skill to learn. It was over 1500 people working their, about 300 on my shift so it was very crowded in a small workplace. We had a set line. My line was just simply processing clothes, shoes, accessories into a box and passing on to the next person. Simple but challenging to do atleast 6 boxes in 3mins and not misplace anything in the wrong box with the labels on them. I definitely learned how to work under pressure and maintained a steady mind frame."
bad,"it is long hours, great pay nice people it a very fast pace enviornment but i liked it"
bad,I learnt how to work in a very rushed and stressful environment where communication was the main key to a successful day
bad,Working at Amazon.com you learn a lot of things. We get cross-train on everything we want to learn. The bad thing about Amazon.com is it get very hot during the summer and cold during the winter. Also the management wasn't so great.
bad,Didn't like  the job really had to deal with a lot of unreasonable practice's due to the lack of management that respected the associates at that facilitation.
bad,Adrntro de algunas station eres solo un numero porque no valoran tu trabajo
bad,No person is seen as a person. You are literally just a clock in number. Human resources are no help and the automated service you have to go through is ridiculous. Its like someone trying to file an insurance claim just to get denied
bad,"Everything is scanner, system, and computer based. Which can be helpful when your a hard worker, but when something goes wrong and it isn’t your fault they don’t want to hear anything, just see numbers."
bad,A typical day would be some meetings that would conclude to unrealistic targets. You get to learn a little of many technologies and programming languages. Management is competitive and you can feel that pressure in lower level
bad,"Doral location has  poor management,  with poor HR who I truly think is worse than any company I've worked for. Incidents get reported and not handled properly.  At any moment they text you to call & then u are told your assignment is over,  but u can reapply. It's a joke"
bad,They always preach 15$ per hour but a shift can only be 3 hours. Sometimes there can be poor management. Other than that It is a cool place to work at
bad,"You can work your tail off all night long, and feel winded yet it wouldn't do you much good to go that hard every night. The handling of packages is nice workout yet you can easily hurt yourself due to how often cumbersome  packages come your way. It also didn't help that people avoided large racks of packages sometimes, disrupting the workflow of the area. So if you like to keep busy, but not make much its not a terrible gig. Though some workers didn't like them the local managers were alright. "
bad,mauvaise direction cher Amazon de bonneuil une mauvaise manière de travailler
bad,Workers are paid to little for the amount of work they do. Salaries need to be increased and there are no bonuses.Workers are overworked and underpaid.
bad,Got promoted to in-house to be permanent in 2020. Was a driver and was great with management then 1st week in January got laid off after being told I’m permanent from management. Very unprofessional.
bad,"Disorganized. Report to a floor and wait for assignment to a ""station"" by a new recruit where You open boxes and call a ""pod"" to your station which may or not have openings that must be scanned before placing ( shove it in like everyone else) into the opening because they expect 3 pieces per ""pod"" every 7 seconds per item. It is MONKEY work. Jumping up and down a ladder and pushing buttons for the next ""pod"" and a trainer will come tell you not fast enough ( matrix algorithm). Once they get a robot to do that they will be self sufficient . Non-Cerebral work if you ride a short bus."
bad,"A typical day at work would be clocking in, getting a scanner, do a briefing and some stretches, start scanning boxes and building pallets, wrap the finish pallets, move them with pallet jacks"
bad,There is a disparity between how seasonal and FT associates are treated despite having the same expected work requirements. The company also makes promises to employees that they do not intend to keep so that employees will continue to work hard.
bad,I had a great time working here. The work environment was exceptional. The cars were nice. You could play music while you are driving. It was a basic 9-5 job that had good pay.
bad,"I'd be very careful about accepting a job from these people, and I'll tell you why. The pressure on you is crazy. First off, everyone in pick and pack has a rate. You can't avoid it and the lengths people go to avoid Time off Task are beyond belief. One FC literally had a person defecate in a tote and send it down the line. "
bad,En un periodo corto de tiempo se tiene que hacer todo lo de una jornada laboral normal
bad,The job was only for a high-demand season and was part-time. The pay is not ideal and the schedule leaves no time to leave for lunch. The pace is manageable and the workload is manageable. America should rely on the US Post Service and UPS and FedEx as opposed to Amazon.
bad,I have to stow twice a week while select few ppl never have to or rarley do it once a month i work dgr1 sort shift and they play favorites instead of switching ppl around on jobs to be fair. I signed up for tdr training and to learn new jobs and 6 months later i havent even heard a thing about it while these favorite ppl select few maneent favorites got tdr trained and trained on other jobs likrtsrproblemsolvesolve
bad,Did not like the job I have nothing else to say about the job  Or company thank you The management is terrible they look at you as slaves Not a good place to work for not for me.
bad,"Very Long shifts, breaks are not long enough. felt over worked during their holiday season with their 12 hour shifts. You are being monitored with everything you do. If you take to long with a task they will know so don’t take to long in the bathroom. Be ready to feel like a robot and only hear sounds of machines since there is no phones or headphones allowed. You are just supposed to do the same thing for the whole shift"
bad,"The company has an overwhelming minority presence."
bad,"Lavorare in Amazon è solo una perdita di tempo, nessuna prospettiva per il futuro. Poco trasparenti su molte cose"
bad,They hired a lot of people and not a lot of work. Work can be slow and feel long. Pay is good. They have good management and they are big on safety. They take care of workers.
bad,There is little opportunity for advancement despite constant suggestion to the opposite.  The company values a one hour interview more than delivering results when considering promotions.
bad,J'ai  travailler en 2019 et avril  aussi a ory 8 et j'ai aimé sauf le personnel très méchant envers les intérimaires merci
bad,A very unorganized and dangerous environment. Hard to meet goal and it's YOUR fault at all times. Were told to put boxes in the most dangerous areas where they can fall on people. A place not recommended to work.
bad,"Es wird überwiegend mit fremdländischen Leiharbeitern gearbeitet. Hohe Fluktuation seitens der Mitarbeiter und durch Amazon. Kontinuirliches Arbeiten daher sehr schwierig. Es erfolgen immer wieder Einarbeitungen, welches nach Ablauf der Ausleihfrist hinfällig werden und es von vorne beginnt. Derzeitig sind über 150 MA beschäftigt."
bad,"I enjoyed most of my co workers and supervisors. It was always clean and upper management did their best to keep us informed of training, safety, and changes to come. They tried to keep us in upbeat spirits and motivational. The hours were long and not as flexible as I thought they should be to accommodate their employees, regardless of my suggestions."
bad,this is a good job to have as a second job. you work 3 to 4 days on any given week for 8 hours. There are opportunities for extra hours but they are on a first come first serve basis. Most of the night is spent unloading the trucks with the tail end of the night dedicated to loading the delivery vans.
bad,"It is a fast paced environment despite its slow appearance, and no resolutions to overcrowding problems. And don't count on workers comp if you get hurt."
bad,Work life balance is very difficult to maintain. Salaries are low. Fast paced and not a lot of opportunities for advancement in HR on the east coast. Challenging
bad,"when i started working at amazon the place was very untidy and the warehouse needed a serious clean. i worked extremely long hours and put in 100 % to meet the proper standards of a work place. i was always on time and never called in sick. i was reliable,punctual and extremely polite towards the staff. "
bad,"Diverse company.  Loved to learn the different cultures."
bad,Management is lacking. It is all about who they like and who sucks up and not about performance. People get promoted because they suck up and not those who deserve it.
bad,It was little  stressful . It was seasonal as well . I enjoyed the culture there. I love to do hard work but it was stressful for me. I didn't get enough support. Staff was really friendly.
bad,Amazon has a lot of good except for management. The only way you move up is to learn their games and play them . Experience and expertise does not matter as long as you can b.s. your way then you're good.
bad,"Tutto era stato bene fino al rinnovo contratto quando meno di 1% hanno avuto rinovato il contratto. Da quello che ho visto io loro prendono in continuazione nuove persone, non ho capito fin adesso il perché."
bad,Most Managers dont know how to manage anything or anyone. They basically slave you there. They dont care if you have a injury with a doctors note or even lifting when your pregnant! Managers communications sucks!
bad,es ist sehr schwer dort klar zu kommen auch wenn man arbeite und gas gibt aber nicht die richtigen kontakte da hat kommt man nie weiter
bad,Good for some side money don't stay long. The managers are alright most of them are young college students who really haven't managed much at all. But seriously the money is alright and they took away stocks so really find some thing better. I was there for 2 years kind of a waste of time.
bad,Inizialmente mi sono trovato bene ma poco dopo la mole di lavoro e diventata insostenibile e di conseguenza subentra stress e nervosismo.nn la consiglio.
bad,Its definitely not what was expected the jobs not hard its just stresstful & they work you crazy its a lot going on most managers are very unprofessional
bad,"Not good for long run "
bad,"This is a job for those that are fast paced and are not easily distracted. You are expected to work at a certain pace and if you don't then there will be consequences unfortunately."
bad,"What else can I say about this company and their warehouses/fulfillment centers........ It is VERY easy to get hired at one of Amazon's Fulfillment Centers... Why? cause it is very easy for them to fire you. "
bad,the workplace is a rotating door for employees. there are new faces every week and employees only stick around for a week or 2. management doesn't care about regular problems if something breaks it takes weeks for it to be fixed.
bad,I am a current employee at amazon its so sad that I have to leave this company due to lack of hours. Not only I am a Full time student and need a part time job. The role I play in with amazon I don't have a set Schedule I have to pick up shifts everyday I am on top of it when its time to apply to my shifts but everything is gone due to the high volume of people we have. It's very stressful and I would like to move into a great company that can meet my desire of salary that can not only fit my schedule but to possibly make a carrier out of it.
bad,"The job was fine until more and more unnecessary rules and regulations came up. Me, as well  as others left for these reasons. Management as well as other co-workers, i had no problem with. Hours were also nice for consistency."
bad,"I worked at the return center and all the management there care about is there job and how can they look good, IT IS A HIGH SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT!!!!!!!!!"
bad,"It can be a stressful and dark environment. depending on position you can be over exerted mentally, physically, or both. this is a in between job. get in and get out."
bad,"A disorganized hodgepodge of bad management, inconsistent routing and faux ""team-oriented"" mindsets. I didn't get my own route without a ride along until almost a month into the job, and when I did, my routes were wildly inconsistent in not only scale but location. No one in management ever seems to really know you or pay attention to any individual concerns. $15.50 is solid pay for another job, considering they expect you to work 10.5 hour days with one 30-minute break. And when you do get done early, they expect you to rescue other drivers falling behind without question or you're chastised for it. They reward efficient delivery with more work or outrageously large routes on a consistent basis. Amazon pretends to be employee oriented, but it's painfully clear they only care about the financial bottom line."
bad,"I wouldn't say I regret my time there but that's solely due to the compensation. Management was a constant sh*tshow for a variety of reasons. One terrible middle-manager essentially founded the Pittsburgh office ""culture"" and it continues to suffer as a result. High-up executives constantly micro-managed specific 2/3-engineer projects to the point where we often spent more time communicating updates than developing software. Morale was constantly low and it was never a concern of lower/middle management to spend any effort to improve it. But at least I got my stock options."
bad,It’s a good temporary job but if you’re looking for full-time job I would not recommend because you’re not likely to get a full-time job They just make you think that you are getting a full-time job they don’t tell you so only for temporary job
bad,"It is a very stressful workplace, always someone looking over your shoulder. Supervisors never happy with your work. Its very fast paced with very little down time."
bad,"The only thing good about working this position was the flexibility in being able to choose your own hours. With that being said - getting the hours you desired was not guaranteed, as they over-hired for the hours available, which created resentment and frustration among employees. There was no management on location, which at times meant some employees would arrive 2 hours into a 4 hour shift, and submit ""missed punches"" and still get paid for the full shift. Other employees slept in their cars during shifts and still received the same pay as those who were working. Easy work (grocery shopping), but the cons outweigh the pros by a landslide."
bad,"management pushed for numbers, ""as you are just a number to amazon"" (a quote from one of my managers). Hard work depending on your position and a lot of favoritism.."
bad,"more focus on meeting targets than workforce wellbeing, too much favouratism between job allocation, bending or even breaking of h+s rules as and when suits."
bad,"Very Tiring job."
bad,"Good pay for my needs. Inadequate and unrealistic training. It never truly mirrors real-life work activity. Production expectations are also over the top and management seems to only care about Rate percentages and not the associates that worked hard to at least aim for 100%. Reprimanded and write ups unknowingly and prematurely in picking department. It was physically and mentally stressful to make 100%+ everyday with no opportunity to just learn and pace yourself.  You will be paid well,  but it will come at a cost for dealing with the company's everyday B.S. "
bad,Very unorganized. Huge lack of communication. Found myself struggling to get my boss to see the lack of motivation among the associates due to this. A lot of people are on a power trip in management. This proved difficult when making important operation decisions
bad,"Prolonged hours with not enough length of time for breaks especially when your killing your self with heavy duty lifting and bending no matter what age you are made to do it or sent home, also everyone is in a rase against each other and a-lot of but licking excuse my languages and backbiting to get to team leaders which is embarrassing like there is no other job but amazon"
bad,"I loved my job until i started trying to promote. I noticed people showing signs of sabotage towards me, i was fired then rehired due to false claims. basically didn't get promoted because at every interview they want a degree or want me to gain more management skills which my management never helped me achieve. my manager had degrees in bible stuff which i dont assume has anything to do with business and he was a junk manager so basically if you have a degree in anything then youre ready for a great career with amazon!"
bad,"Management is horrible, hours are lousy, very physically demanding, not much thinking involved. Great job for a young college kid. Not worth the drama of inexperienced managers who don't care about their hard workers."
bad,"Compensation is good at Amazon. How much you enjoy working there will depend on your management chain and how much you care about your work/life balance. If you get personal satisfaction from working long hours and accomplishing something then this is a great place to work. If you are looking for more than that, or you have/want to have a life outside of work, then you may be in for a surprise."
bad,"At first its a good job, pay and benefits make it worth it. The down side is the unrealistic expectations when they are changed often. Lack of communication and transparency. Its easy on the mind but hard on the body, as well as being borderline boring. The best part would be time off and other benefits."
bad,"Bonne ambiance "
bad,Lack of job security.  the error and rate expectations the environment is toxic because everyone is always in a bad mood because everyone is always on a write-up or probation
bad,"In all fairness, this was a new location. Management was in the process of figuring out the day to day operations and equipment did perform as expected. Leaving a lot of ""on your feet"" down time. There is or was a zero tolerance for siting at any time while in the warehouse. "
bad,"I got my first look inside an Amazon Fulfillment Center as a Fulfillment Associate.  My perspective on Amazon has changed as a result.  This isn't some Amazon bashing missive, but more of a bare bones raw analysis of a middle-aged man's experience inside Jeff's castle.  "
bad,was quickly trained on cherry picker for 1 day. I expressed I didn't feel ready to be on my own. was told to do job or resign. I begged for another position even at another facility. I was to afraid of 40 ft height reach with cherry picker especially having one break down on me. they quickly train you and throw you on the floor. breaks are timed from last item scanned to next item scanned. better not be late. barely anytime to use bathroom and get a snack. ridiculous !!!! Amazon could surely afford 20min breaks. they only care about getting those packages out. not that we are humans
bad,"Depends greatly on the team you go to."
bad,Management sucks. Their continually on you about rates (every hour). They work you like robots. Their starting to change certain guidelines which is causing more people to get fired. Terrible turn over rate.
bad,amazon is a great place to work if you are fast paced and like being pulled to other departments but it is hard  the rates are some what impossible to maintain and  the pay is average. please note this waqs before the got 15 bucks a hour
bad,"No work life balance and you're going to have to see subordinates treated unfairly. Great compensation package though. Overall, I would definitely not recommend working here."
bad,New manager “found” reasons to fire me so he could move his personal friend into my position. I loved my job and assisting customers but the new manager knew me less then 24hrs and decided he didn’t like me.
bad,Management were horrible they didn't respect you some were very rude you would have a few that loved their job. Pay was nice around Christmas season but you have to do a lot just for the $15 and hour. Work Life it was the worse I worked from 6:00 pm until 4:30 am. By the time you get home you can't go to sleep until 6am maybe 7am. By the time you go to sleep you have to go back.
bad,"If you want a job that a primate can do then this job is for you. You will not be challenged at Amazon. Anyone can do the job. You are replaceable. You are a cog in a machine. The warehouse is often dusty. On the bright side, you will get paid fairly well. And unlike other warehouses they have skylights."
bad,You would thing you get Amazon prime for free but you don't. Manager and management does not know what our job is or how it gets done. They make rules and organize that makes the job more difficult. For a bunch of people with degrees they can not do anything correct. Then you got the people that have been there the longest who knows everything and then there is the new hires that don't know what to do with the older group telling them what we all have to do. It is such a mess.
bad,"Extremely poor management - Senior Regional LP Manager has been with the company for over a decade but should be removed from the company and never allowed to work in a managerial role ever again.  This person is not a leader but degrades people and attempts to humiliate them in order to motivate them.  Somehow, some way - no one above has caught on to this or just ignores this.  Others just simply say it's the way it's always been...healthy huh?"
bad,"Amazon management is NOT the place for someone to work if they had a family or child or a normal life outside of work for that matter. This type of facility within Amazon is a high volume center, so there is never a break. I have been there almost 4 months now and I have had 12 weeks of overtime out of my 15 weeks. Pay is absolutely horrible for what the associates are paid here. The newer the hiring period, the less you make. I make $16,000 less than a co-worker who was hired as an L4 college hire area manager and it was only because they were hired 9 months before me. Absolutely think twice about a facility like this if you want to have a normal life and not have more stress inside of work rather than outside. I'm lucky to have had a good group of people mentoring me thus far or else I would have been out a long time ago"
bad,was good to get warehouse skills. to much favortism. work load not distributed evenly. most management way too young. management switched between departments to often. No Consistency.
bad,I would only work for Amazon if you don't have any other options. You are there until they don't want you there anymore which usually happens when they don't actually want to keep you on so they won't have to pay give you any more raises. There's an attendance policy that sets you up to fail even if you didn't do anything to violate the policy. They'll be sure to try and hire you back after they fired you for whatever made up reason they came up with. Best thing about the job was the pay and benefits if you take advantage of them. You'll be able to work with some cool people as well but that doesn't take away from how the actual company treats you.
bad,"Do not apply for pack! As a packer, you get the most blame is there is a mess up on the order, even though it might have not been your fault. I was written up three times before being let go, for things I had no control of. Things wouldn't be in the shelf the the sorter places the products on, and you would be the one to blame. This also goes for most of the other departments in the warehouse."
bad,"you barely work 4 hours a day. the Amazon sortation center (or sort center) is where packages arrive already packed from an Amazon fulfillment center, and are sorted down to a zip code level to then be sent on their way to the customer."
bad,"They hire people that really don't deserve to be hired and the ones they work to death, they fire. I worked hard. Got employed permanently, then they changed their mind the same week. Smh."
bad,very stressful place to work the pay is pretty good but not worth the stress from the managers the time off is a great benefit and the maternity leave is great
bad,"The managers do not care. You are nothing but a number to them. If you like fast-paced, hard-working, heavy lifting jobs with barely any breaks then this job is the one for you."
bad,"I've been at Amazon for 3 years and it gets worse and worse everyday. Managers abuse their power, have their favorites, and treat us like slaves. Their numbers are more important than anyones safety. Quantity over Quality is how they roll. The only good part is they have worked with my school schedule for a long time and offer great benefits, and good UPT, PTO, and Vacation hours as well as benefits. Not worth the physical and mental drainage for 10 hours 4 days each week."
bad,"Where do I begin! Amazon is the example of what happens when you make people managers that are not equipped nor qualified for the job. I'm shocked at the level of disorganization that I witness, at a management level. First it is impossible to give someone 200 items for delivery and expect them to get them done in a 8 hr shift. Fed Ex and UPS drivers deliver abt 100 packages daily and they've been around for years, so take notes Amazon! When you arrive to work, you have so much to do before you can get on the road, you end up wasting valuable time. Every day you show up, the managers are still trying to figure out their plan for the drivers. Then to top it all off, you pick up and drop off your van in a different location from where you park and clock in/out. Hello people, don't you realize you would still be held liable for that employee if they got into an accident in their own personal vehicle, still on the clock?  Just an absolute mess! It wouldn't take a college degree to figure out the logistics to ensure productivity. Your structure (or lack thereof) is costing you millions! Your employees should wise up and start a union on Amazon, then you would pull it together. Now given all of this, I will say thank you for given me a great business thesis to write, should I need one."
bad,I was a temp that worked integrity staffing solutions. The place itself is extremely cut throat. You dont have time to do anything. You cant even go to the restroom in peace with out someone coming up to afterwards complaining how your rate per min/rate per hour has gone down a point. The daily rate percentage non peak are extreme. During peak season it's even worse. The learning curve is awful for this company. You have maybe a week to get the hang of the job itself but you Have to worry about moving 300mph on top that. If you like extreme environments with extreme expectations to match this is your place to work
bad,"- it was ok"
bad,En general buen ambiente laboral aunque no así con los jefes
bad,"Very hard  and fast pace work. It was a job not a career place . I would not work there again. The time I did work there I am grateful, it helped my family."
bad,"Extremely hard on your body unless you are already very physically capable. Lack of consistency between managers, HR personnel, and upper management. Very few advancement or transfer opportunities. I originally started with hopes of working up the ladder, but this job and company are a better fit for someone who doesn't mind an unprofessional work environment, physically demanding labor work, and lack of support from management."
bad,"it was ok until they made you re-aply for your job. then when we started doing the one day delivery the rose up the tag times and then they where getting rid of departments such as decant where that helped to fix any mistakes before it went to stow ground. There where some days the building would be extremely hot and the water areas wold be broken. they thought  a tinny fan in each station would help but it don't . "
bad,"the associates form cliques and if you're not part of one, good luck "
bad,"NOTE: I AM NOT A PROTOTYPICAL EMPLOYEE AND I QUALIFY AS AN EMPLOYEE WITH A DISABILITY."
bad,"you think temps are treated bad, full timers as well. no communication one manager thinks they can talk down to people constantly. HR only available on site couple of times a month even when you make appointment nobody knows where they are no training given cant do it after been shown once or twice if temp your out full timers get from  manager you should know by now its easy start thinking what your doing. people try really hard and work long hours compulsory overtime after working nightshift."
bad,"Nothing was more important than forcing through huge volumes of product to meet numbers for productivity goals, including the safety and well-being of employees. The job is very fast paced and  physically demanding and involves a lot of repetitive stress. Even though I have done warehouse type work for years and am used to physically active jobs, in only 6 weeks I developed repetitive stress injuries from the work. Breaks are very short and often you are so overwhelmed with work that you cannot even take your breaks, or have to make them shorter to avoid falling even more behind. Employees are part time/temporary and are treated like they are disposable. You don't get much training and there were important things I had no idea I was supposed to know until weeks after I was hired because no on told me. Safety is not a priority as long as you get the job done as fast a possible. The packages are treated poorly too, because no one has the time to handle them with any sort of care: they regularly fall off of racks and conveyors, get crushed under heavier packages, are thrown, kicked, and stepped on."
bad,Part time allows four hour shifts 3-4 days a week. Overtime is basically only allowed during peak season. Management was extremely horrible and lacked proper communication with employees. They allow just anyone to be a lead without proper training.
bad,"The job itself is extremely simple and repetitive, however, workers are looked down upon. They try to make you feel as if you are part of something special, but in reality that is not the case. They also tend to give you false numbers on how much the warehouse needs in order to leave"
bad,"Lots of time on your feet,  good exercise.   Too many managers who don't necessarily get what's going on.   Good people leave,  lazy people are tolerated."
bad,"Its a nice place for young adults to start off with. Help get them started in their life. Its a nice to work also, just need to work more hous and not 28.50 hours. We need 40 hours!"
bad,"Amazon expects so much from you, but doesn't give you the tools to help you succeed.  "
bad,"If you really need a job or extra cash, this wouldn't be too bad. It's an absolute nightmare if you can't stand working in silence for 10-12 hours like a robot. Also, hope your bladder is strong because if you go use the restroom your rate will drop and they can dock you for it."
bad,amazon is a company that DOES NOT care about its workers well being they treat you like slaves the only thing i can say is they pay you a decent bit above minimum wage and the benefits are good but what good are they if you dont get treated well?
bad,I enjoyed working for Amazon. The pay and benefits were amazing. I would say the pro about working for amazon was the pay and the con was the long hours.
bad,"I do not want to leave a review of when I worked for Amazon. It kinda sucked because of the management. They never really communicated. You feel like just a number, they always pushed you for higher rates, but it was easy most of the time."
bad,"Unless you know someone, who likes someone, who knows someone else... You won't be offered an interview let alone a promotion. At DOM1 most applications were overlooked and jobs were passed along by referral only."
bad,I hated it there but they payed really nice for my short time being there. I never met or talked to my supervisor. All you do is scan packages on to a pallet wrap the pallet and move it to the shipping location either by pallet jack or forklift.
bad,"The last facility i worked at, made many individuals feel they had no room to grow. A lot of favoritism around the facility. Managers only cared about their numbers."
bad,"Nichts auf Dauer, da es körperlich anstrengend ist."
bad,"Management seemed more focused on promoting or hiring gender specific persons. The last manager did not address issues that I had, nor was the manager there during my shift."
bad,Relatively fast-paced work environment with high expectations for associates but not always for management. Worked with both some of the worst and some of the best managers I've found at a job. Working 4 days a week is definitely a nice schedule.
bad,Amazon is a great place to work the associates are great but management is questionable. They can use a lot of improvement to learn how to get along with their associates.
bad,A fairly stressful job with little opportunity for advancement and very little benefits. Your body will likely become exhausted given enough time and there isn't a good reason to stay long term.
bad,Hard to advance because management plays favorites but that’s at any job. Good place to stack your money but I wouldn’t recommend trying to make a career there
bad,"Wroked 4 hours at a time, sorting packages onto pallets. Some packages were light weight and small while others were heavy. Breaks were technically 10 minutes, but with the time it takes to cross the warehouse and sit down to eat and then get back to your workstation, they were a little less than 5 minutes long."
bad,There is very little relevant training associated with this job. There is a great deal of accountability with very little coaching or development.    Plan to figure things out on your own as you go.
bad,When I worked at amazon it was peek season they hired everybody and it was to crowded. Not enough room at your stations or nothing. The hardest part was standing the whole 10 hours.
bad,"they pay $15 at start but the conditions are horrible. super hot and dusty with very little air circulation. closest bathrooms are generally 5-10 minute walk away and you get in troule for being away from station for more than a minute or 2, but the amount of water you have to drink to stay hydrated there means alot of bathroom breaks. only decent management is HR."
bad,"This is my 5th or 6th time working as a direct hire at amazon. A typical work day here is very long and not much variety in what you will be doing all day. They will talk a good game about training you in other areas, but it is what it is, just talk. You get a 30 minute break and two 15 minute breaks, but don't expect to be able to relax on the short breaks. It takes two to three minutes to walk to the break room and the same amount of time to walk back to your work station, which comes out of your 15 minutes. So now you have about 8 to 10 minutes to relax. Please don't bring food that you have to microwave, you'll waste even more time. Most of the managers are great people, and they work with what they have. The hardest thing here is to work and keep up with the rate, which is sometimes very hard. You have to work very fast and get burnt out quick.TIME OFF TASK will be the death of you here and if you don't get in trouble for anything trust and believe that they will find some way to write you up. The people are great though. I would just say don't come here with the intention on staying for 5+ years. Its great money for a short period of time, but it gets old fast and you will run yourself into the mud trying to keep your job, which after all that is it even worth it anymore."
bad,Hard work with little reward. Communication is lacking. There needs to be more employee incentives. HR teams need to be willing to go the extra mile for the employees.
bad,"Unless you're interested in a warehouse type position, or are applying to a position in Seattle, nearly all Amazon jobs are in a warehouse.  The culture is very cut throat, management is inconsistent but highly competent.  Pay and benefits are amazing, but be prepared for this company to completely and utterly suck up your life and free time.  If a work-life balance is important to you then avoid Amazon.  If base pay, stability and opportunity is what you're looking for then Amazon is perhaps the best place you can go.  Every site is a little different. I've met numerous peers whom loved their role and job, but I was misled during my entire interview process.  My on the job training was a total joke. Finally, my manager was the type of person who was better suited to manage projects and processes, not people so that made my experience highly toxic."
bad,Freshmen college students pretending to be HR that don't even know how to perform their jobs and are completely unprofessional along with managers. managers play favorites New process   assistants think that they are managers and think they can do what they want and think they can force you to do something you really don't need to do their 30 minute rule is by far the most stupidest rule of them all and questionable for something illegal they count down each minute you take a bathroom break and or stop to drink some water or stretch. 12 hour shifts its kind of hard not to stop for a minute but consistent threats for final written warnings if stopped. For a job thats overnight you would think people would be more nicer judging on how everyone is there for the same reason. The pay is more you'd think they would be more relaxed and nicer nobody has time for in the middle of the night. they steal breaks they make you go down from the 4th floor to the first floor break room that takes 10 minutes walking down and 10 minutes back up so your break is really 10 minutes if late more threats with final written warnings clearly they abuse power. anything to fire someone managers makes promises they never keep i usually keep good numbers rate and time very little errors if you have good days you can be promised moving up until you have one bad day the person that had a good day becomes the new favorite your forgotten annoying its a competition game  that you really wont win
bad,"Don't work any harder than you have to, I gave that place 14 months of hard work and it got me absolutely no where. They want you in the same level 1 position as long as they can, the majority of managers have no idea what the job is really like, and they only got where they are due to having a degree."
bad,"Don't want to talk about this "
bad,"Started off great, then got worse. Management are a bunch of freshly graduated from college kids. So that should tell you a lot. Management gets lazy, doesn't care attitude a lot of the time. If you are worthless, lazy and a butt kisser....prepare to get promoted. If you work hard, learn you job, learn all you can, work your butt off, you'll be over looked and worked to death. Also be prepared to be ignored for being up relevant issues."
bad,no advancement in workplace. management is standard with little training given. one upside is the salaries are high and weekly payment is an advantage
bad,"Very biased and no work life balance. Mangers tend to misuse Amazon leadership principle for their own benefit."
bad,"Company has amazing supply chain and very smart people to work with but culture is horrible."
bad,"At Amazon I was kept on ""Each Receive"" a job where you take product of a conveyer belt then scan it and put it in a cage. I was always at the end of the line and the people in front of me always took the easy multipack items and each item had to be taken out and scanned indiviually. While I got the huge and heavy items that had to be put in a cage. Also when the cage got full we had to close it out and get a new one. Amazon had a rate system and it was difficult to make if you didn't scan a lot of items.The more items you scanned the better your rate and you have to do well hourly. So taking the multipack items AKA ""Master Packs"" boost you rate a lot. Also if you didnt make rate for a week you get a write up. You get 1 warning and then you get 2 right ups then a final warning then you are fired after your next write up after your final warning. I worked without stopping unless there was nothing on the line or no cages. I got my final warning for not making rate even after explaining that I can't make rate with this outrageous standard and the other 7 people taking all the easy products. We are supposed to do ""1 Piece Flow"" which means that there is only suppose to be 1 item at each persons station everyone else would pile items on their table and still keep grabbing items off the conveyor belt. While I'm still doing ""1 Piece Flow"", but if I even thought of taking more than one product; these same people who were causing me not to make rate and not doing ""1 Piece Flow"" would tell a supervisor. But when I would tell a supervisor they wouldn't say anything because all the other"
bad,"If you want a guaranteed full-time job with so-so pay, this is the job for you. You are assigned a role in their massive facility and are expected to hit a target number per hour, per shift. You will do this one role for 6 months until you are allowed to request a role change."
bad,"10 hour shifts for a single person is doable.  As for running a house, husband and teenager its a bit more difficult.  The worst part with the length of hours is the expectations of the company.  Work like a dog at the same insane pace for every second for $15 and hour!  Your 2 breaks are exactly 15 minutes and lunch is 30.  They constantly stress this.  You are not to be human!  Write ups for errors, speed and anything other then robot mode is plentiful.  We are just another number to them.  Felt we all had to be sheep following the sheep in order to survive. Management was upbeat and friendly, but they are the individuals giving you the feedback that you suck.  But of course they are told to tell you that.  How is this motivation?  All of us are working are butts off and this is what you tell me.  Why bother? Other positions such as management and such may be alright, but why would I want to work for someone who sets unrealistic expectations with little pay for the rest.  It's not worth it. Thought this would be a great place to work as they supposedly cater to veterans. Maybe it's run by Robotic Marines?  I served this country, but at least the Air Force kept in mind we were all human."
bad,The management is horrible and like to act like they own everyone. They hire managers that have little to no idea what they're doing and they have no consideration for their employees.
bad,"Working for Amazon was a rewarding and interesting experience."
bad,Have to be will to fully commit yourself to be successful.  Hours are long but culture of smart people.  Will learn a lot and if able to successful there will be able to be successful any place.
bad,"If working in sortation, you get very little breaks. Diverse peers and management. Few bathroom breaks, monitored extremely. Usually 4-8 hour shifts. Management did a good job training."
bad,"When I took my drug test I was excited to start but the orientation was super boring. We watched videos for hours while the employee in charge occasionally looked up to chat with us. I should have known at how orientation was conducted"
bad,"You will have fun training classes that last a few months in the beginning, but they eventually throw you to the wolves. The first month or so won't count against you as you are learning, but you will learn fast that beyond that first month of being on the floor alone, you better be up to standards fast or you get in trouble. It seemed like everyone was always stressed about losing their jobs due to some sort of unrealistic expectations. Calls were expected to take less than 5 minutes, despite having to answer extremely complex questions and dealing with extremely emotional customers. Out of all surveys done, you must have at least 93% positive reviews, even from customers you had to deliver bad news to due to company policy. Any minute late you were on any given day is one minute they take away from your paid time off, in addition to getting in trouble for being one minute late. You get 40 hours of paid time off per year that does not carry over into the next year, and 40 hours of paid vacation that must be approved 2 weeks in advanced before you take it, and will be denied if its anywhere near the holiday season. You can acquire no more than 80 hours of vacation before it stops accumulating, and anything beyond 80 hours will not transfer over to the following year. You get no unpaid time off or sick pay, and if you sign up for 40 hours a week, they will pressure you into working at least u hours of overtime each week thereafter. When nobody takes the ""optional overtime"" they make it mandatory, to where you must work 56 hours per week. This was the case the entire 1.5 years"
bad,"Amazon is an exciting place to work in terms of there fast paced environment, however they do not treat all members of staff with respect and lack a duty of care"
bad,"You never have the time for any kind of break with the amount of packages amazon expects you to deliver! I feel like us drives should be departing at 8:30a.m but I leave the facility around 9:30 everyday! Which means, I probably won’t deliver my first package until 10a.m it’s a total mess in the morning trying to avoid other drivers and the tight areas we have to maneuver through in the a.m."
bad,Very fast pace job. It takes everything out of you. After working their a lone time it does a number on your body.  Long hours. The only good thing is the friends you make.
bad,"Worked there for a while. started with an agency, and worked me up to Lead role, "
bad,"Fun at 1st but boring long term. I've worked here over 1 year. Its repetitive even when you do get moved around often like myself. Tiring and demanding, this would be ok if the job actually felt rewarding but it isnt. The associates do all the work and the toughest work and get the least from working there. Theres so much more i could rant on about but i dont care enough."
bad,"typically ten hour shifts spent either standing or walking in often less than ideal conditions such has very hot or very cold areas. 30 minute lunches and two 15 minute breaks but that includes the time it takes to get to the break room, so for some it can be as little as a 5 min break off your feet. Little room for advancement because so many people are trying to advance as well. There can be a lot of favoritism and most people above you are just trying to get through the day. Many dont really care about you and just want you to figure everything out on your own. There are some good people there though and some managers willing to help you out if you ask. Overall though, its a depressing place to be."
bad,I worked in the Safety Dept. and learned that Amazon is a very unsafe place to work. Management was always worried about numbers rather than creating a good work environment. The hardest part of the job was witnessing unsafe behaviors and not being able to satisfactorily resolve the problems.
bad,"Was written up on for going to do a different task multiple times"
bad,"drove cars, lots of packages"
bad,"the job is for those people want to buy something or complete a task like going overseas, saving to buy a house but not a place you want to turn into a career"
bad,great cafeteria with alot of choices of food. be ready to work hard an long hours. if you dont mind working overtime 6 days a week.insurace an 401k is great. great people to work with
bad,"awful atmosphere, round holiday periods workers are pretty much forced to worked long hours/overtime, and are forced work weekends, with the treat of being fired if not agreed"
bad,"I love buying things through Amazon but working there is something else entirely. The hours for part time are terrible due to the pay ""raise"" which effectively pays me no more or less then what I made before, with more hours. Management is inconsistent in quality, and the pay isn't worth the the terrible amount of hours we're forced to accept. Help for advancement to full time is also uncooperative."
bad,"The only good part about the job is the benefits honestly. They give long work hours with a bad wage starting at $15.75 per hour, really hard labor work. The management is horrible they treat everyone bad, and walk around like they're better than everyone else."
bad,"Was hired originally for full-time, found out after two months I was temporary and lost position.  No managers available during shift, HR is a 1-800 number."
bad,"They're not as bad as their made out to be, but in no way as good as they tell themselves they are."
bad,"High paced environment where you're not always empowered to do the right thing, only the politically correct that has negative repercussions on the company and associates. If you lack a moral standing then it's a high paced enviroment with stock incitive"
bad,"Climbing ladders"
bad,"I was working for amazon driver ."
bad,overall it was a great experience to have worked for fedex.I also learned about the company on how it works to get the packages sent out to the customers.
bad,Fast paced job working to get orders processed shipped out to customers. During peak there is alot of overtime. I've worked night shift for almost four year's. I just recently switched to days.
bad,"The company Amazon is cool, its management that is giving them a poor reputation. I was excited about the opportunity, but now I just go to work to get my part over with. I'm ok with the production, but it balances not be a hardship on your employees. "
bad,"A typical day was 12+ hours of meeting on top of meeting. By the time it was over, it was time to start finishing actual work. Cut-throat behaviors were rewarded and inexperience is rampant. Management encouraged employees calling each other out during meetings. The best part of the job was the diversity and solving complex problems."
bad,"warehouse side, it was a total nightmare. often i wasn't allowed to take a lunch during my shift due to them wanting more bodies on the floor. store side, the work was easy but everyone skipped out on working leaving few people to complete orders. They need to take a step back and look at the management again. a good part time job though."
bad,"Good computer knowledge "
bad,"Amazon gave a lot of lip service to putting you in a suitable position and working to your strengths, but instead falsly advertised what positions would entail to make it sound like it would fit your strengths, even if it doesn't."
bad,Tried many times to advance but the management seemed to favor their friends for certain tasks. Lack of good communication within the management team.
bad,"i have nothing to say "
bad,"AWS is a great technology company.  The consulting arm is in disarray.  The management has set a path that does not support their ""mission"" nor does it make the consultants very happy.  Top level executives peer into low lever managers businesses and say they let you run your own business but then question everything you do.  The technical parts of the the organization are much better.  But again beware many seasoned managers with career obsession - stomping on everyone and anyone to advance their job level to get more stock.  Look for positions in technology and not consulting."
bad,"Most days are filled with phone calls with sellers or other duties as assigned. Teams are made and dissolved at random and associates can be fired for small offenses. Overtime can be made mandatory with little to no notice. Most of the Managment team do a good job, but there are a few bad apples in the bunch. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with constantly changing demands, and not having any opportunities to advance unless you become a mentor. With overtime demands and few opportunities for time off, there is little work/life balance. People in other roles at Amazon (Software Devs, Engineers) do not take Seller Support Associates seriously. The best part of the job is the insurance benefits."
bad,Amazon works you very hard. It wouldn't have been such a bad job if the breaks where longer and the pay was better. wouldn't tell anyone to apply there.
bad,"No me e llevado una buena experiencia como empresa,deja mucho que desear,no sabes cuando vas a librar,no sabes donde te toca repartir ese dia...etc"
bad,"If you work through an agency, they can fire you with no reason, just telling lies to justify their dismissal, even if their 3200 video cameras see otherwise."
bad,"I was a contract driver for 2 years and 6 months for Amazon in Austin under the Flex umbrella. At first it was an amazing job. However once the changes started coming in, hours became more difficult to acquire, at the end of my time there it was almost impossible to get the hours. The way in which you had to get the hours was soul leeching, you couldn't live your life. When I found an app that helped me search for the hours because the shifts would go so quickly when they did appear, I was threatened with termination, yet Amazon would not give me more than 6 hours pre-scheduled a week. "
bad,Temps get treated poorly and are just another one more person that amazon doesn’t care about. Also there isn’t much opportunity to progress in this company either!
bad,"A typical work day starts with stand up meeting, picking routes for driving companies, staging routes, picking flex routes, staging flex routes and moving a lot of empty racks. "
bad,Some days things was going wrong. That's all I have to say. The bathroom was very clean. The supervisors some of them was very rude and not helping and the paid was good.
bad,"You can get written up every week, multiple times as a tier 1, for productivity (quotas) or quality (dpmo).  The write-ups can be out of your control and eventually inevitable.  Pay is not the greatest,  but the health benefits are awesome. Turnover is outrageously high. "
bad,A decent job if you have no skills or education.  If you have no aspirations and can deal with repetition and frustrating management then you could stick with Amazon and possibly move upwards.  It takes about four to five years of experience to reach Tier four and then make some excellent money.
bad,To bossey. This was agency work and every thing was done in a rush. No time to learn the job. I was not happy at all with this employer. They need to show a lot more patience when training new staff.
bad,"Not the worst, not the best. Not sure the perks make up for all the mismanagement and backstabbing. Do what you will. And good luck ever knowing who your GM is...."
bad,Amazon management is very poor due to its scale. Very fewer chances to grow to a new position and required do frequent internal transfers. It may have to pay you more than others but work is always stressful and lacks in work organization.
bad,Very fast paced work environment. So fast paced that there is no time to have any real social interactions (at least not when you're a picker). Management only cares about the numbers and has no problem writing you up while you are still training.
bad,"This is not a place that fosters teamwork.  Amazon is about stepping on anyone you need to in order to get where you want to go. Managers are encouraged to throw each other under the bus to help their own chances of a good review."
bad,It is good earning money but if you don’t have your own van then you a lot of your pay goes towards it. Have to be prepared to spend a lot of petrol and not get much back.
bad,A standard day at Amazon consists of a standup procedure to notify associates of what the daily objectives are for productivity rates to which associates are assigned their given tasks based off of permissions/certifications. My specific role in this is to work with management in execution of the daily objectives and maintaining constant communication of the process paths of the required roles to meet set standards. The only good or decent thing about working at an Amazon warehouse is the associates. The work is stressful and taxing on the body at times unless you are a manager who does nothing.
bad,"Deferred maintenance on equipment, management slow to act on ongoing issues from prior shifts, other departments sending defective items down the lines on a consistent basis. I would not recommend working there until there is a completely new team of management and HR that does not look at associates as numbers."
bad,Has its ups and has lots of downs. Every warehouse is different I'm sure. Headquarters is probably better. They don't care as much about the bottom of the totem pole grunt distribution workers. Management doesn't have experience and likes to act like they know what's going on but barely do. Stand around pretending to be important. Lots of favoritism. Unfair selection in job delegation. Very condescending. Barely reasonable pay.
bad,Amazon is not a very good place to work. They are very driven and customer centric. You work 10 hour shifts and are only expected to use the bathroom once. The bathrooms and break areas are extremely far from your work area and you have limited time to get there and back. Disciplinary action can be taken for almost anything at Amazon. They are a huge company with a lot of competition in the work place. They are constantly doing things to make the associates work harder and faster than they already are. The management is horrible. HR is a joke to work with. Almost anything that needs to be dealt with has to be done by someone else not in the building.
bad,"Shopping on Amazon.com is a breeze, but working for them is a completely different story. They are more focused on quantity not quality. Working nights 12 hours a night, 4 nights a week wears you down, very quickly, with only a 1 hour break between those 12 hours. So you tell me, is Amazon a place you would want to work?"
bad,If you don’t meet rate don’t expect to be there to long. I didn’t like management because they were more worried about the numbers than the employees well being I saw someone pass out and they told them to get water and go back to work.
bad,"Whatever you do, don't choose to work here unless you have virtually no other options. If you have no life, this is the place for you. You can do better."
bad,You do not have any job security. You can be terminated at any given time.For the most simplest of mistakes. They do not care about you as a individual. they have made several mistake on my checks.
bad,Warehouse employees were evaluated on volume of product moved.  Interaction with others was discouraged.  Work is done in narrow isles on multiple floors.
bad,This place will run you down and suck the drive out of you. They will try to write you up over the littlest things. They pick and choose favorites and if you are not one they give you a hard time.
bad,working at amazon is extremely hectic. Their policy sucks not a great place to work. The building is falling apart and all they care about is how fast to move but under paying us
bad,"you need to pack 5 boxes in a minute "
bad,"The culture of amazon is not for those who think this is an easy job. The benefits are good, however the company is not run the way it should be for a corporation that makes as much money as they do"
bad,"I worked my butt off for this company and there is truly no reward. If you want to advance, you'd better be a favorite with your AM or PA, otherwise, forget it. "
bad,"Top packer "
bad,Amazon dont care about you as a person. All they seem to care about is your numbers. You could come everyday and be a good worker and a good person dedicated to the job but if your numbers are not good your gone. They have a revolving door for employees. As soon as your gone the next group is in to replace you. They get big tax breakes for hiring as many people they can
bad,Simply a training employer to get young people off to a good start with future employment elsewhere. The work is very hard on your body. Injuries do happen often and clocking in and out for lunch can steal your lunch break time and parking can be a hassle.
bad,Very frugal and Amazon's principles does not encourage good work culture. It encourages unnecessary competition. Review system is worst. It encourages unnecessary competition.
bad,"Too fast-faced, high targets, but reachable, not enough Personal Time, can't ever be late or leave early without getting Voluntary Time Off approved, no vacation between October and January."
bad,"work at Amazon is very physically hard and the pay is very low, The company need to pay this workers more than what they are paying them. I like the benefits."
bad,Amazon Fulfillment has taught me a lot and given me character however the work life balance was a little much to juggle. I learned how to effectively lead a team to deliver results towards a common goal.
bad,"Great place to learn and live no work life balance, tend to have a lot of meetings, projects for the sake of projects and plenty of time at work as the words balance mean very little."
bad,"Besides being monitored constantly, being timed to go to the bathroom, getting paid barely livable wage its a good company to work for if your just getting out of high school looking for a job. The average Amazonian will acknowledge these things and even was reported in a lot of non mainstream media outlets. Every day I got to work I notice the shortage of employees during the TWI shift and it effect productions so much that we would have to flex up an hour to meet volume numbers. After those shifts depending if we flexed up or not and are working a double we have two arcade machines, and a fools ball table with a bistro in the cafeteria with a free coffee machine. The breaks between shifts are 30-2hrs depending if we flex up or not. The breaks during the shifts are 15 minutes but its really 10 because the factory is so big people rush across the factory just to make it to the break room and if you're station on the opposite side of the factory it takes you three minutes to get there because you cant run of course. If you're looking to find a full time position you have to jump the gun because full time positions are not as common as you would think. Most of the people who are working there are part time and no one gets overtime for doing doubles and your only allowed three doubles a week. Amazon doesn't recognize Easter as a holiday like most companies do, and I'm sure there's no raises even if you worked there for awhile. Keep in mind I'm speaking from the perspective of a part time employee who works there it maybe different depending on locations and other employees. I know"
bad,Love working there at times. The holidays were a little hard especially if you had to work. Wish you could get hired back on full time. Hard to changes departments and shifts.
bad,The job by itself is really easy but the pace they want you to maintain is pretty high but doable. When I worked there the turn over rate was the highest iv'e ever seen in any company.
bad,"Stressful, fast paced, always looking forward to resting on breaks. Metric changes make it harder to stay without getting in trouble for something.  When one department fails it may fall on you and you may get in trouble for not catching their mistakes."
bad,"You will experience lots of overtime, stress, and fatigue.  Constant process changes will lead to employee burnout.  You will manage associates where there is 50% to 70% turnover after 6 months."
bad,"Working at Amazon was not bad overall. Their only drawbacks would be that management picks who they like and that is it, if they don't like you then you get the worst jobs and are micromanaged. If they like you they will put you on a non rated function and you basically spend the rest of the day ""hanging out"" while everyone else around has to pick up the slack."
bad,Amazon is a great place to work until you need help from your manager or are experiencing trouble outside of work. I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts at Amazon and I've been told that I should get a new job instead of being offered some kind of help.
bad,Pay was good for work expected of you but they do not treat employees good lots of time off of work offered most not paid HR department not very helpful hands are very tied when it comes to helping employees because of strict rules.
bad,"If your NOT living any where within 10 miles of the 'Alliance county"" district ""THE gas,traffic (going & coming) I'30 south NOT WORTH THE PAY TRUST ME"
bad,High demands rate rate rate breaks safety first not driven by leadership no communication leadership to associates. Inconsistent DEPARTMENTS across the FC
bad,Je travaillais pour Amazon à Bové et je n'est aucune envie du retravailler
bad,Amazon would be a great place to work if they weren't trying to get people fired left and right and if it didn't have so much favoritism. The benefits that someone receives are absolutely great the best benefits I have ever received from a company but there is absolutely NO job security. It is as if they try to get everyone out before they can receive their stocks at the 2 year mark. The turnaround rate at this place in unreal.
bad,"Fixed shifts, punctuality, log in on time, take calls and listen to clients need and complaints, trying to get the problems solved as possible as you can, write down the case remarks to proceed, finally call the client back to make sure that problem get solved."
bad,I was Working in picking
bad,"Massage therapy was not what i thought it is was going to be. I enjoyed giving family and friends massages and thought it would be a great way to make money. After completing most of my schooling we were told, ""Don't be surprised if you get asked for a happy ending."" They had to explain to me what they were talking about. I worked at the 1st location for 2 months and the 2nd location for 1 month. I was surprised if I wasn't asked for a happy ending."
bad,"Poor management, overworked, underpaid. Every day was a constant fight with management because all they wanted to do was cut corners for faster and better results. I felt like a metric and not a person."
bad,"the hours are so long especially peak time and they treat u like robots "
bad,"did not like the workload, it was simply too difficult to study and work at the same time. The overall experience simply made me want to go back to study and find a work that I could be satified with."
bad,"I started working at Amazon to fill a temporary lack of employment. I expect that I would be working very hard because it's a warehouse. The positive aspect of working at Amazon is that you are offered VTO(Voluntary time off), PTO(Paid time off), and  UPT(Unpaid time off). It also helps that when it's not peak season you only work four 10 hour work days, which leaves you 3 days do something else or rest. They also offer pretty good benefits and it's the reason why I hear most employees are staying there. "
bad,"At first, Amazon sells themselves as a very good place to work, but they have a very high standard of speed that you must adhere to, and if you cannot, if you are even a little behind, you get warnings and your job will be at risk.  The managers are kind and try their best to be supportive.  You only get three breaks over a 10 or 11-hour day, and if you're late by even one minute returning from your 15-minute breaks, your manager will ask you why.  It can take up to five minutes to walk to a designated break area from your work station, and you are not permitted to take your breaks at your work station when you're going to spend 2/3s of your break just getting to and from the break room."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the immediate health benefits.   The hardest part of the job was the fixed schedule.  I wouldn't recommend Amazon as a first work-from-home job. Training is trainer led, however it isn't thorough.  Policy changes frequently. Managers will tell you that you're doing fine, however your metrics will clearly say otherwise."
bad,"Very low paying job for the work they want you to do. They will run their employees in the ground to reach the VCP bonus, which is why there's always a lot of injuries. Management is this facility is terrible. They have no clue what they are doing. The benefits are excellent which keeps a lot of employees there. I can't see that keeping employees there much longer, especially with them sending so many people home everyday."
bad,"When you're being offered work, it is great. You get to develop a good understanding of the area and no day is ever the same. If you can't work you can cancel a shift up to 45 minutes before you're due to start. "
bad,"Working nights "
bad,The Job was a temporary Christmas job and basically served its purpose. the Managers from Amazon it self were mostly good but the agency management style of Adecco was not very good. Giving people 30 minutes notice and not providing any follow up positions.
bad,"When I started to work at Amazon through Integrity, I figured that's how everyone started out.  Work my time as a temp, with lower pay and 0 benefits, then automatically get hired on by Amazon. After working through the peak season, I saw new hires there, who started out working directly for Amazon, with higher pay and benefits."
bad,"Favoritism, unfairly treated by management , poor conditions , even when you are sick they won't send you home. They don't care about your well being unless it's something that could get them in trouble"
bad,"If you can, take the time to earn your Bachelor's degree (or higher) first before you apply.  From what I've seen, they fast track young, external college grads directly into roles such as management (or equivalent positions) before developing internal candidates from the bottom up.  "
bad,Worked in an area with no outside interaction for the majority of hard labor shift. Only two fifteen minute breaks for 12-hour shifts. Motivated and positive management but too hard on mental and physical health. I was told it was a surprise I got converted from temp because I went to the three times medic for foot pain(plantar fasciitis because of the long hours standing with no break).
bad,"I had multiple issues with HR not providing adequate support or resolutions. These issues really made it frustrating to have Amazon as an employer."
bad,They are long stressful days. There is no room for products on certain floors but you are still required to meet rate. HR and Management fail to communicate thoroughly about time off.
bad,"My main complaint is low paid time off and vacation. Four days vacation first year, 48 hours personal time off, and 80 days unpaid time. Take a vacation, get sick, you're screwed. Very physical but do-able. Mentally draining at times. There is no additional pay when you learn new skills or take more responsibility. Not worth working your butt off for little pay. Good benefits but I only have 401k as health care is covered under my husbands job. I do not see how people can afford a house or rent, food, electricity, water and other expenses and work there."
bad,"They changed up the management, and it wasn't for the better. The operations Manager got brought in and he/she brought in old co-workers from a previous job. and slowly pushed away employees that weren't there just for a paycheck."
bad,"Strictly a low-level job for 99% of employees. No benefits. No room for advancement. Low pay. Short hours. Physical. Repetitive. Boring. No room for mental challenges. You simply take packages off a conveyor and put them on a pallet. You might move or wrap pallet with plastic, but mostly just stacking packages on top of other packages. The staff is minimal and management constantly pushes for more and more production. They make sure the conveyor is so full that if you don't rush, the packages get pushed to the floor, and picking them up will wear you out way faster than just moving to pallets. They have games where you have to try to break records for production, only benefitting the management. By the way, when you break those records, you go home early - production without pay. These guys are geniuses, no lie. They know how to milk every ounce of production from the crew. But the only beneficiary is Amazon. You might get a T-shirt or pizza or candy bars, but Amazon really gets over on employees. They track your production, but smart, lazy employees just take the small envelopes and rack up big numbers because the 'jiffies' are light and easy to sort. The laziest employees have the best numbers by far. Your break is 15 minutes, but really translates to 10 due to location of break room. You don't learn anything on this job. Management is designed to minimize employee hours. Most people are pretty nice, but you have zero time to socialize outside of break. Hardest part of job is physical demands. Most enjoyable is going home."
bad,"A lot of walking, must have comfortable shoes. The warehouse is just that, a warehouse so don't expect anything other than concrete floors and walls. Good luck"
bad,"We had to stand in a cage for three 4-hour sessions, (sitting down could get you a warning) time has never gone slower. The pay was decent if you worked nights, but I couldn't do it for more than a month."
bad,"Worked their twice, hated it both times . Terrible work conditions. No time off options before 90 days unless VTO is offered. Only 2, 15 minute breaks and 1 30 minute lunch for a 10 hour shift. Terrible!"
bad,"Ok there’s not that much to say, amazon expects so much from you and the managers think they can just walk all over you. They have favorites and all that"
bad,"Very busy times and slow times would come at any time's notice so you never know when it is going to be super stressful or manageable. Great benefits and fun activities all year round. There is some encouragement to move within the company, but not easy to get a promotion. Managers are somewhat friendly but they will punish you severely if you do not comply with policies."
bad,"Worked for Amazon for five years and was converted to full time after being with the agency for three months. If you keep your head down, work hard and hit your targets you will be ok. The problem with that is that the work (especially picking) is exhausting as it involves walking fast for four 10 hour shifts a week. "
bad,Amazon is very dirty in the building and the actions of the staff. They hire many people and then try to make reasons to fire them because there is not enough work. They pay less than surrounding areas. Managers get so stressed out that they take it out of other employees and the company has a board for employee problems they seem to brush off.
bad,I recommend Amazon to most of the people I work with.    The things I don't like about the company is the fact that they treat people like kids.    If you get sick on the job they will NOT send you home.   They tell you that if you leave you have to use your UPT.  (unpaid time off)
bad,"it is great for a temporary job but not for long term. The benefits are good but most companies match or even do better. you better have some ""waling shoes"" because you will need them"
bad,"Fast paced employer ,New facilties opened work is very slow not as interested in being there anymore.Takes a toll on your body in physical ways that I've never experienced before in my 38 years of working. Alot of people have trouble making their rates and staying on track,stand or walk on your feet for 10hours or more each day."
bad,"Tier 1 associate jobs are simple, but overly repetitive and monotonous. Demanding rates and not much room for career advancement."
bad,"Hours vary too much.  One week you would have mandatory OT and work 50 hours, but the next week you might only get 20 hours.  Production rates are hard to make.  They string you along and ask what else in the building you would like to do, but do not offer you any advancment."
bad,"I saw very little of management, so I can't say much on that, but I did enjoy not working as a tight-knit team. I just enjoy my own space and being able to move at my pace or change what I am doing as needed instead of conferring with the whole team."
bad,"Personalmente no estoy muy contento peo tambien hay que contar que las ETT que gesrionan el oersonal tienen parte de la culpa, errores en las nominas, informacion confusa, etc"
bad,"Usually begins with a lot of the same routine. Working from start to finish. Stacking pallets, making boxes to fill up with items off wall. Being timed while working on the clock like robots."
bad,"very stressful environment, co workers were great but management and the hr team contradict each other and no one seems to know what to do, ask 5 managers the same question and get 5 different answers, by the time you get to know someone in management or hr they are leaving for other opportunities"
bad,This company is very unorganized. You will be taught how to do something and the next day it changes. It is impossible to go to school and/or have another job when you work here because they want your live to be dedicated and revolve around working there. They gave me overtime on a day that I had a night class and I was told I had to miss class to come to work. When I was hired I was told I would not have any overtime on that day so my classes were scheduled around my work schedule and things were really messed up from there.
bad,"There is no job security. You will be sore every day. The benefits are good to counter the low pay compared to other warehouse jobs. The breaks and lunch are actually less than listed because you have to include travel time. If you work at the back of the warehouse, don't expect more than 15 minutes lunch when you get to your car."
bad,"The company as a whole is decent ,however, the management and the HR office there is abysmal. All of my problems came from either lack of communication due to management dropping the ball or miscommunication from HR to management. When asking HR questions they either do not have the answers due to lack of knowledge or they have an attitude with you like you are asking stupid questions. The job is fast paced but that comes with the type of job. Its a warehouse that during its busiest hours of the year ships in the upwards of 1-2 million packages a day. This being said it is understandable for the need to be quick and accurate. However when there is a problem with your rate or accuracy and the management does not have an answer to your questions then that is when it becomes an issue."
bad,"Typical Day:"
bad,"7:00 pm start, told you need to reach impossible targets, 1/3 staff left in the first week, i have learn't nothing fully as they only teach you once on your first day and leave you to hopefully remember and constantly told to fit items into yellow bins that are already overflowing with items as the leaders stand and say ""there's plenty of space"" followed by squishing the item, damaging it in the process. management only worry or care for staff if injuries occur and once back from being signed off sick, do not care for doctors orders. they immediately put you back in the same area you have sustained injury before without talking to you making sure you are fit for work. Workplace is constantly falling apart as it's a brand new state of the art warehouse. Hardest part of the job is repeating the same actions without any change or being suggested to go into another area for training, most enjoyable part of the job is being able to leave and rest when you know working there is already creating a constant injuries to staff and seeing people slowly turn into robots."
bad,"Amazons all about numbers and getting things out to their customers. Its very quick paced, and gives little time for breaks to stretch or get a drink. Long hours of standing."
bad,"I was a order picker and I picked items that showed up on my rf scanner, they have these unrealistic expectations for you even though you are new. Training was good but they just put you out there in the cold after only being trained on order pick for a hour. Pay is okay but overtime is a killer when peak season comes around, never can take full breaks because they want you back 5 minutes before break is over with. Management was okay but didn’t do anything but yell and stay on their computers while they complain about your numbers. I don’t recommend, but only work here as a stepping stone or if you have no kids at all. The permanent employee made the same as the temp employees, you only get a raise after 6 months and thats only .25"
bad,You constantly have to make rate or get written up and always stay on task. Management varies throughout depending on what department you get placed in.
bad,Amazon does not care about employees. They don't pay them for what is expected. It is a cutthroat environment. No advancement unless you sacrifice your family.
bad,"While I don't mind hard work, Amazon requires a little too much of its employees physically, mentally and emotionally.  We're nothing more than mindless robots."
bad,"working at amazon was honestly deplorable. the last year i was there i had 10 different managers in the coarse of a year. every manager that came in, had their own way of doing this which caused, job dissatisfaction"
bad,I took this job knowing it was going to be hard. My first 2 weeks I thought I was going to die I could barely walk. 2 months in I have lost my toe nails and my feet still hurt even when Im not walking.  I lay in bed and my legs feel Im still walking and feet feel like a burning sensation.
bad,The facility I worked for had managers using tactics that due not lend to production optimization or team cohesiveness. The managers that did have productive insights were afraid to act due to an unsolicited feed-back program.
bad,"This is a decent company to work for, however they messed up my i9 information on three separate occasions. I couldn’t get a solid answer from HR as to why my information was “lost”"
bad,"I don't recommend it, the policies are geared to the advantage of the business and not the employees.  The job itself is great, but you are expendable."
bad,"Managers don't know much about the actual jobs, just numbers they have to reach. Workers are like a number because there's so many. Managers make you feel like you're in boot camp, but then all the immature workers make it like high school, while the ones who cut up make it like prison, and HR just covers the companies butt along with managers, and the worker is always at fault, even if the camera sees it, Amazon is not in the wrong. So don't make enemies, bullying is not tolerated, but allowed there."
bad,"The work place was clean and colorful, a nice work place for a factory but the amount of work they asked you to do was not impossible except that they did not have the room to do the work. The job required you to put boxes on shelves which was fine but all the shelves were filled constantly. They essentially had no place to put boxes and encouraged you to break stacking rules made by the company. Then if you did not reach quota because you had to walk around looking for one open space to put one of the hundred boxes you have up, they would contact you and tell you either speed up or leave."
bad,"it's a quick paced job that allows you to be apart of a team.  Packaging, wrapping, shipping in and out.  Helping amazon customers all across the world receive there items.  At the time they request."
bad,"Working at Amazon was an experience. I wouldn't recommend Amazon to anyone but if you need a job and want to get hired right away, Amazon is the place to go."
bad,RUN!!!!!!! No Worth it.  I rather work cleaning toilets that ever work it. management is a big joke. make sure you pack a box a min if not your getting written up. Management stocks you to make sure your back from brake on time (9) mins.
bad,"Amazon was a great place to work at.. besides the hours, the people were fine and the environment as well. It was an experience and it was a good one."
bad,Amazon is a good place to work at if you have no life or children. It's very hard to work there the long hours with trying to plan for daycare. Its also a very fast paced job.
bad,"The Managers never really say nothing to you unless theres info about the company or your getting written up for the most sense less things. They only promote and hire young managers with some type of degree but have no work experience in a warehouse or if they do its minimal. All they care about is Rate (your speed) on how fast you work. Its the same for everyone but everyday is different, somedays you can have multiple and easy picks and sometimes it's one at a time and spread out so it takes longer. I also see the older people getting fired all the time cause they're slower and can't keep up with the kids. So the moral of the story is, its a starter job for kids and thats about it. They hire and fire people all the time."
bad,"the pay is not competitive and there is little mobility within Amazon at the Windsor, CT facility. The work environment cant be extremely stressful and you can get write ups easily."
bad,"Sorted and stored items."
bad,"This job ia not good for long term, only good for short term job. Hard on your body specially if you like to have exercise day. Working at this warehouse will make you really tired and you will have a lot of sore muscles."
bad,"Decent Job for a Teen or Young Adult. "
bad,all of the buildings are mostly near the spring tx area and they wants you to waste gas  to scan boxes from the roller  and load vans sometimes and if they are over staff they send people home.
bad,"Amazon likes to hire young kids fresh out of college as Area Managers. Most of the time these kids have no chance to succeed and get stressed which leads to poor decisions. "
bad,This job does not pay well enough. I would like to get promoted but there are so many ppl in the building that I don't think its possible. The 4 day work week is good.
bad,"If you enjoy being at work more than being with family, than this is the job for you. I worked6 days a week including Mandatory OT. I would like to spend time with family."
bad,To many Human recourse issue. Also i think its wrong if a family member passes and you have to leave at the last minute that you can not ever get hired back through the company. COMPLETE GARBAGE!!!!!
bad,"My work experience at Amazon was not very good. The management in the department were very neglectful. And uninterested. The treatment of employees who were 30 and up was very poor and belittling. We had very young managers who had no compassion towards others and treated employees as if they were just a number.  When I was stricken with some kind of skin breakout from what appeared to be some bug bites. The management and onsite medical team treated me as if I had did something wrong. I did not have a good experience working at Amazon and I have worked in previous deployments of similar fashion, and Amazon was by far the worse."
bad,I worked here for almost 3 years I did what I had to do to take care of my son. I would not go back to warehouse work unless I had to. I prefer a job either outside or pleasing people.
bad,Working nights being totally exploited by a Tory-loving tax-dodging shower of wicked capitalist pricks. I met some decent people in there while pushing my trolley for eleven miles a night around a giant warehouse.
bad,Greed driven. Starting to treat employees like machines. Not a fun place to work. It's all about creating a fast process then make it faster. Your just a number and nothing else.
bad,Working for Amazon did seem fufuilling and I enjoyed the work.  However management only cared for numbers and pushed my employees past breaking point and physical limits.
bad,great place to work depends on your station but if you get lucky you will love this job but the hours are a big no no  but for a part time could be good aslo its  hard to move up sadly but it be nice to get  at least a raise for being there a while and for hR to be more about its workers also being able to move up in the company and also how to  it takes an hour of your pay for clocking out late  or being 1 min late to clock in it takes an hour but other than that job and people are great
bad,utile pour dépanner quand l'ont trouve rien d'autre.
bad,The management culture could use some improvement. The top-down approach with full ownership of responsibilities is too detached from reality. There needs be some level of engagement with senior management regularly.
bad,was too far for me to travel so i didnt really like it and also i there was a lot of times where machines wasnt working and id get in trouble for it and lose points.
bad,i took the job under the pretence that everyday would have new and exciting opportunities and i wouldn't get caught in a rut. for the first 3 of four months i only was allowed to scan boxes and not converse with any other employees. of the 4 people i got hired with all of us quit. me being the longest hold out
bad,"Long Hours.  Environment well suited for individuals with no families.  If you have a family; then I hope you have a strong understanding with your spouse, because you will be working long hours."
bad,"Fast pace, continuous movement, Area managers really good. Could be best worker, but don't make rate, only rate matters, your let go no matter how long worked there."
bad,If you like working hard and non-stop all day on your feet then this is your job. Very diverse workforce and no chance of progression but management is top quality.
bad,"The work environment is too repetitive with rude management. The only positive thing I would have to say is that I liked my coworkers. Other than that, I did not enjoy working there one bit."
bad,Amazon is a work place for people who want to work themselves to death. The only upside is that you make a lot of great friends and the pay is pretty decent.
bad,"Entry-Level pay and benefits I would say are the best parts of the job, and the people I have met on the job have become friends for life. Would say advancing would be a longshot in this job enviorment. The feeling is the job is for people that have no choice or doing it for the summer."
bad,"It is and high energy work environment that requires time and energy. Typical day can range from virtually everything, lots of picking and packing. If you are a go getter you can fast track your way up to and through management. People are really friendly, they make the place a great place to work. Management on the other hand could take a chapter from their handbook and engage their people more instead of being face deep in a laptop or computer."
bad,"I was a consultant at Amazon and was placed on a completely different team than I interviewed for without any communication from Amazon, or the firm I consulted through. It's been a frustrating experience and I believe if they just treated their recruiters careers with as much care as their software engineers, they would have a successful recruiting department,"
bad,"Băd experience Working at Amazon Warehouse in Sheffield. All Amazon staff had the easy Jobs to do and the Agency staff had to Carry out all the work. Just one 30 min Break wich is not enaugh and legal. Every night people had minor accidents on the convayors. Heavy boxes to lift, way to heavy for one person to lift. Management dosent care about employes Tips untill something bad happends. And so many more to Say about my Amazon job."
bad,"Do not work for amazon! I repeat, do not work for amazon. They are extremely unorganized! Many young people holding mangement positions, who are rude, and slick mouth. They do not care! No one knows what to do or what is going on! Fired even though I called repeatly to get my job back due to being on a leave of absence from getting hurt on the job. For this to be a high tech workplace, they did not take any time into human resources! -Currently filing a lawsuit! Work for them at your own risk! You have been worned!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,The Management was no where to be found if you had any kind of serious questions. 10 hours a day standing in one spot wasn't the worst of it. It was the constant complaints from other employees about the job. When people came to help with the robots or conveyor they would act like you broke it when they constantly broke down.
bad,"The atmosphere feels like High School like bullies are some of the  Leads then cool kids are a group of people who stand around and chat,chat and lastly management decides on where the wind blows meaning solving a situation depends on who knows who like some people are untouchable despite their unprofessional behavior.I will say Leads and management are the worse."
bad,"The culture the company preaches (customer centricity, etc.) is a good one, but how that is actually applied is... sketch. I was hired with promises of working on one project but it was changed to another team before I even touched it, from whence I was expected to magically do front-end after having been clear at every step of my interview that I am purely a backend developer."
bad,"Just a horrible experience. They will work you until you can't stand, then try to work you some more. Very physically demanding with months of mandatory overtime."
bad,Was hired to be a packer for the holiday season and had gone through Integrity Staffing to get the job. When I was hired the experience for the first week was pleasant until training was over I found out that the Amazon facility had over staffed and my position that I was hired for was no longer what I was having to do. The daily change of your station was ludicrous and unorganized. I had the chance to work the position I was hired to do for a week to then be moved around to 4 or 5 other positions that I had no training for and was forced to learn on the spot in an extremely fast paced work environment which was unfair to the other associates who had been in there positions for awhile because it was forcing them to slow down the work process do to my inexperience and lack of training.
bad,The worst place I've ever worked before. They treat people like rubbish and they don't respect anyone. Really bad management
bad,Decent pay good hours you get three days off but there is no room for career development. They only promote their friends a lot of favoritism goes on in the warehouse I worked in.
bad,They work you to death picking orders. Pay doesn't match work load. Managers are sneaky. You feel like a robot working there. You don't get to use your brain picking orders
bad,"Amazon is not that bad of a place to work, I believe that it is for younger people because the fast pace and repetitive movements can take a toll on the body. That's why I had to leave I was have to many health issues."
bad,"Amazon is a job with great positives that rope you in. They have awesome pay, with minimal requirements. As well as immediate benefits and plenty of overtime. Which is perfect for seasonal workers. But when you are looking to advance you realize the dirty game Amazon plays. "
bad,"Working at Amazon is very hard. hardest part is standing 10 hours (there is aa 15 min break and a 30 minute lunch but that's it). Depending on the department you are working it, this job is very demanding. In my opinion the pay rate is too low. I guess you the most enjoyable part about the job is when you get promoted."
bad,Walsh is one of the worst company's to work with ! Kyle Walsh owns the business and he is barely there and it's hard to ever get in contact with him as a driver ! Hugo (Supervisor) is the WORST supervisor to ever deal with. He is beyond disrespectful and he is not fair with distributing day's for people to work. When ever you need a rescue Hugo picks and chooses who to send a rescue for which is highly unfair. Then he gives CERTAIN people plenty day's to work and others is whenever he needs you. Don't recommend anyone applying for this company!
bad,"Working at Amazon is a feat many young adults will undergo in this day and age, largely due to the fact that Amazon has been applauded for enormous hourly wages and create company benefits. With this in mind, however, at least in my experience, those applicants will quickly realize they're being sucked dry for those benefits, as they are put through vigorous physical activity and little comfort. The warehouse is split up into several different portions, and in my case, I was handling Inbound Packages, which meant I unloaded several boxes off of trucks, usually by myself, and unwrapped them, and prepped them for the line. Amazon prides itself with a rule of not lifting more than 50 lbs without help, but in my warehouse, this rule was largely ignored, and we were expected to lift any package, regardless of weight. The Front Line Supervisors varied in quality, with some offering help when necessary, where others were negligent and for the most part only sat at their computer all day. Coworkers also varied, with morale dropping significantly as the ten hour workday progressed. The most difficult aspect of the job was having to maintain a high amount of energy and productivity in an environment actively challenging that. by way of the strenuous physical labor or the fact that the warehouse was cold and dusty without any sunlight. There genuinely was not anything I enjoyed about the job, and only stayed as long as I did for the wage, ultimately quitting due to a neck injury received from the job. I would not recommend working for Amazon Fulfillment unless it is absolutely necessary."
bad,"Amazon is not a horrible place to work, but management expect you to do more than what's required of you. The work although is fair and there is a rate required."
bad,"In a typical day in my last position I fulfilled management tasks of opening and closing the facility, as well as overseeing a staff of seven individuals. Throughout the day I completed various administrative duties as well, including answering phones, drafting documents and emails, filing and greeting customers. I also provided strong customer service and resolved customer issues"
bad,"When you first get to Amazon, you are very excited because, well, it's Amazon. But this place breaks you down over time. The grueling work/life balance is very striking. With so many disgruntled people in one place, it can be a tough environment."
bad,My experience with Amazon was not a good one first their location was bad I would have to drive 45 minutes just to get to work and then on top of that Amazon writes people up for any minor infraction.
bad,"Not much to say here. 10-15 hour shifts, mandatory weekend availability and great pay."
bad,Work day is ten hours long doing the same thing over and over. Easy work. Some of the managers are cool but there's a lot of favoritism too.
bad,"Although decent with benefits, pay and compensation could be significantly improved."
bad,"Manager's constantly come around & push you to do more. Doing 4 10's are very difficult, but also having 3 days off are nice. I would not recommend working for this company."
bad,"Typical day at work. No electronics inside amazon,Clock in exactly at the time your supposed to start your shift. Start immediately working after brief exercise. Work at rate that is fast paced. Paid breaks are fifteen mins. If you are in the back of the center consider your breaks 5 mins because you are expected to be back at the same location by the end of the break. Lunch breaks are 30 mins. If you are under the expected rate you will be written up. If your break is more than 15 mins scan to scan you will be written up. shifts are ten hours. Night shift gets paid more than day."
bad,Amazons benefits are fairly good and you get a week of vacation right off the bat. The pay is pretty good but if your not in your 30's and a guy it's very hard to move up in the company. You put in a lot of long hours but the pay is decent. I was good enough to train new employees in certain functions but I wasn't good enough to do them myself.
bad,Often times working within the facility we often face the threat of having our job one day and not having it the next therefore I choose to look for higher and more stable work conditions.
bad,"Expect constant change from bad to potentially worse."
bad,"Amazon wasnt my favorite place to work-- for the amount of work your doing in the long shifts you are working, you do not make enough money. Its literally a modern day cotton field. There is no work-life balance. The only part I enjoyed about amazon, is that I met my fiance there, but that its. Management is cluttered. You will have 6 different managers tell you to do something, even though only one of those managers are in charge of your production, and if you dont do what the other 5 tell you to do in addition to what yours told you to do, you will quickly get in trouble. It is too much going on, and the people in charge refuse to talk to each other, making it a headache for the associates."
bad,"amazon recrute tout le monde, beaucoup de poste sont a proposées comme le packing , stow ect ..."
bad,"Job is generally easy, it's as simple as 1-2-3 but 12 1/2 hours shifts which im not even sure if legal. it kills you, then they make unrealistic goals such as 1200 picks in a day. Yeah that would be easy if each pick had 50 items like some lucky people got but then it would send you all the way to the other side of the building to pick 1 item then all the way back for another."
bad,"Someone coined the phrase ""Amazon is where overachievers go to feel bad about themselves"". The company provides no training and little structure. Managers are expected to quickly develop themselves in a fast pace with constant changes. Any positive performance is quickly forgotten. There's a reason why the average manager experience is 18 months."
bad,"The work itself is pretty easy. As long as you're good at your job you have no risk of losing it. This has been the best place I have worked for when it comes to everything else but when it comes to mAnagers I find myself wanting to quit my job. Most of the managers don't care about your job as long as you make them look good. Even most managers are straight out of college and never managed a department before. There's no room for advancement. To give you an idea of advancement let's say there are 20 packers in a department which is level 1 position. Above that is a process assistant who is level 3. Above them is an area manager level 4. There's 1 area manager per department and 1 process assistant per production line. Within about 100 associates there's 4 process assistants and 1 area manager. There's no way of moving up unless you transfer to another facility by applying for an open position that needs to be filled. When it comes to hr they say they are there to help and listen but when you go and talk to them nothing gets resolved. Every issue I have experienced I've always ended up calling the ethics hotline instead. Benefits are awesome. Health insurance is cheap and covers literally everything, company stock after 2 years of employment. Only downside is once you have been there for 3 years there's no more raises. You get cut off at 15.00 an hour."
bad,"Morning meeting before you hit the floor to drive equipment or walk the floor picking customer packages. Most boring job I have ever had. Although it paid well and the benefits were great the job wasn't for me. Coworkers were ok. Some were not so good...bottom of barrel to fill the gaps. Floor management to ops manager were good. Every body above that although they say the care they don't. Hardest part of the job was waking up knowing I was going into a hot, overcrowded building with no hope of moving up in the company and I was just a number for the company to get their numbers. Most enjoyable part of the job was getting a workout on the dock when I loaded packes."
bad,"It's a challenging place to work. The work itself is fun, but it is very political. Management is totally focused on meeting numerical goals. People are just numbers, and if you're a temp, then you're a 2nd class citizen. They don't need you because they can always replace you. Our motto at one point was ""Work hard, have fun, make history"" but the workforce changed it to ""Work hard, or you're history."""
bad,"A typical day includes walking briskly for 8-10 hours, depending upon your shift, which isn't too bad if you don't mind walking. Unfortunately  the supervisors are generally incompetent and the HR department tries their hardest to avoid helping with any problems"
bad,"Empty promises, abuse, get taken advantage of, micromanagement, management is only looking out for themselves, benefits are not worth it"
bad,"As with any retail environment, you have to remain professional at all times. I had some real doozies for customers, but I maintained my calm, cool, collected self and was able to solve their problems. I found that most people were simply just upset or frustrated, and I tried to turn their frown upside down. I had one customer who was absolutely hysterical, in tears, irate. I talked her down and she ended up thanking me profusely and apologizing. It felt great!"
bad,When i first started working at amazon i really enjoyed it. However now not so much. Management has switched up a lot of things and it's for the worse.
bad,"This job is terrible in the fact that the company does not care about your well-being nor your safety.  You are not viewed as a person, but only as a rate.  Being stopped by one of your bosses and asked why did you not make rate yesterday is completely normal. They also ask you what were your boundaries, but beware you better give them an amazing answer.  I told the truth, that I had to wait on someone who was qualified to use a clamp machine to sit down the product that I needed.  That answer was not good enough.  I was then told to throw safety out the window and to ""do whatever it takes to make rate.  If you need to climb on top of all the product and kick down the one you need, then do it.""  I would rather work for a company that actually cares, and sees me as a person and not a rate.  I also would rather work for a company that cares about my safety."
bad,"As a facilities technician, there is little room for advancement - especially since all new buildings will be contracting out labor to 3rd party companies.  The managers have horrible communication among themselves and often give conflicting direction to subordinates.  My co-workers were the best part of this job, but many of them are leaving as the departmental roles are being restructured.  The pay and other compensation was great, but very little increase year-over-year; promotions are few and far between as well.  Overall, this company put grey hairs on my head and requires a larger human resources department to handle the volume of complaints."
bad,Amazon does not care about their employees. employees can be easily fired and wages are low compared to other warehouses with similar duties.
bad,Ai learn how tho deliver purcele at door good learning about daily routs.15 hours working two much for every day workyng program.
bad,"I enjoy the wonderful people that i work with and i enjoy training the new associates. The company itself could be a nice place to work, but the lack of communication just makes for a tough job at times."
bad,"Long hours and low moral have led to high turnover. Focus for Amazon is customers first. I think this principal is faulted however they have remained successful due to the few who make it past a year. Opportunity to grow from within, however will be asked to work 80-90 hr weeks at times."
bad,"Not enough people to do the job we were asked to do, Managers have no desire to teach so you can advance. Senior team only cares about numbers and not about associates. No room to advance if you are entry level."
bad,"A typical day is very similar to a typical day at high school. If high school was ten hours long and you only had two minutes between classes. The managers are all in their mid to early twenties with limited to no real work experience. They treat you and talk to you like you're an obtuse child. There is not much respect for the entry level employees, and even less for the seasonals. It is impossible to move up unless you know the right people. Nothing is done on merit. The pay is mediocre at best. You have two 15 minute breaks that are really only five after the half mile walk to the break room and then the half mile walk back. The benefits are good, and the dress code is very lax. The shifts are very agreeable. Unfortunately, if you're older than 30, you can not consider this a career, as the hr department is very age discriminative."
bad,"I started with Amazon as an hourly associate and earned my way to management over the course of 3 years. I loved my job as Area Manager, but the upper management and GM were simply terrible people. There was never a sense of appreciation for the associates or managers who were spending 60-70 hours a week making them look great.  The only time you would see upper management on the floor was when they were out for blood.  It wouldn't matter if you were running an amazing shift or breaking records, they were there to find something as small as a piece of paper on the floor and would use that to belittle and berate managers to the point of ridiculousness. This cut-throat style may have worked 10 years ago, but it doesn't now and it shows in the turnover rate for both managers and associates."
bad,"I worked at the CVG3 fulfillment center. Typically, you are either sorting product into totes, or stacking boxes onto a pallet. Everything else you may be doing in a typical day is assisting those two main duties by either bringing them product, taking away their full pallets, transporting pallets of empty totes to the sorters, or assisting sorters or palletizers in technical issues with equipment etc."
bad,they have great benefits but their work attitude could be better they only care about the numbers and not how they products get on the shelves
bad,"I was working as a stower, so i was handeling a scanner during my whole shift placing product at their place. Also i had the chance to work in overtime shifts as a packer."
bad,"Basically everyone is easily replaceable. They don't like to give you time off.... It's a good place to work for if you are desperate, need job security, or want to transfer to another state while having a job."
bad,Worked there twice and will not go back a third time. Zero hour contracts. Permanent staff are not very helpful and tend to help their own ethnic friends more.
bad,"I worked for them though an temp agency. I seen alot the pay was good, they watch everything you do even if u go  the rest room. They walk around all night on laptops checking you speed watching you. You get like a 9 min break not 15 and when the bell rings you better be  at your stations like a machine working. They check you  going out too make sure you dont steal nothing. Everyone goes on every break together like you are robots."
bad,Amazon offers a lot of hopes and dreams but does not live up to there reputation and expectations. There were to many shot callers and not enough hands on effort. Frequent unmentioned schedule changes bad hours not to mention the fact that there are several days during the week that voluntary time off is made mandatory and the only way to get paid is by using vacation or paid time to guarantee that my bills get paid.
bad,"Amazon seemed more like a place to enhance young managers looking for experience. Which isn't bad, nut train on your own time."
bad,"The days were long and seemed never ending. Though you have 4 days at work and 3 days off, the days are long as ever! It's not easy work whatsoever. This company does not care if you get hurt, about your feelings, or how they treat you. The lack of respect is unreal...the managers don't even care to learn your names."
bad,every night i go in and if your one minute late you get a thing they call a point and if you get 3 of these you get called into a meeting about your job this will happen 2 more times till you are out. points am given out for lateness failure to turn up for work not hitting your rates etc. the hardest part of the job is defiantly hitting your rates as they am so high not everyone can keep up and there is no exceptions unless you have a disability.
bad,Not the best place to work. They claim advancement but even with a degree its hard to move up. Its a who you know kind of job which will dictate wether your able to progress around the warehouse.
bad,"I worked the night shift.  A typical day for me started at 5:45 PM because for some reason area managers are supposed to arrive very early, it would then end at 7am.  Shifts for line level folks are 10.5 hours long, and managers should tack on at least an hour on both ends of that.  That time was interspersed nicely between stretches of extreme boredom, and moments of mind numbing panic."
bad,"Working for Amazon is ok. The thing is about it, that every supervisor get loose what they doing and never communicate to each other."
bad,"the only thing i learnt with working here was that the management didn't take the time to ask lower down employees on what good ideas we would have to improve certain processes."
bad,"Amazon has a fantastic set of core values that they adhere to better than most companies. Their consumer obsession has meant that they are growing at a geometric rate and that's really the problem. The front-line management is almost entirely made of developers who have no idea how to use basic management tools (Gantt charts, burndowns, etc...) and still fundamentally believe they are devs. That means when influences come from outside, the front-line management is unwilling to listen to them and blames any change in the team culture for their own failures. There seem to be no repercussion for this as there is a tacit assumption that understanding the corporate culture makes a person inherently right."
bad,It was alot work that couldnt be done in the time they wanted. Some people reached those goals but the rates are outrageous. id only go back there if i was desperate for a job.
bad,this was run for your money job.  i ran 22 miles a day picking orders that my scanner on their system would just bounce me everywhere. co-workers i never saw because you did not have time to ever stop and say hello or you would not make rate.
bad,"Ce qu'ils attendaient était opposé à ce qu'on m'avait expliqué pendant les test."
bad,"Amazon is an interesting company to work at.  The culture is one that allows for lots of learning and challenging work to be involved in.  "
bad,"Energetic, fast pace environment. I would say very strict. This job will actually keep you in shape. I like the job its the distance."
bad,"Day would start off with a morning brief, targets and work for the day, would be set off starting on main job as an order picker, if pack line got to busy people who were trained to pack were asked to go over to help out."
bad,long work hours short breaks good pay i learned how to find items that i need to pick for the packers.
bad,"Amazon can be a great place to work for people who have no family and few commitments outside of work.  Compensation can be attractive via Restricted Stock--salaries are market.  In a fulfillment center, managers should be prepared for excessive administrative duties, multiple schedule changes within a year--including graveyard--and high expectations for process improvement while attempting to develop people and run a shift.  Can be fun, the people were actually wonderful, but not for the faint of heart."
bad,"As a fulfillment associate a typical day could consist of you being moved to many different locations in order to fulfill the managements needs. Also you are expected to hit ""rate"" no matter what is going on; i.e. no space, lack of work etc. Pretty irritating"
bad,"LOTS of walking"
bad,it wasn't worth the struggle the days were too long and i felt disconnected from the rest of the factory workers none of my training was relevant to day to day work and it was terrible
bad,"I stowed (packed) product on the shelf all day for 4 months at Amazon. I started through a temp agency and was offered a full time position with Amazon eventually. They have a high turnover rate with temps because it is near impossible to make rate and if you don't make rate they will fire them temp. So only about 5% of temps make it. I declined their conversion offer and quit although I was one of their top 5 in rates each week. The hours are long and strenuous with little break time between. If you want to feel like a insignificant ant on a giant hill all day, only to be spoken to when you make the slightest little mistakes, Amazon is your place."
bad,"As long as you`re doing a job that you enjoy, you`ll be okay. Amazon in Peterborough expect you to work 300mph without stopping! the things they expect you to do is rediculus in the space of time. You`ll be very lucky to walk outta that place without a mental health issue and a smile on your face!"
bad,You have to work your way through a sub contractor to get hired full time.
bad,"a typical day is walking in, going to the cafeteria to put my food in the fridge, get a scanner and log in. after that wait till its time to clock in and wait for instructions, whats new in the company, and stretching. after that you get your ordinance to the location of your first pick. from there you walk, scan bins and items. and you do the same thing till your tote is to heavy, or till the scanner says that the tote is digitally full. then you put the tote or totes on the conveyor and get more totes to fill. this process is all you do. clock out for lunch. lunch is and hour long. but you have to walk to the cafeteria, microwave your food, eat it, do what you got to do, then clock back in. after you clock in you have to wait for instructions and stretching again. then you go back to walking, scanning bins and items till the tote or totes are full. then you put them on the conveyor till quitting time. also you get two 15 minute breaks."
bad,Typical day at work walk all day or drive the order picker and pick items into a cart. Real basic job nothing special about it.
bad,"They always made mistakes with pay checks, and it feels almost impossible to advance anywhere in the environment."
bad,"This is a seasonal job. They will drop you like a fly. "
bad,"The hours are long, only offering 10 hour shift. The worst thing about working at Amazon is that there is no communication once you finish your first week. They pretty much send you on your way."
bad,Hard working People inside but there are no Incentives to boost up the employees working pace. I learned a lot as far as being on indirect functions and Problem solving. Although it took a long time for me to get that chance and proof to my manager that  I was worthy of being a consistent team player. Once you're on the Managers gracious side the keep you as a favorite and it makes you look like a brown nosing person. There is a lot of favoritisms going on in that building and there is no way u can move up in position. co-workers are always complaining that there managers don't let them do other duties it's always the same routine going into that building and eventually it gets tedious. I would have to say that the most fun part about that job was going to lunch and spending quality time with you're co-workers.
bad,"Amazon hire manager straight out of college. The company have several employees that work for the company with degrees and they refuse to review resumes to see if they qualified for the job. This company is solely about their money and not about their employees. The employees stop getting raises after two yrs, and the pay starts at $11 end at $12."
bad,"Only 30% of the original direct hires from the opening are still working there and this number could be lower."
bad,You do the same job you're assigned your entire career there. I learned what factory jobs entail. Management is not very helpful and most are constantly on their cell phones. Co workers pretty much keep to their own little packs. The hardest part of the job is the sleep schedule and the constant overtime. 
bad,get assigned your job and then just work like crazy. possibilities of learning multiple tasks. best part are the co-workers and some of the managers are tough to get along with.
bad,"If you're a picker/packer well, hold onto your hat. They will give you a ""rate"" to abide by. This means parcels you are required to pick/pack in one hour. UPH = units per hour. Within the five months I've been employed there the UPH requirements increased at least 4 times. Four times! In some cases the expected UPH doubled. If you do not make the required UPH you are written up. This will drop off in one year to the day. 6 write ups and you are done. If you bend incorrectly and caught there is a possibility of a write-up. If you make a quality mistake you are written up. If you raise a concern during a meeting....yes, I've known associates whom were written up. If you have a write up you cannot transfer or apply for another position within the company for at least 30 to 90 days of your last write-up depending on how many you have. Your rate will continue to drop during ANY inactivity (e.g. equipment failure, issues regarding faulty scanner UPC bars, getting coached for a low ""rate""...no, they don't allow you to log out of your function while they are speaking to you, bathroom breaks, etc.). If you're a drone you will fair well. If you complain about swollen feet and knees your manager will inform you that they are simply excuses for not making rate. Thank the gods I have an interview somewhere else. Good luck!"
bad,I have been working at amazon for quiet some time now.Amazon has showed me many up's downs more down's thing anything.One of the prooblems I have with job is the point system and the lack of respect they have for there employee.The work demand and the standard is achievable and exceeded and they take no account for that.
bad,"Major turnover rate, peer review policy plus discarding bottom of the bell curve every year makes it a good place to pick up experience but not a long term employment option."
bad,"10-12 hr shifts with only 2 15 min breaks & 30 min lunch n with the time spent walking there, it will eat it up. In addition, theres 100's of employees all taking their breaks @ the same time. You'll never get a full break to rest your feet after hours of standing n walking. Job is easy n can get boring after awhile, but the distance from walking back n forth makes it tough. Not 2 mention, there strict policy of no sitting. Never minded the work, only the cramps n pains felt on my feet everyday."
bad,"This past summer with the outside temperature being more than 100 degrees, I still suffered from heat stress despite there being air conditioning units being installed. I went back and forth to the Doctor and my HR dept trying to get the paperwork correct. This took 2 months at this point I was pretty much fed up with this. I just felt that the company left me out to dry went I needed it the most. I've also read and hear stories of the same type of treatment from others, that Amazon overall is a great company but it falls way short when it comes to the people who do all the heaviest lifting."
bad,"Physical demanding, low pay for the work. Unorganized at times, a lot of time off, not a very promising job. not much advancement, low hours, sent home a lot of people before shift ended."
bad,to be honest it's a very hard job where you're never appreciated for you work
bad,"Great seasonal work, however management was not clear on whether or not the job would be permanent after season (which I understand) but it seemed like there was little communication between the management at the delivery center and the people above them."
bad,You are over worked it’s hard to get time with family . I would never work there again i don’t care how much they pay me . I was tired and stressed all the time
bad,"At Amazon, they have increasingly put increased productivity over the safety of their employees 1st. for example, removing about half of the employees from a specific dept. but, not decreasing the work load. They like to make changes to the department after the conveyor belt full of packages has already started up. Then informing us of the changes. With no tested plan, to see if it will actually work. But the employees can not stop the work to learn a new process. Management is often not aware of how to implement these new changes."
bad,"Amazon is a great place to work if you are content with great benefits including managing your own time, insurance, and good pay. However most people who work their don't follow rules and management can be questionable at times. Most people will bend the rules to achieve their goals and management is so busy with their own tasks that no one can watch or stop associates from doing this unless they are extremely obvious about it. If you can tolerate the people their, then by all means go for it. But this workplace isn't for me."
bad,Physically draining. No training or advancement for women of color. Was unlikely to have a successful career there. I’ve left and prior coworkers state there’s still no change.
bad,It was overall great experience but what I didn't like was when they let a lot of people go in January 2018 without informing  them or given them a week's or so notice
bad,I worked for a subsidized company and it was horrible will never work for Patriot freights again no benefits non caring managers. Rude and unprofessional
bad,At amazon DPS1  the ambassadors and L3 they only choose their friends and their favorites so they could become ambassadors and they don’t let us grow as  an ambassador or to do anything in the warehouse
bad,"I loved my job. I was dedicated and worked hard the whole time. And then they laid us all off with barely a warning. We all asked multiple times when to expect lay offs, but they never gave us a straight answer. Right before benefits were supposed to kick in, that’s when they laid us all off. It’s clear all this company cares about is money."
bad,"Working for Amazon as a warehouse associate is not a job for someone looking to expand their career. Entry-level positions are all focused on manual labor and 10-hour shifts requiring extremely demanding physical tasks that need to be conducted continuously. Performance results do not play a factor into hiring methodologies or placement, so there is no 'reason' to out-perform your peers other than to increase your chance of a workplace related injury. Due to the unsavorable nature of non-competitive work/reward, the majority of full-time permanent employees do the bare minimum at their jobs leading to a destabilized and non-cohesive culture / social environment. Not recommended."
bad,Its like im working for robots there is almost no management everything goes off your scanner and is computer automated. You even get terminated by a computer not even a human. And its like I live there. Us pickers work 5 days a week 12 hours a day which we did not sign up for.
bad,"There is little to no room for growth at amazon fulfillment centers. Plenty to learn, room to move around, but you get paid the same no matter how many skills you learn. Very few spots to move to the next “tier”"
bad,I never have a set schedule of days or hours a week I am going to work they drop shifts and everyone has to fight to get them. And they keep hiring more people which makes it harder to get shifts
bad,This job only cares only getting the with done and it's costumers. Overall it was decent. You do have to bust your butt but not hard at all. Of course if your lazy dont work there that's all
bad,"poor management."
bad,"Fast paced, great benefits, decent place to work, very diverse get to learn about different cultures, mostly working by yourself. Must stay focused at all times."
bad,"keep you in one deptevery singleday, even though your trained in other depts,Job too repetative.Slow advancement unless you get buddy buddy with supervisors"
bad,"They hire seasonal help during peak season and some people will tell you that they will keep you after the holidays, THEY WONT! They gave less than 24hrs notice to people that they were being let go. They give you a bunch of free stuff during peak season but its not worth the lies."
bad,"If you want a place to make money for a period of time, it is a fine place to do so. The benefits are nice and the pay is decent. As far as overall job satisfaction, all time minimal. Warehouse full of people with complaints and a management team that doesn't listen."
bad,"slow times and then all of a sudden extremely fast times, management pressures you into taking ""voluntarily time off"" by asking repeatedly until you give in"
bad,Did not like the place they was always checking up on you it was like u had to put your hand up to go to the toilet if u had steel toe cap boots on u had to take them off when you went through security to go out and off when you came back through and if u was a minute or two later they would cone and see y
bad,The pay was reasonable good but work schedules were very long and physically demanding with little time for rest or to hydrate or use the restrooms causing myself to get burnt out very quickly after starting.
bad,"You can be versatile and learn different positions and move up if you have good work ethics. Once peak season is done, it becomes a dull and slow environment."
bad,I was a picker at 95% of my quota.  They fired me.  The only thing I liked was 10 hour work days.  The breaks were a joke.  It took a solid 6 minutes to get to the break room.  Sit for 5 or 6 minutes then get up and walk 6 minutes back to work your butt off again.
bad,"The good thing about working at Amazon is that they present many opportunities for you to move up in the workplace. However, you will be worked to the bone and beyond. They expect a lot out of their workers and try to get you excited about your job, but it is all to no avail. Productivity rates rise frequently and the breaks are almost non-existent. Amazon is a very labor-intensive and depressing place to work and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless it is their last and only option."
bad,"I didn't really enjoy my time here, Training was good and quite a relaxed environment and the grab bay area isn't too bad however once training is complete and you hit the floor full time I found the repetitive mundane nature of the job just sucked the life right out of me. If repeating the same phrase repeatedly droning on and constantly listening to the same complaint running on autopilot with not much of a challenge is your thing then go for it but they also operate a point system, 1 point for being late on arrival or back from break (3 minutes grace) or sick with a sick note, 2 points for sick without a sick note, 4 points if awol and if reach 5 points its automatic dismissal so no real security really as god forbid you get sick."
bad,I was a crime reporter for seven years. I've seen murders captured on video and autopsy photos of children. The 10 days I spent at Amazon's warehouse drained more of my soul than anything the reporting business ever did.
bad,"Amazon is a company that delivers on benefits and pay but doesn't care about life experiences or even skin colour. Biased, racist and unforgiving at times. Be prepared to work like a slave, get paid like a slave and treated like dirt. I had to work 3 50 hour weeks in a row with no break or anyone caring about how I felt. The manager even took those 3 extra days off. 0/10."
bad,"Weak managers, poor decision making, pretend to care about people"
bad,It was an experience. Wouldn’t go back if they paid $50 an hr. Company has a lot of potential. Only if they listen to the employees. Either way Amazon was a opportunity & i do not regret it.
bad,"When I worked there, there were a lot of unnecessary requirements that made you feel invaded and insecure. Too many background checks and undesirable questions."
bad,"The pay was ok. but the supervisory staff were poor in that the culture is to threaten you with job loss rather than to encourage performance."
bad,"Very horrible, terrible place to be at. Favourisim is so obvious and its disgusting. They talk about the leadership principles but none of them really is being applied. High turnover rate due to unrealistic goals and rates the managemen expect their associates to reach. I'm so glad I quit them and made my own business. Amazon is only good for high school kids or those who are desperately looking for jobs to pay the bills."
bad,I don't care for the way the business is run and I would like to find somewhere else to work. Certain areas are prone to more gossiping and back-stabbing from fellow employees than others.
bad,"I work here and I feel like they should have robots to do this type of work. They should pay us humans at least 30 an hour to do this job.. 15 an hour sounds good until u get there and do the actual work."
bad,"You're basically treated like a replaceable object especially by management and they try to make things fun but it is a failed attempt, it also feels considerably unwelcoming but the pay and benefits are good."
bad,its very physically demanding the delivery to apartments are very complicated getting into the buildings time consuming.. can be very stressful... team is very loving and helpful
bad,The money was good but management played favoritisms with some people. So it’s hard to move up. The managers have unrealistic expectations for the rates.
bad,It was good for a short time. But very tiring and the breaks should have been longer so you can fully recover during your shifts. Overall it was ok for the time being.
bad,"I have a level one job there and a master's degree but have been denied every job that  I have applied for  beyond packing and stowing without so much as an interview, meanwhile they promote people into managerial positions with a GED or high school."
bad,"Bon salaire, mauvaises conditions de travail, énormément de point de livraison par chauffeur après 3 journée seulement de travail on vous réclame un minimum de 100 pts de livraison, application amazon peu ergonomique, clients peu receptif"
bad,Easy job to do daily and it doesn't pay enough due to being part time. Different roles can be worked daily and determined by the scan rate of employees. Indirect roles are usually worked by those who perform exceptionally well. Hardly no room for advancement due to favortism. So seeking a full time role here and elsewhere is tough.
bad,"Working here can be a mixed bag. Managers are relied on heavily to make sure your on task. The machine has quotas and your expected to make them or get written up and booted if you don’t make them. People face frequent injuries here and the med teams primary focus is to get you back to work ASAP. Use this place as a stepping stone or get into management, it’ll save your body long term."
bad,Management very unorganised and unwilling to listen to any opinions you have. The atmosphere is well it's non existent. They tell you to help your colleagues at all times and then when you do you get a warning for being of task as they can see when you've had breaks from your duty this includes toilet breaks. The only good thing about working for amazon is the money.
bad,"I resigned after spending three years with this company. I left due too: lack of company care, management harassment, unfair treatment, losing raises to start at the same pay as new hires, lack of knowledge from HR, receiving wrong information often, overworked and not appreciated, unsafe working expectations, and the list goes on. "
bad,"I would pack in my own station, drove a pit to get items on a cage "
bad,"It's ironic because working here provides no fulfillment, as a human being, whatsoever."
bad,"If you do not care about working conditions and want good pay (after a huge tax that is) Amazon in Euclid may be the place for you. "
bad,"After 3 years I gave up trying to promote within. Never been written up, did what I was suppose to do everyday and the furthest I ever got was a trainer, which is not a pay raise, you got a different vest. Very hard to promote within, especially within the Quality Assurance Department. Wasn't the worst job I had. Lots of time off every year. VTO opportunities were nice as well. Management was very hit and miss. Some of the best/worse management i've ever seen. It's a numbers driven work culture though, so the only thing that really matters to them in the end of the day is your status quo."
bad,It's easy to feel like the robots you work with. There is no sunlight in the warehouse and just walking into it feels as if you're walking into a prison complex. Management was great but it was the only positive thing about the job.
bad,A valuable part of Amazon is the Career Day and special educational options for employees. I have never experienced anything like this at other employers.
bad,Good excercise. Fast paced.  Be careful to avoid accidents and injuries. Production numbers are more important than the quality of your work.  Must have a production mindset.  Seemed like most employees were transient.  Good job for a short time or holidays.
bad,Do not like the way they treat associates like robots. Like they don't matter and when they are done with you. Youre job will be gone as fast as you got it.
bad,"Mi sono trovata  bene  agli inizii... "
bad,Overall the pay was good and the benefits but they are very strict the work is back breaking and the manager I had cared more about the work getting done then the employees well being.
bad,My day start off going to warehouse to pick up all my packages get everything like my gps my gas card finding my van make it is clean and have gas it before I staert my day.
bad,Not to much fun. Not able to explore my skill which I learn from school. A part time job to get experience out in the real world. Very boring and minute job.
bad,It is a good job and pays alright but They have bad communication and they are racist I got terminated unfairly because of a bad customer they didn't care about the employee
bad,No work life balance. The staffing company that hired me was very difficult to work with. I was hurt while working and told if I left to go to hospital I would no longer have a job.
bad,"The ad on here is completely not true. While there is a referral bonus if you know someone that works there, it is rarely that much and that is an amount that THEY get not you. And again there is absolutely no sign on bonus. Amazon has sucked my soul all the way out."
bad,"Starting in the parking lot: Absolutely not enough spaces to accommodate employees. I always arrived 30-40 minutes early and still find it challenging to find a space. Employees literally pull up to the door, run in to clock in, get back in their cars, then spend 15-20 minutes trying to find a space to park. "
bad,"Working with Amazon going on 2 years. The 1st. winter  with Amazon no heat  this is Bethpage  Long island, NY - IT'S COLD  Summer time no A/C - Unsafe"
bad,I would not recommend working as a driver for Amazon. Pay is good but the work days will have you completely exhausted. Long days in the heat delivering large amounts of packages.
bad,"My Job at Amazon MKC6 was Water Spider/Tote Runner the job is ok but physical. Management very poor, Amazon treats their employees like a number not human."
bad,"Amazon is a great place to learn new skills and grow as a professional, but it is unlikely you will get any promotion. Also, the overall culture is toxic. Every year managers need to layoff ~10% of the employees, which means you will never feel your job is safe. "
bad,If you enjoy standing all day and being a robot this job is for you :) as a stower i didnt talk to anyone aññ day long it was very draining and crazy.
bad,the benefits are great. pay is okay. but the drama is not okay. managers have favorites. its basically high school all over again. also dont expect to move up if a manger doesnt like you.
bad,"Cut and dry. It really depends on what you're coming here for and who your senior ops, and managers are. Some look out for their people and some don't. When I first started back half nights were the shiz lol now its going to shiz. If you're planning to get anywhere here, take a number. If you're using this place for the pay don't get too comfy they like to cycle through veterans who stay in one spot to long even if they work hard."
bad,"This job was wonderful at one point. I honestly loved coming to work and felt fulfilled. There is some great people who work here which makes getting through the day so easy. But management is terrible, they lie and will say almost anything to make you feel like they care about you but don’t ever show"
bad,"Was a fun place to be working in the beginning, but after a while it got worse as i solidified my position in the company. They don't care much for their employees"
bad,If you need a job this place is always hiring. Not a bad check just don't expect alot with the company. They will interview anyone who applied for a promotion but they already choose who they wanted for the jobs before that process started.
bad,"Was average"
bad,"They recognize you when you hit high numbers. They write you up when you don't. The work was exhausting, you're are your feet literally the whole shift, besides lunch. They encourage a lot of water but then dock your time for your bathroom breaks, even though it takes as long as 5+ mins to get to the bathroom, depending on where you're stationed. Not worth it, in my opinion, for the pay."
bad,Just a typical day of hard working. The management are rough and the jobs are never easy. Constant standing and no resting. It is not a job that if you are going to school for.
bad,A typical work day is exhausting. Their quota ratio's are too extensive to meet often and you're constantly harassed by Managers that does minimum work.
bad,"The place is full of judgement and favoritism, it begins to feel almost impossible to refrain from getting upset. Bluntly careless about the workers and their sanity. This isn't everyone's experience, but once again there is favoritism and management loves to show that by being heart eyed for girls that wouldn't give them a chance if they weren't management. They let them get out of work early almost everyday lol it's a joke in there."
bad,If you’re looking for a fast paced career with very little respect from management then this is the job for you. Managers never seem to know what they’re doing due to Amazon hiring inexperienced managers to tell experienced people that have been with the company for years “you don’t know how to do your job”.
bad,"You must meet a quota.  It's fast pace. Frequent Injuries. Poor commucation, and they dont give full break times. If you have never worked in a factory/fulliment center it will be challenging."
bad,"It is very hard to work at amazon, it's very stressful, not fun, impossible to balance with a personal or family life. The job is not difficult, but not enjoyable. The pay is not good compared to other warehouses. You do get benefits very quickly after working at amazon and they have a lot of employee resources."
bad,"Fun place to work, but you work nonstop, you move every muscle in your body and you must do it accurately, they move at least 55,000 packages a shift, large and small four hours straight, no brake until lunch"
bad,"Amazon is so big that your experience depends on what team your working on. I'm sure for most coders the experience is quite satisfactory. What I found odd may be common in the tech world. The odd stuff was a very hazy organizational structure, no real vision for a product or feature, and lousy communication. Supervisors may be managing several projects and are always rushing off to other meetings. There is a reliance on communicating by tech through online tools like Sharepoint, Quip, Outlook, Google docs...so learn all those programs. This process is very mechanical and doesn't leave room for open-ended discussion."
bad,"Amazon will hire almost anybody immediately. Doing well your first two weeks is a sign that you can handle it. Of a class of about thirty people, I was among the final two or three there."
bad,If you ever get hurt at amazon you can guarantee them giving you the run around. By the time you talk to anyone from this country you are given the run around.  Just go see your doctor because you will be offered Tylenol. You are almost guaranteed to not get your break on most days.
bad,You get two breaks in almost 11 hours and one is barley 30minutes nobody is nice And nobody cares if you have life issues. They want you to act like robots constantly doing the job none stop. No phones taken inside so no communication to your family. Nobody is nice so not a job for people who need friends or talks. You’re just stuck into thinking about your life for 11 hours straight. Nothing to think about Bc the job itself becomes habit. You do the same thing over and over again every day. Unless you transfer departments you probably doing one of three jobs in ur department. Not a good place for people with anxiety and depression. Being stuck thinking the whole time is mentally draining and depressing. No music to listen to. limitations to your schedule. You either work four days in a row doing 11 hours or night shift three days 12 hours. School can be excused but only upto 10 hours a week so you can either miss one whole day or leave early every day. managers choose favorites like every other work place. Also really fishy is the manager get fired really often it’s weird. I don’t know why but everybody leaves. Nobody stays at the job very long. I started the first day it opened and now almost two years and there’s maybe a handful of people who have stayed. Probably because of production. You go thru security every day. Probably taking in some toxics from tape that I touch everyday and all the conveyer belts moving. Oh extremely loud inside you have to kinda scream. It’s a sad job. Good pay tho lol
bad,"As mentioned in the title, there's career growth possible in Amazon and its quiet fast. But there's no work life balance absolutely. Being a team manager you are expected to attend calls 24/7 whether you are on vacation or even on the days you've called sick. There's politics clearly visible. Its totally unstructured and there's no process."
bad,"Easy money, 4 days on 3 days off - great if you get the weekday shifts (not always the case). However continuously doing the same job for 40 hours a week in the same position obviously effects your physical and mental health. Ok for short term temp job but there's definitely better jobs out there. Plus you'd think with it being one of the largest companies in the world there would be lots of opportunities - there isn't really since you're just kept in the same department doing the same job as it costs them money to cross train people. Made lots of friends but the lack of motivation in the place really gets people down and means a lot of people call sick and don't feel valued. A typical day as a picker is starting work at 7.30am, picking items at your assigned station on your own with no music, work until 10.15am, half hour break, go back to station until 2.30pm - if you leave your station for water or toilet break this dramatically effects your productivity. half hour break 2.30pm-3pm then work until 6pm - very little interaction with anyone - lonely, boring work but suits for some I guess."
bad,"Great teams, challenging projects, access to tools. Poor long-term thinking, scope changes frequently, limited employee growth and advancement, leadership is very tactical/not strategic. Low retention, poor focus on building employee learning and development."
bad,Management has no idea how to manage workers. Allows lazy workers to do poor work with no corrective action making the job harder for those who do want to work. Easy job with good pay if you are a fast mover. Lots of extra time and time off opportunities.
bad,"My time at Amazon was amazing as it allow my to grow my skills considerably and learn about businesses I was previously unaware of. "
bad,The people were nice but being by yourself and not being able to listen to music or really do anything but walk around a 1.2 million sq ft warehouse isn’t worth it.
bad,"Absolutely no work life balance during peak and even aftrer that you they can tell you at any point it time you'll be working overtime whithout notice. If you had palns its dosent matter, amazon literally takes over your life ."
bad,"I worked 5AM-9AM at the DSF5 warehouse in SSF for a couple months. The first couple months with the first manager that I started with was great, once that manager left, it went down hill. It's a war between the warehouse workers & the delivery drivers. Don't work at this location, you'll find water bottles filled with urine, & get harrassed by certain coworkers."
bad,Ambiance agréable selon les équipes. Dommage que certaines agence d'intérim ne savent pas faire leurs boulots lorsque l'on dépose des justificatifs d'absences. J'aurais bien voulu réintégrer Amazon mais je ne suis plus accepté à causes de ces absences qui n'ont pas étaient mis à jour.
bad,"The warehouse in amazon is hot, dark, sweaty, very loud and overall horrible to work in. If you leave your station you only have 5 minutes to get back or else your logged off your station. There are some good thing about amazon like the people. I met some lovely people working there but some of the staff are very rude and when its very busy staff do not have time for everyone who need help. There isn't enough places where you can sit down and relax especially is you have a disability whether its mental or physical or you have to stand up for almost 10 hours a day. Overall the staff are helpful towards staff and they do help when they can but in my opinion they need to re-think the staff situation in most Amazon warehouses."
bad,"Amazon paga 15   per hours,  no mucho para el nivel de estress al que eres sometido, donde el mismo trabajo puede llegar a enfermarte  por agotamiento"
bad,"It was a hassle to get hours the way it was setup you had to do everything online, and it was a first come first serve type so it was hard.And there wasn't health insurance."
bad,"Amazon se presenta como una empresa relajada y equitativa, sin embargo no es la completa realidad."
bad,"Great pay and benefits. Unless you are right it if college, willing to suck up and worry only about you this is the job for you. They don't care about their employees only the numbers. Their core values don't mean anything. If you stand up to management and try to do the right thing you will only get a target on your back and they will do what they can to get rid of you."
bad,"to save your job at amazon , you have to regularly challenge yourself by increasing your raise . The job was funny at the begginning but now it not anymore because you do the same thing eveyday ."
bad,"To prove its diversity Amazon promotes Pretty people, Gays, Lesbians, unique people with blue hair.  Not people who would make good leaders or help the company in its supposed mission.  Each night our real mission is to do the most and drive up the numbers so that the building leaders and managers can make their bonus. This is the true Amazon way.  If you are one of the Locust, you will make your part-time pay and never get recognized for more."
bad,"Managers do not care about employees and are simply not qualified to lead. In addition promotions only come to those who brown nose or/and become friends with managers, not to those who put in the effort and show proper work ethic."
bad,"Each employee had a quota to fill in stocking and was held to a standard that was hard to fulfill. Minimum bathroom breaks, had to clock out each time, and was not allowed to leave work area for any other reason barring emergency calls from front desk."
bad,I’ve worked at amazon for over 6 yrs now. It’s a revolving door of people. Basically no one is their still from when I started. Everyone has left. They have great insurance and plenty of time off which is a huge plus but management sucks and it seems every month you get a new manager.
bad,"Not a design/innovation led work environment. I find a large majority of creative job families very under valued and/or under utilized. "
bad,"The workplace was very open. There were breaks although the managers were not that friendly at that location. I didn't deserve to be treated as such, being as it is a warehouse job you never know what to expect."
bad,"While at Amazon I worked 10 hr shifts saturday and sunday because those were the only shifts available. During those hours I was on my feet all day and got one 30 minute lunch, which included the time it took to get to and from the lunchroom from my work station."
bad,"Typical day you start your day out with morning exercises and then also after lunch. You stand on your feet 10-12 hrs a day. With little breaks because it takes you to long to walk to break room and you have to scan first item the min. your break is over."
bad,"Serious questions for HR were always deferred to needing to further investigate the company's policies without any follow up ever. They pretty much have computer programs dictating everything for them, the HR employees are just face to make you feel better about things. Multiple employees were outright lied to about being able to stay on after seasonal yet they kept some seasonal employees as temps (without communicating what was going on) and fired permanent employees. Leads and associates would outright talk badly about other employees and companies policies/procedures. No accountability for the associates who were following unsafe work practices, yet if your scan rate fell for being compliant or fixing pallets that fell apart due to other associates not giving a care about what they were doing, you were the one that ended up in trouble."
bad,"Management is run by young people. Everything is unorganized, as well as work. You get treated unfairly when you’re a seasonal worker. Don’t get to have much days off."
bad,"I was so overworked I developed several health issues that literally forced me to quit. I have always been a healthy person, but after a month, I was so sick and couldn't walk because of the amount of overtime they force you to do, and the lack of sleep I wasn't getting. It got to a point where I was in constant tears because of the pain, and they didn't care. They also didn't accommodate my college schedule and didn't care I had spent several thousand on classes they were forcing me to miss. If you are not loyal to me, don't expect me to be loyal back. Their overtime was EVERY week in December and people were literally dropping like flies, there was an ambulance there almost every hour from what I saw, and it was disgusting. People's health is not their concern, they just want you to work until you drop... literally. I was pulling 12-hour shifts and was on my feet almost 98% of that time. We don't even get a full hour of lunch. I finally decided that my health was far more important."
bad,"The job starts out a bit fun and nice; however, after continually exceeding expectations for 6 straight months, the expectations continued to increase until they became unreasonable. At that point there seemed to be an upper-management requirement for right ups. Eventually the pay to demands ratio flipped."
bad,"You know what you are getting into when you accept the job."
bad,"Trabajo monótono y exigente, en el que debes mentalizarte en estar 8h sin parar haciendo cosas muy repetitivas. No es un trabajo para todo el mundo. La conciliación es buena y el sueldo/beneficios también. La gestión interna es deficiente y algo caótica, en especial rrhh, es un nido de mala gestión, mala praxis, hipocresía y falta de tacto (no hablo de las ett, sino de los fijos). Para los que entren, recomiendo mucho esfuerzo y no decir lo que piensas, mejor no decir nada que pueda dar alguna pista de lo que piensas realmente. Incoherencia entre resultados y recompensas."
bad,so excited to start work here was told  my hours would be  8-6.30 four days a week . Now been told it is mandatory  we work  50- 60 hours  having to  start at 7 till  6.30 no extra break and then come in 10 hour shift  sat/ sun  and your day off
bad,The people that worked there before were not very nice. I was mentally going through becasue my daughter had just lost her father. I asked for a medical leave but they did not approve. The when I was told to take time off they filed my paper work wrong because they had a new girl to do it and cost me my jobs in the end. She currentl does not work there any more but it made it where I was not able to go back.
bad,"It's a stressful job you are overworked and in many cases under paid."
bad,"i was temp for the holidays old equipment in the facility where I was. pretty boring job. mgt is always changing something to stay"
bad,"Amazon pays for overtime and also arranges for free lunch/dinner during the holiday season of November-December every year. That gives it an edge over the other employers, when it comes to only salaries."
bad,"Management was not good at Amazon, i learned to drive a RC and double jack forklift, met good co workers while  worked there, worked in warehouse deals customer returns checking items for fraud and broken items, hardest part of the job was dealing with managers and i enjoyed the raffle giveaways and entertainment the company gave to us."
bad,"Decent job, but WELL underpaid. 401k is vested for 2 years.Also, they do not treat the production workers very well. The only good thing about this job was the health care package."
bad,"There are definitely toxic managers there.  If you are unfortunate to get one, your life can be miserable.  Mine left me alone for 2 years but I did see many people come and go under this person.  Once I was ""targeted"", that's when things started going really bad.  I started having health issues, miserable work life balance, and just a horrible experience."
bad,"Lots of angry people on the phone. Not a lot of wiggle room to help them, which is a huge downgrade from when I first started, which at that time you had a huge ability to help customers, but then they started reducing your ability to make exceptions. Lots of being yelled at. People were cool to work with, but the culture of the actual company is a garbage fire of over competitive networking."
bad,I applied for the 6:30am to 10:30 am shift and after two days we were told they were moving us to 4:30 am to 8:30am. Several of us were also told that we would be in the sorting department and were actually assigned as order picker.  If you don't care about shifts or type of work you will be doing then it might be the job for you. Not me...
bad,"really low salary and they dont appreciate hard work, so dont bother to ask for a raise cause they always have excuses for not giving you a raise they are always giving you more responsibility but they dont want to give you a raise"
bad,A typical day at work would be to bust our butts everyday without the proper working equipment and still expected to meet goal. Management team is great but can only do so much to help the associates. To Corporate & HR business comes first and employees are replaceable. They are currently forcing associates to change their schedule and hours or resign. Voices/Concerns of associates are not being addressed or heard. Amazon does NOT care about their associates.
bad,"Management team has predatory and aggressive members. Pay is good but hours can be stressful at times. I liked the hours and time off system, I did not like managers who preyed upon female coworkers and insulted me for my sexuality."
bad,"it is a Fast paced work environment, the pay was good but not worth the hassle , they provide a lot of benefits , but still, the job is hard and you always have to meet you rate expectations which makes it even harder."
bad,"Working full-time consists of 4days, 10hr shifts from a selective type that you choose from availability. (ex. Sun-Wed) front-half  / (Wed-Sat) back-half / (Mon,Tue,Thurs,Fri) donut. All of these shifts are from 7am-5:30pm.  Physical labor ain't no joke, you're constantly standing on your feet the entire shift, only time you're sitting down is on your 30min lunch break and two 15min. breaks but the walk to the break room is a 3''min walk so that takes up your break time for the 15min ones. I doubt anyone would want to work long-term at a Fulfillment Center or can't really imagine anyone doing so due to the lack of advancement within the warehouse. I applied for this job so that I could rack up/earn some money fast for a certification program at a local technical college around my area that I plan on enrolling and some money on the side for myself to spend. Got my first paycheck a few days ago but I plan on working here until the end of the year is over. It's a great company don't get me wrong, its just when there isn't any positions available at the Fulfillment Center that you work at, it clearly doesn't give you hopes of moving up. Thats why right from the start I told myself I'd only be working a few months and getting out. They start Tier 1 associates at $11/hr in Georgia plus benefits but again I only saw this job as a short-term one and definitely not long-term."
bad,Amazon Fresh was not a fun place to work. Nor a good place to work. Horrible hours with very little pay. You are little more than numbers to the managers. Never really seen as an employee or person for that matter. Decisions are made upstairs by people who've never stepped foot inside the facilities. Managers blindly follow these orders and the everyday hard working employees pay for them.
bad,Pay at Amazon is great although it's come with high expectations around working round the clock and being quick to respond to any question or need.   Some groups there are good and have better work life balance but they're tough to find.    Try to find a good team there but expect to be working non-stop.   Very smart people working at Amazon though so definitely an opportunity to learn.
bad,"It was a decent place to work. They do have opportunity for advancement. Must be able to stand for long hours 10+. Managers vary, most of them suck though. Pay is decent especially during holidays. Stock after two years. Breaks are short and you have to walk far to breakroom. They hound you on your rate of work. This job is okay overall."
bad,it is a very fast pace job. you work 40 to 60 hrs every week. there is new management every three months or less. they have the best benefits. you earned vacation and paid time off every pay check.
bad,"No work variety, no pay incentives, no flexibility, minimal freedom."
bad,"Micromanaged beyond belief... 13 hour days, the culture is that they throw you to the wolves and hopefully you do well and learn everything you need to know. Management is unhelpful; they don't want to develop you and are only focused on their own tasks/careers."
bad,Lots of work just hot and plenty of overtime  you will start off as a picker as the weeks go on they Will require you to pick a certain amount of items per hr
bad,"Management is hideous and secretive."
bad,it was an ok job but it was vert competitive job you had to have 100% work quota there any less and you would  get fired and your not eligible for rehire ever.
bad,"I'm a problem solver which isn't hard but they just added other things for us to do and sometimes it can be stressful. I believe when my manager says that she cares about the team and wants us to do great but she likes to micromanage. I'd say the hardest part of the job are the hours, it can get tiring at times but the job can be fun depending on the people you work with. They do give PTO, UPT and paid vacation and great benefits which is awesome."
bad,Time consuming. works you to death. takes away from home life. great for single people with no children. literally on your feet for 10 hours. a 30 minute lunch isnt enough. they got me messed up
bad,"About 80% of the work force are foreign nationals."
bad,"If you're young or have no work experience and/or need benefits ASAP, then this is a job for you.  The work is not mentally challenging,  You are on you feet for 91/2 hours a day. with only 2 half hour breaks.  It is a very physical job - lots of bending, reaching, kneeling and climbing.  As for benefits - you get health, vision  and dental right away.  There is only a 10% discount on item that is from Amazon - no 3rd party vendors.  Oh, you don't get Amazon prime for free."
bad,Won't be working for this company again. While the benefits are a great plus the company provides zero understanding of personal situations and hardly recognizes hard working employees.
bad,"The management favoritism is VERY obvious. VERY easy to get write up's or coaching's. I have received coaching's and write up's while working, because their system lags tremendously. Rate's and Time for how many boxes you do and what you're doing throughout the day in general is NOT accurate."
bad,"Easily one of the most frustrating places I have ever worked. Management only cared because they had to. When I tried applying for another position within the company, I was told ""good luck"" with no prepping or anything. When I finally did the interview, the interviewer was surprised that I wasn't taught the proper way to interview. Management would often lie to make us hit our goals. There were good benefits, but it's not enough to stay past a little while. The turnover in my department was very high."
bad,Not a great work environment.  Stressful and competitive.  Long hours and physical.  Exhausting and very strict.  Uncaring and you're made to feel like a number.
bad,The quota for pack is 76 packages per hr and everything goes in a box. That's like 2 pkgs. per second give or take. If they put you on their curve you'll make it. That's if they want you to stay. Don't say anything against Amazon when HR does their survey. They do alot of hiring to make it look like they are helping the Ohio job market. They don't tell you how many they let go after peak. You can never miss work and work hard while your there and it won't matter. Work gets low and they need to get rid of people until the next hiring season.
bad,"been picking for a few months now and i believe its the worst job here, everyone is in your way trying to get the item needed and all other departments have the easy duties, unlike us pickers walking OVER 10+ MILES A DAY and still getting paid the same as an ICQA or stower."
bad,"Been here a year and a half and I'm hating it but the benefits are among the best among employers in the area. I found a new job I loved and stayed here instead because of the benefits and time off ok! You get two weeks overall paid time over the course of the year- PTO that is use or lose and vacation that carries over (I keep using up all my time though). There's also an 'unpaid time off' bank which is essentially a buffer for firing you. If you can't be on site and on task even after all your paid time is exhausted then you STILL get a break for almost two weeks worth before you use up the 'UPT' and then it's time to realize you shouldn't be employed here! Rates are a pain and during slow periods, management will go into deeper scrutiny in order to document you as a deficiency and fire you and avoid paying unemployment. No one here gets laid off. They either give up and quit or are 'progressed through HR'. My current manager an PA are amazing though. They really are a breath of fresh air personality wise but they can only do what our less than stellar on site(yes, there is a third party HR that does most of the heavy lifting while in house sits at a desk and says I don't know a lot) HR team allows so people end up screwed over anyway. Rated low management because above them(above the site really) is just...ugh!"
bad,"very poor management"
bad,"good clean environment though noisie"
bad,"the job is very physically demanding but people are fun and nice. not the best place to work but its okay. i would recommend to those who can handle working on your feet for 10 hours and can handle heavy lifting, walking, and constant movement."
bad,"While Amazon has decent benefits and average pay their production requirements are unrealistic in my opinion. While they provide two paid fifteen minute breaks they are really more like ten minutes because they include travel time. If the building wasn't so large this would not be an issue, but it is."
bad,I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone. It is stressful on your body and mind. You are very disrespectful to their workers. Great good workers horribe and promote lazy workers.
bad,I was a threat to my manger because I actually wanted to further my knowledge and he acted like I was going to steal his position. Lazy poor excuse for a man!
bad,"You have to be a special breed to work at Amazon.  Strategy can change on a dime and everything is over analyzed and written about.  98% of my efforts were wasted.  Most professionals were just ticking boxes to make to t the next level and there was no training.  On the other hand, I met some of the smartest people...a lot of overachievers."
bad,"A fast paced environment. Micro managed. Room for advancement if  playing by there rules, No real time for family, Overtime is often called at the last minute."
bad,I started when they had Peak Season. I didn't expect to work around 6 days a week. It was exhausting. Too many people worked there. It was hard to get around to the microwaves during lunch.
bad,When working at Amazon that culture was very fast paced and stressful. The work load was unrealistic which enable for no work life balance. As managers you are viewed to work long hours and devote most of your time to the company. You get recognized more for failing one out 100 things rather then the 99. I learned when working there that 100% was viewed as 0%.
bad,"it was like electing a new president every couple of months. The management was shifting from top to bottom so often they could never effectively implement any changes, positive or negative."
bad,"longue journée "
bad,"Very stressful work environment where numbers are more important than quality. The employees are the last thing that Amazon is concerned with, no matter how much they try to tell you that when you are in the hiring process. "
bad,"3-5 max hours a day, all part time jobs. They work with school schedule. one paid 10 min break if you work 4 hours or more. Very disorganized and many of the people don't  really work."
bad,Needs to be more flexible with employees.  Hard-work is required for the challenges here.  Room for improvement if you stay focused on the goal in front of you.
bad,Horrible place to work. Long hard hours. You are constantly and unfairly judged by your performance. Worked my tail off only to be criticized by management and their underling 'Supervisors'.
bad,"The hours are really long and of management sees you're good at something, be prepared to be stuck in that function for as long as you're there. It's pretty stressful, especially on busy nights and sometimes you will have to surrender days off for mandatory overtime. Management is pretty fair but as said before, they like to keep you in whatever function you're good at and they won't listen if you tell them you're burned out from that function. Also they have two 15 minute break but it's more like 2 minutes to get there and two minutes back so it's more like a ten minute break."
bad,"Normal day in work would be early start, personal items in lockers, through security to morning briefing. The rest of the day for 12 hours i would stand in one place scanning items one by one."
bad,"The pay and benefits were good but that doesn't make up for the amount of stress, safety hazzards or health concerns there.  Some managers get to know you and go out of their way to have your backs and others don't care, they just want to advance."
bad,Its very fast pace. You have to stay on task on u will get time off task and that lead to write ups. You barely see your manager so you have a lot freedom.
bad,"You could relate the experience to being part of the Borg collective. They basically made you work like a robot constantly. You need to make rate- be fast and efficient. Constantly stowing, counting, or picking. The break room has horrible food. XP No life work balance either."
bad,"using people everywhere they can, pushing at all times, and they sack all of them before christmas, just promises about full time jobs, they took people who they like the most"
bad,Good working with peers. Room for advancement isn't there. I like to strive to know the company within. The company has policies that do not adhere to everyone. Which makes it harder for other employees to agree with them.
bad,"Nastoupila jsem pod agenturu, kde jsou podmínky poměrně horší, jelikož agentura vydělává na přijímání nových uchazečů o práci, nemá zájem o delší spolupráci. Kmenový zaměstnanci mají odpovídající podmínky."
bad,They stress you out and work you like a slave and don’t not pay much. The hours are long and dreadful with small breaks. They don’t not care about your wellbeing just the work.
bad,"Very large and noisy warehouse. Crowded at times with all the other employees. The warehouse is extremely large and breaks would not be relaxing as you would have to spend a considerable portion of them walking to the time clocks. Managers check in with you maybe once a day if you're keeping up with the pace. They really don't do much and probably don't deserve the pay they receive. I would not recommend working here to anyone. The pay was okay for the work, but every day as a young man I would come home sore and it would even hurt to walk. Extremely tough and not worth it."
bad,Pas bonne  ambiance de travail mais les formateur sont super
bad,Mgrs were horrible and treated you disresptfully being a girl.  I did really like my job but it was difficult being a supervisor and the crew not wanting to take me serious cause I might be a girl but I worked just as hard as them.
bad,"I worked at Amazon as a seasonal Warehouse Operative. The pay was great (but it generally is everywhere if you're working nights) and we were paid weekly which was good. However, thats probably the only positive thing I can say. If you know any rumours about amazon they're probably all true.  Awful breaks for a 10 hour shift, which didn't increase at all when my shifts altered to 11, 12, or even 13 hours. I am also a student, and wasn't made aware when  I applied or even when I started that my hours per shift and shifts per week would increase, this then had an affect on my studies and I know if influenced the lives of my other colleagues too. Your breaks are also cut short by the time it takes to get to your locker from the warehouse and then to the canteen. Management were usually there at the desk but when I booked holidays they did them incorrectly."
bad,"Long hours with terrible goals that were impossible to reach. We had to hit extremely high numbers during the peak periods (Christmas), which was near to impossible in the stow area due to their being a lack of space, and guidelines that were not followed accurately."
bad,"The actual job itself is pretty good, with many people who are as committed as you to get the job done. There have been some questionable management decisions made, but they seem to be getting better at not making errors. The hardest part is keeping your energy level as high as they want it to be for the four day shift pattern, you start to feel exhausted towards the end. The most enjoyable part is the feeling you get when you hit targets, its almost a relief to not have the system on your back about it."
bad,You do the same thing day in and day out. Management always has their head up their butt and they don't care about the employees. Great benefits but I was suicidal while working there.
bad,Had to work 60+ hours during peak. 10-hour shifts a day. It's a dirty place and the people that work there are rude. It's also pretty dangerous. I don't recommend.
bad,It's an extremely fast paced environment. It is also a place where a lot of people get fired. Could do better with time. Could handle situations better.
bad,"When I went to apply I thought it would be a very good experience since the company is very praised but I was wrong. On the day of my orientation they made everyone feel welcomed  and said that they try to make their employees welcomed and excited to work here.  On my first day of work they taught us how to do the job that we were assigned and it seemed easy at first but if you did not meet the quota of 10 - 12 seconds they would tell you to speed up the process, they did however let you go to about a max of 20 seconds since we just started. Also you were advised to not make any mistakes even though it was your first day and for some people mistakes where inevitable. Overall the job would've been a good one if it wasn't for the fact that they treat you nice only for the orientation the forget about it on the first day of employment."
bad,Only one day of training that you get and you are moved from on place in the warehouse then sent to the other side of the warehouse then sent to another department to do some all new to you
bad,It’s more for college students 5 hours a day you can not go over 29 hours a week.  Management is horrible managers talk to you ANY TYPE OF WAY.  even older people
bad,"Amazon pays well. But doesn't seem to care when their employees are stressed out due to the inability to do their job. I take pride in my work, but I couldn't make rate, due to lack of space. Then, management rewards the people who cherry pick their jobs, so their rate is better. It is beyond frustrating."
bad,Amazon is a place that hires you and fires you very quickly they hardly train the people they hire and they also have poor parking availability's and only offer 25-30 hrs a week
bad,"The pay rate was excellent, but it is sad to say they don't treat associates too well. The managers can be very unprofessional at times, and I feel they don't appreciate their workers."
bad,"amazon don't care about you. They have madatory over time where you have to work 6 days 10 hr shift. You have people who work hard but may not make production they would get rid off them, It is very high turn over place"
bad,"some jobs here are only temporary. pay was decent. don't agree with being rated on your work on a daily basis, kind of hard to always be at 100% when there is not work of no space on production floor for anything else to be added."
bad,"If you are a hard worker, you get given hard work to do.  I left Amazon because they overworked me, physically. I never had any sort of joint pains until I worked there, and I have done some of the most difficult construction jobs there are.  They constantly put me in positions that were extremely hard on my body, instead of rotating me to positions that were physically less demanding.  Rather, the slower, physically weaker, and lazier employees were constantly given these less demanding position.  Whereas, the physically stronger and harder working employees were constantly given the more difficult tasks."
bad,"I really enjoyed working there. The local HR dept there was quite a bit out of touch with the company.  I was hired on as unskilled labor, then was placed in ICQA, which did require more effort and skill.  Overall a nice place to live, but a full work-week really was difficult to do at first."
bad,don't work if you can just do your best. they want you doing the almost impossible. Even if they give you all the advice sometimes it doesn't work out
bad,"A high stress job that allows for very little discrepancy.  I truly enjoyed working here until I found out that the company relies more heavily on the word of disgruntled associates than of the loyal managers and management team.  HR in this company is eventually going to be its downfall.  They refuse to assist the management teams in standard HR duties and constantly pawn their jobs off on managers, but when an employee is upset at a manager and complains, your job is literally on the line.  The senior managers have no say in whether or not you will be dismissed.  I truly expected a lot more out of this company....sad."
bad,A lot of work .the day can go by slow or really fast it just depends ok the work load .how many people are there who's starting drama because they have nothing better to do.
bad,The work itself is repetitive and mind-numbing. Management couldn't give a toss about employee well-being as they're too busy wrestling other managers for advancement. Only reason to work there is for healthcare and other benefits.
bad,The management at Amazon seem to be very inconsiderate. The most enjoyable part about Amazon for me was Amazon's Away team experience. The hardest part of the job was meeting the numbers for management.
bad,"Working here reminds me of a sweat shop. Clock-ins have to be exact and precise. Can't clock in early, can't clock out early or late. That alone is stressful cause you're always trying to race to the time clock and there are hardly any clocks around so trying to find out what time it is is tricky. You get one unpaid 30 min lunch 3 hours into your 10 hour shift then another paid ""30"" minute break 6 hours into your 10 hour shift. You can't leave your post till break time so by the time you factor in walking to bathroom, your car, the break room, etc, you have about 20 real minutes of break cause they want you back at it the minute your break ends no exception. You will walk 10-15 miles a day non stop. Any where in the building that you need to go is such an extreme walk that it makes you not want to bother. They frown on too many bathroom breaks yet want you to stay hydrated. Every day I worked I was severely dehydrated from exerting myself to the max and low water intake cause I didn't want to worry about going to the bathroom. They also monitor your activity, so if you have more than 6 min time off task, it flags them. Everything they expect of you there is extremely unclear. You don't find out information unless you ask them and then when they answer you're like holy cow I'm glad I asked cause they never would have told us otherwise! Bottom line, if you have feet that never get tired or hurt, then go for it."
bad,Management sucks. Equipment sucks. Too many people in the cells. Very hot. Needs improvement. Also needs to listen to the people's opinions and suggestions who work there.
bad,"I've only been working there for 2 weeks now. And I want to leave already. They don't take your complaints to consideration. Also you can't change your job role or shift pattern after 12 weeks, which I find really bizarre and silly. I mean if your not comfortable either doing that you should be able to change regardless. And they should pay more for the swing shifters because we enter the night so we should get paid more. Also some people on swing shift don't get home till after 3 and they won't do anything about it. They just say wait til 12 weeks which is really ridiculous. If you do apply pick day or night and be prepared to get rushed break"
bad,"My overall experience was good in the beginning the managers are awesome;however the policies are not. They swap schedules too much, which makes if difficult to balance life and possibly work another job for the extra income. I never got my referral bonus when I referred a friend and i have never got a bonus from them."
bad,"Management changes so frequently most don't know what they are doing or who you are. Many don't care."
bad,wouldn't work with my school schedule. You only get two 30 minutes break. Its kinda laid back if they like you . They do little prizes for if you do go to work and sometimes they will feed you.
bad,Too much favoritism. Management sucks. Unfair treatment. It's a great temporary job for people in school. They also don't have much safety concern for the associates. Overall it's an ok place to work if you have low standards like myself.
bad,"I hear that it depends a great deal on where you land in the company.  For me, the company was and is impressive from the outside, but was toxic on the inside where I landed.  Stack ranking caused good individuals to be singled out and get pushed out of the company. People hid their mistakes because exposing them was detrimental to your career, so the same mistakes were repeated over and over again.  Management was not interested in straightforward ideas to increase productivity.  But I have friends who have done very well and are happy there. I've been quite successful in other companies, but not here."
bad,since work has been horrible after the holidays i have been waiting for the day i can pick up and leave do to the poor management the overwhelming of packages software is in serious need of up dating and GPS systems is very poor.
bad,This job is temporary. Not my preferred place to work. Would not recommend amazon . Wage however is very goods and there is constant overtime. Hours are very demanding
bad,"They lied when your hired, they don't listen to the employees, management and human resources lack of communication, awesome benefits, expectations to high, if you get injured they wait to long to send you to medical,  they don't follow workers comps and special accommodations requirements,  and they do everything to get rid of potential liabilities an injured employee can cause, they wait until your fighting a case , to start paying insurance or supplemental,  good part about job, great coworkers, worse training."
bad,Management has no idea what goes on day to day yet insists on increased standards that can't be met due to lack of resources. Constantly raising the bar despite the inability of its associates to even meet the previous bar. Literally ZERO upwards mobility. No promotion from within.
bad,"journée type en WE Samedi  6H 19h"
bad,A typical day at work as a picker for amazon is stressful. I learned the expectations were very high for completing the task in a limited amount of time. Management was very strict and non compliant with alot of things. It is very easy to get fired with a simple write up or two. The hardest part of the job is getting the 300 rate without the help of an energy drink. The most enjoyable part of the job was payday.
bad,Great benefits that's about all the worth of working here is. Advancing through the company is possible but unlikely. Most enjoyable part is the people you meet. Very diverse place to work.
bad,They withhold from you at orientation about the rates you have to make and the fact you are stuck in what ever area of the warehouse they select you for til you make this said rate or get three write ups and out the door.
bad,"The job at first was easy. Scan this, put the item into the area it belongs, scan the area and your job is done. As a seasonal associate  you don't get as much as a full time associate. This is expected but when you are fired and have to fight for your job back for getting into a car accident, despite calling HR right after the accident, and still having to deal with it months later is not okay in my book. Sick days get scarce, You get a set amount of personal time every few months (which was about two days), and the managers will not relay the right information to you in fear of losing money. I kept getting sent to the same person in HR who didn't know what he was doing, and when i asked anyone else about the same question the answer was completely different!"
bad,"BFI4 job can be a way-job, it is practically for the young and strong."
bad,"I only work their as a seasonal worker but if your a full time employee they do provide good benefits. I was busy and worried, I have to be sure to make the cota or the amount that I need to pick for the day not to get in trouble."
bad,"The job requirements Are very difficult to maintain. they treat you as if your a number and not a person and you only contact hr via voice mail. Which, it usually takes about two days before you get a response. The pay was great and hours extra hours  were available. they also pick your hours you have to work. you don't get a choice. in order to switch to another position you have to be placed in a lottery."
bad,Wants so much of you with little in return. Work hard have fun make history is the motto... work hard is the only truth! Super face paced environment.
bad,"I worked there as long as I could, pay was real good I cannot take anything from that. But in the end it just was not the job for me. Good place if you need quick money."
bad,Force you to do overtime exec though the rules state it's optional. Very political and judgemental. Made me work night shifts at a stretch for 7 months inspite of my contract stating shift rotations every 3 months. Very unhealthy work life balance. I humans treatment. Extraordinary long hours (10 - 11 hours)
bad,"very little room to grow, high energy not enough start pay, little to no overtime unless peak, some of the tier 3 positions not worked for just handed to the person"
bad,A typical day at work is similar to that of a day on a slave plantation. The physical labor and such isnt even the problem its 100 percent the management.
bad,"At Amazon Fulfillment center, either your fast or you're fired. Personally management was favoritism. You could have the most experience, highest item rate, and know every one in the team. If you weren't on the good side of management, you were stuck in the first position you were hired onto."
bad,"I've been employed by Amazon for 3 years and in my experience I would not recommend this job to anyone. The management is the worst I have ever come across. Area managers are hired with zero experience and are clueless. Leadership does as little as possible and only gets involved periodically within the company. With 10 hour shifts your entire day is gone and when peak arrives you will not see any of your family for a good month or more. The pay is decent enough to stay as well are the bennifets; however when it comes to the way an average employee is treated by PA's, AM's, HR, and Leadership its no wonder Amazon has such a high turn over rate. Overall if you need a job Amazon is always hiring but if you have the chance to work for a different company I would advise it."
bad,"The good things are the health benefits and the 4 day work weeks."
bad,"I was there from Nov-March.  Being a rebinner the work was exhausting. I received a fit bit for Christmas from my family, and soon realized why I was sore all of the time.  I was walking 30,000 steps a day which was equivalent to 13 miles (a half marathon).   Then you have the managers standing at gate keep talking and announcing rates over a microphone the whole day.  It's a good place for people straight out of high school to work cause it pretty much is a high school.   Always had to watch where you stepped outside cause they're would be food on the ground by peoples cars.  Supposed to get a bonus every month for attendance and productivity. didnt get one for January or February.   They make it sound like a great place to work, but it's quite the opposite."
bad,The hours are very long and you have to work 4 consecutive days at 10 and a half hours each day. By the end of the day you are physically and emotionally drained. Management is okay but they do have favorites and they are always trying to push you too hard. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet for 10 hours. It wears you out really fast and you are constantly bending and lifting heavy objects while trying to keep your rate (quota per hour) the same. The only enjoyable part of the job is talking to the people next to you and that is the only thing that keeps you from going crazy sometimes.
bad,Very face paced work place which makes for a faster work day. Helpful coworkers. Not as stable as I expected. There's a peak season and a slow season which makes it hard to maintain.
bad,Everyday in and out  we did various things like packing and shipping various items. We also would supervise converyer belts to ensure packages were not getting jammed or falling from the belt. the culture there is vary diverse. The hardest part was the work period because they worked you even when you were hurting or in pain. We didnt have adequate breaks eithef. To be honest I did not enjoyany part od working at amazon accept someof my co workers.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend the job to my worst enemy the management is poor and lack luster at best, treated like slaves instead of employees and the lack of equality among employees is beyond poor."
bad,"The workplace was clean but the atmosphere was not that great."
bad,Communication is not enough. No say in changes which are made. Performance driven. Many things could have been better. Conversion is offered after four months which makes an associate permanent but that is not guaranteed. Pay leaves a lot to be desired. I love being able to work from home
bad,"The work days are very long when hired for full time. There are not enough bathrooms to accommodate all the employees, and one must wait. The lunch and 2 breaks are not long enough to really have a rest, because it takes several minutes to walk to the break room within the giant warehouse. Everything is computerized, and while working the computer is always monitoring your work, picking time in seconds, etc. There really isn't any enjoyable part of the day when working at the Hebron, KY Prime Pantry Center."
bad,"well the work is good,i learn about accuracy,but the management are kind of bad sorry to say that though,the colleagues some are good while you will also find bad once.what i  like about the job is that they offer a great  opportunity to foreigners ..."
bad,"While working at Amazon I was considered a ""picker"". Everyday was the same. You were on a timed schedule to go from point A to point B. Managers were about a half mile apart and were helpful when needed. The culture of the workplace was quick and dry. Everybody had a destination and therefore kept to themselves the entire 10hr shift. Working in complete silence. The hardest part of the job was also the most enjoyable for me. It was hard on the body, however the workout was most rewarding."
bad,"The schedules are great. The work/life balance and culture is great. There is no communication with managers, HR, or other teams and departments. The pay is low and there is no room for growth. There is no motivation to stay with this company."
bad,"worst department, walk 10-15 miles a day with no appreciation. Breaks are extremely short for working 10 hr days. MOTO is work hard, have fun, make history, but there is no fun."
bad,"I didn't like working at Amazon , the pay was to low for the labor , they don't give you enough time to meet rate . You have 4 days of training that's it , they just expect you to know how to make rate , after only 4 days of training , they do lay offs way to much , but there website is fun to shop off of ."
bad,"The work is easy, just get your job done and you will bew fine. Moving up probably isn't going to happen unless you have a degree of any kind (BA, BS)."
bad,"Amazon wasn't the worst place to work, but it definitely wasn't the best. It is a very fast paced job that keeps you going on your feet the entire shift, but it can also be pretty unorganized. The hours were never promised. One week we could work a full 40 hours, and the next, they are sending employees home left and right. Supervisors only treated employees like numbers, and didn't show much respect. The employees that I had the pleasure of working with were amazing people, and I made lots of friends. It really gave me the opportunity to break out of my shell and become more social and learn to better work with people."
bad,"I had problems with this job but enjoyed working here."
bad,"I see a lot of four stars here with not enough detail on how poorly run the place is by inadequate managers and leads. These managers and leads are either much older than you and try to patronize you and ignore your requests for actual input, preferring the sound of their own voice, or they're the same age as you and try to act mature but fail at it miserably. I remember being told by one manager how to respect their authority  while they continuously ate on the floor while talking to you with their mouth full. Shem. "
bad,"Great staff. There wasn't any hard part in the job, Every job role I got I completed it easy. Management could be better a lot of people with high roles with no respect for staff below them."
bad,"Require seldom critical thinking, but require moderate to intensive physical labor. Pay is well, and environment is very calm and slow for the most part. Amazon will practically hire anyone, so a great place if in dire need of a job."
bad,"This job was one of a kind. The feeling you get knowing your the one giving people there Christmas gifts is an awesome feeling. The job was very boring though. A lot of repetition and a lot of favoritism was seen, which made me not like it as much. A typical day at work is 12 hours of picking products out of bins and putting them into a cart, and only picking unless you were a favorite. Working here you were basically a number to them and they only cared about your productivity. They didn't care about teaching you if you made a mistake or paying attention to you if you had a question. Almost impossible to talk to there HR team."
bad,this place was very boring as i like busy places i like everyday different however here everyday was same and the job was very monoton 8 hours standing on same place and pack items.This job was not for me.I like challenges i like busy environment i like dealing with people and solving problems
bad,I would say it you like hard labor and don't mind long hours Amazon is the place to go. I personally worked overnight and long 10 hour days. In the Peak season (October through December) you can work up to 60 hours a week which can wear on the body mentally and physically.
bad,"the shift have a lot of hours. the break are very short, you will wish very tired all days, sometimes you feel the manager don't want to help you, sometimes you need help and you can't do anything,"
bad,the job is fun and enjoyable but the agency's that amazon use to employee people are not that good on site as they dont and if you need a bus to there the bus company used are not good as they used a mini bus for 16 people and there was 22  people on the bus
bad,"Start the day at stand up, telling how many orders to be packed out for the day,what  we should and should not do for our safety.  "
bad,"fast pace and a very exhausting environment. Learned to drive forklifts for the first time. co workers are great but some are still immature. The management varies, some are great leaders and others are fresh out of college, but don't know what they're doing.The most enjoyable part of the job was the learning experience in a distribution center."
bad,"This job would be really good if it was a full time job, they pay good but no hours. One manager is a two face."
bad,I believe the company is good but it lacks in oeganization and managment... The job is good if you dont have much responsibilty or dependents. The job is ok but not great.
bad,Work was fast paced every day and everybody was up tempo with all their work. There was really not much communication with other co workers other than lunch and the breaks and occasionally in passing while doing your work. You had your few managers that were sociallable but others I feel were thrown into their position and lacked communication skills and overall management skills. Not really a hard job but to me it was the people that made it less fun to be at.
bad,A regular day at work I would go and punch in and then go to start up where we stretches that the manager leads then I go find a Picker that I learned to drive and got my license on then go and pick up different picks in various orders. Some co-workers are great people and very nice but some are also very rude and nasty to everybody and same goes for management. I don't really see a hard part about the job I adapt pretty quickly to any job. My favorite part of the job would probably have to be driving the order pickers I liked doing that alot.
bad,"Drive forklift, learned how to work a scanner, management bad, good co-workers, getting your rate for the day hardest, enjoyed working with co-workers."
bad,prendre un transpalette manuel et marché pendant des heures sans avoir le droit de discuté avec les collegues ou autre .
bad,"50 hour weeks loading trucks non-stop (supposed to be 4 - 10 hour days). Management is a joke, they just yell at people and they dont even know how to do the job or what is being done wrong. They also love to rush you even if it puts your safety at risk. Benefits are AMAZING!!! I have ever heard them telling multiple employees that they will be ""replaced"" if they dont work harder."
bad,"I started off working in Receiving when I was first hired.  Because of the holiday season, they kept moving people around, including me, in different positions with little or no instructions or directions.  My advice: apply when Amazon is not in peak schedule (October-December)"
bad,This is a very physically demanding job and can very stressful. It's a face paced work environment and can get very hot in the summer. Management is not great.
bad,"They say to work smart not harder, unfortunately the facility does not approve of that because you work hard every day over exhausting yourself for a 'thank you, but not necessary' when you go above the call of duty to help improve the working environment for you and fellow employees. Also expect to work for those speedy numbers because that is all they ever care about instead of generating actual (TRUE) numbers. "
bad,"I love my work, the management is pretty good.  Employees are treated in a very transitory fashion and essential lied to about the prospect of permanent positions.  The sad thing is that its obvious that the objective is to gain good workers and release them before they would be required to give them a raise / benefits or be obligated to give them permanent work.  Economy killers."
bad,We act as if were a team but there's differences between the people. Some people are treated better than other. There is favoritism.
bad,"Amazon was a good experience for me. It was a fast paced job That kept me busy and let the day go by faster, however after some time packing boxes all day wheres on you."
bad,my experience too great of that company.the company process is so bad and not comfort to me my hardest part of job is time and not fixed the scheduled.
bad,Leistungsorientierter Betrieb ohne realistische Zukunft
bad,"developed for the my knowledge, any management lead to company"
bad,it wasnt all they said it would be when hired need more oppurtunities to move up in the company and make your employees feel important
bad,"You work very hard there and for the average employee there with little chance of advancement. The standard of work changes on a weekly basis so much that it becomes confusing on what you should and should not do. They set the bar so high for your work goals that some people cannot reach them, if you don`t reach them you will be written up and fired. Desperately needs a union of some type."
bad,"At Amazon, it can be difficult at times, but it can be fun if you make it fun. I have great co-workers. The hardest part of my job would be when we have machine failures and we cant get orders out to customers on time."
bad,"Co-workers are nice and fun to work with, but the leaderships teams are not very helpful when needed to be and are rude and can be abusive when they want to be."
bad,"Take multiple phone calls and emails from customers, carriers and internal employees for Amazon Fresh and Amazon Pantry. I deal with   the logistics end of orders, site wide issues and general customer service on Amazon policy."
bad,"not good place to work. specially agency."
bad,"When you go through the week long orientation, Amazon talks a big game regarding leadership principles and traits they follow (sounded great) as well as their attack the process, engage the people (APEP) philosophy. When you leave orientation and into the fulfillment centers, mostly everything you learned in orientation is thrown out the window. The FCs I worked at follows an autocratic management style, not the traits discussed in orientation. Senior management goes after associates instead of asking questions first and trying to change the process. Associates by many of the management team are viewed as just a number or to some they are bodies, which makes weekly performance and productivity management meetings become a standard check mark off of the HR checklist. Quality cross training for associates are pretty much non-existent and for associates who work in a path that they normally do not...well, hopefully they have a good manager during the performance meetings or they will be written up. "
bad,"The typical work day at amazon is long and dreadful because management is really strict on bringing phone and electronics in the building so you get to work 10 hours a day without any music and barely any talking. When you do talk management makes it seem like you've been talking for the whole 10 hours instead of 3 mins.Co-workers are always worried about other people instead of themselves. The hardest part of the job is actually getting through the 10 hour work day because the job is so repetitive and boring. The most enjoyable part of the job is the benefits they give such as paid time off, 401 K, medical and personal leaves, and health insurance."
bad,"The only good thing I can say is that you get paid."
bad,"So lets start off with the good things about working at amazon fulfillment. You get 2 options to use if you have to leave work , or want to leave work at anytime of the day(Unpaid time off, Paid time off) You also get Vacation time , which adds up slowly. All in all you have 3 options to use, that is if you're hired on to amazon. I worked in the afe department. There was a lot of favoritism going on and probably still is. If you get on the managers bad side(PA's or AM's) they will put you on a function that you dont like or make you do the same function you did the day before. The general functions at afe are Packing, Rebinning, Inducting. A step ahead of those functions are Problem solving, PG, Slam operator, JackPot. The schedule is 4-10hour days. Rebinning and inducting are probably the most boring type of work you can imagine. Rebinning you are literally pressing a button all day and time gos by so slow, same thing with inducting. You just place a item in a tote , then the rebinners get that item and press a button and then the packer packs it. So try to imagine you pressing a button for 10 hours , and stepping on concrete day in day out, then going back in the next day and doing it all over again. It kind of felt like the twilight Zone. The problem is that there is not enough rotation with everyone to get switched to a different function, therefore people get tired of rebinning/inducting, and meanwhile the same people get to pack and have it some what easier so to say. Packing is somewhat fun, because you can talk and work to the people next to you while you still hit rate."
bad,"Typical day is come in, they have stand up meetings where they discuss what the day entails. You have to do these exercises before you start work. There is a screen or list that tells you where to go. I learned Amazon is not a company you  see as a career. They find any and everything to fired you about. Their intentions is not to keep people for a long time. Unless you are in upper management or HR. They hire anybody..so be prepare to deal with all types of people. The hardest part about the job is having to pick items. You are walking for long periods of times and they make you go everywhere to pick the items. The items are not easy to find. you find a location and you have to dig through all this stuff to find it. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people and developing friendships. I love the fact they give you great benefits.  If you need a job, go for it. there is no interview process. All you do is show up and take your drug test and if you pass the background check and drug screening you basically have the job. Just don't think you will be there after 2 years. You will be miserable."
bad,good place to work but target are set to high and not a good place to work managers are always on your back............................................
bad,Very physically and mental demanding. Working overnight left no time for family life. The work was not hard but picking and packing is very physically demanding. Plus equipment malfunction often leading to low rating which mean write ups.
bad,"Management wasn't that bad, although they were unfair at times. There was also some favoritism, certain employees didn't have to work as hard. I learned about the functions of a warehouse. Sometimes it was difficult to make rate and I enjoyed some of the people I worked with."
bad,Amazon was my first job. It was a good experience but there was a lot of politics in my team. Get used to people leaving all the time.
bad,the company had a very good reputation but the don't treat their employees fairly they put a big pursuer on each person and in the end of the day you see everyone is totally exhausted.
bad,walked around picking items and sending down the line. thats pretty much all i did for 10 hours a day 4 days a week. everything else was great.
bad,"I just think its long hours, and also you discriminate against people with DBS records. which I think is very unfair & as for people that work with the company are very rude, they all talk in non English which is unfair to the rest of the people."
bad,"Constant major changes with very little communication, average work week off peak for a manager is 55 hrs,  peak average work week for a manager is 65 hrs or more.  Overtime constantly being called with little to no notice.  You will be required to be tied to your email even on your days off.  Shifts require weekend work sunday - Wednesday or Wednesday thur Saturday are the shifts.  4 x 10 hr schedule will in most cases be 4 x 12hrs and when overtime is called will go to 5 x 10hrs or 6 x 10 hrs"
bad,The company just cares about money and not too much the employees. Their greatest concern is rate and if you do not hit rate you will get written up. Majority of the time you do not get acknowledged about your hard work until after the fact.
bad,"Many will tell you how difficult the jobs are or complain about the high level of security. They will gripe about the ridged structure and mandatory over time. I would submit that anyone who takes this angle just isn't cut out for hard work of this nature. That's not to say that they can't work hard, just not in this particular environment. The real problem is that the company does not care about its employees at all and will even take advantage of, abuse and discard them."
bad,"But shortly after getting hired, upper management was replaced with a cutthroat group of managers. As we were told in a meeting: ""If Data Center Technicians were smart they wouldn't be working in a data center"" among other disrespectful gems."
bad,Typically i work at day time. I leaned how inter-act to other raise people and safety in work. The manage is quite ok. My co-workers is niece and with have coordition with other.The hardest parts of may job is there you always sweating lifting heavy weith. The most enjoyble is during my 2 days off.
bad,"It should be no surprise that as a ground-level position in a warehouse, the tasks are very physically demanding and opportunities for advancement are miniscule to non-existent. Expect constant mandatory overtime and a rigid, impersonal workplace structure."
bad,"First, the benefits packages are incredible and quite affordable. That's pretty well where it stops. Unless you are a people person and can find something to talk about with everyone, you will be bored out of your mind. I rather prefer a little more than scan, count, scan, repeat. You can move up only if you know a much better way to brown nose than I did. There will be people there that care about the way you work, but they typically have little influence over the ""powers that be"" so they won't be able to put in a good word for you. Hardest part of the job is to get anyone to notice you in the first place in order to do some of the more exciting jobs in the building. The culture is only enjoyable due to some of the good people around you. I will say I was lucky and worked under a highly competent manager who actually gave a d*** about her employees. Last but not least, and this is merely one of the better buildings in the network, in three years, you get a dollar pay raise!"
bad,The pay is amazing but the work is strenuous and took a major toll on my body. I just couldn't stand the environment of the warehouse type of job or at least this one.
bad,"In the beginning I enjoyed working for Amazon. Until, I quickly realized I would have to dedicate a substantial amount of my time and freedoms to the company and their needs with little say so in matters. The most enjoyable part about working for Amazon was meeting and working with other hard working individuals. Having the ability to uplift co-workers by positively reinforcing them."
bad,Good experience for young adults just graduating from high school and looking for their first job. They teach you to be on time and a little discipline with job functions. Also to manage your own time you accrual each pay check. The importance of not wasting time or money to ensure customer satisfaction everyday.
bad,"No review to tell at this time. I do not respect the management team and I have learned that it takes many years and many broken promises in order to work your way up, that is why I am looking elsewhere."
bad,Twice I have worked here under many different roles. Treated like dirt on times. Break times were horrible due to the lack of time you had and distance to walk to the food hall. The job was do-able but wouldnt work here if i had other options
bad,"At the start of shift we start off with standard & safety work tips. Afterwards, we proceed to do a variety of stretches with a 7 count. When stretches are finished we go to our designated area and begin work. I have learned how to ""pace myself not race myself"". Amazon does preach a lot about quality, but also they want productivity which can easily cause quality errors if you are not careful. The ""hardest"" part of the job? Well there is no hard part unless you make it hard. Life is what you make it & a job is what you make it. I have never had a problem with management simply because i do my job."
bad,"was treated like robots"
bad,"You end up doing maintenance work because there is not enough work in your department.  Maintenance can include crawling on your hands and knees scraping tape off the floors for hours.  If you get done to fast and there is nothing to do you go home,  Some departments are very physical while others are not yet all departments receive the same pay."
bad,Was a great place to work for until the transition took place.
bad,Great job if you like rude management and unorganized atmosphere
bad,"Received product in from freight, able to maintain tack times per product."
bad,I did many things at Amazon and didnt get the credit that I deserved.
bad,Ive learned a lot of experience working with this company. they rotate employee to different job function. the hardest part of the job is during peak time they imposed mandatory 10 hour shift to everyone.
bad,It was a long standing job where you got to work with others at a high pace. Working for rate and maintaining that rate though out the night and keeping it at a study pace. The hardest part is standing a long period of time. All Managers are on the learning curve with the assoicates.
bad,worst thing is 12 hour shifts but you get 4 off days if you decide not to pick up voluntary extra time. very laidback work environment and most people are friendly
bad,"It takes out a lot of energy and determination to withstand the long hours of this job, I was well prepared but the next employee should be prepared mentally and physically"
bad,"C’était un moment difficile dans ma vie donc j’ai pris le poste, mais je n’y Retournerai plus. Nos supérieures son arrogant, aucun respect du personnel."
bad,"There won't necessarily be a training curve, but  in less than 60 days, you will be expected to perform at the same level of those thats been doing the job longer.  If you fail to meet this performance expectation,  you will be coached."
bad,"If you don't have anything going on outside your work life amazon is the job for you, long hours, consistently standing and/or moving around in the condition of the warehouse I wouldn't recommend unless you are fully motivated"
bad,"The pay was decent, but you are constantly monitored, and you aren't allowed to fall below a given productivity rate. Depending on which department you end up in, these rates can be unreasonably high, and you are expected forego bathroom breaks in order to maintain them. The nature of the work is completely mindless and repetitive, so the hours really drag. The result is very dehumanising."
bad,Management was rude and fired for no reason and over all was a good job and they great opportunities and great staff and great work shift and great benefits
bad,Targets are very hard to fulfill and stressful. Too much pushing and the management sits on the heads. Theirs is hire and fire policy. They hire during the peak season from September to January and fire in the month of January.
bad,Good job if u are quick and welll focused. Brings a lot of stress and sometimes u will have some really bad days and bad routes but for the money u get I’d say is worth it
bad,"Try the warehouse in St. Peter’s not the Hazelwood location. "
bad,Unrealistic production goals and always forced to work extra shifts even during the non holiday time periods. The work load on the area managers is unrealistic.
bad,"Amazon do not really care about the people working there. The most important point is to finish all the tasks they assigned to you by the end of the day. Also day can play with your shifts however they want. They gave you a shift and they cancel it one day before just because they do not need you. So you never know how many days you will work for the week. The work is easy and the working hours are not long."
bad,"It was a fun environment, they played uplifting music...but it got very dangerous when lifting heavy packages etc. I was injured twice, I got workers compensation and I healed (it was in the chest cavity)...but my other co-workers were injured in the head, one is still there but has to  endure permanent headaches for life, the other I do not what happened since she left the company."
bad,a work day consist of the same mundane task for 10-12 hours straight. There is very little chance for social interaction. The paycheck is nice however.
bad,Ok place to work. Not enough work/life balance. Too much mandatory overtime. Need better time off accomodations for sick days. Not enough days to recoop. Could definitely use more realistic work standards. Most managers are good.
bad,I loved this company until they used and abused their powers like it always happens but each story is there own. I've seen a lot in my time shared here. I left due to managment changes and that caused the whole building to function differently
bad,"You will meet really cool and caring people but this job is very stressful. I wouldn’t recommend this job unless you really need the money. You will be hurting at the of the day especially at night. We kept changing managers. Bags will be overflowed and stuff will be on the floor because people didn’t want to close their bags. Most of the time if is COLD in the Winter and HOT in the Summer. 90% of the scanning devices don’t work with gloves which is very inconvenient."
bad,"At first the job was great and fun and then management started treating people low and harsh. Fire people just because they can, mean and harsh words."
bad,"I'm very dismayed at the fact that an online advert offered $18 hourly for seasonal peak employment and upon working its actually $15 hourly."
bad,"Not the best place to work, crazy long hours no much flexibility. If your looking for a place that just work work work this is the place for you. Pay is actually good but comes with a lot of work and impossible rates."
bad,"Amazon has terrible management. You will be taken-advantage of daily. HR was never any help. Seasonal employees  who were kept past their seasonal position due dates, were the most who got taken advantage."
bad,"If you want to end up on wheel chair when you are older go and work there, because you are going to weak all your bones and strength and you will never leave the same way you came. You  either leave with back surgery, leg surgery or permanent waist pain problem. You will work long hour without sitting by the end of the shift you will be dragging your leg home. The money is good, but the nature of the work is difficult"
bad,"I learn how to pick and store,I work with people with different background and culture.It was a very challenging job,which make me motivated to work hard."
bad,"You are just a body at Amazon. There is no appreciation for you're hard work and I have never in my life been treated so poorly with such a lack of respect and care for me as a person. Amazon will work their employees as much as legally possible if they will make money. They have no respect for veterans and are dishonest about programs they have for veterans when they do not. I worked there for 4 yrs only because I had to support my kids. By the time I quit , money didn't even matter anymore and was not something that could keep me there any longer."
bad,its all fun and games at first...but then just wait....I got fired after 5 yrs of being there for something that I DID NOT DO!!....I had several witnesses!!!...Supposedly HR did a full investigation...BUT THEY NEGLECTED TO EVEN TALK TO MY WITNESSES
bad,"Working at Amazon can be fun and a little difficult , the fun part about amazon is getting to experience all the different things they have to offer such as  holidays pays, paid time off and you have to chance to the different jobs with in the warehouse . The difficult part about working at amazon is staying away from home and the hours other then that amazon is not that bad ."
bad,"Bad job, They try to get free labor out of you in the mornings. You do not get paid to load your truck. This is just a bad deal. You will not have time to spend with your kids. No set time to get off work either. Please avoid at all cost!!!!!!!"
bad,"They don't tell you what the job is until after you're hired and if you are scared of heights or unfit then this is NOT the job for you. They make everyone get F.I.T. trained and licensed. If you can not drive that mini forklift type of machine, you probably won't work there long. They start off with 40 hours a week then they give out M.O.T. Mandatory Over Time with zero exceptions, if you don't come, you're fired. They are not for people who have families or other obligations. They like to you work and breathe amazon only."
bad,"Great work environment but no greater opportunity to move forward."
bad,The higher up were never happy with anything we did. We broke records and in return they upped the daily goal. so it's best to do the minimum and fly under anyone's radar.
bad,"The work place was unorganized. I as a worker did not know who the managers were. However, I did learn quite a lot and experienced quite a bit. As a seasonal it was not worth the time."
bad,"1. Inequity, unfairness, favoritism, injustice"
bad,"All they care about is getting the packages out. They let some people stand around and talk, but seem to pick on others. They have favorites they give the easy jobs to and no matter how hard you work their friends always get the good jobs. I just go there and do whatever they tell me and go home."
bad,I found the work a a challenge physically but overall the work was mundane and very repetitive. The salary was good. The standards held were held very high overall in terms of work load but I felt that in each specific department the strategy to the work was sloppy at points and there was a lack of interest from managerial positions.
bad,Working for Amazon you learn that management is the biggest issue with the company no matter what department you are working for. Besides that the environment is pretty laid back.
bad,"Other than the pay, Amazon sucks they over work you, managers talk to you like you’re a child(if you let them),no job security, nothing but a bunch of lies, & favoritism. Overall if you’re looking for a career or long term position this is not the place."
bad,Amazon is great at first and the longer you work there you will see that no one cares about your health. There were a few co-workers of mine who were injured and no one would let them leave unless they used there hard earned time.
bad,"Overall, you do your job you are fine. What is horrible is communication, safety is ""#1"" as they keep saying but really isn't. They cheat you on your paycheck. You are allowed to punch in 5 minutes early, but you won't get paid for that. Management sucks at getting things done. If you bring an idea to better the system, they expect you do create it (without pay and off the clock). Also, training is a joke. I used to work hard and stay late, train new people (although not my job to do so) and am I great employee, but I gave up on that. Oh by the way, my doctor wanted me on a 10lb weight restriction for 2 weeks and when I brought them my note, they sent me home and I couldn't work for two days because I couldn't work until my doctor released the restriction. So, against my doctor's orders, I had to have it lifted so I could work and make money! Overall, there are a few pros as well!"
bad,"Fun place sometimes when celebrating successes. Started off good but then things went awry. Less work to do. Moved from department to department each day. Wasn't what was expected. Amazon locations too far out, lots of traffic and challenging to get to.  Not worth the low wages for gas and vehicle mileage."
bad,Worked in the warehouse inbound stow they have high expectations of rates (how fast you are stowing items into the pods). If you do not meet the rate requirements you will be terminated. This is something they do not tell you when you apply. They also give you a mandatory overtime day which they can call you in and you have to come in again something they don’t tell you when you begin pay is decent and benefits are decent as well just make sure to make friends with your water spiders they are the ones who brings you stuff to stow items i and make sure they open boxes for you if they don’t do either things for you it automatically falls on you and you get written up. Discounts ehhhh ... not great my code never worked and he never could help training was very disorganized and no one seemed to know anything had to find out everything on my own
bad,"Work there only as a one to two year job.  "
bad,"The job was okay at first, then, after a while it starts to get annoying. I get it you have to work at least 10 hrs but the hrs are ridiculous and suck.. the team I worked for wouldn’t get you out until late way after the time you’re supposed to start like almost an hr or two after you’re start time then they show up to hand out assignments and even take forever to do that and then wonder why were out there so late. Not only that the pay sucks you have to clock in and out on an app in your phone and if you forget to do that then you’re screwed but you don’t make much anyway after a taxes. Then the people there have extremely nasty attitudes especially the people who call themselves running the team you do meet a couple cool people. Don’t expect to get out of being out past 10 pm unless you have an issue with your route specifically because they don’t care if you have a problem seeing or if you don’t feel safe. Only concerned with if there’s an issue with your route. I mean some may have had a better experience or will have a better experience but."
bad,The pay was 13 a hour for u working 70 hours a week or sumthing like that 12 hour shifts for 5 days straight. My checks were good tho i never had time to spend it being so tired from work i lost 10 pounds working there in 2 months . the breakroom is a 10 min. Walk from ur spot at work and a 15 min break lmao managenment isnt approchable at least on my shift on another they were.
bad,"Employees are treated like machines instead of human beings, breaks are too short and lunches or too short too (30 mins unpaid) Too much un reasonable demands and expectations... Not fun place to work"
bad,There was very little communication between managers and associates and no room to move up in the business and they over work us. I don't recommend working here unless you think your up to the challange.
bad,"Amazon is a great company it’s just bad management and you don’t get a pay raise after working there 1-2 years +. It’s really sad that the so called managers show favoritism, no experience, and more concern about productivity. Warning please stay away from this place unless you really need a job because they pretty much hire anybody."
bad,Overall not enough pay for amount of work and money made for company. Fast paced and rate system that was inconsistent at times with the work load. Bad management
bad,"Working at Amazon used to be such an enjoyable experience, that was before managers (especially in the North American department) felt as though the company belonged to them. Customer service agents are exploited and not treated with the same respect and courtesy that management feels entitled to. Shifts are ridiculous and very inconvenient for mist agents who still would have to use their own transport to commute home, and actually arrive much later than expected AND still be expected to be well rested for a shift. The fact that you do not feel secure in your job due to managers who are autocratic bullies makes working at Amazon a nightmare. I used to really enjoy working there, but not anymore."
bad,"I would not recommend this job unless your extremely in need of money or some benefits. Pay is not even close to worth standing for 10 hours a day. 15 minute breaks are more like 5, since you are on you're break when trying to find a parking spot for your forklift."
bad,They need to treat their employees with respect and not like machines. Many managers feel they are better than others due to their title and barely care about those under them.
bad,"great place to work, but the pay was lousy and not constant. management for the most part was good but had some serious holes. Loved the opportunities that i got, wished it was more rewarding."
bad,ti tengono a lavorare nei picchi lavorativi oppure quando ci sono le ferie poi ti mandano via o ti tengono part time
bad,I worked as hard as I could in a warehouse with no management insight. It felt like torture working as hard as I did to get no recognition. You feel trapped in a dead end job basically.
bad,If you don't mind working 60 hour work weeks and can stand it loud dirty and lonely you might love this. But you are a number to them and they do not care even a little bit. I've been there over a month and four people know my name.
bad,if you can handle the strenuous work and long hours good for you but my depression got so bad after a month working here i could not get out of bed to go to work the next day
bad,"A typical day in Amazon (at that time) is pretty bad and unpleasant due to the repeating tasks,target driven tasks and strict (too strict) "
bad,"It's hard work, and that's fine. But because of the faulty computerized automated system that dictates your employment based on your scanner's activity --there is no job security. The technology is terrible, there are always glitches and serious issues with the scanners and computers and system in general. Just terrible, and it wastes so much time --time you can't afford because of the ""rate"" system where you have to (for example) stow 83 items an hour, or you get written warnings... ""Cherry pickers"" take all the cages full of many small items and leave the ones with just a few big items on them.... making you have to rush harder to hit rate, which causes you to be more likely to mess up... the whole system is BS. They were also telling us to take a 20 minute break for our second break..... Ridiculous."
bad,"The pay is around $15/ hour but the hours can vary.  The minimum they may make you work might be 12 hours a week.  at most with the optimal schedule would be 30 hours a week, but this will only be the christmas season."
bad,Place was stressful paid well but would not work there unless I absolutely had too. Training is paid and it is a simple job to work. Managers micro manage.
bad,The pay is good. Especially holidays but the company tries to downsize for any ridiculous reason once the holiday season is over. The more you struggle to reach goal the more they push to reach a higher number for no reason but to overwork everyone.
bad,Stressful job during prime week but great for making quick and easy money with no prior job experience. Consists of heavy lifting and fast paced working to ensure orders are ready on time.
bad,"12 hour shifts to 15 min. breaks that start while you are on machine and if you have 15 mins. you really have 10 . and a 30min lunch which is really 25 mins . and that it for 12 hours in which you are moving contantly the whole time . its not a easy job ,and they have an amount you have to produce .and if you dont bye by!you are expected to move like a machine."
bad,Literally no job security at this place . They constantly change things to make your job harder . Went from only having to stow 1000 items an error (which was ridiculous enough on its own ) to now 1700 items for JUST ONE error. They continuosly change things to “not lay people off” but to basically force you to lay yourself off . They expect perfectionism and if you can’t provide that you basically put your self in a position of slow but sure termination. Other than the pay this job is trash . NEVER BE A STOWER it’s the easiest position to get fired from and the most stressful/boring . You can literally become depressed form the boredom from this job . Also Too much Voluntary time off to the point where even if you don’t take it you still have to leave work because THERE IS NO WORK to be done . Trash . Can’t believe I stayed here this long .
bad,"Good job. For the amount of work done, the pay was acceptable. Overtime was always presented. Great job at the time but just expected more. Jobs a good place to work, 4 days on 4 days off."
bad,"Make sure you find the right team.  Management is really lacking and nobody is looking out for anyone but themselves.  This makes the work environment unwelcoming, especially since the teams are asked to not interact with one another since they don't want anyone to move to a new team / get ahead in their career"
bad,"Amazon seems to think their employees are robots, they do not care about you, and if you do not meet the rate they like or need they'll fire you, Amazon wants their employees to do intensive labor for 10 hrs and remain at the same exact quick pace."
bad,An ok temporary job.  Mandatory overtime during the holidays doesn't cater to family life.  Employees treated like cogs in a machine.  Little room for advancement.  No full time positions.
bad,"Nice place, kinda stressful at times. Hard to balance regular life with the work schedules and demands. I was hired through a temp agency and worked barely a month before the assignment ended."
bad,Now I make as much in 25 hours at I used to make in 40.  Still I have to move to an income restricted place because that is all I could afford to pay in rent.
bad,"Manager très irrespectueux , manque de respect , mais très bon salaire"
bad,"I was a stower I enjoyed stowing but they had unattainable rates no matter how fast you worked could not make rate because the robots would bring the wrong size pods or ones that were full and would blame the person for going too slow I was fired February 3,2019 for this reason I couldn't please them."
bad,Very tiring especially if you work as a picker. You don't get appreciated no matter how fast you pick your items... Always look for a reason to send you to pick desk to tell you off and never listen to your reasons. Literally they are just looking for the slightest reason to fire people.. Also Breaks are rediculously short. Worst place I've worked at.
bad,I was so excited about working for Amazon until I got in and seen how they really work. People getting written up and fired left and right. They will constantly move you around which affect your rate and will still write you up knowing it was they fault. Or have you do a rate task then put you on indirect work and say oh we writing you up because your rate low well if I'm assigned to indirect work by the mgr most days and here and there I'm packing of course my rate going to be low duh!!! It's nothing personal it is prison like you have no job security what so ever they structured like they want a high turn over rate I don't understand this place at all most companies want people that plan to stay for years they don't care people can walk in from the street if they can pass a drug test and background check you In that's why they don't care. They try to make they self look good with decent starting pay and benefits but that's as far as it Go! Managent is nice but they move around who they want to at the end of the day they have a job to do so they'll  be talking and laughing one min and writing you up the next no one can be trusted. I'm so disappointed in this place I thought I was going to make a career out this place but I see Not! The bad part it's so many people that want to work for Amazon not knowing the job will not last long! Who don't have a family these days people need job security and Amazon is not secure by any means! most people have 2 jobs working here which it allows you to because you only work a 3/4 day schedule which I Love!!!! But heart broken that I have
bad,If one has any physical issue this is not the job for them - I had back spasms while working there - they initially were very helpful but then because nothing I did would alleviate the pain they decided I could not work there any longer.
bad,A very liberal culture. Minorities got away with cheating to make rate. Dishonesty was an issue I had with not just workers but by  mgmt too - they would give boxes of large quantity to Thier friends or favorites. Then you had to make rare with pallets of low quantities or harder work. The nepitsm/ cronyism extended to the lunch breaks too - they caramel back from breaks late and never got written up. Hostile atmosphere esp if they knew you were one complaining.
bad,"Some people were nice to work with, others not so much. Management could improve, sometimes there would be unrealistic expectations from employees. Good benefits"
bad,"not getting treated fairly and not enough time of hours, need more management training and learn how to treat people right give mre heads up on new schedule change."
bad,"I have just recently left my job at Amzon Tilbury. If you're prepared to be treated like a number and meet high demanding targets then this is the job for you. The pay is pretty good, they have recently put it up to £10.50 p/h since November 1st 2018. However, the job is extremely repetitive and you're constantly being reminded if you're falling behind on your targets. The pick rates what you're expected to get are pretty high, and if you keep on failing to meet them you could and will eventually face the sack. The amount of walking you have to do is ridiculous. After all, it is the size of 11 football pitches If you're at the furthest section of the building from the canteen, it can be up to a 5-6 min walk. Then a 5-6 min walk back. Your break times are eaten into because of this, and that's quite a lot considering you only get 30 mins. And if you're 1 minute late back the managers are onto you like a rash. It's not a fantastic working environment, and it's a type of job you can only do short term. I won't be working back at Amazon again."
bad,This job is a good first job kinda thing if you are young fresh out of highschool or in school. Its good temporarily as seasonal for some quick cash. For the longterm or as an older adult looking for a good quality job this is not for you. Its constant fast paced work and all you will hear about are rates. They come to you at least 3 or 4 times during your shift and nag you about the rates and constantly make you feel incompetent. They dont give a bananas hoo ha about you you are just a slave there. Managers are young and the place is like highschool. The worst part of it all is communication. It is so horrible trying to contact someone when you are sick or cant come in. You have to do everything through the site and even then they will try to make it seem like you didnt notify them. They never answer any of the phone numbers they provide. Its very frustrating. Overall it s a physically and mentally draining job that you will grow to hate and despise.
bad,"I wouldnt rave about this job but it does pay well enough for you to continue to come back the next day. My entire first month we worked with no heat. I worked 3rd shift with temperatures going as low as 22 degrees. There is absolutely NO structure in this establishment. They rushed the opening just to get packages moved however, the employees had to deal with HR having hardly any paperwork processed correctly which in turn meant some employees schedules were wrong, some people werent getting paid correctly or at all, and there was no proper training done at all. Most of the people I worked with were just ""winging it"" which caused a lot of production to be messed up. Whenever you'd go to complain to a supervisor most of the time the response they'd give is ""Just try to figure it out"" or ""We're trying"". I think this job is a joke but if it wasnt for the pay I wouldnt bother showing up at all."
bad,You have to work a high speed pace its stressful and to crowded. They expect to much out of you and breaks is not long enough cause you dont get your whole break.
bad,"When working there, if you had any issues physically, like dizziness or soreness, or any sickness, they wouldn't help you. They would basically tell you to suck it up and keep working if you didn't have the time. They don't give you enough time to be able to take more than one day off at a time, considering you only get 3 hours every two weeks. They don't really care about their employees like they should. They don't accept doctor's notes to excuse you from work. Either you work through it and risk hurting yourself or you get fired for not being able to come into work."
bad,"it's ok I guess. Worked long hours, graveyard shift. supervisors were great a lot of motivation. The upper management I never saw. All in all it was an ok place to work."
bad,"until i was working at this job i was told very little about my position. useful information wasn't given during training or orientation.  perhaps this was to hide the simplicity of the task, and to prevent me from rejecting the position until i was working so they could get some use out of me. the job consisted on scanning items and putting them in plastic boxes then put those boxes onto a conveyor. the job was very simple, it was more the way the job was presented than the actual position. the hours were long night shifts of 10 hours for 4 days and some days would be mandatory overtime resulting in working a 60 hour week performing a very simple and boring task."
bad,The management was very poor and practically acted like kings/queens of the warehouses. The pay is alright for when you start out but when they start making you do other people's job for the same pay is when the value of the job diminishes.
bad,Pros:Hours fit well with my daytime job. The time went by quickly and the position goals were easily met. Cons:There was little hope for advancement to a full-time position.
bad,"Working there for over 2 years all I heard “we promote within” but rarely occurred they always hired from outside. They always want you to go faster but to always maintain quality. If you get written up in the area your no good at guess what your staying there. Benifits are great,PTO,Vacation etc but it was just very cut throat"
bad,"pues esta bien dos breaks para comer de media hora "
bad,Great place to work and great culture. Interested managers who cared about their workers. Great learning experience in customer service and skills gained.
bad,The working conditions can be unbearable at times. My workplace had deep holes in the ground and you still had to work around it. The freezer area had some employees slipping and falling. The hours are hard to get at times when they drop. The pay can be increased
bad,"Working at the Amazon sortation center is rough. Once you enter the building you have to leave your human identity behind and honestly pretend you're a piece of machinery incapable of independent thought otherwise the work load is so overwhelming that it induces a panic attack. When there is voluntary time off offered in the middle of a shift, people literally run full speed towards management competing with each other for the chance to leave early because that's how unenjoyable the job is. For the kind of work that it is, the pay should be at least $20 an hour to make the amount of stress it exudes worthwhile."
bad,"Process Guide-"
bad,"Amazon has so much potential as a company, however the way that they treated and the amount of effort demanded out of their employees is absurd, especially for the salary."
bad,"A typical day at work was awful because the facility I was employed at were understaffed, and also a lot of people would call out. So management expected you to work twice or three times your work load and wanted everything completed by 6:30 am. On top of that they had us pick routes for drivers which felt completely unnecessary since the drivers did it their-selves, which caused us to flex up most days. They assign you specific aisles but if you maintained your assigned aisles they expected you to help out others that were lacking, on top of which you had a daily duty to maintain scan rates if you stowed. Overall my experience wasn't the greatest. I would honestly never work here again. The only positive is that they pay weekly."
bad,I was a picker while I was working at the Amazon Warehouse and it was very repetitive. Each day consisted of a lot of walking and reaching daily goals
bad,"When I went in for the job fair I was told that I would get a start date within two weeks. It took TWO MONTHS to be scheduled for orientation. If applying for a fullfiment position keep in mind the shift and available work days will affect how quickly you will recieve a start date. "
bad,Do your job to the best of your ability don't worry about a raise if it comes it comes better to be prepared for a advancement then not prepared when the advancement shows face
bad,"Not great...not enough compensation for cost of living in this area.13.75 is nothing as a start in the Seattle area. No stocks unless employed for 2 years, medical insurance premiums are expensive. Raises are only 25 cents every 6 months. Good luck trying to get promoted. Also, if you get sick, too bad, you only get 2 days of unpaid emergency time off. Paid time off is a joke, only 6 hours of it accrues a month. The job is fast paced and boring; you are by yourself isolated in some jobs. You will get fired for going too slow as a picker or packer. They want you to move one item every 8 seconds and calculate what you're doing down to a T. Really stressful, lots of people just stop showing up."
bad,"Amazon offers many opportunities to promote within, but it is a cut throat environment and you will work egregious hours, including weekends if in Operations. If you are in Operations Management, you will fire people for not processing units fast enough. You will work 14+ hour days (most of which you are standing). It is often unfulfilling unless you have strong senior leadership."
bad,"After working for Amazon for over 10 years I was subjected to quite a bit of change as we grew, along with the culture. "
bad,"Amazon's work-pace requirement combined with their guidelines provides an unfavorable experience for anyone who follows the rules. Trying to maintain the required rate of working, while also following the rules was tough considering the space we had to work with."
bad,I just realized working here wasn’t for me. You stand in one area for ten hours. My management was the only good thing about my job. Pretty good benefits.
bad,"Poor management, not paid enough for the work. The company itself is great the people are great the managers just lack a quality of leader ship. Would not recommend."
bad,"Its a very fast paced job, and a Job is just what it is. i got a chance to travel and work unlimited hours but they expected to much from a associate that all"
bad,"the hardest part of the job was having too many bosses and enough team members"
bad,"starts out good, have to get used to 10 hr work days. after a while it just another job not a career. they promise a lot in the begging and than only disappoint after"
bad,"Not a big deal I guess but 4 hours is four hours. Have contacted the HR dept at least 10 times and I am yet to receive an email back. That's just wrong l. Is it so hard to reply to an email to someone who worked hard to get your holiday shipments out. Maybe not much money to Amazon bit for a single working mother who needs that money to feed their child it is. At least reply and let me know how to collect the 4 hours. It's been 3 months now.  Wow Amazon really"
bad,Good company to work with. Lot of work but you will learn a lot. Especially while working on Amazon Web Services part. You deliver fast but job culture and work life balance is not that great.
bad,"they hire too many people. I ended up being a janitor for thelast 6 weeks working there. it's cool that you can wear basically whatever you want, can have tattoos and piercings. the pay was decent. the 10 hour days are BRUTAL. especially since there wasn't anything for us to do. there is limited lockers"
bad,"i had no social life outside of amazon. I get off, im tired and have to get home to get in bed to get enough sleep for the next day. it's ridiculous. machines broke down constantly yet they expected us to make rate while not having the proper materials to complete our work."
bad,"While managers were friendly and approachable, expected rates are simply too high. It is sometimes impossible to work at the expected rate through no fault of the associate. Associates should not be punished when they are not doing anything wrong and SHOULD NOT be told to shorten their break times in order to be more productive. In addition the starting pay is not high enough, although health insurance and other benefits are better than average."
bad,"This job is easy to learn, the thing is it is long day, long hours, minimal breaks, short lunch, walking and standing is all day. People are nice but the job is long and boring."
bad,"High pace, stressful and sometimes low staffed. The people are who make it fun. The hardest day is making numbers and getting orders out asap. Some individuals on the management team are naive to many of the operations but are still willing to help on occasion."
bad,"never knew who my immediate supervisor was, job was pretty self explanatory, good pay, kind of stressful when trying to make rate, a lot of walking..."
bad,"They work you like crazy, change the rules every other week, change your schedule whenever they want with no regard to your life outside of the job and no job security at all, they will walk you out at anytime and not give you a reason"
bad,the money was good but was 10 hours shift and really hard job too much pressure to the employers they ask always 100%. but after after that i learn how to be safety in a warehouse.
bad,Maintaining a 100% production rate is difficult if you follow all the safety guidelines and procedures. So the only way to keep up is to skip steps and rules in order to keep up. If you are within the bottom of the pack (5%) you tend to stack up production warnings quickly which led to loss of job.
bad,"When you start they only train you for 2 hours and that's it. It was my 3rd week AND I WAS still learning I got fired for making 49% production when I was supposed to be making 50%. Management was so rude. They didn't understand that it's a new job and I'm still trying to learn myself, I was teaching myself and no one helped me."
bad,"It's an okay place to work. Fast money, fast environment. On your feet all day long and only the strong survive. Career choice give the opportunity to excel."
bad,"As a employee at amazon, I did enjoy what I did , in which was packing out merchant dice from various of venders in the distribution center  because I was so good at packing fast and accuracy in a fast pace environment and knowing I was doing my job above and beyond measures."
bad,"Me pusieron en Stow, y di lo mejor de mi para quedarme, no tuve ningún problema con nadie y mantuve una actitud positiva, los leads me hacían llegar que no iba mal,  y yo procuraba subir los ratios , aún así alos 15 días me mandan a casa por falta de productividad, en fin si lo que buscan son robots, seguro que al final lo encuentran. Hay mejores empresas para trabajar."
bad,"Stressful, inappropriate breaks and lunches for an 11 hours day, physically overwhelming, unrealistic goals, management has no clue how to boost or maintain morale, management does not know how to speak to employees. The best part of the job is the benefits and the salary. I would not recommend anyone to ever work in the warehouse for this company."
bad,paid great and had great insurance benefits but management was sexist and management honestly was poor but that was working at the warehouse I was at.
bad,"work is slow and safely rule that seem to be made up on the spot, The place acts like you cant do anything your self and are to stupid to infer want to do or know when something is unsafe"
bad,"If you need steady money for a short period of time, I would recommend. You'll be tired the whole time though, and like any warehouse work, it's not for lazy people"
bad,You are an amazon robot. You get overworked (mandatory overtime pretty much every week.) The people I worked with were fun though. High physical demand on body (coming from a competitive soccer player).
bad,"The job is fun and you are able to work in many areas within the warehouse, but there is one problem, the people who work there are gossipers and some try to mess with you, and even try to start fights.  This is not a good place to work unless you really need the job."
bad,Very Stressful job with long hours. High demand o make rate daily rates. Very dusty environment with poor air conditions. Breaks are very short. The one thing that i like about Amazon is that they allow you to manage your on personal and vacation time through there web site.
bad,"Amazon is second to none when it comes to customer service. They take the ""customer is always right"" to a whole new level. However the managers don't communicate with each other. The work their employees to the bone with no regard for their safety or family life. though they will tell you otherwise. Any good Ideas that you suggest will immediately get laughed out of existence only to be put into action by some one higher up several years later."
bad,"A typical day is 10 hrs. long. Like most places communication is an issue. Also, doesn't promote within, hires managers right out of college. They push for productivity rates. If you hit your hourly rate, they expect you to go above and beyond their set rates."
bad,Boa apresentação domínio de controle de portaria. Registro de entrada e saída de mercadorias e etc.
bad,"Picking is the hardest, very stressful adjustment to body and mind. No music, talking, or anything for 10 hours. A 30 minute lunch and two 10 minute breaks. ALOT of walking, and too much time to think about everything. The pay sounds good, but you have to decide if it's worth the stress. Some people can do it easily, it's not good for my mental health so I'm trying to find something else."
bad,The rates you are expected to maintain are higher than necessary. The breaks are short for a 10hr shift. Management is only worried about rates and not appreciating workers or keeping team moral high.
bad,they work you to the bone would not work there again. the hours are ridiculous especially during the winter months. six day a week ten hour days. staffmangement people get around $13 and the actual employees get around $14
bad,"I would come in and do some group stretches, sign in and start working by scanning items. And that's what I would do for 10 hours, it was a good job and the management was good. But the most enjoyable part was the items, you kind of get to shop the internet while you work. I learned that i prefer dealing directly with customers, and meeting new people. The overall feel from the other workers was unwelcoming."
bad,"Responsible for every single aspect of your shift (productivity, quality, safety, training, associate engagement/motivation/issues, etc). Great soft skill development, lacking in technical skill development. Pay and stock options incredibly attractive, but they make you earn every cent of it."
bad,"This is a great part time job but if you're a man then you will most likely do most of the work."
bad,I love my co-workers and my direct managers.  The problem with the company is the hours.  Long days make it difficult to raise a family.  This is one place that has good benefits.  They work you hard and have high expectations.  Favoritism has hurt the overall moral.  You are expected to do more and more for the same pay.  Pay is not based on performance or drive.  It is difficult to take pride in a company that lets people slack off while others work hard and everyone gets paid the same.
bad,"The benefits are very good, but the over all management lacks the necessary experience for a large company. They make promises about work/life balance that they do not follow through with."
bad,"It seems like a good company at first with great benefits and perks..But Amazaon is all about How fast you are and how much you can produce for them.  They hire you for seasonal and let you go   as soon as the Christmas season is over with no notice of your job ending, This job was by far the hardest physical  job I have ever had.."
bad,"This was a job I had that was seasonal & gave good hours & good pay. Sadly it was only for 6 months, great environment, very professional. Always had a good time working there for the short period I did."
bad,communication is horrible. lots of drama. similar to a highschool. the benefits however are great. only thing i miss. you can work your butt off and still not get recognized for it.
bad,"In ICQA I had to count the objects in a bin, and then another, and then another, for 10 hours or so. It was not fun, I went home and was so tired, mentally and physically. But it paid better then any job I have ever had. If I would have gotten used to it I may have stayed, but I couldn't handle it and had to quit."
bad,"not worth the pay. disrespectful staff, baby fema camp. better off working part time and going to school instead of spending 12 hours of my life in that warehouse"
bad,"Always arrive on time, lots of walking, on your feet for 10 hrs. Worked with all types of people and enjoyed that. Heavy lifting, you had to meet a quota at end of every shift."
bad,Work Less than 20 hours per week just to always be doing the same mindless and tedious task. Even though you get paid a salary of $13 per hour you make less than working 30 hours at a job that pays $10 per hour.
bad,"Becoming a dictatorship, the company allows management to pick and choose people they want fired and lets them make up things to terminate. You get yelled at for using the bathroom and are talked to for almost anything over a minute about why you were ""off-task"""
bad,"The demand a lot with little in the form of compensation.  They care more about the customer than the people that work for them.  Unless that person is a customer.  The job is quick paced with little down time and can be very physically challenging.  If its not being physically challenging then it is being mentally challenging.  Management cares more about production, than the overall moral of its employees.  Minimal room for advancement, with lots of openings available.  Expect soul breaking overtime during ""peak""  With minimal hours during the rest of the year, and or nothing to do for extended periods of time.  The only reason to stay at this job is the benefits, and the co-workers who are going through it all with you."
bad,"it was okay, the hours are sometimes to long with working up to 12 hours a day and they only tell you a day in advance, its literally impossible for some people to work there trying to keep up with rates because if you dont hit it every single day you get written up, the manager i had you didnt see much and if you asked for something it would take him forever to do, before i left the new ops manager was trying to fire people because they were getting written up for going out the wrong door or a piece of paper sitting at someones station."
bad,It was great for a few months to earn some extra cash.  It is a great place to work if you enjoy doing wear house work.  I don't know that much about it except holiday time.
bad,"It""s amageing work place and self directed job"
bad,i am working in your company honestly. this job is very important in our life for ever.so i will working in more energy and very honestly.
bad,I worked at amazon through a tempt service. I liked working for  amazon but you barely have a life working here.  You work long 10 hours and get only 2 breaks  which are 15 minutes and a lunch that's half an hour even though it takes you 5 minutes to get to the break rooms. They get upset if you leave 2 minutes before break which is ridiculous. The shift leaders and PA are not helpful sometimes at all some won't even bother to help. The PA are like high school students who talk bad about people. I had a PA tell people that I wasn't doing my job correctly because I went to go get water... Not only that there's a lot of older adults who need help but don't get the help they need because of stuck of people. The only thing that made me happy is the pay and wonderful people.
bad,The management team at Amazon Fulfillment will fabricate to you about helping you to advance within the company. The job is tiring 10 hours a day on our feet with only 30 minute lunch.
bad,"Help train new hires on the process of their daily operations. A team effort and working with operations."
bad,"taco bell is a place that full of integrity they are more worried about thier money than thier associates health ,"
bad,"Working there was fine, until my car got broken into and stolen. I was not able to receive a locker so I had to keep my phone in my car. They don't compensate you for your stolen goods since it was on property, okay i understand. My car was taken off property and damaged and had stolen goods so I should of received some sort of replacements for my good being stolen. Security was on the job and driving around property and my car was still broken into."
bad,"10 hours standing up, short brakes alot of eastern Europeans and lilttle english spoken among eachother. However good pay and when you overtime pay rate does double. but people get treated unfairly."
bad,It's the people.who they put in charge of the workers . The management  some sort ment center well it's Thier only job that they had like other people.are better fit for.the job title as a manager.  But the point it if u brown nose hire ups then u get the job title u want. Or if ur a favorite with in the sort mentioned center u get promoted.  Like me.and others we speak our mind and they know they can not control us like how they want us to be.
bad,"Shifts are 10 hours long, 11 during peak, and they certainly feel like it. No music is allowed after the security checkpoint, same with electronics, bags,and non-clear bottles. They hire anyone, there is no interview but it's because they work you until you burn out. After being hired in July with over 30 people only 4 of us are still there. Management is very sporadic with different managers coming and going constantly, and their is a lot of political fighting between them. The pay is good and the benefits are phenomenal but it is because Amazon expects you to quit before you really use them. You are given a set of time off that you spend whenever, and however you like, but the instant you run out you're fired."
bad,"Pushed people beyond there limits, not really a one on one job when it comes to training and lack of management. See with me I like to have a interaction with someone that's one of the reasons i choose to like retail because not only do you make people happy you achieve the goal of wanting to make them come back"
bad,Too many rules and regulations. Everyone want to be a manager. Too many chiefs not enough Indians. Not enough work to be done in ten hours of work.
bad,I did enjoy my job at Amazon when I was fully staffed and had resources. But that was only 3 months of the 5 years I worked there. The rest of the time I worked 7 days a week and still did not get all my work done- which I heard about come review season
bad,Meet good people and made good money but the managers is terrible and doesn't care about their workers. I wouldn't go back if life depends on it
bad,"A lot of physical work, a lot of management there don't care about the associate they don't speak when you pass by them meaning a lot of them are not friendly at all I don't see compassion at all. A lot of favoritism there. Only 2 managers I've found out that really cared that's what I experienced since I've been there more than 2 years now. some of Co-workers I have there are cool then there's some not friendly."
bad,"Worked for the company for over 16 years.  The company culture has changed significantly over the last 10 years.  Expectations are no longer realistic and leaders are now lying to save their jobs.  Associates are viewed as machines and are not of interest to the organization.  Yes, you are compensated very nicely, but can you go home and look at yourself in the mirror and know you acted with integrity."
bad,"Let me say right off the bat, this company was AMAZING! gave great benefits and very well put together, I guess my only thing is that the management team was horrible, and they let anyone be a manager. they didn't work with you on balancing out schedules. However they did pay for schooling if you were going into programs that they used for their company."
bad,"12 hour shifts"
bad,I worked at Amazon for 5 years it is a terrible company to work for. They only care about numbers and that is it. I would never recommend to anyone to work there. The benefits are the only good thing there.
bad,"Amazon is very difficult and is not for everybody. The demand for productivity is through the roof but upper management seems not to care for its employees health or well being. Within HR and upper management, you are just another number. The positive is the benefits that entail such hard work."
bad,The work is very easy and repetitive which can be very mentally exhausting. It consists of the same movements and actions all day with long hours.
bad,"Amazon is a place full of super cool people doing a pretty basic job. It's not a hard job, but they ask you do it at an insane pace and are quick to punish you if you can't keep up. There are several ""Voice of the Associate"" or ""VOA"" boards where employees can write feedback to HR about the job experience, needs they have, etc. It can be anything from ""fix the fan in ship dock"" to ""why did they stop selling fruit in the break room?"" Anyway, HR is supposed to follow up on each and every associate's feedback on the board. And the feedback is supposed to be on the board for the whole facility to see. Well every so often we'll have visits from the news, from high schools, whatever, Amazon DOES NOT want anyone else to see the realities of the warehouse, so they remove everything from the VOA boards to keep outsiders from seeing the real thing. They have group meetings twice a day with your team which are called ""stand-ups."" In these stand-ups they go over the goals for the day, how we're performing as a whole, updates in the facility, and then at the end of the 2-5 minute meeting they attempt to get everyone riled up and motivated to go back to the same job they do day in and day out. The hours are LONG. During peak season when you have mandatory overtime you don't see the sun. The sun is not a thing that exists. You start at 6 AM before the sun comes up and you end at 6 PM after the sun sets. You pray for breaks and fight for the roles that let you see natural light every so often. The concrete floors and metal stairs are terrible on your feet. If you're in a direct role and get"
bad,"Typical day: Walk, scan, pick item and repeat."
bad,"Unreliable transport which was provided, where being on time would be affected. Pretty tiring where working as a picker meant I had to bend down and stretch up constantly for around 6 - 10 hours during a shift. Safety hazards weren't well too since a rat ran across my feet, where I could have tripped over it or accidentally ran it over with the cart I was pushing."
bad,"More than 200 parcels in harrow or wembley lot of parking tickets, low salary, 10-12 hours per day.Not recommended at all."
bad,"Management Problem too much, you never know when they will change your rota shift. Timing not good and shift hours missing most of time from payslip"
bad,is an ok place to work benefits are great medical and dental. and got to learn a new piece of P.I.T. the hardest part of my job is trying to remember all the stuff I want to buy when I get home.
bad,"Work is extremely easy, too easy, it gets boring after the first few weeks. Favoritism is part of your daily routine. Monkeys could literally do what I do. Literally. My manager is very cold, uninterested in your issues, and cares only about the bottom line and will use negative reinforcement to get what he wants. I have made some really good friends working there as well as people I can't stand because they're part of the managers favorites line-up and can literally walk around and talk all day and get paid the same/more. 4 day weeks, long days, overtime is only available during peak seasons but VTO (voluntary time off) is a regular thing to some. Money isn't as good as they act like it is, and isn't worth it imo, but it might be to others. IF I had had a different manager or department, I may have liked it besides the fact that it's run by dude-bros. WHEN I leave, I'll still be good friends with the people I meet but I'd never go back. Oh and one more thing, the building is HUGE and they give you 15 minute breaks. Your car/breakroom/smoking areas are roughly 5 min away, so you only get a 5 minute break with a round trip being almost 10 min."
bad,"no review, it's Amazon. Hiring takes place"
bad,"The culture is if you are not happy with your job there are 20 more in line for it and it shows. 13 hour days, contradictions in priorities set by management, some sites have great culture others have very poor culture."
bad,A typical work at amazon consist of standing on your feet for ten hours a day 5 days a week. You are consistently standing in one spot doing the same motion over and over with no interaction with other employers.
bad,"poor management, co-workers were not happy, overall could have been run better. should have more meetings that workers can attend to give their input on what should be done to make things better"
bad,"clock in ,hurry to get to the meeting everyday hear them talk and talk, what I learn that there's other better places to work for its like being in the military in the outbound . management was like being in prison they are always watching you and keeping an eye on everybody. co workers were great .the hardest part of the job was if I work hard production was high and my friends were not they would get wrote up . most enjoyable time was when I didn't go to work"
bad,"Great benefits horrible management. Bad for business short breaks treat associates like trash like they need the company, unorganized."
bad,Inbound recieve I would check all products that came in were not damaged and I did some problem solving to.
bad,"This place have the best hours and benefits, but if you want a life outside of work you might want to reconsider. The overtime is exhausting, and the rules that can help you change on a daily basis. I'm a picker, i scan the customer orders throughout my shift. I make sure the quality is exceptional and that the quantity is correct. The hardest part is the walking for 10 hours, the stairs, bending, etc.. What i love about the job, it's third shift, you meet some pretty good people, and when we have a ton a work, the management try to make it fun."
bad,"Amazon has good benefits,An excellent break room, But thats about it !, You can get wrote up if you use the bathroom too long. When peak season is over, They will toss you around like a rag doll, Have you working for Temps, Move you from extreme cold to a hot area in the middle of the day. High School pay. You have to work alot of overtime just to see a decent check. Talk to you like a Kid and Threaten your job and write you up even if you do a job you wouldn't normally do, even if you do 99%, You need 100 % or your'e wrote up ! Management Sucks, However HR is the Best !"
bad,"Super fast paced crazy, zany. Make tons of money. Managers may be treated like an Army mule."
bad,"Mala compania ambiente laboral estresante"
bad,The hours wasn’t good for my schedule supervisors didn’t help very much pretty far from home didn’t care about the employees the work was very strict but most of the employees sticked together
bad,I did not like the work setting and it was very unprofessional. I would not recommend this company to anyone. the pay was decent that's about it. I hope it has changed now.
bad,It is all about numbers. Everything is quantified and you are expected to hit those numbers. However there are many employee incentives in place to motivate them. Training for advancement is also made available.
bad,"They pay well for unskilled work and they train you pretty well, so you can try, but only if you ok with:  being searched, being called a thief many times on the interview, mandatory 11 hours overtimes 5 days a week if they need it and when they need it, random drug tests, dirty cutlery and cheap food (in all meanings). And most important if you ok with the feeling you are a battery, which will be thrown away when not needed. Do not let them trick you: you hard work won’t be appreciated, so care about your health no matter of circumstances. It is definitely not a worst place to work and not hardest job, but Amazon is cheap inside - there is nothing interesting."
bad,condition de travail un peu déplorable et mal payé
bad,"great pay, decent hours, nice benefits, VTO & VET, convenient location, strenuous work but pay is worth it, seasonal positions are a great way to make quick money for the holidays"
bad,"This location was okay. I didn’t like how the managers were always on you about the simplest stuff."
bad,great for progression but not a long term move. working environment was fun but you have to work unsocial and long hours to earn your wage. enjoyed my experience
bad,I didn't work there to long due to management actions. The hours are not that bad and the pay is well but its also hard to get extra hours when needed.
bad,Un- professional. I was also shorted on my check and mis-handled too many times. very  disappointed in my experience it's more important to have benefits public relations than to hire good people and treat them accordingly.
bad,"Working at the amazon warehouse was not that great, i only liked how i meet funny people and possibly long term friends. i really dont suggest working"
bad,Warehouse operative order picking instructor stock control palletising working within a team working as a team player instructing new members hitting target's .
bad,"I loved my position originally in driver support for amazon! They shut that down and sent us all over to customer service! It’s awful...the customers are so mean, there’s no honest support if you need someone, and the team leaders are so worried about metrics instead of employees that your just a number on a board to them. My husband was active duty military and became chronically ill and they made it almost impossible for me to keep my job due to that. I do love the ease of working from home and the pay was good but ultimately I do better working outside of the home"
bad,Amazon is a well oil machine. It chews you up and spits you out. They work you to the bones. High rates are set for super chickens. Time of tasks are closely monitored. Amazon is great place to buy stuff from but not to work for.
bad,"The job is mind-numbing and extremely boring. You'll feel like a zombie working there. Its every man for himself. You have to take care of yourself or you'll end up getting fired. They always promote working as a team but then again you have to worry about your own quality and productivity. You'll always be in competition with each other. Everyday you come in, expect to be doing the same thing. However, expect the managers to come up with new things to best suite them and make your life harder. You'll get written up for unreasonable things, instead of things that actually matter. If it's something that will make their life easier and you don't comply, be prepared to get written up. Upper management can't seem to project volume. That being said, expect to work overtime, even when it doesn't make any sense. They'll make you come in an hour early or an extra day, just so they can send you home and in doing so, waste your time and gas money. Also, if you plan to work here, don't be so trusting of what management is saying. They will tell you what you want to hear to make you feel better or do whatever they want you to do. They will play mind tricks on you just to get you to work harder. They give you hope only to let you down. So...don't trust management at all! Just remember, everything they do is for the good of the company, customers comes first before the employees. However, they can't seem to remember that without the employees, this company would not exist. They do occasionally throw a ""party"" or give out treats to show their appreciation but most of the time, it is mediocre."
bad,This job personally was not for me. Worse job experience I've had by far and wouldn't recommend unless you really need the money and can't find another job. Others may enjoy it but I don't see how.
bad,"No care for your home life. Pay is good, I got paid every week between $400-$600. No regard for home life they dont allow you to basically work around your home life, there way or the high way"
bad,"Amazon has the best benefits you have ever heard of. Full stop. The pay is competitive for it's industry which is distribution. You are unlikely to work in the cutting edge tech portion of the company. More likely to move boxes from point A to point B. That is not exciting or fulfilling in any way. Amazon is run by the numbers. You will be managed fairly but it will be by the numbers. One day you may find yourself in the parking lot unable to go in. I was told that by a person who described himself as an Amazon Kool-Aid drinker for years. I laughed. Then it happened to me. Check out Charlie Chaplin's silent film ""Modern Times"" It captures the feeling perfectly. Amazon has many good points as an employer. It's not for everybody. Best of Luck."
bad,"I have gone an entire week without a single shift. They are always asking of you want to leave early because they just aren't that busy, or they over hire at Christmas time. Big turnover due to having to work in a 10 below freezer for extended periods of time sometimes. On the other hand most managers are awesome at their job, only one or two weren't that great."
bad,"Company pay was decent, great benefits , long hours and labor they want you to move super fast and reach high Goals and then write you up if if you don’t."
bad,Very physically demanding. Too many hours. Not challenging mentally. I do not recommend if you aren't able to lift heavy or stand on your feet all day on concrete. I have plantar fasciitis now.
bad,Management is not fair.they dont listen equally only in packing supervsors are good.problem solversdont like to listen if there is a problem in their system like scanneri only negative feed backs no encouragement to employes
bad,Terrible work environment the staff were pretty up tight and rude I wouldn’t recommend workin there the pay is great the work is terrible as well definitely think they should pay more
bad,I hated it. They made up new rules everyday. Magement was biased. I honestly hated it. I did make a lot of money though.You couldnt use your phone and could barely talk to others.
bad,Took offer to work from home but needs of business required being onsite in Seattle full-time.  Be wary of an offer for a remote position since it wasn't possible for me.
bad,"Clock in, check my position for my shift, listen to the announcements. If I was on the lanes, I'd grab a scanner, and then I'd go do my job. There were tasks that I did enjoy, such as AR and inbound."
bad,Le rythme de travail est très rapide. Nous ne pouvons pas être à la fois rapide et respecter toutes les règles de sécurité qui sont demandées.
bad,"Very hard working job, pushed to the limits, not a very nice job to be in if im totally honest. The only time you get when your not on your feet is when you go to the toilet or are on your tiny break."
bad,Over worked and underpaid. They do not care about their employees well being. If some ones gets hurt or harass by an another co-work the don't solve the problem
bad,"I have nothing to say about this company."
bad,It’s just really boring it’s a long day of doing the same thing over and over. They pay good money and the benefits are pretty good I would go back if I really needed a job.
bad,They have great benefits and people are friendly. Pay for employees to go to school and after graduation may leave for better position anywhere else. The pay is not too bad comparing with other warehouses
bad,"You have to be in tip top shape mentally and physically to work here  for those of us that have arthritis, it is impossible to meet the rates  all of my managers are sweethearts but they change like I change my underwear  I have had 3 managers and I’ve only been there a month  customers are important but we too are important  Amazon value your employees. We are humans and we aren’t replaceable"
bad,"Man steht 8 std am sotiermaschine, keine Sitzmöglichkeiten"
bad,"Stressful and worked to death. They work you 59 hours a week and your work to life balance is non existent and when you ask to do a different job they say will let you but they have no other positions open, but hire I’m new people to those spots.."
bad,"ambiente competitivo "
bad,meh I didn't really like it at all. It was a very lonely job and it was mind numbing. I think they try to treat their employees good by giving them good benefits but in reality everything the employees do is never good enough.
bad,I hated it the management sucked. It was hot no AC in the building. Favoritism is very easy to see with the favorites getting the jobs they want everyday and everyone else getting the worse jobs. You are seen as a number and nothing more.
bad,A very fast paced work environment. Extremely cliquey. Management had their favourites. Whilst on picking duties I walked an average of 14 miles per shift. I met some nice people whilst working there but the workplace culture was such that it was difficult to get to know them well.
bad,"Very fast paced working environment. It is difficult to get help from colleagues or management during the shift hours when you are new to the job. There is not much effort being put in to making sure new workers know what they are doing, as I was pretty much left to figure out what to do from the second day of working there."
bad,Les tournées sont trop longues et fatigante le salaire n’est pas à sa juste valeur
bad,"I worked 3rd shift at a Sort Center. Turn over rate was incredible (maybe 1 in 10 ppl last more than a couple of weeks).  This job is much more physically demanding than the Fulfillment Centers (I've done both), yet pays less. The associates who work hard have to compensate for the associates who don't (some are on their phones all night).  If you're a worker, management pushes you harder; if you're not, they put you on a easy task to get you out of the way. No merit pay or raises, so work or not, everyone gets paid the same, which leads to much resentment.  All jobs are part-time, no benefits.  Pays just enough ($15 hr) to make it attractive if you're desperate.  Managers are not bad, but their hands are tied by corporate.  Moral is low, stress is high.  Additionally, no air conditioning, so the heat index can soar to over 100 degrees (I witnessed a couple of ppl pass out from heat exhaustion)  Overall oppressive place to work"
bad,The pay was ok but it is physically exhausting. You get a 15 min break for 45 hours of work but technically its 10 min because they count 2.5 min of walking to and from the break room.
bad,"I saw decent because the people who you work with are probably the best part of my experience here... rest is just ridiculously competitive and a lot of packages under a 15minute window for 1-2hour shipping. Also, trying to internally transfer?? FORGET IT, never updates the status of your application through the A2Z app, just always says ""Under review"" and then when time is up on the application it says ""Job was removed""."
bad,the company was a very good company to work for .although the management was very horrific I still managed to get my work done in a orderly fashion I but I needed a job so I managed to make due.
bad,This job expect to get pulled muscles and not a fast accomodation. Long walks and lots of lifting pay is ok for night shift. Make sure to wear closed toed shoes
bad,not much too say other then delivering 200 packages a day and stopping a 130+ times/ one of the worst jobs ive ever worked. horrible work conditions...
bad,It was an ok experience for me. Had the opportunity to move up but i didn't think it was worth it. And I had recently started school IT school@ Mycomputercareer. So I turn down the opportunity to move up.
bad,"150-200+ stops on 10-12 hrs a day?"
bad,troppo lavoro in rapporto allo stipendio percepito.
bad,Uncaring management who do not compensate for extra work done. Zero chances of growth within company because of favoritism. Absolutely zero chance of pay increase whether you worked 2 months or 2 years. This job is a very very short term gig with a high turn around. This type of job is not beneficial for those that need benefits such as health and dental. May only be useful for those looking for extra cash once or twice weekly.
bad,"-Having to make rate (which seems impossible at times)"
bad,"When I first started it didn't seem to bad but the constant competitiveness eventually got to me and began to tire me out. If you don't meet your quota you risk getting written up and at 3 write ups you're fired. You're extremely expendable, which was obvious during hiring since all it took was a drug test and a background check to get hired. I didn't even get an interview. All I did was show up and complete my drug test and I started two weeks from then. The culture is pretty great I guess, although it does seem pretty forced. My manager was probably the best manager I've ever had and the people working there were enthusiastic early on and eventually burned out the same as me. On a set schedule, you get a 2 15 minute breaks, which after accounting for walking time to a break room, gives you 7-10 minutes of actual resting since my workplace was on the opposite side of the building. The same concept applied for lunch as they expected you to clock out at a timeclock near your station and clock in back at that one, even though the nearest break room is a 3-6 minute walk away. They occasionally gave out free amazon clothing and meals on holidays which was nice."
bad,"The pay is nice, too bad everything else sucks. Phone was stolen WHERE THE CAMERAS ARE and nothing happened, now i lost a phone with 0 compensation. Will never work here again especially if they're hiring thieves."
bad,"then maybe consider Amazon. It's a very easy job to get; just show up to the hiring event, give them your info, pass a background check and a drug test, and you're in."
bad,"Overall, Amazon was nothing special. During my tenure with amazon I first started off as stow in inbound for 3 months. Stow was honestly not bad in comparison to the other positions. Stow was a great balance, as the physical labor wasn't too much. It just consisted of pushing a U-Boat or Juice cart full of merchandise to an aisle and stowing these items away. A great balance between walking and standing. I was then transferred with no choice to outbound; Pick. Pick was the opposite of stow. For 10 hours a day you will be a slave to your scanner, as you will follow directions from your scanner on items that need to be picked. As pick be prepared to literally just walk and walk all shift. ""Amazon Pace"" as they call it, 20 feet in five seconds. I felt as in pick you are worked the hardest for the same paycheck as everyone else. BE WARNED if you are a picker."
bad,I usually dread working here. The pay is still not enough for as hard of a worker as I am. It’s definitely not a place to work if you want to be happy
bad,"There are two hour shift availability for work, so there is no flexibility for any additional appointments.  The lunch for only being half an hour is a bit stringent.  Time management is a little bit overkill especially if you have to be at team meetings at a designated time and you really only had 15 minutes to eat.  I have seen coworkers who would work 10-12 hour days and only have enough to eat one out of 3 pieces of their lunches.  "
bad,"I enjoyed my time here."
bad,nepotism and no look at employees with other skills. Very harsh schedules and sometimes mandatory overtime and very less pay. apart from this warnings and complaints but no rewards.Tight fist policies for works.
bad,"Bad management and policy. If someone was injuried we couldn't help. Managers didn't care about the one thing they ""enforce"" safety. Just like any other  Corporation it's all about the numbers."
bad,"Definitely not the best place to work, more like a sweatshop. Wouldn’t recommend the place to anyone. Have to apply through agency and both agencies to apply through are awful."
bad,Got hurt on job still fighting for workman’s comp after 2 years of not working there.you would think they would want to settle soon.  But they still have not.
bad,"Building 2 CRC sucked standing in one spot twisting your back to lift and scan packages sucked, had to walk a mile to the rest rooms, didn’t pay well."
bad,You work your butt off but the managers very seldom say good job.  They only want to talk to you if you mess up.  It is definitely better to be an Amazon employee and not a contracted employee.  The pay and benefits are better.
bad,"Atmosphere in this place was horrible, and everybody looks miserable. You have to work quite fast, sometimes for hours without taking a breath. Also shift- from 1:30am to 10am was destructive."
bad,Amazon is ok but you have to be ok with not being able to PERSONALLY speak to people about problems w/ work or personal issues they really do not care it’s just “as long as you make it to work” type attitude! Which is very unprofessional & unreasonable.
bad,"Productive place to work but need to focus on quality and quantity, pay attention and work hard. Very good benefits and the people you work with are knowledgeable in their jobs."
bad,"If you're over 30 yrs old  you're likely to have a heart attack. This job is for the young and able only and for those who have no responsibility. If you're a single parent it brings in good money, but don't expect to see your kids. Supervisors don't work or help at all, in fact most hand off their responsibilities to more seasoned and experienced workers and make them team leads while they sit and contemplate on their laptops. It happened to me and was never compensated for taking on the extra role."
bad,"worked there two years,eventually placed in a position where my quality errors while performing heavy lifting tasks exceeded the production policy therefore was terminated!"
bad,"You work about 10hrs a day , you don’t make enough money . You are basically a robot. During the month of November to January you can’t miss a single day ; and you work  11 hrs a day 5 to 6 days a week ."
bad,"There was many days when it was no work to do and the supervisor could not find work for some of us. They would tell us to use our paid time off or find work to do. Asking for a broom to sweep at least sometimes was a problem. It was times myself and other coworkers was told to keep stowing when there was no spaces on the shelves to place the items. Amazon did everything they could to make people use their paid time for when it was their fault for not allowing employees to work. Amazon was a 45-minute drive from where I live, so I hated having to drive 45 minutes there to have to drive 45 minutes back within 30 minutes or less being at work because their was too many employees and not enough work."
bad,Mandatory over-time if limit was not met. And if you do not pick at least 1500 worth of things with-in your 10 hours of work a manager will have to speak to you about it. The only good thing was of course the UPT that they pay you out after you leave.
bad,Long days and not a long enough lunch break. Slave drivers and managers seem to play favortism to certain employees. Rude employees more than considerate ones. Lunches get stolen items not safe
bad,"While the floor managers are all great and do a lot of legwork to get tasks done on time, the same cannot really be said for the upper management. At least at my building, processes don't run as smoothly as they could and it hurts the lower levels as it interferes with their ability to do tasks on time. As far a typical day, it either goes really quick or fairly slow, depending on the workflow and what function you're in. Best part of the job is honestly the people."
bad,"The hours are long and hard. The daily work environment is stressful. They talk about quality and safety, but in action, demand speed. If you're not fast enough, they eventually let you go and just hire a bunch more people."
bad,great company but the pay is horrible. They treat you like if your just a number and don't pay for training or anything you do to help the company grow.
bad,"The recruiters do not work for Amazon, they are a 3rd party.  I assume they get paid by each person they bring on board because they will lie to you.  The schedule they had me signed up for was something I couldn't do.  They told me I could change my schedule to anything I needed within 2 days of being hired."
bad,good company work starts around 5am and its fast paced must be on time and be prepared to work  long hours you are replaceable never get to comfortable and a lot of room for advancement
bad,"There is nothing redeemable about this company. I can honestly say I have never worked in such a hostile, patronising and oppressive atmosphere.Even if they paid double the wages I would not go back. However there are some oppurtunities"
bad,"Where do I start?! Management. They are ignorant and positive at best, and arrogant, and uncaring at worst. Their ""performance reviews"" pretty much consist of them telling you your rates, then saying you're trash. Rates! The rates you have to maintain are a bit ridiculous. Robotic speed and quality is expected. If you HAPPEN to make rate, you have to cut corners, and you'll rarely get shared to another department that you're trained in. Though, this is only after increasingly stressing shift, and daily flexibility. The jobs, for the most part, are you standing on a concrete slab for ten hours, with two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch for your only hope to alleviate   the pain that radiates through your body that's brought on by that slab regardless of shoes. You'll leave each day with your feet, knees, back and neck in near crippling pain. They prefer quantity over quality in every department from Inbound Dock, to Pick, Stow, Inspect, Pack, to Outbound Dock. Lastly, the Local HR, and Safety departments are either incompetent, ignorant, or inept. I've personally witnessed this. It takes and act of God to get anything done in this building or company. I'm surprised this building is still under the same management as it was at launch."
bad,"Working for Amazon at first was incredible but as time went on I noticed the many flaws in this business. Factory workers are expendable, replaceable. hours were cut although the pay rate went up, always an issue with time off hours and sick leave."
bad,Good pay alot of hours but bad managment. When you get done with route you are made to help other co workers to finish and had to work 10 hours everyday.
bad,The benefits are amazing. The managers only care about numbers and productivity. The time given to us as pto or upt is not rational and not enough. Overworked.
bad,"Amazon was a straightforward job for the most part. Many of my complaints would be for the very stressful peak season. For a couple months, you would work 12 hours a day for 5 days in a row. Within a warehouse setting, this can be extremely draining. I also felt management did not care about the employees very much at all. On the other hand, you would accrue paid and unpaid time off that you could use at any time, as well as health insurance and similar benefits."
bad,Bonne ambiance entre jeunes et nous pouvons garder le camion
bad,"A decent job for seasonal work. The managerial staf will notice and weed out the hard workers from the lazy individuals. Sadly it isnt like you get paid more, but the work you do will be noticed and the better employees will be picked first for better jobs"
bad,Work can be challenging at times but company has good benefits. A lot of walking (up to 22 miles) daily if in picking department. Shift accommodations if needed
bad,"It is good for 2-3 months for get extra money before Christmas, there is a lot of overtime hours. But after 2 months of that work you body is saying stop..."
bad,"Management was okay, but the employees they had is part of ther reason why I left. Other than being pregnant there would be so many people just not doing their jobs."
bad,"My typical day at Amazon consisted of me picking up trash and resetting the floor. The only thing I learned at Amazon was the importance of safety at a job. The workplace culture was hostile at times, even coming from the managers."
bad,"There’s numerous of employees so if one minds their business it’ll be a decent placement to work. There is too much favoritism so if one wants to advance in a position you can’t. Also one has to stand up the whole 10 hr shift, 30 min unpaid lunch two 15 min break. They give you unpaid time, paid time and  vacation so use your time wisely."
bad,"Working for Amazon can be very tiring it wears the body down you are jumping in & out of the van anywhere from 130 - 180 times everyday. You have no time to rest & reenergize your body, you work in all types of weather conditions. A lot of people have invisible fences now so you have to be careful of not running into someone's dog. The pay is good for in Ohio but the request of deliveries are crazy with a 30min lunch & 2 15min breaks that you more then likely will not take so you can finish your routes. It's 10hr shifts with 3days off & you get no benefits. I'm not going to lie it's a stressful job if u are looking for a laid back job this is not the job for you!"
bad,"Things change very fast and you need to adapt to change quite well."
bad,"really depends on your manager,it can be a great fun place to work but there has been a lot of staff cuts over the last few years and can be a stressful job depending on your role in store. on the plus side if your good at your job they like you to progress but you can be waiting a while for the position to become available"
bad,"Very hard job at Amazon. 10 hours long standing with only 2 breaks each 30 minutes. work so hard, complete target every time but they want more and more without appreciation."
bad,I actually liked to work there. But management and work conditions were awful. They are so quick to replace you instead of help you. Also they have fired people while they were on medical leave.
bad,It was ok until I couldn't get my 6 months raise after my maternity leave and I got terminated when I passed out on the shipping dock. It's a good job that started paying more after they terminated me
bad,"You were given a task and a very high goal to reach. At times it was not taken into consideration the amount of time it would take to get to one area to another, team lifts and obstacles that you encountered trying to reach a goal. The management was great, but could be very cliquey. You were not always given a fair chance if the managers knew another associate better or longer than you."
bad,"-mauvaise organisation du personnel "
bad,"Amazon doesn't pay for lunch time and long hours of work that is very repetitive. Doesn't pay enough for living, and taxes plus benefits take most of the paychecks."
bad,"Having worked here for a while, I've come to find that it's (as most places are) not what you know. But who you know. There is favouritism happening all the time. "
bad,Good company high demands.  Good people.  Very smart and talented work force with good attitudes.  Most leaders are fair and balanced.  Some will place unreasonable demands
bad,"-Very Competitive"
bad,"A typical day at amazon was stressful and exhausting, would not recommend to anybody. I was never excited about going to work. Also they do not give you a decent amount of pto and vacation time."
bad,"I felt like I was joining a cult. No one there seemed to realized how poorly they were being treated. Everything you do is tracked... Everything. You are told that you can stop working to stretch, drink some water, or go to the bathroom. But the clock that is tracking your progress continues no matter what you're doing. They toss around the 'fired' word a lot. Anecdotal stories of people being fired for dropping something under a powered down conveyor belt and picking it up without having a tech pick it up. You will work  hard from the time you clock on until the time you clock off. There is zero downtime. Turnover is so high there that my manager had only been there for a couple of years. You will not feel trusted, you will not feel respected, and you will not feel like your job is secure."
bad,It was extremely fast paced and hard. They dinged you for not meeting goals even as a new hire. Breaks were only 15 minutes and restrooms were a good 5 minute walk away from work area.
bad,very hard and managers are horrible they treat you like an animal and honestly to them you are just a number. I was there busting my but off and it never got recognized
bad,peak season is known to make a few people pass out You may be stuck working one position when you're told that you'll work various positions. Benefits are great. When I work at amazon I got paid 12 an hr not 15 (sad face)
bad,During normal days you would be there for a two hours shift maybe less. During holiday season they keep trying to let some people leave using VTO (voluntarily time off) and have the few remaining complete the job. Packages everywhere on the floor and on the belts. No one follow the roasters.
bad,"They pay under what I think you should get paid there, also it is a very demanding job. They expect you have certain perimeters met, but when you bring up examples holding your area back, they tell you to just figure it out."
bad,"Amazon is the worst, they make you work long hours sometime filling multiple positions since people leave constantly.  Went in to work everyday wondering what kind of wreck I would be walking into."
bad,"Very bad organisation, they give you a lot to work, they push you to your limits and they count every single mistake, if you are struggling they wont help unless you complain but then you will be seen badly, a lot of stress, many tasks to do, human exploatation"
bad,"this company has a constant flow of work available, and some times this flow of work can backlog for up to several days at a time, this can be frustrating knowing that others around me are not pulling their weight"
bad,"I did not enjoy management. The amount of work we were doing to how much we got paid wasn't enough. Too much drama, it was like high school because they hired anyone."
bad,I was only allowed to work part time hours. They have a flex system. This is not good because you never know how many hours of work you will have each day.
bad,"Overall, the company as a whole is solid. They have a good system in place for getting the job done, but they go about taking care of their employees (at warehouse specific locations) in a less than favorable manner. For instance, you get two thirty minute breaks in a ten hour day. These breaks, however generally do not account for the amount of time one needs to take to move from their position to the designated break areas, stop at their lockers to retrieve the items they need (as next to nothing is allowed on the warehouse floor past the security checkpoint, especially phones), get/retrieve/heat up their lunch, and return to their work station. The pace is extremely fast, and if you can keep up, that's excellent. If you are even the slightest shy of the metrics, even if you are a new hire, it will be drilled into you  until you meet the metric."
bad,"A typical day at amazon consist of coming in going straight to  meeting which consist of management informing us what's the volume for the day. then we would all stretch prior to working at our assign area. the work itself is easy but, its high demanding having to maintain a high scan rate for your entire shift,which is the hardest part of the job for me. the workplace culture was great I personally worked with awesome people. the company implemented games and prizes to make the work enjoyable."
bad,"Expected to deliver 210+ stops (300+packages) in 9 hours."
bad,"I can only speak to my department, the job requirements were vague, with no tools needed to be successful. Unfriendly work environment an communication."
bad,"A typical day was fast paced. However, when the holiday season was rolling in and I was expecting to work a full shift for my regular schedule and the shifts I picked up in the website, I was disappointed that I only got to work two hours or even less. I think it was strange that they continued to hire when we're only working for two or one hours a day in that time period."
bad,Only worked there cause was in school. Really couldn’t find nothing else to fit in my school schedule. I only recommend that job to people if they really just need a job
bad,The job is easy but boring. Managers are not friendly and hard to move up. Job pays well hours are great. Hard to take off incases of emergencies you get only a certain amount of hours to take off.
bad,"High school all over again. Lots of lazy people which requires you to overwork, bad management. I believe its for a temp source of income. Mandatory overtime,"
bad,"Amazon tries really hard to care about customers, but fails a lot when it comes to internal customers.The often brag about how often they want feedback on processes, but when it is given, nothing ever changes."
bad,It was a quick paced environment for others but coming from fast food background it wasn't as fast. Overall it was an easy part time job with decent pay.
bad,"some are great, others not so much - worked at a few different fcs - really depends on senior management as to how the amazon experience is for a manager"
bad,"It was a temp job and that's how they treat you."
bad,"Be careful who you speak with  and if you speak with someone in management,  please document it,.. who said it and what was said,  the times and date . Do your best at whatever job you do at IND1. I can't speak on the other Amazons."
bad,"Overall a good place to work, fast-paced and sometimes stressful. A very physical job and had to be in good health.The management was limited with her communication skills were lacking."
bad,It was all Buns. 2 and a half hours on your feet just to take a rushed 15 min break. Felt like I was in a sweatshop in Thailand. It was really tough to keep up with the fast-paced environment. Also making rate should not be that important to the point that good workers stress about the security of their jobs.
bad,il y a une mauvaise ambiance de travail et le travail est ennuyant .
bad,"If you have no career experience and are young then yes its like basic training. For others coming from careers they enjoyed unrelated to warehouse work is compares to a work camp or a cult with false promise. A very small percentage move up. I witnessed many angry people that felt trapped by the benefits given, a low wage that requires a second job or group living. That is what corporate greed has given bottom 90 percent. Sad."
bad,"Expect workers to move in fast pace under a certain amount of time. Sometimes when it is break time or lunch, there isn't enough time to walk to the cafeteria, prepare the meals, it down and eat in tie before everyone has to go back to their work station. The break times aren't enough for everyone while they are preparing their lunches, let alone enough microwaves."
bad,Without peak season there is no work the managers and supervisors Are Young they do not have good people skills and they make their environment hard to work in
bad,Didn't like it
bad,"As a middle Manager I was forced into firing good employees as a matter of their ""lowest 10% goes"" rule. The problem was that I am a good people Manager and did not have any under performers on my team. I don't allow for low performance and my teams know that. It was a poor Management philosophy in my oppinion. Employees are taught to compete aggressively just to survive, and this creates all kinds of problems. Upper Management is a survival practice and very political. Abusing employees both personally and professionally is pervasive due to the toxic Management philosophy. They have super high turnover as a result. The statistics show this.Not fun."
bad,"Amazon is a great company to work for as far as pay and benefits.  However they discipline you for things that are sometimes out if your control.  Like if you have done everything you are able to do for a customer but they still respond on your after contact survey that they didn't like your answers."
bad,"Amazon is, in some regards, a great company to work for including: great benefits, good time-off options and pay rate considering the position in question, and a friendly work environment. It's problems occur on the corporate level where there was an obvious progression towards greater work loads with more job responsibilities and heavier restrictions to keep you to their standards. The company as a whole is clearly only concerned with quantity and has no regard for quality of work and the long-term ramifications of such choices."
bad,"Bien, physique mais j’ai beaucoup apprécié le travaille"
bad,"Amazon is very fast paced and you are coached everyday on how to improve your quickness. If you are moving too slow, management will tell you and watch your technique. It is a very lonely job, if you are used to being able to chit-chat with your co-workers. Benefits are great and you will need them, but don't expect HR or on-site Med Services to be sympathetic or empathetic to your pain...and you will be in pain for at least the first month. Amazon is only looking out for Amazon. High turnover rate."
bad,J'ai bien aimee l'ambiance du travail mes le cota est trop elever a mon avis personnel.
bad,It was a good job just wasn't the right hours I was looking for the job was easy I learned how to be a packer it was a good place to work and a friendly environment
bad,It is not a horrible place to work. Good entry level job. There are a lot of positions in several departments that you can choose to explore and grow.
bad,"They work you like a dog. The pay is not worth nearly what is expected of you."
bad,"Repetitious work environment doing the same thing over and over throughout the shift. Great insurance benefits, but low hourly pay. Co-workers are helpful, but not much interaction in this position due to making your nightly production rate."
bad,Too much work and walking have to be on a timer soon as you clock in til you clock back out. Can’t do one thing wrong or they will fire you and find somebody to replace you.
bad,"this is a great company, however you have to get ready to work. my shift is 11/h day and  we work until the end of the shift. your brakes are limited and the management want you to work and work. You do not get much rise on your payment but can work more hours. "
bad,I've worked in a few departments at Amazon and it honestly depends on where you're working.  Some departments are a lot nicer to be in because of work conditions. Some managers do play favorites honestly and it doesn't help with you.
bad,it’s a good work place they have good benefits the managers or good and caring they give you days off and on holidays they provide overtime hours without having to work
bad,"their machine drivers are under trained and their is too much stuff crammed in the racks, things sitting in the floor, and stuff falling out of the racks."
bad,Amazon is an okay job. It a fast paced warehouse job and there are many managers which change every other day. It is a four day work week with three days off.
bad,"Pros: Really smart people, a lot of opportunity for growth, always encouraged to be innovative, think big, and create something new. Competitive salary and benefits with other major tech companies. 100% self motivating work environment. No dress code and 4 legged friends are welcome."
bad,Just keep working hard & don't try to give up try to make the work place fun so you can be more comfortable in your space. It might make you tired but they pay is worth it
bad,Fun place to work and very fast paced and organized. I liked it there I just couldn't work the hours. plus I was going to school every day and working there 3rd shift.
bad,"Long Hours, Competitive Pay, Cut Throat, Seen as a number, No Incentive beyond Personal Work Ethic to Go Above and Beyond in This Job. Management is very inexperienced often hired outside of the company, internal upward movement is often difficult."
bad,"fast paced environment with low pay salary, you get vacation over time, only 48hrs of paid time off and 80hrs max of unpaid time off. if you go negative of (UPT) automatically terminated.."
bad,Wasn't easy work. But the management wasn't that bad at all. We got paid and I enjoyed that. I was a stower and it was a crucial part of the day to day operation.
bad,"Walking every second of the day, except for the short breaks in between the shift. Ran through acouple soles of shoes from the amount of walking in a day."
bad,"I have nothing positive to comment on, other than none of my checks ever bounced."
bad,"Being that Amazon is the highest grossing retailer on line, The should be ashamed of themselves by paying people nothing. They work the mess out of you!"
bad,A typical day was all work no play. I learned a lot about structure. The management was good but they played a lot of favoritism. The culture was strong with a hard work mentality. the most enjoyable part was observing how a company should be ran.
bad,"While working at Amazon I have learned a lot. You definitely have many opportunities to change roles and move around within the company. However, with that you often don't get to specialize or become an expert in one particular field. Instead you have some knowledge in many different fields, which can actually hurt you when looking outside for careers outside of Amazon. "
bad,"Management did not teach you the correct way to do things because one minute they would be smiling in your face telling you ""great job"" and by the end of your shift you get yelled at for ""working too slow""."
bad,"Long hours, Poor work life balnce. Really depends on location. You will love it if you find the right mix for you. You will hate it of you need time for family or personal endeavors."
bad,A typical work day isn't to bad make sure you have a nice pair of walking shoes or running shoes if your the quick pace type trust me you will need them you will be moving around a lot and on your feet most of the shift.
bad,"Working in the warehouse is nothing too complicated. The only problem is that you receive such a small break during shifts, and the micromanagement from multiple people."
bad,"To be frank, I've been to the hospital for severe muscle strains twice since I started working for them. It's incredibly physically destructive and if you are not already a triathlon champion, you're not going to make it."
bad,"Management sets unreachable goals for hourly rate and despite the fact that most people aren't hitting the rate, they refuse to lower it and then write-up employees who don't make it."
bad,"belt stops for 10-15 minutes no product, can't make quota... Was put on stations several times with no scanner or supplies, had to  hunt down manager...loss time, can't make quota..."
bad,"Minimum training for positions PIT is required, a lot of items may be ""Team Lift"" but you're working alone and can't easily find anyone to help for ""Team Lift"""
bad,"If your looking for a temporary assignment then that's the place to be the slogan work hard have fun make history is a joke . Every thing is based on rate , 100%  you don't make rate 3. Times your fired  the work load is never consistent so some days you will make rates and some days you won't an there's your write up to to stressful nothing fun about being stress out on a job."
bad,The pay sucks. They should start employee's at $15 at least. Management and employee's who have been working for amazon help out friends working at amazon with productivity goals.
bad,greatjob great place keep up the good work just keep working go working tjust keep working just keep working keep up work   great fat past keep you moving long workouts
bad,"Refuse to comment.  My opinion is not relevant at this point in time."
bad,"The company has unrealistic expectations of productivity based on their SOPs. No matter how well I did, they always wanted more - I felt like nothing I did would ever be good enough. Not much more than lip service is given to safety. I pointed out two serious hazards & nothing was done about either of them."
bad,"They set the expectations really high on the employees, but don't give them time to learn their job fully. I found the atmosphere to be lonely and tiring."
bad,"The job is quick paced, cut throat and bluntly its just stressful. theres no personal relationship with management if you have problems its hard  to get in touch with the actual person who can solve the problems. its a whole lot of run aorunds."
bad,"Management can be wonderful, or rude. Well same goes for everything there. If you are okay with hard labor, this is a job that fits you. The hardest part of the job, if you work in any place with a rate, is meeting it. STOW IS BAD! Keep away from stow!"
bad,"Typical day we would stretch every morning, hear morning announcements, and go straight to work. The hours were long and a lot of over time, around November it became a nightmare we had to work 12-13 hours a day, it was hard not get hurt when some of the items were broken, heavy, and the work station wasn't the best. We constantly had to wait on boxes, and if we couldn't wait for any boxes we had to run and grab some."
bad,The job is very specific on what they expect from you and how you do it. The area where they keep the bread and other items is so hot that every day you will find melted chocolate
bad,"there are targets to meet, if you don't meet them you are moved to something else. in my experience the management were disrespectful and demeaning. if you are 1 minute longer at the toilet than they would like you to be they make you know so."
bad,horrible shifts the management isn't that good and it feels like your slave. the only good thing about the job is job security but overall not a good place to work
bad,"The harder you work ( Deliver Packages ) the more packages they give you. Without paying you more. So if you speed through your route, the next time you do that route there will be more packages for you to deliver."
bad,"This job is a very hard job , thei make routes with 160 stops . You neet to be on depozit at 7 o'clock but you don't know when you will finish . You have 1 day off per week but you don't know when ."
bad,I didn't like amazon because they work you really hard for not the appropriate amount. I worked there as a temp and I gave it a trial and error to see if I would like it. when I looked at my check I felt like this is not worth it.
bad,etre plus attentif au personnel car des fois le travail n est pas facile
bad,"Amazon moto:"
bad,"nothing special just another job, the management was all about numbers and have no sense of customer service or how to talk to people, young kids on power trips"
bad,"This job is not for everyone. If you want to be stuck inside all day and feel like you are institutionalized this is the job for you!!   When the robotic pods stop, so does our production, they penalize you for going slower, when their pods are the problems. There is no way certain people can keep up with their ridiculous demands, that is why they have a high turn over rate. If you are not as fast as speedy Gonzales they push you out the door, no matter how hard you try. The place is so huge it takes 3 to 4 minutes if you are on top floors to get to break rooms or if you want to go outside on your break. It is a hot place to work.  If you want to push yourself for their demands this is the job for you. But your feet, back, hands will suffer in the long run, which will not be worth it for ANYONE,  for 11.00 per hour starting as a picker."
bad,an extremely intense working environment. created by amazon high demands. physically demanding. short breaks and not very social creating and unpleasant atmosphere.
bad,you get to work right away. you get very little break time. they are very strict with their numbers. you do the same thing for ten hours.i did not like it at all.
bad,"a typical day at work"
bad,amazon is a fast pace place to work.  The standing and walking from place to place all going your shift is hard on your feet and back. I did lean to package items.
bad,"Pay fair, stress level too high. Huge turnover on a daily bases of employees at all levels. Management disconnected from the front line employee. Don't apply here."
bad,I worked in refurb. inspecting items returned to the warehouse. It was 40 hours a day 4 days a week. the manager was helpful and good to work with. thanks
bad,"this is a good place for young, energetic people to start at a fair wage. the work is fast paced and isn't very well suited to older folks. they don't show much respect for their people."
bad,"You are working four different areas, you have to rush to make a 100% every day all day. If you know how to pack, problem solves, or other positions you may do all of them in one day. You do get to learn things like Outlook, skype, Microsoft Office, Excel, spreadsheets, and Analysis while you problem solve. The hardest part is the hard labor of walking, lifting, and constant climbing. I learned how to an analysis of inventory mistakes, cause, and effect, to be a safety coordinator and an ambassador to train all new employees."
bad,"I've been with the company almost 3 years, and never really had a complaint till recently. At first it was a very fun and exciting job, now moral is insanely low and many of my coworkers have been looking for employment elsewhere."
bad,"Fun and exciting place to work, Learnt a lot including how to become a good team player. Learned how to work as a team better, The management was not very good."
bad,"Productive and fun workplace , break rooms and vending machines , work is very easy but you have to stand for long periods of time. Bonuses are a plus friendly environment"
bad,"You had no say on what was done and were constanly worried about rate and time off task, no bathroom breaks and management never helped when asked simple questions."
bad,"On your feet for 10-11 hours straight, with two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch, my feet hurt so much every day, I worked nights and by the time I went to sleep it was already time to go back."
bad,if you like not talking to people and doing the same thing over and over again amazon is for you its really boring wouldn't recommend it if you have other options to choose from.
bad,The job was fun the first few weeks. After that it was terrible during peak time. The rules changed everyday without warning or at least a heads up. I would not recommend working here. Its just the name that makes it sound like a good job when it really is not.
bad,"Assist customers with problems, replacements, refunds.  Listen to a lot of complaints.  Lots of meetings with supervisors.  Team oriented place to work."
bad,Does not care about employees. High turn over rate. Not reasonable at all. Long shifts standing on your feet doing hard manual labor.
bad,"Very unsafe place to work, very faced paced, very body demanding, 50 cent raise every 6 months, opportunity to change departments, scholarships and own class rooms for schooling."
bad,"The job is in a warehouse, which means that the schedule is strict and your output has to be consistent with increasing speed and efficiency as time goes on."
bad,I got the job through a temp agency SMX. They weren't very friendly to their staff and they weren't very reasonable when it came to working together on scheduling.
bad,"The fastest paced warehouse I've ever worked in, and you make no more or less for production speed (Picker/Selector). Pay wasn't the best, but you also weren't lifting large products. Fun, full of culture, but tough hours at the specific location and position I filled. Job security was great and my wife received a promotion a week after being there! (we both worked at the same time)."
bad,"Great pay, but very strict. The commute was farther than I had anticipated and with only one vehicle with my wife and I, it was ultimately why I left Amazon."
bad,"On a typical day I punch in, go to my station and do my work, go on break , come back do more work and then go home. I learned how to operate different machinery. The worst part is the standing and the non social environment. The best part is the pay."
bad,I enjoy the experience I have gained while working here. The environment is very diverse and conducive to getting work done properly and in a timely manner.
bad,There is never a dry eye at this place. Every minute in this warehouse counts so don't use the bathroom and also you might have to skip your break just to try and make rate. You never know when your last day is here. Don't get comfortable.
bad,The company promised Temp to Perm one week after Christmas the let all the temp people go. And hired from outside the company. So basically they lied and only wanted Christmas help. Gave me only one week notice. Very high on safety.
bad,"Didn't like working for amazon, very demanding and horrible to the workers"
bad,"Long night shift"
bad,Need more varitey in hours for job. 10 hours start is a very hard task to maintain and you can't even choose the time either night or day those are your only options
bad,"answer phones, troubleshoot, problem resolution, accounts payable, accounts receivable, human resources assistant, respond to emails, inventory, maintain databases"
bad,"Steady work, fast paced, can be stressful depending on number of associates/customer orders. Day to day doesn't change much. Expected rates (how much product the associate picks/packs per hour) for each associate which can result in disciplinary action, but not much incentive to make the rate. Fellow associates are polite and helpful. Getting trained in PIT is encouraged, but associates sort of get locked in once they have been trained."
bad,"Work a 10-11 hour shift at one station assigned for that day."
bad,the job is not hard but the people can be very rude. breaks are not long and you will get talked to if moving to slow. the management staff is hardly engaging to their associates.
bad,"no matter how its been described, each shift was business as usual, continuous, constant, all about production and numbers, a family/team oriented ???"
bad,"High demand, and high paced. Overall I enjoyed the work experience. But as far management and other things surrounding I would never recommend this job to anyone with these things in consideration."
bad,Expectations are set too high. Not enough support from management. No recognition for accomplishments. Physically and mentally draining.
bad,Overall a decent place to work. You spend 10+ hours a day on your feet. Generous benefits. They tend to hire outside the company for management positions to people that have NO work experience.
bad,Stressful work environment with unfair managers and hours that were unbearable and hr representatives that didn't care about the associates health which required myself to leave after i got injured at work
bad,"Amazon is a great place to make money, the only things that i really had a problem with are the badge issues they had and the pay issues they had. they still owe me money from my last paycheck."
bad,Cruel enviroment but with nice and helpful co workers. It is a hard job where you have to deal with difficult people. The hardest part of the job is that you get payed in base of the NRR.
bad,"I thoroughly enjoyed working with my fellow coworkers. I did feel, however, that the company didn't care too much for their employees and did not give people promotions that deserve them."
bad,i am very ambition about my work.the most enjoyable part of the job is fully enjoy the work .my work experince about this job is good.
bad,I would rather not review this company. Thank you for understanding and respecting my decision at this time. have a great day!.
bad,When you first start at Amazon it is a fun and innovative place. You quickly learn that everything from the New York Times article holds true. Everyday I come to work heavy with anxiety as everyone is given so much to do and not enough time to do it.
bad,"7:00am to 5:00pm"
bad,hardwork is all i can say. its nothing you want to settle for. but the benefits and the pay was worth it. i guess thats why i stayed for so long
bad,to much same bending routine needs to  be more of a change up and management was nice co workers were awful I quit cause of my co workers being rude
bad,"The hours were horrible, the people were not great either. It was a Christmas temp job to earn a little extra money while I was in between jobs. It started of okay but after a few 12 and a half hour night shifts it all because very tedious. It didn't feel like a team effort, people would be offered a free lunch for highest pick rate so people would be racing around on the trollies with no consideration for anybody else."
bad,"Amazon offers excellent benefits. I am however more interested in further developing a career in Higher Education."
bad,"The people there don't care about quality as they do quantity.  They want you to go fast and even though it is almost impossible if you are concerned about quality of what is being put out,, if they had less of a rate they would get a better quality of work from people and there would be less mistakes."
bad,"Pretty easy work environment for most jobs all around"
bad,"Long and slow repetitive days. four ten hour shifts with lots of overtime, but days drag on. Did not feel very appreciated because it is such a huge company."
bad,Typical day is work super hard and make sure all customers get orders in a timely manner. The managers all everybody who works there work super hard. It shows with how successful the company is. IT is a very rewarding job knowing we are so customer centric.
bad,a great company with a lot of different type of products. I would say the hardest part about the job is standing for 10 hours. I enjoed the friendly people
bad,Work was long and very tiresome. Pay is not equal to work that is expected of you. Management was not friendly and very condescending
bad,"Meet at your department and begin assignment . I learned how to strategically pick ,pull ,ship orders.The co workers where a great help to my knowledge of the job.The hardest part of the job was the commute.The best thing was the overtime pay."
bad,"It has its ups and downs, but its nothing I cant handle."
bad,It's still a fairly new facility so management and rules are constantly changing.  Certain favoritism goes on in that facility as well.  The most enjoyable part of the job were my co-workers.  The hardest part was trying to adapt with the rules that were constantly changing because there was very poor communication among management.
bad,"Strong engineering teams, but management at the VP level is rife with politics, infighting and uncertainty in direction"
bad,"Typical day involves vehicle checking before you load up the van with parcels, drive off and deliver. Then arrive back and scan any returns - all within a 10 hour window. Sounds simple enough right?"
bad,here at amazon i worked in the winter while on break for college. I worked long hours through the night packing items for people all over the world.
bad,Working at Amazon is a good experience and it's very fast pace. If you're a person who isn't into working in a environment that has constantly changing situations than that's not the place for you.
bad,"They only worry about there customers. Can care less about their employees. I just kind of enjoyed the pay, they way the people talk to you and treat you is just down right ridiculous."
bad,Doesn't care about your personal or health issues/upper not clear with their instructions or reaching out to employees/fun to work with other co-workers in group chat/manager easy to contact
bad,"As a packer,picker,sorter and problem solver faced different challenges. Learned how to work very fast since every position has a rate to achieve. I always kept a positive attitude on the hardest days."
bad,If all your looking for is a job and don't mind repetitive mindless work. This is the place for you. If you want a career then i would not recommend.
bad,"shifts are extremely long"
bad,"A typical day would be having a co-worker talk about how the days going to go, then do some stretches. Then we would go to a station and build boxes up and then pack single items into that box then tape it up and send it down the line. I learned fast working, team work, and motivation. The hardest part about it was standing for 12 hours for 5 or 6 days straight."
bad,there is nothing bad to really say. The people there really micro manages you on everything. Every fault is your fault. Be careful with everything and in everything that you do
bad,"a typical day is going in, scanning a cart and going to pick 40-120 orders depending on the order. because the place was so big i found it hard to find one specific ""management"" person when needed. the hardest part of the job was keeping up with each order because it is so fast paced. but i enjoyed there was always work to be done, no down time."
bad,Boring workplace that doesn't give you what you signed up for. I asked for 20 hours a week. The first week i got my 20 then they started to send us home early the weeks after. Dishonest.
bad,Drive to work. Find out what route you are on. Sort your parcels. Load the van. Deliver the parcels around Bristol. Drive back to the depot when you have finished your route. Debrief with amazon and hand any undelivered parcels back to them. Have your van searched. Go home.
bad,horrible place. nothing more needs to be said. be prepared to be treated in an inhumane way. i worked there for 4 years. hardest part of the job is working for dishonest people
bad,"If you need a job, amazon will hired anyone that have a diploma or GED.  Amazon also have a high turnover rate.  Lack of opportunities."
bad,this place is miserable. everyone is miserable. pay is ok and benefits are great. makes you feel like your kinda trapped.
bad,The place is massive and you get written up all the time for not running full speed across the place to keep your time off task at a minimum
bad,"siehe erste Bewertung von Amazon"
bad,"Nice to see how a very large warehouse is managed. It is very stressful, very long hours i.e 11.5 per day and breaks are very short and timed to the minute. It's Army style. You have to be physically fit and prepared for being pushed to the limit. Parking is usually far from the building during Christmas time and this adds to your 10-12 mile walk a day. Agency Managers are constantly informing you about your daily target percentage which is always impossible to reach. They are often rude and hard task masters. "
bad,I recently just moved to Florida and this job helped me meet people. But besides that the job is boring and long. Your standing in the same spot for almost 10 hours and you are not getting put in different depmartment unless the other department is short. HR watches you everywhere you go so you cant really do anything.
bad,"The typical work day is smooth. I come in get assigned to my work area, do what I do and if anyone need any assistances / help with anything, I make sure I'm done with what I'm done with the task before I lend a hand. The co-workers are fun an easy to get along with. Getting to know different people and learning them as a person is the most enjoyable part of the day. The hardest is leaving sometimes."
bad,this is a good place to work but dont get to comfortable Amazon for the most part only hire sesonal employees during the holidays and let people go afterwards.
bad,"Tagging"
bad,"a typical work day is 10 hours, work is repetitive and requires long hours of standing. my co workers are the best. Meeting daily goals is the most enjoyable part of the job"
bad,"This job is okay for people out of high school with no family obligations. The work can be very physically demanding. The hours are not always great for families. Finding out less than 24hrs before mandatory overtime can make finding daycare hard. Communication is awful. Unless you are a PA or AM, you know nothing until last minute. Half the time they don't even know what is going on. "
bad,"•	Handling and Moving Objects"
bad,Senior management has a lack of personal engagement for development
bad,"I do not feel if you are a quiet person, that you would be happy in the Amazon.com workplace."
bad,a typical day at work consists of me running the shift smoothly and making sure everything gets complete
bad,The benefits for this company are wonderfull.  There are a lot of chances for overtime.
bad,"Main duties included – The counting/weighing of material for inwards, outwards,"
bad,"Was a very fast paced job in the warehouse, picking items for customs orders. Learned how to use a hand held scanner during my time there and found some of co-workers ok to work with."
bad,"The day is busy, fast enviroment, and team work. I learn how to do my job fast and safely. the job allow you to learn many departments. Managemnt are easy to talk too. The co-worker are good to work like every other job. The harderst part of the job, finish the goal for the day and have VTO. I enjoy learning new departments and work as teams."
bad,Amazon was a good workplace for me they knew what they were doing
bad,"learn on your own, no guidelines or assistance. fast paced work environment without direction. after a few days of work i learned on my own and assisted other employees who did not know what they were doing."
bad,"During the day I pulled customers' orders. It was always very hot in the warehouse and I did a lot of walking, up to 15 miles per day. The managers were helpful and understanding to new employees getting used to working under such conditions and allowed us to take a break when needed."
bad,"estressante"
bad,"I was petriefied after the training sessions. No mercy for employees after 30 days grace. Brow beating, and pestering from management. Use of point system which was a first for me. Extremely hard quotas, the average worker would not make it here!!! Upwards of !%) units an hour. With constant brow beating.... and write ups if you use the restroom 2 times in a day on their time. Restrooms were long distances from my department. Brow beating for communication with fellow employees. Very dangerous, with conveyers,and forklifts everywhere."
bad,The pay and benefits were ok.  The work was boring and repetitive.  Zero opportunity for advancement.
bad,"When I started working hired with SMX, I was excited to work because it was my first actual job. When I got the job I loved keep moving doing hands-on work constantly. I didn't like the fact that we would do the same thing every day, I wanted to learn how to operate a forklift and other cool warehouse work but I couldn't because I was new. So I left this company to go work for CSC Telecom which is a whole new different industry, and heard they pay really well."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is going home earlier than everyone else. That way I do not have to get stuck in the parking lot traffic."
bad,Working at Amazon.com was interesting to say the least. I didnt enjoy the twelve hour shift or working in isolation but i did enjoy the paychecks
bad,"I worked through a staffing agency SMX for Amazon. Most new hires do for 6 months and at the end of contract Amazon has the option to hire you on full time otherwise you would be released. Unfortunately because of this, us contractual employees were treated differently. Management would not respect you because they know anyone is replaceable. There were times I felt like I was being treated like a child. The pay was poor and the days were long working non stop on your feet for 10 hours. The only good things about this job is the experience I gained and the 3 days you get off. I had been offered a full time employment with Amazon but had declined."
bad,"i just stood for 8 hours, very boring didnt enjoy it, also didnt like the schedule."
bad,"Feet hurt when you get home..body aches, long shifts 11-12 hr days"
bad,they are not that nice to work for because you make one mistake and they have a right go at you.
bad,This place is good for a part time or seasonal job. But as a full time job it would be hard to deal with the people and the environment.
bad,Lack of communication is my biggest complaint with the company. We are not updated on issues and changes like we should be to perform our job the best we can
bad,"Go in, stretch and get right to work. Make sure to get straight to work because time off task will get you sent home so if you have too much of it so beware."
bad,They just asking for numbers no matter what. They don’t have organized the items in the bins was a disaster.. that consumed your rate which they all the time asking for.
bad,I did not enjoy working here but the pay is good.If you do not have time to cover you then those are considered grounds for termination even if it is a emergency.
bad,"The pay was good management was nice benefits were obviously a plus."
bad,"I was employed at Amazon Fresh to be exact and worked the overnight shift  I worked as a picker and dockhand. I love my coworkers but the actual job is tedious. If you’re a fan of warehouse jobs this can work but if you’re new it will beat you down. The worst part of the job was working in the freezer, and chilled area for the most of the shift. If you work with the robots or in a non fresh warehouse you can surely make it here."
bad,"Amazon is a very fast paced work environment. It's honestly not that difficult to keep up if you just work. However, it is hard to move up within the company with out 5+ years of experience within, or a completed degree."
bad,"Travail intensif, le salaire ne suit pas le travail fournit"
bad,People dont have respect and its not enough money to get yourself desreapected . A lot of people just work there because of the pay rate and some just to have money for the holidays.
bad,Me personally the company will have better workers if they give them time to learn the system basically if your system is not 100% up to par and you know this then to come down on someone on three days it's not a good idea I talked after 90 days I can understand then if you come down on the employee for not getting a system right but three days it's not a good idea this is a joke
bad,"The company is very misleading from the moment you’re hired there. Lots of confusion during the orientation process. The job itself is easy and people are helpful the best they can be and are nice. But could have better organization. Also, there is more to the overtime during peak season then you are told at hire aside from your mandatory overtime day. Not a terrible place to work but definitely could use improvement."
bad,Amazon was really fun at first but a lot was focused on working you constantly with a camera about six inches from your face at all time which really made me feel unconformable. The lunch break were way too short at only 30 minutes and you only got two of them a day. What got to me eventually was the isolation from the outside world for 12 hours it felt like you were in a bubble.
bad,I originally was hired as an inbound picker. I signed paperwork that said I could drive without being made aware that the job required constant driving all day. I still performed the job to the best of my ability. I was given awards as an inbound picker because of my rate. Then I was switched to stow where I was not meeting rate and given warnings. They were unwilling to work with me to transfer me back to a job that would better suit my skill set. So I chose to give them my two weeks notice and find a job that would.
bad,"It was a good experience till you get a write up every week.  Even then I push hard and yet I still get a write up for getting 98% out of 100% and this was my second month there.  But when I hit up to 110%, I still got write up because of quality.... so they expected me to be fast and accurate with only a 7 second window to pick my item."
bad,"Boring but pays 15.75 when you start"
bad,The on-site mangers are very disorganized and tend to mess up on peoples points because they done always communicate with HR about employees upcoming vacations and call out dates.
bad,Lack of management and leadership. Too many people trying to do it there way and not the Amazon way. The work can be very physical and will wear you down quick. The overtime can become way to much.
bad,The work is very hard on your body. Even after a year of working there you will still go home hurting.  Hardly anyone who works there is happy to be there. At the end of the day its just a pay check. They could make it so much better to work there if they paid you what I think should be a much higher pay based on the work.
bad,Just like any other warehouse job Amazon is a rate-driven company. Workers are reminded constantly at the very least 2 times a day of how good or how bad their performance is and this brings other workers morale down. Processes that can be analyzed and given a rate are prioritized more and management won't recognize that other parts of the work process that they can't give a rate are not as important and gives less staff to work there. Upper management only recognize people that they can quantify the work and not people who do the odd work needed for the operation. Workplace culture is okay most of the workers relate to each other complaints. Hardest part is getting your rate up especially if your of older age and/or after walking for 7/8 hours picking orders. Most enjoyable part of the job is the camaraderie between the workers.
bad,"The money was good for my age at the time and benefits worked out for me , it’s not a hard job , laid back and slow paced . You get a lot of overtime around holidays"
bad,I enjoyed my co-workers and mangers at Amazon however I did not like the management system. And the work was tough some days. Stay hydrated and positive.
bad,"The pay was great, but the hours were brutal. 10 hour shifts with only one 30 minute lunch and two 10 minute breaks. You have to keep up a certain pace of work and if you fall behind and don’t meet that pace you get a warning, which can lead to a write-up if it’s consistent. Not a hard job but definitely stressful and demanding."
bad,"Managers either force you to resign or fire you for nothing. They're biased and never score people the same, you can give a 100% with the greatest attitude and character... but if your manager doesn't like, then they don't"
bad,"The work life in amazon was tough. a lot of walking and decent shifts. management were great and I'd say the most enjoyable part would be depending on what role you have in the industry."
bad,This job is ideal if you are not in school. It pays well and they often take your feedback into consideration however they are incredibly strict with quotas and breaks are very few. Sometimes managers will hold productivity contests and those who are the most productive will get an extra 15 minutes added to their break. This is incredibly unfair and feels as if they use this as an excuse to give their favorite employees a longer break.
bad,"Co-workers were amazing, management was very strict. They were extremely strict with how we use our breaks. Asking to use the bathroom was hard. Always had to keep a rate of over 100 every hour."
bad,"The work was very demanding, needing to improve and meet bigger and bigger targets week by week, this depended on items given which was not random, some employees who gave items to store for the stock workers were given small items like a box of CD albums which is very easy to store while others were given heavy boxes to store, both big and small products were expected to store items at one speed which was around 11 seconds per product throughout the the entire shift."
bad,"The location is fairly new but it still does not excuse the fact that the managers lack respect, knowledge, proper management skills & communication. So far, it has been a major headache. The work load varies every day & so does their daily ideas of how to make the work place smoother on their process to relay information & get the drivers out on the road in a timely manner. The major things that corporate should focus on ends up being the least of their worries but the most worries for the drivers. Between constantly terminating employees & employees quitting, I'm not sure which is a higher rate. Their isn't enough help where it should be & it makes the work 10x harder for the drivers & others who then have to double up on tasks to be completed. The routes should already be ready to go by the time drivers arrive. However, they tend to not be ready which causes a delay. They should hire more warehouse workers. The vans should be cleaned out. Last but not least, the employees should not have to park their own personal vehicle at another location in which it seems Amazon is not responsible for and then have to transport the vans assigned to them from there back to the warehouse to pick up their routes. The vans honestly should be pre-loaded to better help the drivers on a timely delivery without there being issues. The Amazon A to Z App should be updated. There are (2) 15 minute breaks that you take whenever, IF you can & also a 30 minute break. I been with Amazon more than 90 days and still have yet to receive dental & vision insurance. I do however, have Medical insurance &"
bad,Working 10 hours a day and making sure you reach your goal is a stressful work for some of the associates. They think it's unfair. They should change.
bad,"Exceptionally fast past work environment. Expected to work at almost a run. They do a lot of good things for their employees, meals on occasion, lots of free hats, shirts and other swag."
bad,No one really had controll over anything. Workers always complaining. Hours werent matching. Lunches werent correct.. Always blaming drivers with craxy situations
bad,The management and staff are very friendly but the work is way too demanding. They base you're work rate on other employees so even if you're making the expected rate you can still be fired.
bad,"A typical day at work would be attending a team meeting where Amazon team leads go through one of their safety tips and let everyone know what volume of work we would be doing that day.  After that it's just a case of pushing a trolley around, picking items, placing them in tots and sending them down a conveyor. "
bad,"Not enough hours to go around. no real job security, unless you work higher managment, every move you make is micromanaged (you'll get questioned why did you take 2 extra min to so and so), if you are ok working in a robotic manner, then you'll be fine. on the up side, Amazon is a very laid back, chill environment. perfect for students. Mostly anybody can start working at amazon."
bad,"All jobs at Amazon are easy and anyone can do them. But they become repetitive and boring. And very physically demanding. If you’re sick and can’t perform well, some managers will try their best to accommodate you but other than that, they don’t care. Amcare (their medical center) can only do so much and even then, they tell you to use your time and go home. This company only cares about numbers and rate. And they write you up for nonsense—even if you were their best worker. They raise rates just because of the 1 or 2 people who can hit frequently high numbers, not considering that everyone doesn’t have the ability to do so. And while you do get PTO and vacation, you don’t get much. It’s easy to use all your time and get fired."
bad,"If you get a job over at Amazon Warehouses, be strong e determined. The hours are long and grueling, it is very loud thanks to the machinery (at least in my warehouse) and expect to work 59 hour a week for at least three months out of the year because of peak demands. It can be very physically exhausting and if you have a hard time with your position, try to last your probation period and switch places because if you get four write ups in a 90 day period or 6 in  year, you will be terminated. You might have really good quality, meaning you don't make mistakes, but if you don't make rate, which can be a confusing system, you will get written up. It can be a very rewarding job is you are able to stick to it, but many leave or are terminated at about 6 months. Try to stay to it if you can"
bad,"its an okay company. honestly, it just depends on who your area manger is and what department youre working at. over all, great place. however, HR people are rude and AMCare people are rude as well."
bad,"I guess amazon is a ok place to work . ive been there twice. The money & benefits are great. I just choose to find something more consistant because at any given time you can be vtoed.....meaning they can give u time off. For lack of work which means your hours can be cut short or u can find some light industrial work to do. Like peel tape off of the floor, or put new tape down ....your choice."
bad,"I wouldn't go back to Amazon as an employer strictly due to management. on the positive side, they have great benefits, 401k plans, stocks and the pay is good especially during peek season. The holidays are the busiest and it pays more when you work overtime."
bad,Amazon is good company  I worked in this company 45 days and I very thankful to Amazon I just that job like a  part time and I get my salary on time. Thank you
bad,i was hired on a contract basis and during my contract period i had given innovative ideas but management wasn't transparent with me . They said no to my idea but internally worked on my idea and implemented without giving me credit . Hence there is no transparency ; internal politics is so much that u dont even get to know whats going behind you . And coming to my contract to full time conversion no opportunity was given to me and no reason was given . No job security so work in Amazon untill ur manager want you to be in the company .
bad,"The work was stressful and physically demanding.  Repeated motions of up and down the ladder for eight to ten hours, along with the repeating motions of scanning items.  Made the joints, feet, and back ache very much."
bad,Amazon is stressful on both your mind and body. The pay is not enough to deal with the back and feet pain of working there. The work days are long and the breaks are short.
bad,noone can make a LIVING there warehouse opened it took distribution  RTP when the Richmond distribution opened.  Who can make a home with 20 hours a week?
bad,"Very stressful environment with close quarters in certain parts while they often times pushed the body to it's limits at times. Management almost never seemed to be around, but they were there when you need them."
bad,The days dragged and some of the conveyor lines wouldn't function properly but you would have to deal with it and try to make your quota even when you told them it wasn't working correctly. Some people were actually fun to work with if you got placed together during peak seasons. The days probably wouldn't drag if you could listen to your music of your phone or some kind of portable device but phones and any other electronics are not allowed. Parts of the week were with one Area Manager which was good but the other parts was with another which was not so good.
bad,Good place to work but poor management and if you get hurt your told its your fault they go after you...when you go ask for help they turn on you and was not willing to help..
bad,A very demanding and competitive atmosphere that may work for some people but will wear very quickly on others. If you plan on working in a fulfillment center be ready to be constantly compared against your peers. This leads to high turnover and low worker morale among the lower level employees. I recommend the job to military type people who are not worried about firing people and holding their feet to the fire.
bad,Long hours hard shifts and high pressure job with management that are hard on staff for not working even harder even though some people are at their limits. A very difficult job for people with bad legs and struggle with heavy lifting.
bad,it was ok it just that the Ruskin location don't really care much about the employee and it very humid long hours and mandatory overtime most of the time
bad,manager daved  was away trying to get people to do stuff for him that was above my pay grade  and always wanted me to do extra stuffthat was not in my job description
bad,"The benefits of the job are fantastic.  However, doing the exact same thing over and over each day can make one feel...well, like a robot.  You can ask to do other things, like fluid load.  However, if you want to do something that isn't as physically taxing, they typically won't allow it if your stowing rates aren't fast enough.  Plus the building itself is two million square feet.  Getting to the break areas fast enough during a 30 minute break can feel less than ideal if you're not for power walking.  I was getting in shape at first, but then started having physical problems.  Also, MOT.  Mandatory Overtime.  I get why it was necessary, but working 50 hours a week (five 10-hour shifts each week) non-stop for months was an issue for a lot of people when they were initially promised to work 4 days out of the week.  We only get a limited amount of unpaid time off, which is understandable, but if you're one minute late for your shift, they take an hour off your UPT.  You can fix it by using your PTO (paid time off), but still think it's unfair to take a whole hour for a minute."
bad,As a picker your job is to stand in one spot for 10 hours and grab things off of moving robotic shelves as quickly as you can. I initially found it fun but that wore off in a couple months.
bad,"Everything was fine about the job, the pay, the work, but the how much Amazon tries to automatize their interactions with you left me in a perpetual limbo of being fired and rehired by them, with a lack of communication from any actual human, until i had enough and took the termination."
bad,Want you to work to much for 10.50 around the holiday it can be unorganized at times but overall experience was pretty nice for my first time working there
bad,"The pay and benefits make it an ideal place for those with minimal qualifications to find a job fast, and there is a combination of a rigid schedule and plenty of opportunities for time off. However, in the end, it's very much an ""it's a job"" kind of job"
bad,"So after clocking in, you are to report to your departments stand up area to receive the latest department info and business production needs for the day and entire week. What station you will be working at, and/or your assignment for the day. Then you go to your station and pick or count for the next 10 hours. The 10 hours are broken down into 4 quarters. You get 3 breaks two 15 minutes and a 30 minute lunch. I've learned that the only thing that matters with this company is PRODUCTION! Moving up isn't that easy. Management in my experience wasn't ever really a problem. "
bad,"at the time management was terrible and disorganized, they would make inconvenient for many employees who were set to leave at a scheduled time, causing them to stay longer. they had many superfluous rules, such walking in a certain line to avoid slow moving forklifts that barely ever moved. when many of the packages were placed the conveyer at once it we would pause that department line, we were told to use a skinny fragile stick to (avoid our hands getting caught in the conveyer belt) despite the belt moved incredibly slow and the stick being so weak against a large amount of heavy boxes.. a few times i had to complain request help from management who spent most of their time standing around."
bad,"Everyone works hard and makes the company THE top priority in their lives. The hours are long, with different challenges every day that push you. You learn a lot working here. 6 months with the company and you are considered a veteran. The growth potential is tremendous if you sacrifice your personal/social life."
bad,"My experience working at Amazon was good. Your on your feet a lot and the work hours are a lot. Standing and walking for 10hrs are really hard to deal with but the work environment is fun and enjoyable. I learned how important it is to be very accurate and detail oriented when doing something very important for the records of the facility. Would I back to work there? Most definitely. You learn, meet new people, have fun and most importantly gain confidence that your can do anything you put your mind to."
bad,"Its Gets tiring and Boring"
bad,I would not work for Amazon in Milwaukee ever again. The supervisors are inexperienced. Some of the other employees are very lazy and work very slow. They dont close out totes when they are full. Just keep stuffing packages and putting little packages in overflow racks. It was a was very stressful job for the simple fact that no action was being taken by management. They just keep giving the slackers warnings and never a write up. Thats why the employees do what they want because they know disciplinary action will not be taken. Which caused alot of good employees to leave such as myself. For the simple fact that we worked so hard why people get by doing nothing most of the day.
bad,Liked my job there if only they allowed to you to move around within the company and learn different jobs i might still be with them.
bad,"HR was absolutely the worst. They were never available when you needed them. They would suspend you without saying why. When you tried to reach them on days off they would tell you they would call right back, they call about a week later. Managers were cool. All associates were like a giant family. We knew we would always have someone to talk to."
bad,To many rule changes with no communication. Favoritism between dayshift and night shift. Not enough manager experience with technicians.
bad,i would not advice anybody to work at this wear house they do not care about the well being of their employees working at this job wasn't at all a great experiance
bad,Long periods of standing in same place. Stand at your own station until its time to go. All about number and have to meet rate every day. No life. Late hours to work sometimes mandatory over time.
bad,"cool work place"
bad,"working at amazon was efficient and structured. time managed"
bad,It was a very difficult job which ordered you to be very active and fit and on your feet all the time. But the pay was good and you got to make new friends who worked with you.
bad,"10 Hour shifts/4 days a week with 1/10hour OT day gets to you after a while.  The pay is not benefitial to what a person can find in their local area.  The work and the people take a toll on the menal stability of the worker and eventually make one bitter.  The people at amazon are friendly but are there because they ""have to be""not because they want to be.  Amazon looks out for amazon and the customer, not the employee.  The management states they care about you the worker, but they don't they just care about the workload."
bad,Great place as a temporary job and excellent place for younger people of age starting out getting there feet wet in the job world. Good Benefits but management and the amount of hours are ridiculous for the amount of pay they offer.
bad,"My typical day at amazon was fun and enjoyable."
bad,"The day-to-day is not challenging or stimulating despite having a very high-skilled and educated staff. Some days are better than others but, in general, employment at Amazon should be used only as a stepping stone to your next career goal."
bad,"Your job is not ever secure, with thousands of temps waiting to take your job you can easily be replaced with just one slip up."
bad,"I current work at Quidsi/amazon, Amazon took over not too long ago. Since they have taken over the company has took a turn for the worst. The attendance policy is designed to get you fired. They dont care about family life or emergencies. They run a very strick business. They expect more then what is achievable. Their expectations are VERY high, too high. It's like working in a sweat shop. Only positive are the benefits and the pay."
bad,I liked working by myself even though sometimes I would rather work in a group but I made my expectations at this job and I was glad about it.
bad,"In the Amazon management culture you will be given no choice but to grow.  It starts with frequent, unfiltered feedback on job performance and consistently includes stretch assignments to expand your limits in scope and scale."
bad,"its was sometimes a great place to work, but other than that its stressful and you really have to be willing to work in any condition you are in. i would still be working there if i didn't get sick, because the hourly pay is wonderful"
bad,"Picked items and sent them to shipping for packaging"
bad,"work alone not allowed a chat must meet targets. i learnt how too pack customers goods safely, enjoyable part was first day as was working in the group, no music always quiet unless had to get more boxes always at your station until break not much training giving only got 15mins then stright into it."
bad,"Organization and operation of daily assignment. Responsible for researching grant information, development of proposal documentation and presentation."
bad,When the Human Resources department acts more like company advocates and dictates who has the last say on who is allowed to  work there and and who dose not there are going to be great workers that are removed by information that is not necessarily the truth.
bad,fun job for the most part. The work was okay but the fact we were being watched and basically being pushed around by monitors was a let down. and the fact we were rushed and timed as well.
bad,The managers at Amazon will have Favorites and they didn't really pay attention to what was going on in the warehouse so therefore if something was wrong they really had no clue about it
bad,"Obscenities, discriminatory language, or other language not suitable for a public forum"
bad,Flexible work hours but very difficult to make the money i need to make at theres a lot of driving involved and i  dont get reimbursed for gas mileage. I like making my own hours.
bad,"The job as an ICQA associate is simple when you learn about it, but it's highly stressful. You're job is very monotonous. On top of that, people are constantly behind you in the aisles telling you to move out of their way. Either you're spending anywhere from 1-10 minutes at one bin counting items or you're constantly moving out of peoples' way and can't start a bin at all. Then you get in trouble for Time Of Task if you keep getting kicked out of an aisle. So instead they suggest you just start a bin even if someone is behind you and often they're in a rush so now you're coming off as a bad person by holding up this individual. It's just unnecessary."
bad,amazon was a good job for me you will have good days and bad days just like life itself. a very diverse environment many ways to move up in the company.
bad,I love my job to drive delivery to them and work so hard and normal a hours I love from 8 am to 7 pm perfectly..but sad that they are not provided to stay 80 hours a 2 every weeks
bad,It is a decent job if you don’t mind repetition work and long hours the management could be more helpful most of them act like they are better then the rest of the employees
bad,Poor management managers don’t care about your rate as long as the job gets done. They careless if you don’t make rare and get fired just because they get to sit back and relax on their computers all day while others work their butts off!!
bad,you get several breaks but minus 5 minutes from every break whether its 15 or 30 bc if you are not in your station already working before break is over you get docked and asked questions. expect you to meet daily and hourly quotas that are unrealistic. although woring there sucks the people are fun and friendly
bad,Descent Place to work for someone who is just getting started in the facilities business and Maintenance field. Employee and Management communications could be better
bad,Hours are only available online at a specific time and their are only first come first severe . In the work place they onlyy have 2 - 5 people on the floor
bad,"You are encouraged to work as hard or harder than you can until you break, then they replace you with someone new. I had a full team when I started and we became too efficient and my team was downsized, but the work load kept increasing."
bad,I want to better oppurchunity  I have lot of exepeirnce in amazon .because first prioty in safty related and second associate benifits .good environment at work.i give a better exepeirnce in the office
bad,"i have learn alot off different thing working.I meet dofferent people from other countries and i enjoy stowing and controling the robots,and must of all"
bad,Were do I freaking beginning . A typical day  at Amazon as a sorter  begins with a group meeting and stretching with the main managers and the whole team in the warehouse. That part is actually nice because we all get the chance to commucate  all together. However after that the nightmare begins.The lack of commcation is very bad you can hurt yourself and if management busy at that time they can ignore u because Amazon is more important   . They play LOUD four language  music though out the warehouse and worst when u are done with you shift they can send you to another part of the warehouse and have you work  among people who are already over there not doing NOT ONE SINGLE THING while u are doing EVERYTHING . If you are a scanner your scan  rate has to be ATLEASE 220 if not YOUR FIRED unless you are a favorite . Its a VERY UNORGANIZATED  PLACE and your work will never be notice unless you are a favorite . They also have a parking problem so you wont be able to park on site but on a site farer away and take a shuttle to the job site so BE CAREFUL AT NIGHT yes they have security but the risk still remains . Some people  there are very helpful and considerate and sadly over looked  but some are clearly there for a paycheck and VERY sadly promoted ...ALOT OF dead weight at this place YOU WILL BE PULLING MORE THEN YOUR SHARE  ...Beware
bad,"While they did the best they could with what they had, Warehouse work in general is not mentally stimulating, but rather numbing and tiring. To make matters worse, it was happening at 4 in the morning."
bad,"They are a numbers job. If you can make your numbers consistently all day every day, then go for it. But they will cut throat you if you can't. It's not a bad place to work but it's not a great one either."
bad,"They lost my medical accommodations paperwork and didn't let me return to work, so I ran out of time off and was terminated because I couldn't come in."
bad,"A typical day of work consists of working fast while standing, lifting up to 50 pounds, and bending.The starting positions are all physically demanding. Management are all friendly. What I hated the most was how they constantly monitor you about everything. If you have a low rate for any reason, you will have someone from management coming to you to find out why. The equipment also frequently doesn't work properly and you have to move to a different station. When I worked at Amazon, I got the impression that Amazon doesn't care about their employees , only about the required rates. They give out some nice raises but I hated the work environment."
bad,"It is a very fun hobby at first. Then when things pick up it can be very stressful. listing items, returning emails and trying to please every buyer is extremely hard"
bad,"Amazon was strict with their lunch and break times. Breaks weren't long enough. Was overworked. Very tiring but the pay was good. If you are a picker, you work alone for the entire shift."
bad,"I am grateful for the experience. I learned what I needed to, to work in another warehouse similar with, hopefully, better benefits, a more organized system, and better pay"
bad,depending on your circumstance it can be very good just depends on weather or not you wish to take the to do so and if you like to plan everything ahead of time this is not a job for you in your social life that is.
bad,This job is so monotonous that it is hard to feel motivated to work hard there. There were no real enjoyable part of job in all honesty. I learned to build pallets and wrap them up for transport.
bad,"They have pretty strict shifts, which means you can't change it around to make it flexible with your full time college schedule (coming from my experience)."
bad,It could become more understandable and less stressful for the employees. Quick to fire and quickly get a write up for something you didn't get trained correctly to do.
bad,"Management and HR will take risk assessments on what laws they break and bend"
bad,"They need to train there human resource department. Everyone is rude and unprofessional. The job itself is okay. Its not hard to do or learn. Its the management that makes the job unlikable because they show favoritism and select there ""buddy's"" for promotions over who will be the better leader and worker for the position. I would not recommend the job simply because of the poor management and it is extremely unorganized and they are not upholding the Amazon values."
bad,"Working here as a female worker was a nightmare I would only suggest you work here if you need the money and only for a short period of time. The hours are very long I would be working literally for 5 hours and 15 minutes until my first break which was only 30 minutes and could be cut shorter whilst trying to clock out and get through security checks. "
bad,"The managers were great, they do the best they can, but the hours are abominable and the work itself is mindless and repetitive. Great for somebody who just wants to turn their brain off for ten hours"
bad,"Picking isn't bad it is just extremely mind-numbingly boring. All the people are nice and very welcoming, but the job is just seriously boring. They pay is great and the benefits are wonderful, but if you do not like being on your feet all day and you like something to occupy your mind this is not the place to work."
bad,All the managers at Amazon don't work and tell there employee to do there work for them. The breaks at amazon are to short. And when there is nothing to do they want you to stack totes and move them a cross the warehouse
bad,Your body breaks down and every muscle hurts. We are treated like kids. It use to nice working their. When they change AM'so things get worse. Favoritism.
bad,they expect alot out of you and they do give you rewards if you make their rates they expect you to make if you make that you are great if not well you know what happens after that breaks are 15 mins and lunches are 30 mins their hours are long fair warning on that.
bad,it can be a long day. u can learn a lot of thing if your welling to learn the hardest part of the job is you well get tired and its all ways hot best part of working here is that you get to meet new people all of thee time and new manager ever year
bad,"Pack is built for people who like to stand for 10 hours in one place. It was super easy but I like to move around, so I liked ICQA better. Walk around the whole building counting Inventory all day with a cart and calculator."
bad,"Be prepared to work! This is a tiring job and there is a quota one must fulfill every single day otherwise your job will be jeopardized. It can be hard to move departments or get promoted unless you are heavily favored. Great health, school and vacation benefits. Salary typically increases about $0.25 every 6 months."
bad,"When i worked in amazon it was a nice company to work for and always kept busy "
bad,"This job consist of alot of walking, moving, and being time as you work "
bad,"Working here is not what I expected. There is no encouragement for the work that is done. "
bad,"I couldn't last long because I like a job with some challenges, something that will keep me busy & happy. Was definitely busy but not happy. Once you understand everything you need to do to it can get really boring. Incredibly boring."
bad,"It is very hard to work and It alot of pressure.  Too short 20 min break , But great pay and great Benefits."
bad,A typical day at work would be start at 7.45 until 6 pm Friday to Monday. My co workers were nice but it it was mainly working alone. The hardest part of the job was having to carry heavy items. The most enjoyable part of the job was when you had finished your packing.
bad,"i think there great as a company when it comes to online orders but for there temp agency they are not professional, rude and give that company a bad name. They have associates working there and i feel like they don't know whats going on around them. I also had a check bounce more than four times and still had to wait for ever to get one. You have a full 10 hour shift but a 30 min lunch."
bad,"I had Learned quite a lot off things at amazon, and got on really well with the other staff/mangers..."
bad,"to go and collect specified items in correct area and put on your trolley,go get more and take back to unloading area in warehouse,"
bad,15.00 is way to less to paid with all the work they want you to do this pay needs to to way more then just $15.00 and you guys knw y’all can pay these drivers more then that
bad,"In the beginning, working there was fun, but what you aren't told right away is the speed quota certain job types have and that you must maintain it constantly for 10 hours straight. "
bad,"Amazon is a nice place to work. You get two 30 minute breaks where you have access to vending machines, televisions, computers, and even games to play. It is a very easy job, but you get very lonely while doing so."
bad,This job is super boring and stressful. There's been people seriously contemplating suicide because of it. Everyone I've talked to says they hate the job and are only here for the benefits. You don't get amazon prime and you max out at 48hr pto for the year which is also dumb. If you like brain dead work where everyday is the same day then go for it.
bad,"overworked underpaid. boring, wish u could at least listen to music while u worked to make the day go by smoother and faster.  Ten hour days are to long. Very hot in the mods"
bad,It’s an ok job if you can stand for long periods in one spot limits ya bathroom time and never say no...and some days you will feel unappreciated...but the good thing is only the benefit and the pay
bad,"The job itself is very easy and laid back. Pay is great for the work that we do, but getting shifts is impossible!! We're on a flex schedule, so shifts are posted and whoever gets to them first get them. The problem is because management hired way too many people, the second shifts are posted they're all gone. I'm not sure how others are getting shifts but I haven't worked in two weeks. I sit at my computer constantly refreshing the page waiting for shifts to be posted and I still have no luck. The manager is no help with this issue."
bad,"They have nice management there, and a lot of benefits. But their is a lot of physical activity. Where split into tams and would often compete for prizes which was nice. But its impossible to meet your quota unless your a trained Athlete My body hurts every night when I get off of work."
bad,"Higher ups in this company feel a certain privileged above the other associates, they are very rude and order you around as if you have no status in their company. They make up the rules as they go. No time off without penalty everything gets you docked."
bad,they over worked everyone and there was no room for advancement I left cause of the way that they treat you and how they treat everyone else but it was a job
bad,Got let go because my average stowing was at 87.7.% when they wanted 100%. I was always on time the only time I took was my brothers funeral. My first manager was great until he moved on then I got a new one who had something to prove. I wasn't the only one to be let go there were many others that lost their jobs.
bad,"1- a typical day was an induction day it was the most difficult day we had stayed for ."
bad,If you enjoy working in a warehouse then amazon is the job for you but you are going to be on you feet for 10 our or more the benefits they offer are great but this job takes up too much time to the point you won't really have social life.
bad,Management hardly ever communicates with employers before making major decisions involving the employers. They expect the employers to go from one job function to the next with little to no training and master it.
bad,"Packing,picking,enjoy work-day with a good co-workers and a professional management.Hardest part wa when I finish the contract."
bad,The hours are long but the pay is good. Its nice to have a set schedule but being a single mom and having a child that just started school its hard to keep him on a routine because I don't get off work until 4am.
bad,"A lot of pestering from managers, even though my job consists more of what they're asking for, they continue to try and set you up for failure"
bad,"The first time you walk into an Amazon Fulfillment center it's like walking into Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. It's so amazing to see all of what goes into just one customer order. But don't let the glamour fool you. There is so much more ""under the hood"" once you start working there and actually see what is going on and how unorganized some of the management is it will make your head spin. Rate is a HUGE deal at Amazon, if you don't meet rate your area manager and PA's (Process Assistants)  with be hounding you constantly about it.  I was even told by someone that they got written up for being less than under 100% for the week they were at 99.08%. If you're not doing 100% per week they will find you and talk to you about your rate, yes. Even if it's at 99.08%. They will try to accommodate to what fits you best.  Besides that, Amazon is not a place for everyone if you thrive in fast paced work environments this place is for you. If not.. Well better go find another job.This is why they will pay up to 95% of college after 1 year of being at the company. Not everyone wants to stay Amazon, and those who do, either move up in the company or stay a Tier 1 associate. I hope this helps some of you out there and gives you more of a concrete answer if you should work here or not. Have a good one!"
bad,"The day starts with stretching based on your job. It was an interesting place to work if you have ever ordered from amazon I enjoyed seeing the inner workings. The management is very company  driven and they are reminded of that by their supervisors its a very numbers driven company. Everyone is on pins and needles hoping  to keep their numbers up. The job that I had was very tiring and is ok if you are in alright shape physically you walked the entire warehouse your entire shift. The end of the day was part of the best part of the day but, I have made several good friends from this job."
bad,If I was you and you are looking for a warehouse just to get some experience and that's it Amazon is the right place for you. After a few months you can be cross trained and learn different things that's other jobs will pay more for
bad,"typical day was long, fast paced, and extra hours were needed to be worked when the rates weren't meant. hardest part of the job was the time passed so slow due to the fact the task was easy for me"
bad,Go in to work do stretches in a group to get ready to work. Get a cart start picking items. Learned how to use a pallet jack. The rate at which they make you work it to high. Move around was the best part of my time working there.
bad,"Amazon is known for great benefits and perks but they demand overtime quite often and those perks (40hrs paid overtime, 10 hrs unpaid) have to be used if you can't work their very often mandatory OT."
bad,"10 hours a day for day shift. Eleven hours there. Ten and a half paid. It is a hard and tedious job but pays well. It definitely isn't for everyone but if you can get into it, it's a fantastic thing."
bad,the place was ok the rules and regulations are a little messed up and ways that you can written up but over all its an ok place.
bad,"Working with Amazon was overall a success. I learned how to do quite a few things. i learned how to sort items, how to load & unload trailers, i learned what is expected in a warehouse & also how to be safe working in that type of environment. Management was a little poor as to they weren't really doing there job, which led to other employees trying to have an advantage over others & take authority. my co-workers were very good people, i learned the type of people to be around to help me have a successful day. i learned that some people are irresponsible & do not do what they should be doing, & i learned there are others who are there to do what they need to do to help keep things steady. The hardest part of the job i would have to say was communicating with managers & PA'S because some of them wouldn't do what they were supposed to do & they made the job environment unfair for some. The most enjoyable part of the job in my opinion was being able to go in there & do what i needed to do, being happy doing, & doing meeting many different people who also enjoyed doing what they needed to do to be successful."
bad,"its ok if you need the money, they will hire you quick and fire you as fast as they hire you if your not on your P's and Q's.                                                 thats all i have to really say about amazon, they pay good if you work every hour of the week plus over time."
bad,Amazon was a really great experience . It was very fast pace from day to day. Great exercise. Would walk up to 6 to 9 miles a day. Everyone was very helpful and fun. We would listen to music every day at stand up before we started our shift and when we came back from lunch to give us motivation and a pick me up. It was loud also. some places you were not able to walk threw without ear plugs. It taught me a lot and I greatly appreciated the work experience.
bad,"overall,  a wonderful experience. However fast paced environment with high stress levels. Good management and problem solving team. Wonderful open door policy."
bad,This job is not for everybody. Your body is treated like a machine. Footwear is extremely important. The walking distances will kill you. Averaging 30-40 miles per day.
bad,I just had a bad experience time there with them. I  disliked working at the company because they put me in another  department from what I apply for and when I answer about what I apply for(Human Resources) I was told that all that positions was take so that why I was place in department of packing/shipping that you have to stand for all most 12hrs with just a 30mins break in the morning and a 30mins beaks in the even time.
bad,"A typical day at work is doing your assigned work for the day. The hours are set and are not changed, however you can be required to work mandatory OT"
bad,I worked their for almost a year. The management on days in Inbound have a lot of favoritism. The managers didn't really care about the employees.
bad,"lacking in growth ,recognition and salary.good in people management .exploration of knowledge is great here .no boundation in that .very free culture."
bad,There were great employees at amazon very respect full and helpful but when I was getting ready to have my baby boy amazon didn’t let put me on Paternity leave they fired me !
bad,Lost position due to hrs taken for medical procedure anf eent negative unpaiftime so i figured if im terminated as informed if hittin negative time... Best insurance an pay was great.. 7.5 hrs shift w 2 30 min breaks. loved workin there but the HR dpt wdre careless messin my hours up constantly & was rude to ask for help straightening out issues their trained to fix...bad at understanding personal emergency problems..Quit after hrs of unpaid time were bein taken when not used numerous times. Not worth the hassle of accepting rude employees that only make matter worse.
bad,"Amazon is a great place to work, but very physically demanding. Also very picky about how you stow items. Be prepared for long days during peak and prime seasons."
bad,The people that you work with is great but it is way too fast pace. they dont help you and you feel like you can lose you job at any moment.its hard to keep up and feel secure about your job.
bad,a usual day every day go in for a start up meeting then we would get sent out to start picking our orders on our guns the management was good always there to help you when ever you needed it all the workers I worked with were a good laugh and good to get on with the hardest part off the job was trying to get the cpts out on time and the most enjoyable part would have to be the people I worked with
bad,"I worked at a call center for Amazon. There were lots of events, especially around the holidays. This included time during your work hours for fun presentations by the upper management and HR team (paid, of course.) "
bad,"Normal duties include alot of walking. Scan merchandise and place them in a tote, when the tote is full you then place it on a conveyor belt to have it sent up to packing. Management was great and the facility itself had fun things to do to keep occupied during breaks. Only issue is the breaks were way too short and management was unfair on productivity expectations on someone who had just returned from a medical leave."
bad,"My Manager is very helpful, The people I work with are a great team. The Company has changed my hours for my overtime. I work Sunday thru  Wednesday and my over time day was Thursday. Changed Overtime day to Friday.  This is not expectable.."
bad,Working here was very stressful and tiring. The breaks weren't long enough for a 12 hr shift . It's really hot and the job is stressful. But the management and the pay was really good .
bad,"I was just part time, but also wen to school, and had another part time job at the time i worked at amazon. The work i did there was so easy that i seriously died of how long i was there. i worked 10 hrs sat and sun. but i also formed hamstring tendonitis while being there, and i am pretty fit, and like the be active. But it was just too much on my body, and wasnt something that made my weekend any better besides getting a check every week. I guess this job isnt for young or really older people. you have to really enjoy being in a warehouse if you want to do this job thats all i gotta say"
bad,"It was to tiring and didn't fit my schedule, co workers and management wasn't helpful to me at all, but I did learn a lot more than what I knew by working at Walmart."
bad,It's a fast paced environment. I enjoyed working there the short term I was there. I'm always happy to meet new people. I would love to work there again.
bad,"I can not really do anything bad to say, all the staff and government super-"
bad,Amazon was a great place to start off with but the management was terrible. I loved working there with the great people that worked there but the  management sucked.
bad,amazon is a great work area they have a wide work range of positions you can work in I worked on a order picker putting away any merchandise before we send it out
bad,"I only worked there for 7 weeks after finishing grad school and needing to just find something really quickly to help pay bills. "
bad,"Efficiently picking customer orders for shipment and ensuring that the correct number and type of product is loaded and shipped on time, Dealing with incoming parcels and prioritisation of the same, Experience within a warehouse environment and an understanding of health and safety regulations, Meeting tight deadlines in connection with team and individual projects and objectives, Prioritization of work, under extreme pressure and to very tight deadlines"
bad,"Being self employed sometimes can get difficult seen as not many hours go after Christmas but some weeks days become available to work."
bad,This job was to fast paced for me. Ia typical day at Amazon is like walking a high school football field 100+ times a day. I learned how to operate a forklift
good,Posibile ci prende un stipendio buono che hai un contractto full-time pero con un contracto Mog come mio che in novembre ho lavorato solo 9 giorni che ho prenso 647... Euro no mi bastano con una famiglia ( moglie e figlia) che ho le rate al meae di 715 euro....calculate voi
good,"Awful place to work, you are shouted at whilst doing your job, how on earth the managers got their jobs is beyond me. It's a place you dred going into. Would not recommend"
good,"The worst company to work for! I worked for 4 full weeks and i got paid 240£. I said today is my last day at work, and the answer was sweet: said the rest of the money i never going to see them because in the contract is writted, i must give them a notice of 2 weeks, if not I don’t get the deposit back."
good,"Worked during Peak. Nov to Dec 31.Was 12 hr nights. Had Wednesday and sunday off. Fast paced. They transfered me depending upon where they needed "
good,overload on work. Managers dont care but them-self. that all i have to say about that place. I guess bad experiences working there. Richmond Amazon need serious help.
good,"Lack of resting and no for family time.  "
good,"I honest dont know it's making me do this, if you want to work there be my guess you're a human being with free will so do as you please would I recommend working there or reapplying nope. my 90days probation is over and I'm not going back... there hope that was enough"
good,"Packed product into the correct shipping box, scanned barcodes to print shipping labels, bubble wrapped product, closed box up and ran through taping machine, labeled outside of the box with address label and put on the conveyer to pack on trucks. very hard job."
good,"I googled it, knew it was a bad job based on various articles, still applied, still hired, and began regretting the decision to work here very quickly."
good,Awful anyone with any power gives you tasks they wouldn’t do themselves and they don’t care about their employees and if you work at END OF LINE OR FLUID you can get hurt a lot by totes the come flying down  conveyrs and hit all over your body
good,It was a tent. Management was horrible. They do not care about their employees. Their was no heating . The bathroom were filthy. It was favoritism shown.
good,"A great company to work for, you'll encounter huge scalable systems that you cannot find anywhere else."
good,"Very hard job at Amazon. 10 hours long standing with only 2 breaks each 30 minutes. work so hard, complete target every time but they want more and more without appreciation."
good,"Working for a third party company was horrible , your on pins and needles to not do anything wrong. If a situation occurs as such something went wrong. There is not a equal opportunity to share your thoughts if you get any."
good,"I have been working at Amazon (More than a year)"
good,"its a cool place to work if u like running all night long, team leads chasing u down about your numbers, turn over so bad never know when they are gonna fire u.  I worked there 3yrs I liked it fun and fasted pace but I was in ICQA"
good,"The hours were horrible, lunch was only 30 minutes for a 10 hour shift. Would show up to work somedays only to be send home because there wasn't enough to do."
good,"Picking / packing ,"
good,"It is a job where you can make fast money, but that is it....The turn over rate for this place is horrible..The company on cares about there product not the employees...."
good,"This position was very stressful. Always had to meet certain numbers by  a certain time. Aside of that management was great, I really enjoyed our standup meetings."
good,"They will get everything they can out of you, while not caring about you."
good,the job hours were too long you stand in one place the whole time and the breaks were really short.
good,"worked hard everyday but didnt really learn much, management was terrible, co workers were pretty cool, hardest part of the job was the quick and shorted breaks, most enjoyable time of the days is when it was time to leave!"
good,On vous fait croire un salaire soit disant net mais quand tu reçois ton contrat déjà signé (sur tablette) tu remarques que c’est brut
good,Hard on body either alot of work or none  being sent home since going to clothing facility it is horrible and boring not either too hot or too cold no in between
good,I worked in every department to learn and expand my work skills. Faced hard tasks as well as high volume of packages and gave it my all to the end of shift. My management team some worked with us some didn't but turned out ok. Good energy from most associates but I think the hardest part of the job was working with lazy associates. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new skills. I was giving the opportunity to work with every station in the fulfillment.
good,"As a self employed driver, the money was ok for a delivery only job, but out of that you get ripped off by the contractors that put you in there as you can’t work directly for Amazon, so after they’ve done that, it’s not as good as first appears."
good,Working at the logistics delivery of Amazon  which is DCH1 you’re only giving 4 hours daily for 5 days with the option to pick up shift if available. This particular facility is not a good place to work if you’re looking for full time work.
good,ayant travailler chez amazon c'est difficile mais passable
good,"Operation culture is very bad and there is no as such amazon work culture in kolkata specially EFP warehouses, long ofc hours and specially no place to seat. And managers are also not co-operative, HR are not that much active, if you join by only considering its brand value u will be wrong."
good,"Chance for promotion is slim, even if you have experience and bachelors or masters degree. Pay is not enough for cost of living in illinois average rent in area is 1500 or more. Rates are high which is not a problem until you get large freight in which makes it harder to meet. Lastly they have a time off task policy which is not accurate but it goes off scan to scan for example, if you have to get fuel or get water or go to the restroom  your time off task. Some times you may be trying to find a location for a item to stow and if its over 5 min you time of task which can lead you to write ups and termination"
good,"after I retired started to do contract jobs, because I always hated to sit around and do nothing.  working at Amazon was one of the many "
good,"Amazon would be a better employment opportunity if management were more accurate in the assignment of  work schedules, there are time where there are no schedules to work or they are all taken. if there were permanent hours of work it would work better."
good,management focus on employees personal lives versus keeping goals and company deadlines.  Too hard to move up especially when management feels you can do there jobs better than they can.
good,They can handle their stuff a little better pay a little bit more for their people or their benefits and be a little less on stressful. They could give their people all a locker as well
good,"Micromanagement galore!  They track you on everything, even bathroom breaks.  If you didn't meet their sometimes unrealistic goals, you were written up.   Sometimes you were written up for no good reason.  Unreliable work volume."
good,"Too Much work, not enough rest. Not enough care for drivers. Many accidents on the roads and no help would come out for hours. Fast pace for sure in the warehouse, lots of in and out driving on the roads."
good,"I don't approve of the treatment from amazon to their employees. They speak a big game of caring for their customers and employees but don't compensate their employees enough to care about their job, in return their customers. It's a big money scheme for the ceo and higher ups while the ants get peanuts. But why should ants complain when the size of a peanut is considerably larger, right?"
good,There is no real management or leadership at Amazon. it is a numbers company who hire bookworms / numbers people to manage a number of personalities and most managers are young ( avg age is 25) with no life experience or communication skills.
good,"formation ""sur le tas"""
good,"We cant afford to make living in Colorado with 12.50 per hour. This is really lowest salary than other companies. Walmart, and other paid more than Amazon. LIne rate is silly. Safety is important than speed up work. That will injury lot of employees."
good,when o started it was fun but now they do not care about the drivers anymore they listen more to the people that they don't have functions over there than to listen to the drivers problems and to take care of them more than the other
good,You have to be in good shape also wear comfortable shoes. typical is long with few breaks. learned to work with pallets and hand jacks. Management to be permanent I apply myself to /Amazon
good,"It was alright, I learned a lot about production and leadership.Days were long and made difficult by lack of staff. I learned how to be a proper leader. Management was good it all depended on their intelligence and drive. Culture is liberal, almost too liberal. Hardest part of the job is having no work life balance, and always working MOT. The people were the most enjoyable part/"
good,Constant fires to be put out. The amount of stress and lack of support created a toxic work environment where everyone was trying to outdo everyone else.
good,"It's a machine's job, there were means to handle cases with just computer codes, there was literally no need to hire humans. The hours are long, you can't leave your seat, because you'll ""hold up traffic"". They had an X-Box and other recreational facilities that collected dust because everyone was too busy to use them."
good,"Temp to perm but its a 11 month contract with no benefits working as an assembler.  Changing to permanent is not likely and worker is laid off for 3 months, and worker must reapply for an additional 11 months as a temp."
good,"I liked the work and the people I worked with . But it went from wok hard have fun make history."
good,"Très mal manager "
good,There are many benefits to working there that I did not receive because I was not an actual associate. I'm not an accurate representation of full time work at the company. What I do know is the work involves mild labor and very impersonal management. However the work is steady for decent pay.
good,"Amazon provides workers with all that is needed to accomplish works. Great materials, Good break room, Facility good and work break time intervals very good."
good,I packed and shipped out packages. It was a very high pace place to work . They keeped to work place clean and it was a safe enverment to work in. They made sure the breaks were on time.
good,"good team"
good,"its a descent job for someone fresh from high school or looking to make some extra cash but that's it. if you have a family especially small children, that is not the job for you."
good,Amazon was a good opportunity though the chances of making a career out of there for myself was very unlikely. The pay for what I was doin was ok but the opportunities to advance seem narrow at best. I wont say I would never go back but if a better paying job came up I would definitely jump on it.
good,"Ho imparato tante cose ,lavoro molto pesante e ripetitivo con orari e turni che ti tolgono quasi la vita privata e non retribuito equamente ai sacrifici richiesti"
good,I like the job as a packer. But I'll be packing one quarter out of 4. I work to hard to not get a raise. I don't think is fair how the some of my Co workers and me do more of work and the workers hired straight from Amazon don't get send back to the shipping. I like my job. But I think they should put the workers straight from Amazon to work more like us from the agency.
good,"It is a hard working company, you will become sore and tired everyday. You must be an active person because you need a lot of energy to keep up with your job. There are a lot of workers and the building is huge. You get a chance to meet a lot of new people. If you need help along your journey there are more than enough leaders that can help you when you are having problems."
good,"Als erstes gibt es eine Besprechung (Motivation). Dann gehts an die Arbeit. "
good,i didnt enjoy my time with amazon mainly jue to the expectations of the company from its staff which i felt were unrealistic for someone of my age
good,I work has a picker so I have to go really fast and get things picked as fast as I can.
good,"I really love my job, but the hours are very long and its redundent work day in and day out. You spend more time at this job than with your own family. I get to learn alot in my department, but the advancement part of it needs lots of work. I do enjoy the unlimited amount of overtime because thats the only way some of us will survive.."
good,You as a worker are kept very bust during your shift. It is very long hours with minimum breaks and most of the time you are in an aisle alone. The pay was not bad but it was a depressing work environment.
good,"Amazon es bueno, el problema es Alorica, que es la empresa que terceriza."
good,"Decision making sucks but overall a decent part time, that's all cause u ain't gonna live of this. Not enough to pay bills. Also they really dont care about the workers, cause they feel regular associates can be replaced easily no matter how long or good u are."
good,"It is a place that is decent to work for.  But it is a slave labor environment there in their fulfillment centers/ warehouse locations.  Most of the managers there will work with you to solve problems as you go, and they are very helpful too.  For the most part, it is a decent place to work.  But they need to focus on the employees' needs and not be so numbers driven."
good,"Des heure supplémentaires de folie, chacun fait ce qu’il veut comme il veut, un gros manque totale d’organisation à tout les niveau . Pour un salaire de 1200 euro et tout est fait pour te faire croire qu’on se soucie de toi de ta santé au travail, il y a beaucoup intérimaire et le peu d embaucher démissionne peu à peu même les responsables partent."
good,"No hay crecimiento si estas en las outsoursing, no hay aumento de sueldo, al contrario hay incremento de horas de trabajo, disminución de días de descanso....."
good,"Pros :"
good,"I can not speak for all locations but the one I was at. Just go in work your hours and go home. Most of management is not respectful towards the floor workers. And Managers play favorite with the workers. The associate voice board is a waste of time, only basic questions get answered nothing more. Again, just go in work your hours and just go home."
good,"The environment was not that good  due to allergies of cardboard."
good,"Getting to work was a journey in itself. My commute was about an hour each way. Everyday i would go home with no less than 18k steps on my pedometer. During my 10 months with Amazon, I learned to become more independent and gained a lot of patience. Having a management team that is hired specifically to assist employees who truly need assistance is a blessing although it created a lot of room for complainers to occupy more of their time. The hardest part of the job for me was leaving the people i created relationships with, being micromanaged. "
good,Don't specify that you have to earn your holidays but let you take holidays when you don't have them and don't get paid for it I wouldn't recommend anyone work there if they have a family
good,"The place is awful! Hard work is delegated & they expect you to know stuff that they never taught you.You're just working and catching on as you go..They have Learning Ambassadors that walk around & weirdly watch you work,flirt with employees & expect you to respect them.lol.The training sucks at"
good,i would not recommend this kind of work to anyone. it is physically demanding the hours are consuming and the manager well some are very rude you have to move to different departments in order to get some kind of advancement.
good,Very fast paced!!! Did not liked being timed to used the restroom.... I feel that there was alot of favoritism at this particular warehouse!!! The temperature at this warehouse at times was very hot. Some of the staff in the H.R. Dept. did not have answers to alot of important questions asked...
good,"Amazon contractors dont pay the 16.25 but $14-15. Blue amazon trucks track and monitors your speed, how much your reversing (because they don't want you to) which is impossible if you can't turn around in a driveway or dead end tight street. They track if your wearing your seatbelt, how many times you pick up your cell phone while truck is in motion, and engine idling🙄 the system reports these things to your boss. Only thing good about this job is the pay and flexibility. Equipment is trash and you only get Christmas Day and Thanksgiving Day off. You will be lucky to get time and a half. If you finish early they want to stay and help someone else who is behind. Dogs attack you. You don't get a discount or gift cards NOT EVER lol I wouldn't go back but the money was ok Run awayy"
good,"I enjoyed working at Amazon learning what life is like processing customers packages for shipment, it was a great experience. I made so new friends. I learned how to multitask in a warehouse."
good,"It was all online "
good,Modern day slavery. No room for advancement. It's not a company to work for if you don't have a college degree. Knowledge and work experience is not a benefit.
good,"I would recommend Amazon for an entry-level job, but unless you are ex-military or a recent graduate, advancements are very limited. Management is out of touch with the ongoing operations of this company. Pick your schedule wisely for it can be very slow or extremely taxing depending on the shift you are working"
good,"Working in a distribution center can be very hard and easy at the same time. I think because it is such an simple process to get in Amazon, they hire about anybody."
good,"wish my work paid off but instead got denied promotions, transfer after work injuries so lighter sort faclities inner co-worker problems never resloved."
good,they didnt care much for the employess all they cared bout was the rate and how fast you worked. if you would get hurt rigt away tried to blame you that  you did it on purpose.
good,No breaks 30 min lunch is not efficient for the amount of work load they have need to implement a union to have a job security with amazon the work is to much
good,"It's easy to get fired if another co-worker doesn't like you. The other co-worker can lie and HR will simply escort you out. If you keep to yourself and don't step on anyone's toes you'll be fine but eventually miserable. "
good,a typical work day was seldom organized employees were rarely placed where they could be the most productive and management could have been greater but it wasn't
good,"Amazon is huge company with a lot of opportunities. However, my assessment of how the organization treats their managers and hourly employees is that everyone is just a means to an end. Amazon is highly customer centric, but generally at the cost of their leaders.  More is never enough, and the overall culture is poor to fair.  It is not a company I would recommend working with for more than a couple years."
good,"work culture is not at all employee friendly...very much micromanaged, they try to map an employee's every second...too much work pressure and tough physical work is the main thing here...long term working here can take a toll on anybody's health."
good,"Just basic work, you walk in meet with the group do some stretches after you just go to your station and start stowing product onto bins. Same thing every day over and over."
good,i learned so may soft skills over there. People from different countries work together and enjoy working over there. sometimes work load is more and workers are less. working in amazon warehouse was a good experience.
good,"If you like four ten hour days, backbreaking work, and little to know appreciation then this is the job for you. The job is not safe for anyone under 5'5"" and there is no advancement opportunites."
good,They dont care about there employees.if you needed water you would have to wait for break .if you park in the wrong parking they will tow your car .you could not use the bathroom unless it was break
good,"Poor management structure & poor work experience"
good,"Feeling like a foreigner in your own country sucks. This has many disadvantages especially in the early days when you’re learning if the people that are teaching you can’t speak much English. "
good,"Favorites with Managers you feel like modern day slavery. A lot of just standing not working, race card was definitely played.  Breaks too short for distance you walk to and from breakroo"
good,"They expect so much from you and kill you physically little by little and the pay is horrible for a company that makes so much money, also they will fire you over any little thing. I got layed off but they wanted to fire my mom for not packing 100 packages an hour."
good,It's like being in high school most of the time. People just love to cause problems there for some reason when all you try to do is mind your own business.
good,"I worked here seasonally for the festive period in 2016 and hated every second of it. The management were absolutely horrible - as well as awful management skills, they were just genuinely horrible people. There would be sudden rushes of orders to be fulfilled yet when you were busy working on a trolley they would randomly give it away to somebody else to do? I was given a 'final written warning' due to not packing enough boxes in time, yet was never given a verbal or a written warning previous to it and I was being pressured to sign it! "
good,Every thing in stow is timed which makes the job stressful. If you somehow can't keep up with the speed and accuracy you can be fired which I have seen a few times while working there.
good,"ATL6, where managers pick and choose who gets to move up. I was excited for my job at first, only for my flame to be slowly put out by managers acting like it'd bother them to get someone to train me in new positions. If you aren't willing to train me, then adjust your scheduling algorithm not to schedule employees for positions they have not received formal training in."
good,The job is hard and very long work hours. They expect you to perform the job at robot level. Co-workers are only there to help themselves and not to help each other.
good,I was hired and assigned to a department that was very stressful and mentally draining. Management was comprised of very young people who had the book smarts but very little or no hands on experience
good,Rating system for production is entirely to high for the average worker and pushes people to the point of exhaustion. Management is more concerned with reaching those rates.
good,"A typical work shift was the evening shift from 5pm-4am. "
good,amazon is a good place to work depending on what department you are in and if you ar with people you know. the pay is at a good rate dor the 40 hours but if you make a 60 hour week it doesnt work out as good as it may seem
good,Fast paced ad cut throat if you don't work quick enough you gotta go. Learndd a lot of diffrent skills while emploed here started as a temp and got hired on full time.
good,"No problems went above and beyond for them doing great work over target and one day decided to end my contract based on volume of work the company was receiving, Have a huge turn around in both customer service and fraud side would be weary about starting a job here you might be gone after a couple of months"
good,"Was a college hire to a Sr HRA role. In  a nut shell, should have listened to the negative reviews posted about the experience of working at a fulfillment center. On top of the horrible experience, and being moved across country, I have to somehow pay Amazon back. The money was not worth the hostile environment, the poor culture, and management that treated us poorly. . No thanks."
good,Terrible. Computer generated.  Can get kicked off at any time for false reasons because a mass generated error. Then they won't tell you why but yet make you write them a letter saying what you would do different.
good,"Non lasciatevi ingannare dal nome della multinazionale in questione perche' in pratica il lavoro e' organizzato come una vera e propria catena di montaggio,in pratica e' una fabbrica di spedizioni. SI viene spremuti con contratti di somministrazione e lasciati a casa quando il picco e' finito.Le promesse da parte dei manager sono tutte bugie ed i criteri di valutazione sono molto soggettivi.-Nel mio caso ho collaborato con l'azienda da ottobre a dicembre 2017.Durante quel periodo sono gravitate in Amazon circa 1800 persone ma dopo Natale ne sono rimaste circa una cinquantina (circa il 3%). Ad oggi ancora agenzie di somministrazione continuano a fare selezioni per Amazon che continua a illudere,spremere e deludere chi ha bisogno di un lavoro."
good,"When you are a contract driver for Amazon, you get a wet pay for the job and there is no increase for the over sized loads. Your pay rate depends on how fast you deliver."
good,Over worked underpaid for the under appreciated. And play favorites low expectations as far as overtime  they would psych us up for over time and over time would be canceled
good,You will not expect any concerns from the managers and no one really knows what they have to do. There are freezers and employees are get sick they do not care at all.
good,"While Amazon LLC is a great company in and of itself, the RIC5 facility is not a place I would recommend working. There is no room for advancement, the management is short sighted, and there is little room for moving up. Im honestly shocked I didnt decide to leave sooner, but Im staying until I can find a better job."
good,"pay sucks, you never know when you might lose . your job even if youre a hard worker. at my location only those that are lazy get the permit position."
good,"For a company making billions of dollars, it is really sad that most employees like myself that can't feed my family on such low pay. I drove over an hour to work and back. Sometimes, I would be sent home because they said they had no available workstations for me It happened over six times. The company forces (VTO) Voluntary Time-Off on employees. I didn't get pay for VTO. I was driving from Waldorf, MD to Baltimore, MD without any guarantee that there would be work for me. They could send you home at any time without pay. As a result, I had to resign to find work security somewhere else."
good,As much work is done they will still find something to complain about. 1st shift always does more than any other shift and have to work overtime everyday
good,"I worked for a sub contractor for amazon and the management was bad. The routes were not fair themanagers rarely helped when you had a on route problem, and they weren't really understanding to the work hours they were expecting."
good,"The only thing this company has going for it is the benefits package.  I have only been with Amazon for a few months and there is not one person whom I have talked to that is happy about their job.  Every person complains about pay, not getting cross trained, unfair treatment.. The complaints go on and on.  Overall, Amazon should be a union job but that will never happen which is to bad because they could really benefit from it."
good,There is alot of body work the stretches in place are not physically good for the type of job they offer. Had a few talks with management and nothing was done
good,"My manager was great. Most employees at this site are good. A few lack motivation and use the turnover rate as an excuse not to work. Not much room for advancement at first but your performance is noticed and you will be given more opportunities in your department. They offer tuition reimbursement after a year of employment."
good,"best for only temporary workplace"
good,"No work life balance.Office politics is the worst."
good,they fire you for every little thing and have rates that you basically gotta break your neck. The management is very poor and not helpful and there is a severe lack of communication in all levels of management.
good,don't do it! its hard. I didn't like it. people are weird. the rate is crazy high. a lot of drama. night shift is paid more but messes up your life. if you work here work day shift.
good,"My assignment each day was single item packaging. Each person is tracked for number of items per hour and I was always pleased when I exceeded 60 items per hour. One day I worked in packaging DVD's and small books and I excited 130 items per hour."
good,"Amazon is a great company overall.  Those that run its different parts and pieces can be less than desirable.  You can be walked out at any time with no detailed reason as to why you are being let go.  Good place to visit, but I would caution on making it a long term home.  It seems the longer you have been there the more they want you out."
good,This job is good if your single and trying to live your life and pay bills.  Alot of favoritism and they overlook or keep hard work in a position as long as possible
good,The pay and the rate is great. Really no time to have much of a personal life. Really no time for anything but work. The environment is pretty well. Easy to get integrated
good,"Your job feels like its always on thin ice. Managers are snobby, stuck up, and arrogant. You HAVE to have a high rate. You get 30 minute lunch breaks and 2, 15 minute breaks on a 10 hour shift."
good,"Working for amazon was an ok experience. I worked for them as a Temp and I must say that i enjoyed it. It has it perks, I was able to be certified on Forklift.. but i wish they would would treat their temp associates better."
good,"little pay and messy management. no motivation towards the employees, people worry about whose sleeping with who instead of the well being of the company."
good,"You are treated like a number, all they want is results. They do not care whether you are ill or not able. It is hard and laborious, some people thrive in this environment. Some of the facilities have great programs, but I was part of the start up of ONT 9 (warehouse in Redlands) they had many issues, and were not willing to work with the employees. However, it seemed that ONT 2 was better (worked there for 1 week)"
good,I started there in one department stow. I worked 10 hour nights 4 nights out of the week but when peak hits and you have any kind of leadership role they make you work up too 60 hours a week in which i was then i got hurt missed too much time and i was done there.
good,"As a picker, a typical day has you walking at a fast pace for 10 hours per night.  This amounts to around 20 miles per shift."
good,typical day just standing there waiting for orders then when some become available scan them box/pack them
good,You will have the brightest minds to work with. You will be learning so much from the peers. Every thing you deliver or work on will be measured against the Leadership principles.
good,"Any job at amazon is simply simple except for the extreme physical requirements. Chairs are not allowed and there are 10 to 12 hours of long shifts with usual brakes. On second day of assignment I barely could walk to my car. My feet kept hurting for next two days with fever also. Hundreds of people work there, it was not for me though. Job function is totally mindless. No sense of achievement for employee everyday."
good,"doing morning exercise knowing what is expected and working the line."
good,At the time. That i worked at amazon i felt that there was no stability there.
good,"not good for health for long term job. Benefit is good but not advancement in career. Work is toxic especially in busy season, but many opportunity for ot."
good,"You will be hired as long as you past a drug test and brought in your ss card and ID to the interview! It can be a little confusing to find the interview location and I would suggest calling for more in-depth directions. Interview process is a drug test and getting your pictures taken for an ID badge. As for work environment, its factory work. Not the happiest place to be but for something temporary, perfect!"
good,"They expect you to work like a robot no relaxed time whatsoever every second of worktime they expect you to be busy even when there’s nothing left to do.witnessed colleague being marched offsite for talking and standing still, they give foreign workers preference over local people to gain promotion wouldn’t recommend"
good,"Your day starts with a puzzle, unsure if you have a route or not, even though being a company with millions of packages to be delivered on a daily basis, you may have ended up with no route."
good,Te pagan un sueldo aceptable pero el trabajo es muy duro y estresante y poca estabilidad
good,"Everyday going to work was an dventure not knowing what to expect. If there were no vehicles, or there were no rabbits, or the route assignments were changed. Total caos"
good,Worst place ever. so much disrespectful people. Mangers barely stop any of it. Times get rumor spread about you as well. It was horrible. Parking bad!
good,"Sorting, Pc scanning, training, problem solving. hardest part was listening to the inappropriate music that former co-workers would play. The most enjoyable part was being recognized for hard work."
good,"Amazon works you hard, but when you a little order it is hard.  I feel when you take a buy out and should not be consider they fired you even when you are resigning from the company."
good,Company treats there employees like robots. Operation Managers are always trying write people up for TOT(TIME OF TASK) and they treat employees like kids the way they talk to you.
good,"It’s a corporate culture built on no love/ barely helping it’s own and with over-focusing obsessing on science not it’s own employees.  You find huge gender discrimination my area (reverse from typically norms of earlier times) and people get promoted on how close they were with someone else and it’s very corrupt hush hush with cover ups constantly.  Change management is run rampant making causing a constant scramble no value longevity relationships and humans are treated like numbers"
good,"Disorganized hiring and training process. Night shifts only available which are ten hours long. Each sick day counts as a point, if you get three points you are in trouble. Good facility and lunch room though. Friendly people."
good,"i had long shifts , really wasn't mad abiut that. It just i was working out a truck for as long 7 to 10 hours . Sometimes heavy freight or light , only thing that cuaght my eye was some of my co-workers work ethic"
good,Place is a slave pen with a decent wage. Insane walking requirements due to mandatory 12hr shifts. Hardly any personal life balance and you're tossed at the end of season regardless of how well you performed.
good,"I enjoyed the money as a 19y/o but for the amount of work and bs that I had to go through it was not worth it by the end of the pay period. I had to life outside of work, and my family rarely saw me. I was in a cycle of wake up at 4am, work till 6pm, then go to bed because I was so tired. 50-60 hours a week, and they literally fired me once because I was moving too slow because of injury and never told me till I tried to leave and was locked in. needless to say I got my job back when they saw me in a cast."
good,"This job was fine for a temporary position, transitioning from that into full-time was something that I couldn't do while pursuing higher education. That being said it worked well for other co-workers."
good,"Very stressful place to work the management does not care about its people unless you're a supervisor or may be same one whose directly employed by amazon,."
good,You pick up a truck load and you drop it off address by address stop by stop they clock your speed but want you to hurry they will take your 30 minute break but you will never get on and it's way too many stops and the conditions need to be addressed and the expectations of an Amazon delivery driver are unbelievable and for some they can't manage but you will work all day rain or shine Sunday to Saturday
good,"Your managers are likely going to be in their 20s. This fact makes favoritism a real problem. There aren’t many “adults” around to supervise the way our young adult managers run things. The individuals who complain the most or make the biggest spectacle are often immediately offered different options. They almost seem to get rewarded for refusing to work the position they applied for. They get cutesy fun tasks, while the tough/quiet individuals are ignored. The favorites get to talk and waste time without reprimand. The favorites get to come back from breaks late. The favorites get to make excuses that are readily accepted. It’s an entry level job for kids... and it’s run by kids so it helps to be popular. The rules of high school apply. Be well liked. Be fit. The more in shape you are, the better. If you’re in it for the money or benefits, get yourself some lightweight foamy shoes. You need the right shoes and compression socks. Get these things before you even start. You’ll be standing your entire shift. Invest in a back brace, ankle support, knee support, Epsom salts, and anything else that might help you... You need a ritual for self care and you need sleep.  You will also need pain reliever on hand. Keep it in your locker.... icy hot roll on is smart to carry. If you’re a hot female, you’ll be worshipped and automatically made a favorite. If the guys can see your thong straps through your leggings, you’ll be treated very well. There’s a lot of childish and inappropriate behavior. "
good,"I can only review my experience in the fulfillment ares which was not very good. I have never been a negative person and it was not easy to maintain a positive mental attitude, but I did. The managers were only very young college educated with no real world experience. I have no problem giving young people a chance, but in a role that helps them to learn without hurting employee morale. Overall, I would give a below average review or the company, but I know they will improve with time."
good,"I worked for Amazon 2xs.  First time in warehouse which actually wasnt bad.  I was getting the hang of things but the seasonal part was up.  They sent email, to wrong email address, about choosing a different work time.  I didn't get it in time and was told to re-apply since I wasn't terminated.  Finally get back in the door and was sent to Amazon Fresh which was running around a gigantic warehouse filling food requests.  Usually 10 at a time.  Would have gotten speed up but if item was missing, you had to call thru a radio for it.  Sometimes that could take 10 mins to get reply but that was 'time off task'.  I actually got written up for it within 2 weeks of working there but told its no major deal..It is in my book. I don't like starting my career anywhere with a write up and got sent home more than working due to slow business, not enough orders, etc.  Oh and  SOME managers picked favs right off the bat.  Just my opinion."
good,"You get what you put in at this job."
good,you will work your a** off for little or no acknowledgment from management on your work. You get very short breaks and you must make rate or you will be let go
good,"Good place for young people from high school or, no college degree, looking to earn money while while taking advantage of the tuition re-imbursement for eduational advancement. Not a good place to invest for a career position. In/out, revolving door employment."
good,Great place to develope leadership skills that you can take on with you throughout your professional career. Little to no career advancement opportunities as they tend to be geared towards hiring from internships. Average life cycle is about 2 years.
good,"The healthcare is excellent, but you will certainly need it.  You will be worked beyond the point of exhaustion and forced to work overtime so it practically feels normal.  No one should be worked this hard and held to the ridiculous standards they impose. You aren't even allowed to use the bathroom off of break time, which is sadly becoming a standard practice in VA. This is blatant slavery. My advice is to take a pad and pen, and document every"
good,"Very few benefits received"
good,"•	When on call there. I’m responsible for all day-to-day global operations taking place on my scheduled weekend night shift within the PHX6 Amazon logistics, fulfillment, warehouse and distribution center located in Phoenix. "
good,"Working as a warehouse associate is fairly easy as long as you can physically keep moving and perform tasks at a decent pace. Moving up into management was a terrible experience as everything feels rushed, there's too many gaps in communication, and the environment doesn't feel welcoming for mistakes."
good,"Very shallow company that hides behind big sales and big expectations. The HR department is very rude. And managers and supervisors tell associates often that once hires they ""own"" them. And that there disposable."
good,"Its a good job if you don't have health issues. They don't care if your hurt or sick they just want you to work, If you are not fast enough or are not a valuable worker to them they do not care about you."
good,It was hard to move up or to change positions in the company. It was very fast paced always on your feet and moving for 10+ hours. The location was to far from my house.
good,"With high turnover in senior management, getting continuity of leadership is impossible which is required for promotion.  Much easier to get hired into a higher level from the outside.  A lot of Amazonians leave Amazon to get promoted elsewhere and then come back at the higher level."
good,"Overall, if you are looking forward to being told every hour to get or keep your numbers up then it's for you. You need to use the restroom and drop in numbers or fall behind too much then you will be given points based on their System that could lead to write-ups or termination."
good,"was a very rewarding and demanding job achieving high standards of fast paced accuracy using scanners to deliver parcels  correctly into right zones ready for distribution,also keeping workplace tidy and safe using 5 s  procedures and Health and Safety regulations."
good,"If you want a fair amount of over time and good benefits, then amazon is for you. Flexible shifts, nights or days and a bunch of different departments to choose from."
good,"HR and management work together.  It's always ""Amazon Way""  no help for the employee.  The employee voice is rarely heard and help isn't rendered if the complaint is against a PA or Manager."
good,"Not that bad of a company, I worked from home in the reserves department which meant we made our own schedule and had a laptop and headset sent to us to work with.  It was a nice remote job however the pay was not that good at the time. Starting off I received a base pay of $10hr and a quarterly raise of .25 cents but they have raised their minimum pay to now $15hr. Only downside was I left right before they made that announcement."
good,It could have been better just poor management and lack of direction and structure within the facility and not enough brakes provided for the employees at the company
good,"Prepared to be micro managed, calls listened to, overworked and underpaid. Managers tend to choose a favorite and praise... Consistently talking about numbers and scores and how we need to move faster.  Weekly meetings and comparisons on teams/Individual scores and everyone can see. Raises were typically  25Cents every year... Overtime ALOT and not optional. And customer is always right no matter what or how much there yelling."
good,Da man ständig unter Beobachtung ist und nur auf Zahlen geschaut wird ist das Arbeitsklima dementsprechend.
good,"I would never work there again they treat people like they’re not human they don’t even care about your situation , they just say you have to get back to work .. that place was my first job"
good,"worked here for 4 year, its for some people and not so much for some people."
good,"Even after performing at 98% that still was not enough! I was wrote up within my fourth week which is, according to Amazon is still the curve 5 weeks."
good,Working at amazon you are under paid for all the work you do it totally sucks. Also you they want you to get so much work done and not take breaks. I would never advise someone to work here.
good,"It was a temporary seasonal position, they would not let me apply through HR for a IT tech position until you have so many months with the company.       *"
good,"They don't want to keep employees around and there is a very slim chance of getting hired. I was one of 3 people out of approximately a few dozen people in my shift to be kept. After a month of waiting and without any warning, I and the others were let go and just like that, no job. The people and managers in my building were very nice, so this is clearly an upper management problem. The benefits only apply if you become an actual employee, which none of us were. Otherwise you get basically nothing, which is not what we were told when hired. The odds are completely against you, it doesn't matter if you performed well, Amazon simply doesn't want to pay out, period."
good,"Kept increasing hours to terrible levels. Pay and benefits were good though. Management was uncoordinated. It is abundantly clear that they want you to be robots, but that it's unfortunately currently cheaper to do that job with humans."
good,"never want to work there again, management was rude and unhelpful. the workplace culture was nice. the most enjoyable part of the job was leaving. the"
good,"It started ok, but after training it went down hill. One manager would say that a task should be done. Then another would come over and say we were doing the wrong thing. Then another would say stop. Then another would ask why we stopped. It was very unorganized and it seemed like there was no central point of communication. It was frustrating to say the least."
good,"For some Amazon is a suitable place to work. It's not suitable for me, The hours are too long, the breaks are too short & working overtime is a waste of time.Some of us live in states that have a high cost of living, & the pay doesn't match. By the time all of the benefits & taxes come out of your check, there still enough to make ends meet."
good,"Working at Amazon was definitely a good experience for me. I’ll be introducing who I am, going over the work culture and what to expect, the community of people there, and the shady things that happen to seasonals."
good,I recently quit Amazon regarding a horrible experience that I had after working with the company for 4 years. I am not comfortable stating the experience in this survey at this time.
good,"Amazon is a great place to learn how they build and ship products quickly. There is a sheer energy across the board to be customer obsessed, build and ship products. They do many things right and you have a great opportunity to learn. Great pay with shoring stocks. However it's a unique place with a unique culture which is not for everyone. It's certainly a stressful environment with constantly changing middle management. It's always a day one for you there. "
good,Good of you're looking for a faceless temp job over Christmas. Stand by for long hours and boredom. Manegment will treat you like cattle. Targets can be difficult to meet.
good,"It is a job with decent base pay, but the hours are inflexible.  For example if you have a shift starting at 7am, but your daycare or school doesn't open until 7am, you are required to either take paid time off (which you don't accrue past spring) or unpaid time off (which can only be used in full hour chunks).  If you ever exceed your unpaid time off, you will be fired.  This is reiterated to every new hire several times over that somewhere around 80-90% of the people who lose their jobs overstepped their allowed unpaid time off, and several examples are given of people with 15+ yrs on the job.  Since this was going to be an issue once I found that it was about 25 mins each day in traffic on my 4 midweek work days, I was forced to give notice to maintain a good standing with a previous employer.  Also, 15 minute breaks start from last scan with a device to next scan so if you have a 3 min walk to the break room, you end up with a 9 min break."
good,"L'aspect agréable de cet emplois est la rapidité de la journée, les tâches sont diversifiées, et permettent de ne pas rester immobile. Le travail d'équipe est important car chaque poste à une répercussion sur les postes suivants. "
good,"A typical day consists of unloading and sorting trucks. It is not hard work, but it is hard labor. "
good,"Rules were constantly changing, they don't pay you well enough to be driving your own car. Lots of wear and tear on your own vehicle with all the driving done. You have to caught your own hours in 2 hour increments."
good,"There is virtually no opportunity to advance without moving to another city. Very little work/life balance, although they really try and promote that they do."
good,"I used to sell on Amazon's Marketplace.  In recent years, many items have been restricted and there are more scammers on there.  No longer a viable way to make income."
good,"If you’re not willing to work hard, fast, and accurate it’s not the place for you. You must reach certain goals for certain jobs. If not, you will be retrained and warned. So you have to keep improving performance."
good,Amazon it's a place where you can learn a lot and is a very challenging company. Sometimes it can be stressful and frustrating but you can take the positive of all these experiences.
good,Started out at $14.25 with a .50 cent to a .75 cent raise every six months. When the building is in retrofit or expanding it's a nightmare none of the contractors know what they're doing. Nobody communicates anything and IT is expected to pick up all the slack from everyone one else.
good,"Very hard on the body. The company does stretches twice per shift. Employees are given incentives to meet or exceed their goals with internal competitions. If goals are not met employees are given verbal or written warnings, retrained or notice of potential termination. The job leaves you sore from the second day and throws off sleep schedule and causes pain and soreness. You are not allowed to call out or go home sick. You are expected to meet your target rate no matter what is going on in your personal life or of any illness. There is little to no chance of changing positions or shifts."
good,"Es una vergüenza como te engañan desde la ett."
good,"Only my back knows the answer to this mess, i cannot rate amazon as a positive experience but the financial problem i had it was a must for me to endure that lovely place filled with low graded people from around the world."
good,"Amazon is not the best place to work, there is all about work. You can not laugh, or any other activities that make you happy and more productive. "
good,"Very unorganized, no management, they just hired anybody, if you going to talk station and somebody else starts it you're both getting fired it's just not a good place to work that's something for somebody that's temporary or in high school Etc."
good,they are really messy on their positions make you do different thing every day which was fine we will always fall behind because of the system going down
good,"Unrealistic expectations of productivity.  Employees are underappreciated.  Even when I felt I tried my best to meet their expectations, I was told I under preformed."
good,"Increase the dollar per hour rates"
good,Fast paced highly demanding work environments with long hours and low pay also not getting paid on time and correctly was a huge issue for me as i commuted from over an hour away
good,Its o.k. the hours are long you do not really get a lunch break and It is dangerous depending on the implement weather. There are no benefits until after 90 days and even then they cost more money than they are worth
good,The company under appreciates and underpays its employees. There are almost no perks at this company. So many smart and talented people leaving from the company and the new ones   have to be trained again.
good,Fast past job consistently on your feet moving be able to lift items anywhere from 5to50 pounds be prepared to walk up an down several flights of stairs
good,no work:life balance
good,I was the best driver they had. I constantly had to pick up other coworkers slack and not get any compensation for it. I would try to finish my day as fast as I could because I knew what they expected from me.
good,do nopt work here there give you tergets that are way to high and thay tell you that thay well keep you on but there let go 98% of the temp worker before the temp trem is over
good,"This was my first warehouse job. My background is with retail clothing stores. "
good,"poor management, no room for advancement in the company, the ""amazon culture"" is force on employees. If you do not fit the ""style"" you are looked down on."
good,"They have ridiculous rates for you to reach but not much support in helping you to achieve this."
good,i liked working there it was fun the people was nice. the managent team was ok there are some great ones but also some mean and rude one.but overall the pay is good.
good,"Amazon is hard core, I worked during peak season and it was grueling. Hard work, long days, long weeks. Micro management is not necessary, proper training was sometimes missed."
good,"Stressful, constantly changes almost everyday. Org/Teams tend to restructure all the time, and changes in the management team. The only benefit from Amazon would be the stock option"
good,"I wrote Aim higher because although ONT2 had the cool break rooms  , good benefits, stock options, schooling and am care, you dreaded work certant days because in certant departments like receive it was super tough to make rate management would take the path of least resistance and let people cheat sure they talked about it at line up but in order to make rate properly you would haft to really work your putt off and hope your computer wasn't jacked up or your computer froze. This is a good starting warehouse job it lets you get your feet wet and experience for the next, this was the only job I've ever had where I had a LOA where if I was approved I was able to take off so much time starting with 2 weeks, I don't blame the company except there cap in pay, hardworking warehouse positions should start at 15/hr not end right below that I capped off at like 14.50 -14.75 and PA's get like a dollar above that, the money comes when you have a degree here and your an Area manager or above, but yeah I worked there almost 4 years and got let go for tot which is time off task not only did I have co workers right across from me watching me work but I also knew cameras saw me work, I planned to appeal the matter because I knew I was wrongly accused after filling out the appeal paperwork they said they needed it again or something and I only had 48 hours to respond well I was in between a move and didn't get to the email so even though I initially filled out the simple appeal they needed it again then I got to it to late and wasn't even granted unemployment so watch your back with The ONT"
good,"Repetitive."
good,"HR is so rude, they misplace files, make it seem like its incredibly hard to answer or help you out with what you need, they huff and puff, roll eyes or mumble when u interrupt there talking and the managers play favoritism."
good,It wasn't for me at all will never think of going back it has to be the last resort for anybody. He can meet rates and do good and they still want you to keep going faster and faster
good,While working at Amazon I realised it did not have the best interests of its staff at heart the company went really bothered about staff turnover and we're happy to replace you no questions asked
good,If you like to be worked to complete exhaustion for 14/hr be my guest. I seen numerous individuals get carried out in a stretcher. Alot of management habe no experience in logistics just degrees. And your easily replaced i lasted a little over a yera and seen at least 500 faces come and go.
good,fast past temporary work never a job as a career amazon hires seasonal work only good pay for working temporary the only way to work for Amazon is to go threw an employment agency.
good,"A typical day at work would be you finding your assignment on the assignment board then finding items in the scanner before time runs out on the scanner. You always under review so if times consistently runs out then they are going to likely say you didn't make whats called ""rate"" and you will get wrote up. They make  it hard to make rate because the PIT which is powered industrial truck you will be driving goes about 3mph if that."
good,"Amazon logisitcs had very great staff'. I enjoyed working in the chelsea location. However, the demands to deliver high package counts were irrational. Over worked staff."
good,"I like Amazon, the fact is everyone but a select few people are actually full time with benefits.Everyone else is part time with no benefits. I want a job with a future."
good,A typical day at work consisted of being berated and disrespected with no follow through with appropriate higher up management.  For associates in the Outbound position you are required to make rate or be written up; receive no more than the allowable time off task or be written up.
good,"It's a fairly fast pace job, with little to no chance for advancement. There's a notable high turnover rate of employees, as all positions are seasonal. The managers were of no real assistance in handling any issues that occurred."
good,I really didn't like working at Amazon much they wanted long hours not enough pay and tend to get you to work harder and longer and faster this is not a job that I word like to continue in my work field
good,short 3 hours. need longer jobs. need to make atleat 100 dollars a day. not 54. need consistent work in the area. workload is too much for a short period of time.
good,Very very flawed process too dependent on computers pay is ok not for everybody would recommend if you are hard pressed to work but don't get comfortable
good,"Fast paced work. Breaks are real short. You really need a lot of energy to work at Amazon, if you don't, don't apply. Take plenty of water, and go to do work, not to make friends, however, friends are always optional....."
good,Working at Amazon was too much for me. There were lots of cool people at amenities but what they expect of you was too much for me. Even when I did my best I still couldn't reach their desired hourly rate.
good,"working at Amazon is so stressful, there is no work or life balance. If there wasn't so much stress about making rate, it would be a lot easier. The breaks are super short and I wish the lunch was longer."
good,"Amazon has really good Healthcare benefits as well as leave benefits. Including maternity and parental leave. Hourly rate isn't as good as most other warehouses though, which is a huge down side. Local HR is pretty much pointless. You call a call center for 99% of your questions or concerns with your job. It's ridiculous. But overall it's not terrible and super worth the insurance and stock."
good,"More and more people keep getting shoved into the tiny back third of an old walmart at this call center. The more people they shove in the more expendable they treat the employees.  The place is swarming with middle management whose job it is to ""motivate"" the employees but it comes off as demeaning, especially considering they get paid more but don't actually do any customer service, just tell the people that do to do it faster and better. A depressing job that is at least good for steady money.  Not a lot of money, but a steady income."
good,Very difficult company to work for. Your just a number they don't care about anything but there numbers and bonuses.I have too work two other hobs just to make ends meat. They finally gave us a dollar raise but it isn't enough... Especially since I do the job of a tier 3 associate and get paid as a tier 1.
good,"Boring long days, strict about time off task like some times females need to use the restroom for personal hygiene and get in trouble for taking too long."
good,"Learned how to operate Heavy machinery"
good,Amazon is a very customer and associate eccentric company with continued growth and amazing benefits. The management positions are great for anyone who has just graduated college.
good,The manners of some people and manager how they lie to your face when all they have to do is day I don't know instead of change the subject and walked off
good,"When I envisioned working for Amazon, I got a good feeling. But this company is by far one of the worst to work for. From the mandatory overtime, to the physical need to perform, to the stress about keeping your rate up, to the inability to accommodate employees when they are sick. Yes, Amazon seems to give you a good amount of hours to take off of work, but in reality its 8 days a year."
good,Very physically demanding and they call overtime whenever they want with very little notice.  I feel like my age is preventing me from moving jobs within the company.
good,Engineers are talented and some of the problems are quite interesting to solve which have major business impact  but most of the time you are maintaining systems instead of building one and too much office politics in management side
good,"If you don't have a family and if you live at home with your parents and don't mind sucking up, then this is the place for you. Other than that, don't waste your time. Everyone is out for themselves."
good,"Asked to work to high pase with unreachable goals while sticking to health and safety regulations. "
good,I felt like I was working on a plantation because of how some Managers talked to you as well as how they treated employees. I was terminated in June 2016 for not making a tac time.
good,"Amazon is a rough place to work, you stand 10 hours a day on your feet and they expect you to pack 120 plus packages.  "
good,This is not a merit based company. They work you very all day while you are rated on performance. Pay isn't good for work expected. Very short breaks with constant monitoring to account for 'time off task'.
good,This job has  high turnover rate forcing everyone to worry about their jobs. The management only cares about meeting numbers and not about the people meeting them.
good,"Apart from the wages being decent the rest is awful. "
good,I love my job but the training well it doesnt exsit its just a bunch of videos and being rushed and having to remember everything... I get no benefits because I am seasonal and we are suppose to get a seasonal bonus check which is 1 dollar for every hour you work in november december and january and the only way u dont get it is if you quit or get fired well it seems like now that its at the end of the season they are trying to push us to quit so they dont have to pay us the bonus
good,"menial work that robots will be doing some day soon. "
good,"This job required an extreme amount of energy and time. You work 12 hours of strenuous shift with barely a break or lunch. You have no social life, at all."
good,if you need a job this is the place to go not a place you want to get comfortable. I worked there for about 8m and couldn't wait to get out of there just didn't like long hours
good,The most horribly run place I have ever worked at.  The compensation is good but don't expect to see your family in July or after thanksgiving.
good,Job advancement takes 2 years. Very low pay for warehouse labor. Short hours of 4 per day. Not the kind of job to be looking forward to working.
good,A Typical Physical Labor Demanding Warehouse Job.. Temporary Work For A College Kid Who Is Trying To Find A Quick Source Of Income.
good,Nothing interesting about it. A typical work day. A lot of walking. You get two five minutes break. They say fifteen but reality it's five.
good,A typical day at amazon was always depending on who was your manager and what job you had. I learned nothing there really we did the same basic things everyday for 12 hours. My co-workers where the best part of the job they made me feel like some days the job was the best job in the world. The hardest part of the job was probably the hours we work. The best part of the job was the pay and the overtime they gave you.
good,"Die Arbeitszeiten waren eher unflexibel."
good,"I have worked there for the last 3 months only to experience complete chaos and untruth. The pressure to perform and rhetoric displayed in what is called ""stand up"" is a phenomenon within itself. It was not at all the company I imagined it would be. The inner workings of the company is the reason for the overwhelming turnover rate. A typical day is that you are expected to show a small space with an another person called ""team stowing"" and that person is someone they pick and the union may not be cohesive; but, you must complete the task anyway. The management is relying your flaws or your lack to meet the goal without taking into consideration the following variables; one bin, one scanner and two ppl; another party unwillingness to work as a team; height, condition of the bin, heat, the supply of work etc. This job created a adverse stressful environment that hindered progress instead of motivation for increase of work. What I enjoyed is the ppl I formed a friendship with and meeting the goals set before me when I was only responsible for me; no team stowing. Breaks, lunch and any other down time was simply a joke...Amazon need to revamp their management, goals and strategies. It is not a sweat shop but, a formable company that should not only include consumers to serve; but, the associates in the building."
good,"typical day at work as a picker packer, wages not too good but there again you don't need much experience as a picker i got on well with work colleagues and work was only round the corner from my home."
good,"Entnahme von Waren und für den Kunden versandfertig"
good,"Long hours and lots of walking and not very good management, the pay is not great either, they seem to play favorites when it comes to promotions"
good,good team working towards targets energetic got to be fit management good team leaders good long shifts average wage cant make to much errors
good,"Big brand that provides awesome infrastructure and technologies to work on. "
good,"The first year was actually a good experience. I was one of the fortunate ones to be able to work in the Prep department. It ran smoothly efficiently and for the most part was not stressful. The WHOLE netwrork could take note of this and realize it was the management style that was DIRECTLY responsible for this. UPPER management here, would not HAVE THAT! How quickly changes were made to take that harmonious balance away. The constant revolving door of middle management does nothing to help this place. In fact as a direct result it creates more lost time and HUGE amounts of money that ANY other source of lost labor hours. Add in the indirect causes and you can no longer wonder why there are truly NO profits. WITHOUT all the local governmental tax breaks as well as the federal breaks this company would have gone out of buiness long ago. THANK YOU CORPORATE WELFARE ..  The pressure to continuously INCREASE your production WEEK OVER WEEK is ridiculous. This is not a stock measurement Humans and robots can only achieve so much efficiency esp in an atmosphere that is rife with operational and logistical inefficiencies. FIRE people for pretty much ANY reason they can make look good on paper. Including but not limited to outright lies and numbers manipulation. To clean ouse get new bodies in so they can receive another financial incentive from the government for hiring someone getting them off welfare or unemployment temporarily. There is NO review or vetting of aork habits or past work experience. Over all THE WORST JOB AND 2ND MOST STRESSFUL JOB I'VE EVER HAD. All for an entry level"
good,"I liked the fast paced environment, made a good amount of money, but the long drive coming from Dover pretty much took away the benefits of the cash"
good,"Amazon is an okay place to work if you are between jobs; however it isn't a job to make a career from.  It is too much micro managing.  If they managers let leave you alone to do your work, then it may be ok.  No morale in the facility.  It will sometimes interfere with your family life because of the long hours of overtime.  The benefits are great!"
good,Walking twenty miles a day. I learned how it is to work in a factory. I never got to talk to any of the co-workers. I enjoyed getting  my pay-check.
good,"For starters, it's a 10 to 11 hour workday depending on the situation. The managers they hire are 23 year old kids directly out of college, that those of us who have been there are forced to train. They do not promote from within unless they can't find anybody quick enough. Each workday is planned down to the last second to get orders out in time, leaving no room for mechanical or human error. None of the various departments talk to each other so each has their own way of doing things and that ALWAYS interferes with each departments daily routine. Co workers are usually in a terrible mood because everyone is watched very closely and intimidated with write ups so everyone is in a mad rush to keep up with rate plans, which causes various safety incidents throughout each building. Also after 3 years of service there are no more raises so each employee loses incentive to really care about anything more than what they are made to do each day."
good,I was responsible for putting away returned products and process damage items. The management was okay and the co-workers was easy to get along with. The job wasn't hard and they never did anything fun during the time I was there.
good,I found it to be a pretty stressful job at time but also a cool calm and collected environment. Knowing that your assignment could be up at any moment was very hard on a lot of us. There is a lot of walking so be prepared for a workout everyday. Making rate will be the hardest at first but just give it your all.
good,Work as Amazon varied from really fun to downright awful. There was always what seemed to be a revolving door among management and no stayed in any position(or in the same building) for more that a few months.
good,"my day involves of loading and unloading carts full of items. I learned how to work at a steady pace and the management were tough at times.l but they worked with me and my great co-workers. the hardest thing about the job was walking 10-15 miles a day, but the best part about the job was the workout"
good,All you are is a number. How many items did you scan today? I did learn how to use a handheld computer and work towards an unreachable goal. The hardest part of the job was expected to be work like a robot. The best part of the job is you got to see all the new items coming out for the year.
good,"Made sure that the shop floor was always up to date and did a stock rotation every week, served customers and did till work."
good,The only way to advance there is to be willing to step on others and have no empathy or think for yourself. The pay and benefits aren't too bad and for the most part the people are good people until you get into upper management. The most enjoyable part of the job is the three day weekends and the hardest part is having to look over your shoulder in fear of the perception of doing something wrong. It was a good opportunity to get to know about and work on the types of equipment that they have.
good,"There's a distinct lack of managerial oversight at Amazon because you're your own manager, in a sense. You need to fight for your position to stay on, and a lot of people don't see their contracts renewed. There's a ridiculously high turn over rate, and only around a 25% contract to full-time hire conversion rate. Work-life balance depends on the projects you're on and can shift drastically every few months because projects tend to last that long. Lost of moving around; I moved 4 times in the same building during 9 months. Also lots of internal transfers; the team you start with one week could look completely different the next week as managers, TPMs, etc. move to different departments."
good,no job security. they were constantly hiring and firing groups of people.
good,"Very hard work"
good,"muita atençao no ambiente de trabalho. Aprendi a ser cuidadoso, antecioso e agil. Colegas de trabalhos muitos legais apesar do estresse causado pelo ambiente de trabalho. Organizaçao do estoque. A parte mais agradavel do trabalho e a hora do intervalo."
good,"typical day was a quick meeting about the shift,then its picking items for different customers.I learnt how to setup and use a scanner and read the different lables and i realised i can do different kinds of work.The management were nice and helpful so were my co workers there was not a hard part of the job but i did enjoy keeping busy and the lunchs."
good,Scanned and picked mershandise for customers.worked an 12 hour shift with very productive people.
good,"unwürdige Behandlung, Stress, kein Arbeitsklima, wird zuviel verlangt"
good,"The actual work at Amazon is fairly easy, it's a smooth job to learn overall. However, some of the management there is what makes the job slightly difficult."
good,"Working for Amazon had to be the most influential yet experimental company I’ve ever worked for. There’s lots of pluses and negatives for sure, you get paid $15.00 min, and your healthcare benefits cost next to nothing.  "
good,"I wouldn't work there even if they paid me millions as it was stressful, you were reprimanded for bathroom breaks that  lasted more than one minute, if you had a proper meal at lunchtime, you practically had to rush it just so you wouldn't be late back and basically had to give yourself indigestion just to please them, and they made it feel like it was your fault if you ended up sick"
good,"I took this position as a part time student, thinking it would be easy and flexible. It was neither. Workdays meant 10+ hours of work, two 15 minute breaks that were paid yet you clocked out for them (not really paid). The workload was over the top, you cannot imagine how much they expect. Whether it is a small envelope or a 75lb large box, you were given 200+ items a day with 150-175 stops typically 3-5 mins from each other (based at 60mph which residential is 25mph) so you are setup to have a rough day everyday. Think hard before taking this on if you are a single parent like I am, babysitters don't like not knowing when you will be home!"
good,"A great place to make decent amount of money. However this job is not for everyone. They work long hours, 10 hours everyday and 11 hours when we have a lot of work. They work 4 days a week. I loved this job however they need to improve there management team. Some of the people working there have a lot of potential and work hard yet others don’t work at all but it seems like the managers don’t care about that. They don’t seem to pay attention to those who work well and do not get appreciated for there hard work."
good,"best company to work, but process vise can be organised better and  review a employees performance fairer and better way."
good,You work all day never have Time for yourself. And they put to much on a person.you can have 322 packages and it can be 193 stops and they want you to get that all off whether you start at 10:30 or 11:00am
good,Good company but I only drove box trucks which didn't pay me well at the time. I was working 2 days a week and the pay was lousy. I would drive from Ashland to Alexandria
good,"My opinion about a typical day at work, what i learned, about management, about workplace culture? It's sub par. The hardest part of the Job was the pay."
good,Grazie a questa opportunità di lavoro ho imparato ad usare la pistola laser barcode
good,Management pretty much treated you as a number and not a person. They were more worried about people’s performances than they were with the health and safety of the employees
good,"Worked for them at the Call centre in Edinburgh. "
good,"You had to run all the time to get to the next product you had to pick. The managers kept stress people about hitting unreasonable targets. It wasnt a easy working for amazon at all, they didnt care about the employees."
good,"Working at Amazon was okay , management sucks, poorly run management, they were un organized,  and talk too associate rudley , travel to the job location sucks ,, Amazon is truly overrated"
good,pero solo te dan 15 minutos para descansar y cuando llegas al area ya han pasado 4 minutos
good,"This is a slave orientated company with a  customer obsession. This company doesn't care about their employees ,they only seek financial gain like the rest of there competition. The employees are underpaid and have to work long hours on their feet. This is a selfish organization."
good,"Stressful and low paid, graveyard shift, no work life balance, culture is good but management will make you feel other way around. However, it good platform to upskill yourself."
good,It's a good job to get to the next level meaning take the experience and move forward to a company who will appreciate your hard work..No matter bj omw good you do the job there is always a problem
good,amazon have a big issue on safety becouse they tell to all associate as safety is first but is not first for amazon is quantity after is quality and after is safety
good,They fired a man when he had a heart attack. During the convulsion he fell over the Kiva line. Repeatedly over the management radio they asked if he was faking because they didn't want to go to the third floor and check on him.
good,"Travail de chauffeur livreur, il faut être dynamique motivé"
good,I witnessed two people collapse from exhaustion on the job.No room for advancement whatsoever in the warehouse. Management is very clicky and you cannot get into club if you are not in management or know anyone from there.
good,"This place does not know what a hard worker is, they treat people like robots and have no remorse to people that have busted their butts for almost three years, day in and day out"
good,"Doing Seasonal only. I like that it's 3x a week. Dislike brakes are all unpaid. Brakes are a joke, they comense from ur last scan & u must scan again within that alloted time otherwise it counts against u. Reason why is a trick is bc it takes approximately 5 mins sometimes more depending on where ur station is 2 get 2 the break area so walking back & forth is about 10 mins. Essentially making ur break a lot shorter which means ur literally on ur feet 90% of ur shift. First 2 weeks are by far the worse if ur physically not used to it. It takes about a month 2 get used 2 it. THEY CONSTANTLY talk/remind/checkin with u about ur numbers & let everyone one know about being terminated at every team huddle if they fall behind on their numbers. Overall I reccomend this job if u need immediate income as they don't do interviews."
good,Management was a bunch of cut throat people  would recommend that you stay clear away from this place favoritism is a big problem there as well not a good place
good,"Fate entrare gente che ha inventiva, e se ha un opinione ascoltatela, non solo lavoro lavoro ! e poi chi se ne frega tutti a casa, ci vuole più inventiva, idee !!!"
good,"Run from this place I cannot write 150 words about this place - they talk about safety, and work the people to death, I was desperate so I took this job, what a hole, do not work here ; you might die on the job:"
good,"un peu physique et fatiguant, très bonne ambiance."
good,Good working environment and the management is also very supportive and all the co workers are also very supportive and all play and work as a team and the good place.
good,Amazon is the best of job in the world  I was working amazom picker parcker stowing but that time am sick then I left the job by my self naw am file better that way  I need back to work
good,"Amazon can be fun. It's also very enticing and from the outside looks like an almost perfect place to work. Depending on the dept you work with, you may face mandatory overtime hours during the holidays, the vacation/time off packages aren't nearly as good as other companies, you don't get stock options until you've been there for 24 months, and promotions are rarely given on merit. You will have to perform at a very high level to be considered for promotions and raises, and you will have to interview for internal promotions/title changes for the most part-which is standard for employers the last 20 years. The discount is extremely limited, and if you do actually use it, you'll burn thru the limit in a couple of purchases. The metrics can be very stressful, so if you're not super goal oriented, this will not be the place for you."
good,"Very stressful, breaks and lunches are very short for the amount of time spent working.  The pay is not worth the amount of work put in on a daily basis."
good,Upon starting work is a wait period of receiving an order which sometimes is a wait of 15-20 minutes.  While shopping I’m learning the store and where items are located as I shop. Sometimes if I can’t find an items another Amazon Shopper assist by telling me where the item is located at. I enjoy working as a shopper at Amazon because I can work at my own pace.
good,Some military jerk who thought he could drag people around physically. HR didn't do anything except make him take off for a week and a half. Monotonous job.
good,"This job is good for someone with no skills.  they will hire you without checking your work history. they don't care about your skills."
good,Very competitive place to work that does not foster collaboration. The most vocal people are promoted and this company does not value compassion and kindness.
good,"Nu conteaza omul, ci cantitatea de munca pe care o depune si atat."
good,"Don't expect to advance here. This is a job where you work to dig yourself out of a hole or just to get by. When I first walked through the door of this Fulfillment Center, I was told that this was essentially equivalent to high school in which it is. Just come to work, keep your numbers up on stow, and move away from stow as fast as possible because that's how you get fired. Just learn how to maneuver around the b.s and you'll be okay."
good,Top notch customer focus but relentless pursuit of innovation and drive for improvement. Challenging work environment.Large and complex organization with a very unique culture.
good,There are very long hours and hard to balance home life with work hours. It is fast paced and you have to keep up your pace.  You are standing or walking all day.
good,"Not a great working environment, Very toxic and abusive. The Job training was really bad and i was not prepared to do this job because it was physically demanding. There is a reason why they offer healthcare, because it is very hard on your body afterwards. Expect to lift 10,500 lbs throughout the day in very humid hot temperatures with only a 30min break. Too many expectations and not enough team work."
good,"very Fast Paced "
good,It was a very easy interview and hiring experience. Full time work is very exhausting on your feet.  Peak hours and Holidays require overtime. Not enough unpaid or paid time off without having consequences of being fired.
good,"High turnover rate is likely due to Management's treatment of employees. Training is done through indimidation and criticism rather than encouragement. The work itself isn't really difficult, getting help to learn the basics of the job is the most difficult part"
good,"Their motto was ""Work Hard, Have Fun and Make History."" For the record,I never had any fun. 40 hours in 4 days is tough, though the shifts went by quickly. Overtime hours made it 55 hours in 5 days for Peak Season was far too much. "
good,It was alright for the most part. Pay was ok benefits were nice. Management sucked for the moat part. HR was a nightmare. When i left they locked me out of my account so i couldnt fill out my paperwork in case i wanted to yo bavk
good,The rates are to high. They expect to much with little space. The benefits are good but that’s about it.the area managers are lazy. It’s like being in high school all over again.
good,The work is grueling and dirty. The corporate emphasis is almost entirely geared toward negative re-inforcement. Favouritism and cronyism play a major role in determining who advances .
good,After hire it was immediately clear that unless you get into this position with overqualified credentials there is no way to possibly advance beyond your position. It ended up being a waste of my time.
good,"Overall, it is a good company to be employed with. Compensation and benefits are great. Met a lot of great people. Physically demanding workplace. Hours are not ideal for workers with children and families."
good,"I start in November as a seasonal, 9 months later and we still as seasonal. This means, no benefits. Every time is more and bigger packages to deliver, nombre one around the nation, breaking our numbers most of the time, for nothing. No rewards!!"
good,"I worked for Amazon for about 2.5 years"
good,"The hours are limited to about 20-30 and it changes on a weekly basis. Shifts are on a first come first serve basis which has to be picked up on a website, so it's not easy picking up the maximum weekly hour cap  with the only set schedule is your first 2 weeks of training, "
good,They never told you what your goals were until you were written up. The managers were not professional and the goals were not realistic especially if there was a issue you could not control
good,Working here is an easy task. The most difficult part is trying to fight for available hours. It is also a daunting task to go online EVERYDAY at 6:15pm to try and get hours which can go as fast as 10 seconds. We all have lives and cannot stop it everyday to try and get work. A better way to ensure a reasonable amount of hours needs to be taken care of.
good,Fun workplace  and a great place to start as  a fresher. Have fun work hard and make history is the tag line. Amazon offers growth opportunities for freshers and is a good starting place for those who wish to start their careers in the customer service industry. A place to experience corporate multi national company culture and atmosphere.
good,My peers was great management was horrible over worked us and expected to much and rewarded those who broke the rules to get higher rates. Management never understood the lower level employees
good,"Amazon is a very fast paced work place. Management is lacking and they have so many managers that do not communicate with each other it makes working there really hard. If you have a family, you almost never see them because you work 10 hours each day and when you get home you are so tired you cant do anything but relax a few minutes , eat dinner and go to bed. It takes a very strong person to make their numbers each day and is very stressful and a physically body draining job. When you leave each night , you can hardly walk to your car because your back and legs are hurting so bad from trying to get the high rate numbers each day they expect from everyone."
good,"You are constantly pushed to do better, be faster and they couldn't care less about quality!  Management changes almost weekly and the work load is ridiculous.  You are on your feet 12 hours a day and overtime is mandatory or you are fired!  The average employee lasts 3 weeks - if you are a robot, this job is for you!"
good,"they most hire seasonal employees and landing a perm. position is a struggle. working condition are also horrid. very hot in the winter, minimal breaks and long shifts"
good,"As they say it's not Christmas everyday neither it is PrimeDay everyday, well not all employees are compensated fairly."
good,5out of10.  I wouldn't  recommend  this  job  to my  friends  or  family. This  is  the place  to  work  if  you  don't  have  any  other  choices in  your  life.
good,lean a lot there to many people for them self you have to walk on egg shell you make one mistake you are out the door the right hand don't know what the left is doing
good,"Pros: good benefits, easy to move up if you have the right people in your corner, meet some great people and make friends"
good,Hours are long. Not much support from management. Almost no opportunity for advancement. Minimum requirements for rates of processing items is difficult to maintain.
good,"Zero work/life balance, expect to do the work of two people for at least 15% less money than you'd make anywhere else, especially if you're an admin. Most EAs do not have children/partners or social lives. Want a promotion? Expect to further double your workload just to ""prove"" you can do it."
good,"Amazon is a very fast moving and high energy company. Because of this they sometimes leave the employees out. The good thing about Amazon, however, is that you have set hours that only change dramatically during their peak season. at amazon, you know when your work and when you don't because everyone sticks to one schedule for the most part"
good,"I would recommend choosing a different Amazon division than Fresh. Except for entry level employees without a college degree, there is no reason to join Amazon Fresh. The business in the Midwest region (and probably others as well) is a loser. "
good,The program as they would call it says that you should be able to pull a unreal number of units and eventually u fall behind and get terminated the forklift u drive in pick department can only go so fast and u can not control high traffic and the unrealistic demands of the company made this one of my least favorite work places
good,"Can't complain on the $15.00 per hour. Management doesn't treat people well though. I talk to my dog better than I have been spoken to by some managers at Amazon, and I am not kidding. Work is hard and tedious but doable. They change shifts and ""force"" you to take it or quit. High turnover and Amazon wonders why. Met some great fellow employees while I was there. All of them quit because of the way the facility management treated people. The ""Ambassadors"" were a joke. Most were big ego types, who were all talk but did not work hard. They had favorites who wouldn't work hard but nothing was said. Not a good way to run a business."
good,Very physical environment with high expectations they treat their employees as numbers not people no direct hires must go thru temp agency then not guaranteed offer to go perm
good,"I was a process assistant for 3 years, the stress from upper management and treatment takes a huge toll on you. Associates were great but not worth it"
good,"Con:"
good,"I decided to apply at amazon and they had seasonal position open that was part time and I applied for a scheduled shift and once I finished training I found out I was on varied schedule and the only way I can work a shift is if i sign up for voluntary extra time on the employee portal online, the shifts on the portal rarely available and when they are it's usually overnight and only 4 hours too."
good,"Compensation is fair, not many chances to advance your career.  The people are nice, but the way management treats the employees is unreasonable.  Pay is even across the board based on seniority and position, so there is no incentive to go above and beyond."
good,"was able to work at home, however management communication was not that great. didnt really enjoy this for a very long time. enjoyed talking with new people and helping them out with daily online challenges."
good,They fix it where you are at fault no matter what you do to prevent having packages stolen after you have delivered it I’ve had guns pulled out on me because they thought I was there to rob them 8/9 at night I’ve had people think I was soliciting without even looking to see that I was there to deliver something they ordered I’ve been pulled over by the police because someone called them and whoever generates the route has you going in and out the same neighborhood several times and I cannot lie that does look suspicious I’ve had dogs sicked on me there are routes without a nearby bathroom 11 miles was the longest I have driven to get to a bathroom they say take a 30 minute break but sometimes it’s impossible because if you stop you may not finish your route or you may get behind then they will send a rescue and that effects your drivers score there are several things that need to fixed and no matter how many complaints you make it will never change
good,"I feel like this jobs best suited for really hard working people, as I personally felt a lot of pressure with meeting the targets, and I know that many other people felt the same."
good,"Too much stress for rates. Mamagers always getting on for your rates. Need water spiders to help/assist packers get supplies."
good,The management sucks at my location they never considered people who is injured or has a disability they expect you to work full shift even when you dont feel good
good,"If you go into this job understanding the rug can be pulled out from under you anytime - you'll do well, and will tolerate environment while searching for another job."
good,"Trabajo entretenido y buenos compañeros. Los descansos eran de 30 minutos pero tenías que recuperar 15 de ellos. El nivel de exigencia era alto y fomentaban la competitividad entre compañeros. Antes del comienzo de cada jornada nos reuníamos para hablar y resolver dudas y realizar estiramientos para evitar posibles lesiones. Organizaban concursos a menudo y daban premios, de vez en cuando amenizaban el descanso con alguna actuación y también nos sorprendían con meriendas gratis para todos. Fomentaban que la gente compartiera coche y así contaminar menos y lo premiaban con plazas preferentes de aparcamiento, también se celebraban los cumpleaños y nos reuníamos para celebrarlo"
good,It's very difficult to have a company culture when no one stays for more than 2 -3 months. Some do but not many. Also the training is spotty and breaks are short for the hours you work.
good,Great company to work with great benefit but hard on work life balance and culture is a back stabbing culture. good opportunity to learn but very stressfull
good,"Pour ma part j’ai travaillé chez amazon en intérim pendant presque 1 an. "
good,"Passer toute une journée à transporter des cartons vide afin de les poser sur un convoyeur est très rébarbatif. "
good,Contrainte de travail difficile suite à une productivité toujours croissante.
good,Rád pracují v amazone ale manažeři by mohli se víc věnovat zaměstnancům než aby ich odpalkovali od sebe doporučil bych aby se chovali lépe než teď
good,No career opportunities and very poor management. Everything was awfully organized at the sortation center I was working at in Miami Gardens. Building is old
good,"If you're just looking to work for ten hours straight for four days a week, it's alright. You will work, and you will work hard. Productivity is king. They will squeeze every last ounce of work out of you that they can, and the work you do with mostly be boring, very boring. For long, extremely fast paced days, wear something broken in and comfortable on your feet because they're gonna hurt for the first few days."
good,"no work is guaranteed you have to stay on the app hours at a time just to get a shift. overall you will eventually quit for sure after you realize there is no hope for a simpler workload, accidents in traffic were quite common due to such minimal delivery times or you lose your job."
good,"Has become very unfair n biasist management selection."
good,It's a good job but managers are mostly straight out of college and dont have a actual clue on how to run a crew because they have no life experience.
good,"depending on location it can be very good or very bad, and employees are very much expendable. not very Canadian born friendly. great full time hours and overtime"
good,Great job for young students looking for a part time job and have zero previous work experiences. Great place to start work and gain knowledge and experiences of organizing and preparing customer services and while also communicating and recommending customers with substitutions for any items listed were out of stock!
good,"Not the best place to work.  You are only a number.  There are a hundred people waiting for your job.  So, they could care less if you leave or they fire you."
good,"The job was repititious. You sort and place customer packages to pallets. Easy. The hard part is they expect 150 -200 packages per hour. You compete with other co-workers some what. The real down part about the job was the way this group of supervisors treated the new workers. Several would test you doing intentional things like one time the supervisor took the sorter away and the line packers so there was only 2 people on an entire line.  One pregnant women and me. It was very stressful. I went home VTO. I can scan 200 packages an hour...but there was enough workers. I just had had enough.  Clicks, schemes & plots. I saw and heard so many unkind things. Use blinders and you can make it. I for Godshake don't speak up...""they"" will figure a way to get rid of you...so beware! Be nice. Be quiet...you will survive it."
good,"Did various jobs working there but wasn't happy with the rate and manager. Supervisors look at numbers more than the employees. Also, good luck going to the washroom as your rate will go down..."
good,They overwork you and they don't care about employees. Hard to advance. It's good if you are looking for a quick start. They don't require much training
good,"I worked as a sub-contractor through one of the companies within the Amazon warehouse. I delivered packages in different areas in the state. Each day was about 10 hours and if it snowed on your scheduled day and you called out, high chances you didn't have a job to come back to. The company that I worked for had a turnover rate that was so high every 3 months a new wave of drivers was working routes. I applied to work directly for Amazon but ended up taking a different position with another company. The job that I applied for was vey low entry but it was so I could get my foot in the door. Amazon as its own company to work for, has potential to grow but if I needed to depend on the check solely to live off of I would not be able to afford to live. The $16.74 per hour was what I made as a driver. To start out working for Amazon the pay was 14.50 an hour."
good,Thanks For letting me go. Got let go with no contact. No room for advancement. Mangement treats you as expandable and replacable. would never work there again
good,If they train better it would help. Its an okay job just stressful at times. There are good and bad day more bad than good they just need some  Improvements
good,A regular day at work in not bad due to picking my own hours and being alone.I learned how to focus on my mission as a independent contractor and make sure every costomer is satisfied.its nice to see everyone work together to make sure packages are organized and ready to be shipped out.The hardest part of the job is maintainting a good car to fit the position and not being able to due to pay.the most enjoyable time at work is being recognized and respected by ppl on the streets. but i want more...i want to work mornings and work inside warehouse organizing packages or driving for amazon
good,"When I first got hired I was very excited about the job.  Training was okay but it didn't prepare you for the calls you were going to get.  Most customers that call don't want to hear ""I'm sorry to hear there is a problem with your order""  Most customers want resolution.  I totally understand.  Most of the things we learned in training I can't even recall.  There are some members of management who act like they don't want to be bothered with the CSA or the customer.  They feel that you should be trained to handle it.   How can I be trained to handle it if I've only been taking calls for two weeks.   Customers also nee to read their emails or other information received from Amazon.  Some of the answers to your questions are contained in the email.   Customers need to be more patient with CSA, we are not responsible if your package is late or missing,  if your item doesn't work.  These situations are like the weather, we have no control over these things."
good,A typical day at work is clocking in and working non stop. Getting yelled at even if you are doing your work right.  No compassion for workers if they see they need a break.
good,Amazon is the worst job I have ever had. Management has no people skills or experience dealing with people.  You work hard and are forced to work overtime when ever they want you to.
good,I started taking calls the minute I got to work and it never stopped. Customers were rude and vulgar at times bordering on abusive. We were expected to take the abuse.
good,Poor management with poor training. Managers were not trained to actually train team members. It was hard to learn anything from people that didn't know what they were talking about and changed their minds every hour of training because they misinformed you.
good,"Firstly as an employee of Amazon we were told specifically NOT to say anything bad about the company to ""outsiders"" and OF COURSE they WILL deny that, however A LOT of the Youtube stories about people losing their jobs for going to the bathroom (Time Off Task) and what they had to do are true. The company claims to be ""customer Obsessed"" meaning that you will be reprimanded for NOT being at your assigned stations, IF you have to relieve yourself and it takes more than 5 minutes you WILL be reprimanded NOT at all considering that some people walk slower than others and most restrooms are not closely convenient to everyone... I have to remind myself that Amazon is a ""job"" and NOT a ""career"" because if U do not have a COLLEGE degree, you can only go but SO far. Management, are Usually hires with college degrees with NO leadership experience, and many have NO ""People Skills""... The BEST part of the job is that associates come from ALL walks of life and the bond and friendships we have working with one another. I don't want to sound unappreciative for Amazon has brought a lot of jobs back to Baltimore.. I thank them for that."
good,A decent part time place to work. No career advancement opportunities. No raises for anyone. No full time positions ever become available in the warehouse
good,"Great if you are solely career focused. Not flexible to employee needs, business needs outways life needs. Can be a great company to promote through, however, you may also have to work nights for years and years."
good,"My manager was horrible didn't meet his workers needs,  barely had any shifts amazon has way to many workers and way less shifts available. Barely had any breaks"
good,"Probably very common at Amazon. You got great coworkers, but that's pretty much all about it. No benefits whatsoever. Incompetent managers. No work-life balance. Politics."
good,"Long and lots of standing, counting walking and not enough time for lunch. Typical work day didn't like working weekends. The work you do should be paid more. Hardest part of the job lifting heavy buckets."
good,"I've been with Amazon for about 11 months.  It's not a stressful job, but it's just that a job.  This wouldn't be a place to look for a career unless you are a programmer or great at something that's internet based.  For people like me going to school for something that Amazon isn't involved in it's just a job."
good,You don't have time to go to the bathroom or eat lunch for most who work at Amazon. The management are young right out of collage and have no experience in managing people.
good,"I feel for any associate at amazon. You are just a number and all they care about is your rates. The repetition is so boring, you walk for 10hrs. When they are busy its not so bad but when they are slow, they offer you Voluntary time off. But if you chose to stay, it becomes very difficult."
good,Amazon gave me an opportunity to experience the first hand lifestyle and experience needed for me to grow and develop into my career within the two years there I was able to learn so much in my field of study.
good,cuthroat and managment is against the people they only care about the bottom line. they are always changing their standards to lose people they know will fail in whatever they are told they need to learn
good,"Management drops the ball left and right constantly. Lack of foresight on everything and this attitude tends to roll downhill and affect how other employees behave."
good,Offer payout for self termination management do not treat employees as equal but as we our less than them and to offer after go though there temp service to take little money to quit and not able come back shows its a revolving door job
good,"they hire through staffing agencies and use temps, treating them badly then throwing them away like garbage. Only a few people who know the management get hired permanently"
good,"Fluctuating volume of orders throughout the year,many 3hr shifts during slower periods.Frequently changing Supervisors,Mgmt-employee communication is lacking>"
good,"Not a very good place to work, bad hours, low employee morale, horrible training. When you are hired you are told what you will be doing. If you do not perform well at your assigned job, instead of find a position you will succeed at, they write you up so you cannot transfer to a different area of the company."
good,It was a fast paced nice work environment. The management staff was very hands on and people friendly. They took the time to ensure the employees were well trained before releasing them to the production floor.
good,"Incredibly competitive in block acquisition. One must stare at their personal device for hours on end to get the right to work for what seems like a good wage, but is not after excessive miles and car care."
good,It is a good job for family life and for money. The management team is good and cares about workers. Good opportunity for growth. Hardest part of job is time.
good,"Felt like PRISON never been. If I had, Amazon would be a perfect description. After the aggravation the employment is OUTRAGEOUS, UNDERPAID, OVER WORKED."
good,"If you need a job, and can stand for 10 to 12 hours on concrete floors, and work very fast, without thinking, then you could do it for a while, until you are able to find something better."
good,"Very stressful job, especially during the holidays. Fast turnover. Lots of people couldn't handle the workload. Short breaks during shifts. No full time unless you applied for management or other positions. Usually wind up doing multiple jobs during your shift just to get home, otherwise they would set mandatory overtime."
good,the job is easy but if your computer messes up then you are responsible for the mistakes which can get you a write up or fired.  all the managers are not on one accord and have different rules for their shift.
good,the work is ok but the overage percentage was unrealistic and no opportunity for advance at all. They hire people who they want for management and not employees who have worked in that role for at least 2 years.
good,"A place for good professional growth with little or no space for personal life."
good,Not a bad place if youre content as a little person with no voice. cutthroat environment.everyone for themselves. No teamwork. Lack of knowledge on mechnics part for taking care of equipment. Lazy mechanics who want opoerators to fix it themselves
good,"Amazon is always changing.  We could not exceed a number of work hour per week, the work hours were limited per week.  Some (not all) managers are not that helpful when dealing with employees needs.  "
good,it was a great first job. Great hours and great pay but the long distance travel was draining making the work load tough and tiring when handling the long hours.
good,you are not a person to them you are an asset until they decide otherwise.   do not expect to advance quickly an don't believe the sugar coating they try to feed you
good,Never had a physical person to speak with about things that were going on and needed addressed. Had requested for certain shift that was being offered but was given a completely different shift that I wasn't available for.
good,"Its really an amazing job, I enjoyed coming into work to do my job, but the unreasonable demands from the people of amazon make it pleasurable. I was lucky enough to have a phenomenal manager at the time being but the culture unfortunately ended in losing his job. As a maintenance tech I enjoyed what I learned and practiced daily, I learned alot that I can take with me further in my career."
good,"The entire course of my work at Amazon was very stressful. When dealing with customers, nine out of ten times they were yelling and angry that their package was not there. This can get to a person quickly. The problem is that it is competitive as to how fast you can handle customers, making the need to have good reviews as well as good time of completion, which is difficult to do when a customer will not quit arguing and fighting with you about returns/refunds, or that their package is late while there is nothing that can be done."
good,Management is poor with day and night shift
good,"Amazon is a very impersonal company to work for. Your bosses don't know who you are at all. They company has unrealistic expectations of employees. You are treated as a ""robot"" and not as a human being. The company is always hiring because they are always firing. Employees are let go out of nowhere and have no idea what they did to deserve their fate. They don't even have a phone number to call if your going to be late or sick. You just don't show up and the time is deducted from your UPT (unpaid personal time.) Also if you are 5 minutes late, the company deducts 1 full hour from you UPT. If you go over your allotted UPT you are fired automatically. These things were not a problem for me as I was always on time and at work. You are rated and must be ""on task"" every minute of your shift which means no bathroom breaks unless it is during your 30 minute lunch period. You are only given 30 minutes for lunch during a 12 hour shift. If a computer glitch, or human error causes you to be off task, you are penalized. This company DOES NOT CARE about the employees at all, They fire people in large ""batches"" and allow you to reapply in 90 days so that your company stock never vests. The pay and benefits are the only thing about the company that were OKAY. For the amount of work and pressure you are under to stay on task, the pay is not enough. Because of the constant fear of losing your job due to rate, the quality of work and morale suffers. I enjoyed the actual work that I did at Amazon, I did not enjoy the constant pressure I was under to complete that work based on the goals and quota"
good,I will never work here again. I worked here for over two years and the job advancement is horrible. The hours are terrible. Poor working conditions. Managers are terrible. They have no care for any of their employees. You are their work horse and they don't care if you fall over and die because they will replace you in a week.
good,"Had a low pick rate the day before Single Day Productivity Reports were going out. I was sick and went to AmCare, intending to just get over it and keep going, did not have a fever and just got some Dayquill, making me even more tired than I was."
good,"a typical work available from start to end of shift"
good,I would recommend this job to someone that needs a quick start job or that need health insurance. Health benefits start on your first day of training.
good,"Typical day was 10 hour shift but 12 hour work. 60+ hours per week and some meetings had to be attended on days off. Very little time to enjoy your free time."
good,"A typical day at work is a 10 hour shift, with a 30 minute unpaid lunch and 2, they call them 15 minute breaks, but they are really 10 minutes with a 2 1/2 minute travel time each way cause you have to walk a long way to get to break rooms.  I learned they are a very customer obsessed company, what they should be is employee obsessed, so those of us who have been there awhile wouldn't want to leave.  The management lately it terrible.  The hardest part of the job, is making the ridiculous rates they have set.  The most enjoyable part is the people and friends made along the way."
good,"Staff and Managermet wasn’t of same page, Mangers where not trying to get most employees and for such a big company like Amazon that’s should be priority however it didn’t personally effect me as I still worked my hardest and surpassed all my goals"
good,"Horaires tardives"
good,"Its a very stressful job always have to be on task making rate, rate was really high with no space stow. Managers had alot of favoritisims with certain associates"
good,"I was fired because my axle broke on my way to work, I live 30miles away and have never been late. They said I showed no effort to come to work, and refused to use my hours to cover my absence. If you do not DO WHAT THEY WANT WHEN THEY WANT IT, you will be fired with no remorse."
good,"long day full of non stop work"
good,"One day I was sick with the stomach flu and they wouldn't send me home because I didn't have the hours, so I had to throw up in a garbage can for 10+ hours."
good,"HR no help."
good,I took on amazon as a second job but I didn't last very long because it was a very tiring job. A lot of lifting with only a 10 minute break. I was only there for about 2 months until I started school again.
good,My coworkers were really nice but the management not so much. I worked every weekend which was not ideal.  The benefits are the only reason I stayed more then a week.
good,"A typical day at work is stressing about the fast paced environment and about making rate. Management definitely needs improvement, but overall the job gave me a chance to better myself and to continue looking for jobs to better my future."
good,"I enjoyed the people , there are many different cultures represented at Amazon. I had good managers during my employment but the environment in my department had degraded and I felt it better to move on to a different company. There is really no room for advancement at amazon and the harder you work the more demanding the company is of you but there is no additional compensation , while others are allowed to make the same pay and not do their job. I am interested in being part of a team that works together to allow a company to excel and being recognized for my contribution."
good,"cut throat and not a fun place to work they fire you before you can get your stocks and you are under stress it is a slave driving job "
good,be prepared to walk... ALOT!! I literally walked 10 - 12 miles a day. worked 10-12 hours a day 4-5 days a week. its really fast paced. must pick 180-280 items an hour depending on the items you were picking. people were great so it made the job better.
good,"A typical day at Amazon is quite tiring and stressful. The management is poor. You can never call off unless you have hours that they give you in your portal. So if you have no hours, and a family emergency comes up they more than likely will fire you, which is SO unfair. The pay is good, great benefits. Would not recommend"
good,management does not support workers only wants work done at any cost they will fire anyone who disagrees with their methods so be quiet work and leave
good,Human resources sucks don't know anything they are rude. Security at the building is a joke never would work there again. The work is like assembly line. They call overtime at a drop of dime
good,"Very demanding and fast paced job. Supervisors were young college kids who had no idea of how to run things. Long hours, heavy lifting. Supervisors had no concern for you, more interested in maintaining rate."
good,"Very fast-paced environment which allows you endless opportunity to grow and learn. However, there is a very steep learning curve that needs to be met head-on--don't expect to be able to relax at work."
good,It is an ok place to work. They do not pay enough a big company like Amazon should start off at about $14.00 an hour instead of  $12.00. The shifts are too long and you have to work Sundays.
good,the job was great just didn't like the fact of waking up the next day wondering if you still have a job over a mistake.the weekly rate sucks for anyone.
good,To be honest I wish I could've given it 2 & 1/2 stars. The work life balance is ok depending on if you're front half or back half days or nights. They can call mandatory over time pretty much whenever they feel like it with very last minute notice. You have to schedule your appointments and business around their needs not your own. More than half of the employees at my building left due to low wages and a refusal from HR to try and raise them. They are very insensitive to their employees when unforeseen events arise. Very hard to move up unless you are one of the Sr.Ops and Management favorites. Very low wages for the type of wok that you are required to do. I.e. $11.00 for driving and order picker and/or forklift for 10 hours a day. 30 minute lunches that pass too quickly and 15 minute breaks that are really 10 minutes due to your walk time being included and they are from scan to scan. On average it takes about 2 to 2 1/2 minutes to get from one side to another of the building. Poor communication among the senior leadership and the area managers. Senior leadership is quick to make a move that is poor in judgement and blame the area managers. There are some managers that really do not care about the associates and are strictly there for a paycheck. The work itself is not hard but can be a nuisance to get right if not trained by the right person. And can be very easy to get fired due to quality and production errors due to the previous.
good,"Amazon will take anybody off the street. If you operate a forklift/order picker, you will be paid the same as someone who scan items off a convey line."
good,"The benefits, schedule, and stock options were the only good things for working at Amazon. The discount is a joke, can not advance your career unless you have at least a bachelors degree, pay caps out at $13 no matter how long you work there."
good,"No work life Balance."
good,Very competitive place to work with limited advancement opportunities. Work there was stressful with an inability to recognize that or promote from withing.
good,"It's a job I could easily handle, but the management there was not so good. I worked overnight I am 19 saving money for school. Managers have favorites and always let them have the easiest task. So if you want those somehow always try to talk to the managers since the rule was everyone gets to rotate positions but the majority stay in one spot. Complain about how they want us to hurry but they just sit there and watch when they could help."
good,"Making safe deliveries, giving feed back about the package to the dispatcher if any, reattempting packages if there is no safe location to leave it and driving safe."
good,"Too many back stabbed and 2 faces children there easy work but mentally draining but met good mates there which makes the days go a bit better but it is like a prison keeping to a strict time for breaks, u have got to walk the whole legnth of the building for a 15 min break and u can't smile in the place"
good,"Ambiance très familial, question horaire c'est une semaine du matin, une semaine de l'apres midi (donc 5h40-12h20 & 13h20-20h30) il me semble ! Question sécurité il y a une formation sefety mais bon faire quand même attention à sa peau car poste à risque ... Tout de même il faut beaucoup de volonté et de motivation pour s'y sentir bien ! Pose de 30 minutes dont 10 min non payées."
good,"It is a very high paced, stressful place to work.  Upper Management has no communication with floor support. Over Time is called every week.  Safety issues with employees getting hurt on a daily basis. Poor work attitude with employees."
good,"Well payed transport secured , overtime availble , great team , well payed ovetrimes , 10 hour per working day , minimum 40 per week , allso night shift availble , better payed"
good,"Typical workday is generally taking packages from a conveyor belt, scanning it, placing it on a pallet, and scanning the package to the pallet. Repeat this process for 4-5 hours."
good,"Everyday you report to work these guys try to complicate  things for no reason. Amazon will bring out the worst in people in an effort to make ""rate"". The employees do not clean up after themselves, trash and cardboard everywhere. When the bell rings at the end of the day they are gone, leave the area a mess for the next person. This company takes average employees and puts them in leadership roles, resulting in declining quality year after year. I would never recommend this company. I have worked here for over 9 years and might be the biggest fool in the building."
good,"Great environment as far a warehouse is concerned, very diverse group of co workers. Every day is different. Great company benefits from day one! Stock options and college tuition assistance after time requirements are meet."
good,Looking for a new job as I was promised full time employment but was overlooked. Also looking for a new challenge and work closer to home. Also tired of doing constant nights
good,"Not a place you can grow at. They don't take your work ethic into consideration when applying to move up in the company, only who can answer the questions better."
good,"Learned how to get orders picked that customers order via online, learned that walking many miles can take a toll on the body, they did single out the older people from younger employees and I loved that the job was at night."
good,Amazon was an experience because it was around Christmas time and we had minimal training to be a stow there. A stow is a person who puts merchandise on the shelves to be picked by order filleers. It was like driving around a parking lot looking for a placed to park. There was no room for anything but it was unique.
good,"Because my wife and I sure did! The hours never added up, the money was never there. If that's not bad enough, they hire everyone as part time only, except for the warehouse manangers, who literally just graduated from a big name university with no managing experience. The set off a lot of us workers, since we had no degree, but years more of experience with the warehouse industry and with managing techniques."
good,"A typical day in the day of a life as an Amazonian would include coming into work already stressed about what surprises your superiors would throw at you. Management can not seem to agree with how company policy should be complied nor do they hold personal opinions about policies, management, and associates within themselves."
good,"developed my leadership skills and worked in leadership capacity, learned more about productivity from associate perspective, as well as a managers perspective, workplace culture, hardest part of job was the 10-hour shifts, most enjoyable part of the job was being competitive and meeting people from all walks of life."
good,"It was a learn as you go workplace, so some days were good and some days were bad. Most of the management was good, but they weren't there long enough to form bonds with because they would send them back to their original fulfillment centers."
good,"Typically on your feet all day and it involves a lot of hardwork and managers telling you not to go off task.they literally want you to work non stop except for breaks. No room for progress either. I have been there almost a year and everytime i put in my application for an indirect role, my application seems to have vanished. Unfair treatment."
good,Long 10hr days of standing on your feet as well as very strict and regimented work day. Quotas are enforced to keep processing up. They do not mess around with breaks and being back at your assigned areas on time.
good,"great people, very productive fast pace work. great experience is that you meet alot of new people sometimes almost every day. its a very tiring job if you are not in shape"
good,"worked too many 10 and 12 hour shifts over 4 different peak seasons, stayed all the way thru peak without ever being offered permanent employment."
good,"No todo es bueno, un poco engañosa en cuanto a la estabilidad laboral, le dicen a uno que se va a quedar permanente y al final es mentira."
good,a typical day was mostly aggrovanting i learned there how to use the rf gun and different pit. some of the people that work there are nice to work with
good,If you don't want to have a life outside of work this is the place for you! If your single or looking for any job possible apply there. it truly sucks.
good,"Ok place to work, bad hours with unclear volume for each shift really jacking up your day/night, people I worked with were cool but it becomes clear who works hard and who doesn't fast so associate yourself with workers who do good work and don't talk much cause they talk a lot. Upper management does not do follow up to issues promptly. Break is 15 mins (really it's 10) takes you 2-3 mins to walk to the break room, now count in restroom use, getting your food and actually eating it = no time, insult to injury they won't even leave you alone to gather your thoughts on break, they come thru the break areas to corral you back to the lanes way before your break is over, They say they like feedback but do not really listen. Advancement is possible but you almost have to beg one of the managers to consider you for anything outside of scanning. If you need a job go for it, just remember to keep your eyes open...."
good,"Some very great people here. There can however be issues with some of the superiors and micromanagement. Consequently this can cause stress and an agile environment. Due to the sheer scale of the company networking opportunities are vast, yet can be difficult to develop due to that very thing: the vastnes."
good,"okay place of employment. Shifts are 10 hour shifts, pro- three days off. Mandatory overtime is sometimes assigned to employees. Pay is not too bad, over time is time and a half for first 8 hours and double time for last two hours."
good,"Amazon can either be the best place for someone to work, or the worst. It all depends on who your manager is, and how they interact with associates. Also, it is a move up or move out employment opportunity. Meaning, that your pay will be capped at a certain amount depending on where you work (pay is based on regional cost of living and how competitors pay their employees). Also, be prepared to interview for every promotion you apply for, as they use the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) method of interviews."
good,"At the beginning it started as an 'OK' job to get through Christmas. January comes by and I'd gained more knowledge about the Amazon. They kept me on and I started learning new things and it made me feel as if I was apart of amazon and not just a temporary worker. They promised certain roles and positions and for a while I filled them (Supervisor/Manager) while being a temporary worker. Then I got screwed over and they looked to someone outside the company instead of allowing me to progress, even though I'd shown clear results while filling in as a Supervisor/Manager and showed that I was able to take on those responsibilities."
good,It was only holiday work that was offered. I enjoy helping customers with their purchases. But did not like how if you pay for prime you still might not get your product within a short time frame. Also had too many times of system default.
good,Employees are pretty much unappreciated on a daily basis. It is a very unorganized company the upper staff make it hard to catch up with them. Amazon offers as little help as possible.
good,"Training is half of one day. After that, you know exactly what to expect each day.  Scan bar codes and move items from a shelf to a tote."
good,"Abbastanza attenti alla sicurezza (a parte quando devi andare veloce allora li chiudono un occhio) fissati sulla produttività quando è pressoché impossibile dato che mancano carrelli e ceste. La pausa di sola mezz'ora che poi diventano 20 minuti è inutile e stressante. Molte volte non c'è meritocrazia."
good,"file clerk -proof reading writing ,copy paper, doing work file paper A to  Y. and Data Process  dots check on account deposit , copy paper ,pickup mail, pickup bag in money and check."
good,This place was all about walking miles and miles of warehouses. I had a bad knee so standing was just a nightmare let alone walking. They did give us breaks which were nice but unfortuantely for me it wasn't long enough for my feet to get used to the ridiculous amount of walking. I was also a seasonal worker who was told that I could become a permanent worker if I did a good job but later learned that no one who was seasonal was hired on to be permanent.
good,"The temp company at the time was very questionable, however, Amazon itself is a fine company. Its great for work experience and fast money. While I didn't have the best time at this company I did however enjoyed being able to afford christmas of 2015."
good,"You can never get a hold of HR, the company is about NUMBERS NUMBERS NUMBERS. If you are not in management, this company will work you down to the bone. You do not have a secure job even after the season, I would not recommend this job to anyone."
good,"good benefits but not a job to make a career out of, they treat their workers poorly. The management team needs some improvement and the pay is not worth the hours they are asking for.The co workers don't work together as a team and everybody is for their self.To me its a great job to start out from but not a job to stay for years.The only thing that's good about this job is the benefits one of the main reason why i still currently work their but the money doesn't support my family needs.The hardest part about this job is all the changes they make unannounced.,the relationship with the management team"
good,i enjoyed the pay at this job but company treats you like you are easily replaceable. either your fast or you don't have a job. great way to get extra cash during the holidays but don't expect full time position
good,"Uma empresa boa, poderia ser melhor se valoriza-se os funcionarios e desse mais oportunidades"
good,"direct sales team are the worst people around, will not recommend anyone for the 3P direct team in india headed by Nut , HR are just for namesake, no action taken by them"
good,"Although Amazon seemed to be a fun place to work, the work culture was not consistent and management seem to not have the knowledge of the company's policies and procedures. Amazon's fulfillment center had a very high turn over rate of employees due to dissatisfaction."
good,"Amazon pays very well, however the work ethic is really poor. There are limitations and it appeared those limitations were not effective."
good,Ok place to work hard going but can learn on various positions find your strengths and weaknesses. Co workers are friendly but not very forthcoming to make you welcome. Hardest part of the job is the walking for more than 10 hours. There s not much to enjoy as your on the go all the time.
good,fun and competitive fast pace working environment with a large amount of learning and growing opportunities within the company in itself.
good,"Fulfillment warehouse is not the place to work. If you want to work there, do so at the cost of your sanity and your ethics and morals. Amazon has favoritism that is rampant at the warehouse. If you work hard you may not get any other opportunities to advance in the department you work on. They are the kind of company that make you become a robot. Management does not care about you. When you tell management about anything that is wrong, they don't do anything about it(This includes safety issues). They are a numbers driven company, not a people company. I have many times told management that I want to do more at Amazon. But they never put me in any other opportunities to advance, So I say  if you want to work here, do so at your own risk."
good,"What job you get assigned to kind of determines how nice it will be. Most of the jobs are basic labor and there is little to no chance to move up to a better job unless you're willing to get 'personal' with the managers. The co-workers are good, the pay is good and the benefits are fantastic. These jobs take a huge toll on your mental state not being allowed to talk or do anything other than repeated movements throughout the entire day with breaks being limited to a few minutes and if your station is far from the break area, you have little to no time. If you can handle mindless and tedious work and won't get frustrated by being stuck where you're assigned then it's not too bad."
good,unrealistic targets for christmas. non flexible working hours. long days short breaks. great that you only have to work 4 days to do 40 hours and over time is paid well
good,"I barely have time for myself outside of work.  The expectations are above and beyond for little pay."
good,"If you apply to this company be wary as they have a very high demand for Rate, Scattered Management and Some violent Employee's."
good,"Lacking a culture conducive to a positive productive work force."
good,they train you within a day or two and expect you to be perfect but not everything is clarified until you start making mistakes you realize you weren't doing it right and they want to write you up for anything can barely have time to go to the restroom or else they will mark you off task you need to know people to help you at first or else its a bit difficult seems like a lot of competition
good,"You arrive to a crazy parking adventure every day. There are hundreds of people working the same shift as you. You go stand in line to clock in while one person's badge won't work and they refuse to stand aside to let others through. Then packers go upstairs to stretch and fight for a station. If your name is on the list and has a station number, you better get there quickly. Someone else can just take your station if you have not claimed it. You get a rack or tubs of goods to pack. Then you start packing them into boxes. The computer gets the size of the box wrong every now and then. That's about the only time you have to use some brain power. The job is about quality and speed, but mostly speed. I'm not the speediest,but I just keep on packing. The co workers are very nice. The management is ok and always trying to motivate the workers. The hardest part of the job is the long hours and mandatory overtime. This is not a job for those who find it hard to be away from their family. Then at the end of the day you must fight to get out of the parking lot or take a bus up to overflow parking."
good,Hours were bad. They treated you like a slave. You couldn't get a drink of water or go to the bathroom without getting low rate.
good,Work moves very quickly and management pushes very hard to get everything done quickly. Planning always takes a backseat to operational issues that are continuously given top priority.  Leadership is very smart but frequently treats employees as resources and not as people.
good,"Too much focus on a person's ""rate"" for doing some tasks, and far too little focus on their overall worth to the company.  I like many of the co-workers that I have there."
good,A sick feeling to be there knowing you're not appreciated. lack of management professonalism. co-workers is fine. the hardest part of the job is enduring punitive action for situations beyound your control. threre's nothing enjoyable about working there.
good,"At Amazon your enjoyment and motivation level will be directly driven by your local management team.  As such, the Toy Team should be avoided. It's micro-culture is one of cliques, and work quality is measured in shear hours vs. quality of work. "
good,It gets real busy during the holidays.  Borderline chaotic.  They hire hundreds of temps.  So its very crowded.  During break there is a foosball table. That's fun
good,"My job was to unload small cases of incoming product as fast as possible so that it could be processed and send out when customers ordered it."
good,"A typical day at Amazon.com is usually caotic and unorganized,the managers are new so they do not understand the problems that we have and give us the idea that they do not care.Everyone is being pushed to go faster without concerne for quality.The computer systems are slow and it is hard to get the imformation we need to do the job expected of us.The most enjoyable part of this job is I only have to come here 4 days a week."
good,you are treated like a child. they do not want you to question things or think at all. benefits are good but pay sucks. there is a pay cap and they will only promote who they want not who is right for promotion.
good,"Seasonal employment, hard work and fast pace environment."
good,I enjoyed the job but the culture at the location was not too friendly.
good,"Here's is a honest review: I started here in November of 2014 as a Seasonal Customer Service Agent II. The training was jammed packed with a insane amount of information of which no one will retain from the two week period. During this time you will take many test in a KNET via virtual cartoon demos/questions. During this time the training will try to ease your mind in reference to it taking some time to learn and the mangers will take in consideration the learning curves and metrics. Next will come the Christmas traffic of which they under-prepared you for. most of your calls will be: where is my shipment?, when will my items ship out?, can I change my shipping address even though I completed the order and it has been shipped?... those issues are truly out of your hands and if it has to be asked and clearly it must, expect a likely negative review. Most of the customers don't review based on your actual performance but simply because they didn't get their desired outcome. THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT THE ISSUES MENTIONED RECENTLY!! So then, the closer you get to Christmas the worse the customers become and more so the worse the unrealistic they become too. Some customers will flat out be rude and downright nasty.... nevertheless, after Christmas you'll have about 2 additional weeks. During this time you'll see what the trainers and managers are really about because you have served the seasonal purpose and the talks about considerations via metrics goes straight out the window. More so you'll discover the most disturbing part will be your metrics were measured from week"
good,"Wouldn't recommend anyone to work here but its a job when in need."
good,long hours 10-12 hours a day on your feet the whole a little unorganized
good,10hr shifts were the worst part and pay was the best part.Great management and overtime hours.
good,"A typical day of work included walking 30 miles a day to pick items, i learned to follow safety rules in the warehouse. The management expected way more than i what i expected out of a person. The people i worked with were friendly but the hardest part of the job was walking 30 miles a day the best part of the job was getting paid."
good,"Although I enjoyed working with Amazon, it is a very unsecured job. I was always under a lot of pressure as people were getting paid off at anytime and most of the time due to no faults of their own. This put a lot of pressure on me as I have to pay bills and not knowing if I was going to be able to pay bills the following month was stressful. "
good,Over worked and under paid  for the work and hours that we had to endure.
good,"This job is just physically demanding. You're on your feet for 12-14 hours a day, and they want you to give your all each and every night. You have to have a mindset to work and no play here."
good,counted and inspected inventory in bins. Learned how Amazon works.
good,I was an order puller and packer. There needs to be more communication in the company
good,"Every day is pretty much the same. Can get very boring, sometimes there are  contests. You will work 55-60 hours a week during peak and scheduled to work 11.5 hour days during peak with 2 30 min breaks."
good,"1 must work there to understand Amazon. 1 works in a very high pace environment @ a 99.5% accuracy rate. If you are not successful you will be getting a jam. Supervisors are the only employees who have degrees who have 0 experience, no clue how to motivate employees & only care about the NUMBERS. The aura & relationship between experienced warehouse employees & supervisors is very poor & supervisors expect those employees to do their job. It is, in my opinion, why this company has such a high turn over rate. Employees make Amazon fun during work as long as your not getting a reprimanded of your 99.5% accuracy rate on one's performance on STRICTLY TIMED tasks & though breaks are also STRICTLY monitored, when special holidays come around. The only  good 2 things of Amazon- GETTING YOUR EDUCATION & THEY WILL PAY FOR IT."
good,"Unrealistic Goals Expectation. However, very advanced robotics technology was used. The management was not willing to heed suggestions from employees who had more experience than them in the same field."
good,"Work environment could be better by having conversations with team members. "
good,L'ambiance général était correct ( musique et bonne ambiance de groupe) mais le travail en lui même demandais un énorme effort physique car il etait en plus de nuit.
good,"2 turni di lavoro da 12 ore, paga misera e ambiente pesante."
good,"my area wasn't hard, but amazon didn't have a good environment to work at especially air conditioning for people to work in and when a big company doesn't cover food for the break that's so lame"
good,They are all about their customers. Employees are over worked and are getting hurt on the job.  It's extremely stressful during the holidays. And can better train management.
good,High pace high demand and if you can run for 9 to to hours a day great job for you👍🏾 If you don’t mind short lunch and helping others out everyday job is for you if you like helping others and receive no pay job is for you
good,"Conditions of the work environment made this job difficult on the body. The expected output was often difficult to reach, but still expected from employees"
good,The job is good but the management is lost in its own world and doesn't care about its employees. The workload is alot. They dump alot of work on agency employees.
good,"Hard work,. Worked long hours and a whole lot of turnover in management. Steady hours with steady pay. Good benefits but very hard to make certain claims"
good,"Better than nothing"
good,The atmosphere was not great. You are literally treated as a number and that's it. The management are a bunch of people that are hired straight out of college that could careless if you succeed or not. Long hours with decent pay.
good,"Ringrazio questa azienda per avermi fatto lavorare, Sono rimasto deluso sul fattore rinnovo ti fanno entrare illudendoti con proroghe... Poi finito il picco ti scartano come un semplice numero. Dico questo nonostante 0 malattie sortavo medie alte 1500 e più.. Sono stato mandato via nonostante 8 su 14 ops ero bravo... Evidentemente nn ce meritocrazia ma tanto lecchinaggio... Vanno avanti"
good,Amazon permet de de gagner pas mal d'argent (environ 1400 net/mois) mais les conditions de travail sont très fatigantes
good,"Management is generally horrible. Your a number . Barely any training. All they care about is the packages, not you. They will not help you. You are basically a lone wolf. You will not get rewarded just fired or written up if you do wrong and then laid off the second season is over  but pay is decent and driving is fun I thought"
good,"Work at Amazon was work, nothing more and nothing less. In the beginning, I never saw nor met our HR, so I didn't even know we had one- until after a strike. The workplace environment wasn't the best. The managers wanted Stowers to meet their (managers') goal rate of 300 packages per hour (normal rate is 180). Hence, Stowers focused on rate rather than their mental and physiological health. Meeting the 300 rate meant that Stowers would be working at a faster pace than normal, therefore resulting in unorganized bins, unnecessary closed bins, and safety hazards (aisles & packages in bins)."
good,Tout dépend de la qualité de votre supérieur qui fait obstacle ou non à votre progression
good,"Recent Amazon TV adverts are misleading regarding workforce: being white british I defintely felt like a foreigner in my own country.  Can be stressful with constant pushing by mangers to reach near impossible targets.  If you met your target, you were just pushed more!  Got impression that Eastern Europeans with permanent contracts appeared to consistently get easier jobs."
good,"This job is very dusty, you ask for help on your line and no one comes. "
good,"Long hours, short breaks, poor management, not the greatest place to work.  They do have great benefits and generous time off.  If they would train their managers properly how to manage people instead of just managing processes, it would get better."
good,"Its not what it seems. Its very boring, tedious and uncompelling. I like having three days off. Its not worth the drive. Benefits are ok. Just not the job for me because its to easy."
good,"Most procedures are confusing and make no sense in the way it is carried out. They try for a happy and together atmosphere but too many people, too many turn overs and too many hours make the managers see the workers as just another drone to get through the day. Even with out the managers feeling that way it becomes very apparent very quickly that you are just another cog in the wheel and there is always someone waiting to replace you."
good,To boring and the msngerment is rubbish it so quite even in peak it was quite if your face don’t fit you don’t get the training it takes months managers got there favourites
good,"It's a good company but a lot of chaos. It's not your typical 9 to 5 job"
good,"Il lavoro e lo stipendio sono ok,il problema e che non si capisce chi prende decisione di rinnovare i contratti,se amazon o le agenzie interinali xche ho visto persone che lavorano seriamente a chi non è stato rinnovato ed altre che npn lavoravano acui è stato rinnovato"
good,"Working conditions at Amazon are not good. Paranoid culture, constant looking over your shoulder, micro management in the extreme. They like to turn over staff because the belief is fresh staff will bring new enthusiasm and energy to the business."
good,"The work was fun, but I was only working nights in a holiday position at a warehouse in Bellevue. Which oddly enough closed down about a year after I left the company. At any rate, it was tough work, but I would not recommend it."
good,Nothing really just personal preference. I’m going to give a bad review about anywhere I’ve worked. I believe it’s all done by personal preference and what you believe.
good,Overall experience wasn't good. The job itself is very tiring and the warehouse conditions in the summertime are bad. There was no a/c and only one short lunch break. Definitely a job you'd apply to just for financial purposes. Expect to WORK.
good,the amount of time given to find a product is not productive the breaks are short and you have to work for 10 hours a day which was very stressfull you get break after 5 hours of fast paced work and then another straight 5 hours which is something that need to change
good,really depends on what type of person you are. its fast paced and can take a toll on you. Management was okay but I've definitely had better. unless you make friends pretty quick you'll feel pretty alone.
good,Working at Amazon is awesome as long as you dont want much of a increment every year. The yearly appraisal is the same as others which will lead you with 10 to 12 percentage. But you can always opt for internal transfers that are within the scope of what you had been already doing at Amazon or you may have upskilled yourself with whats required for the profile which you are looking forward to.
good,Just a lot going on inside the entire building and rather fast paced. Sort of a challenge with having to keep up a certain pace (at least with stowing away items).
good,"Unfortunately my expectation were more at the beginning, then everything starts plomming down to a point that I don't trust in the company anymore. "
good,That was the day we were given a task to do and a deadline without supervision.it was difficult but at the end we still met the target and the supervisor was happy.
good,"I didn't work there for a long time, but it didn't take long to see the inner workings of a male dominated work environment. I enjoyed the hard work, but realized (by observation and word of mouth), that favoritism is the only way to truly succeed. I took a pay cut to work there. Wish it would have been the environment they boast about. They don't really work with you."
good,"It's not a job for everyone if you're lazy in nature then don't bother applying you will be miserable.  Long hours, two 15 min breaks, 30 lunch, a boring job with false hope of advancements."
good,Not the best  worked seven days a week with no days off including holidays  no one was concerned about me having any time off  I have kids and a family that I missed a lot of for the year and a half with no days off
good,"Working at this company is sometimes stressful. Especially with the time they give us, not enough time to be off for sick days etc. seems as if everything is a race there or competition"
good,a bad company overall. youre nothing more than a number and you'd be hard pressed to find someone there who is actually excited about going to work. dont do it
good,Most managers are great. But they dont help you when you have internet problems or computer problems. They provide laptops but will not fix them if they mess up.
good,Would not recommend if you have responsibility’s .it is not a dependable job sometimes you work an sometimes you don’t. They don’t give raises as they say they will .
good,"Fun work environment but super tiring. If you don't like standing on your feet constantly moving, this isn't the job for you. Good luck with the dust too."
good,"You scanned a bunch of stuff for weeks and then your throwing pallets around like their nothing. Throw your back out, call in for a couple days and get threatened with termination, nice."
good,Every minute that you are clocked in has to accounted for. Rates are monitored and you can fired at the drop of a hat. Long hours with lots of physically exhausting work.
good,"Amazon has decent pay and benefits for the difficulty of work, however, working pick at a traditional fulfillment center will take a toll on your body"
good,"Amazon is the kind of place that asks for your life and nothing less. Prepare to fight for a day off. They tell you they won't micromanage you, but they will. There is incompetence on nearly every level of the business - it's hard to find someone who actually knows what is going on. Keep your head down, do your job, and don't ask for a day off and you should be fine."
good,Not much to say. Did not enjoy the long hours and mostly with born i also font esnt to provide a review about this company which i no longer work there.
good,"Terrible management folks with no customer obsession and ethics."
good,"I was working on the top floor and the time it takes me to get from my station to my locker is taken out of any break you have so I ended up not being able to have one."
good,"A typical day with Amazon can sometimes be hectic. They will have you assigned to a lane. Then after you clear your lane will send you to a different one. And it seems it's the same people they ask to depart lanes. If you are/ was fixing an uneven stacked pallet and wasn't scanning, because it's a safety hazard not only to you but others due no water spider in your lane. You will be written up w/o warning! In which I thought was unfair.  You always flex up. The only enjoyable part is the excises before your shift. Sometimes HR don't put in your sick time so you may receive points until you bring back to his or her attention."
good,"Amazon doesn't give you days off on Bank Holidays. Overtime is well payed. On ocasions they do parties or concerts for workers, for example Halloween, barbeques or raffle."
good,"Once you reach ""leadership"" level (a workaround for the site to belittle you and refuse to call you leadership), you are given a minimal raise from your original starting salary and expected to do the same, if not more, than your counterparts making not only salary, but stocks as well. They pass off the benefits package and your Community College stipend as better than the ""management"" gets, but after being belittled and overworked for so long, it becomes clear you're getting the short end."
good,Good it was hard work it was long shift easy task and you meet a lot of new people also you get to play pool and all that in the canteen on your break
good,"The job is easy and fun, the day goes by quickly, however the management is not up to par. It seems that the management has had no prior experience in handling most situations and/or managing employees."
good,"L'ambiente amazon è stato molto stressante,poco tempo nella pausa e solo una pausa nell'arco di una giornata lavorativa,addirittura a volte mi è capitato di lavorare 5 ore di fila."
good,"Working there was pretty fun at the begginning but then it got worse."
good,the company is good...but the manager and hire up..dont do much for the workers and ..give up false hopes about getting promoted..when they already picked someone else..and getting verbals or write up...for thing your told to do ...it will never change..
good,"Make Sure Amazon is a last resort it's hard work even though they pay good "
good,"I was at a fulfillment center, I exceeded all productivity standards . I felt that the supervisors were very unfriendly and  non caring about theyre employees with favoritism being out of control. also, the pay there was horrible, I was embarrassed"
good,"Amazon's culture is not for everyone, and the focus is more on developing business growth than developing and investing in employees.  Your direct manager makes a huge difference on an employee's overall personal experience."
good,"Overall, it's a good place to work. But not pass 10 years because that is when the management will start will start finding reason to to get you fired."
good,"As this is my first experience working in a warehouse, therefore, some attitudes, demeanor and work ethics were surprising to me. It was a completely different work culture than I was accustomed to having worked in the corporate world. "
good,"Good if you need a part time job if somekne else in the house is raking in most of the income. But if you come into the warehouse looking for full time don't bother. You'll only ever get full time if you're lucky, worked there for years, or have a college degree of sorts."
good,It's all about work no enjoyment working there at all that all I have to say.ok at lunch u get 30 minutes to be human the other 8 an a half hours u a robot.
good,I found it hard to deal with managers or HR everything was on line no direct phone number to anyone. Also not constantly working lot of leaving early wich cut into my income. But the job was easy no one hang all over you to get the work done. Very laid back
good,"Job culture was based on co worker approval.  Day to day was faced paced . Not enough consistent training in key roles. "
good,"A good job if you don't mind working at a fast pace. Way too much politics though, way too many ways to cheat the system. A strange dating game meets high school clik environment. When you get there for warmups and mandatory brainwashing over loudspeaker I feel a bit like a herded cattle."
good,If you are hired flex you will be lucky to get 20 hours per week. Management is poor and demanding. Job is dependent on surveys you have no control over. You will be frustrated and stressed all the time. Good CSR’s lose their job weekly because of surveys. If I were you I would take a hard pass on this one.
good,"At first glance there's a lot of promise for development. After a while your realize that the managers(who are all inexperienced and straight out of college) are just trying to get ahead and will use you however they feel they need to while calling it ""business need"""
good,"I came from a very structured environment.  There was very little structure at Amazon.  a lot of the information you needed to do your job was gathered through tribal knowledge.  My part of the Amazon environment was in a business that was only about 4 years old at the time I was hired, so I understand that they were still in the growth phase.  However, it was still frustrating.  I LOVED my team.  We worked together well, and there was a pretty good synergy between Ops and HR."
good,"Come work for Amazon a company so large that its left hand doesn't know what its right hand is doing. Where no one gives you a consistent answer on the most vital of questions and the work environment is so impersonal that you're unlikely to interact with another human being for hours,"
good,"Impossible to ""work your way up"" from this position. Management will take advantage of your hard work and dedication, but will not take you seriously as a viable option for promotion. Also, no raises and no benefits."
good,It was productive but not a fun placw to work at. The production is more important than safety. It was a few team members that made my time their easy.
good,"Although the pay is fair for the kind of work you're expected to preform, amazon needs to inprove on the way they treat employees, also during the holiday peak season workers are hit with an overwealming  amount   of work almost impossible to finish the day hitting your numbers."
good,"I was excited at first, I will not lie. I enjoyed it in the beginning, however the longer I worked there, the more I realized how incredibly unstable I became. Work like balance is this: Wake up, work 10hr shift, home/eat/shower , maybe 2 hours of free time ( i had no other priorities) then back to sleep. I am a very strong and confident worker and this place beat me down. I saw multiple people needing medical attention due to poor working conditions. I saw many unsafe factors, managers were barely seen on the floor as their assistants were the ones running the department."
good,"It’s a rough job, but pays the bills. I work 4 10hr days. But it’s never just a 10hr day. More like 12 hrs. Physically demanding and even worse with the summer heat"
good,"My favorite part of coming to work is my coworkers. Other than that there’s not really anything great about Amazon. It pays well and the benefits are good. But if working in a quiet warehouse for 40 hours a week while lifting super heavy items constantly is something for you, go for it. If you’re okay with never getting a promotion too."
good,Worry more about how many packages are scanned then how hard people are working   mostly about making management look good then when it's finally time to clock out they want you to stay longer
good,You’re treated like cattle. You’re just a body there to be thrown at a work load. The management doesn’t really care about your well being because they can always find new cattle.
good,"Outsourcing position to cover off business hour in Japan "
good,"The culture and moral are very low, need better training for potential employees. No A/C in the building and not long enough breaks and lunch break for employees."
good,The work itself is not hard its easy work were the issues come into play is management the lack of communication between PA's AM's and Operational Managers is crazy now not all are bad there are some that work amazing together. Be careful of favoritism if your not liked it could affect you as far as getting training on PIT or if your trying to transfer to another department or even trying to move up in the company.
good,"Working here seems fun at first, but you are isolated away from everyone else in most sections of your job, the pace is very fast, and rate keep rising without any extra help from anyone on how to reach it (they just say move faster).  Not only that, you have a very small well of time you can use for everything from mental health time to recuperate to actual emergencies - and once that time is gone, you have to wait until next quarter for more.  Not only that, doctor's notes and things like that are not excused, you have to use your numbered time for that."
good,"I have worked in a fulfillment centre. Every day is busy, work is fast paced and speed is what matters the most. the advancement opportunities are limited and work place is not the most favourable."
good,"Make sure you have transportation and emergency funds just in case youre un able to work, they are a difficult industry. Not for people who are not used to standing or working long hours. Take light food for breaks."
good,les horaire de travailles est de 7 heures par jours. Un travail rigoureux et assidu est dem andé.
good,Great friendships with fellow employees. Usually poor management. Very poor HR department. My badge didn't work at the door  and after traveling to work for a week and having issues getting n for my shift I gave up and stopped going. Manager was told about my badge and replied he would get me a new one but a week later and still no badge.
good,Management drives You to meet an unrealistic production rate and doesn't make any consideration for lack of business or computers and robots breaking down. If you get hurt or your production rate goes down they will push you harder and they won't give you any slack.
good,"They work long days, and you have to account for any down time, they get Petty about going to the bathroom, managers are very sarcastic like you are beneath them, if you are injured they don’t care, all they care about is rate."
good,"Long, gruling days. Can never slow down. Must always work at top speed. Always a risk of getting fired every day. Super high stress. Come home exhausted and in pain."
good,"esclavage"
good,"Instead of being transparent and making you aware of how long they plan to keep you , they would rather make you believe they have intentions on hiring from a season to a regular employee. That goes for HR and your management as well"
good,Not a bad place to work if you you can do labor & like managers that are incompetent. I have worked at multiple amazon locations for over 6 months. My only real issues were most if not all of the managers run everything but have no idea how we do our jobs & the struggles we encounter daily. Some managers will work side by side with you & communicate but the majority don’t care & just want to see numbers met for the day. Your coworkers will keep you sane & help you out if needed. The pay is better than it used to be but barely feels worth it due to the back braking hours. Nice job for quick money. Especially during their peak seasons.
good,"Profit is the goal, employees help make that happen.  Impersonal, detached environment.  I was recently sick and received points because there is no sick leave unless you obtain a ""blue badge"", then it is unpaid time-off.  Takes a while to get that. But it is a decent salary for the hard work."
good,"I liked working at Amazon, but the position and hours I choose, were not working with my home life. 6:00p.m.-4:30am in the morning plus overtime was my least favorite part."
good,If you don't mind a lot of walking is a good job a lot going up and down steps in apartment complexes and you do get paid vacation and paid sick days but they don't know how to schedule you right one week they'll give you six days the next week they'll give you three days and you maybe get one day a week
good,"Our training manager would not answer any questions; we tried to help each other in chat but she did not answer or acknowledge unless it was to snap a reply. I totally get that training in that setting is very stressful. They play favorites and she had one member of our 'class' who thought he ran things and talked down to and gave orders to others members of the team. Overall disappointed."
good,Best thing about Amazon is the hours available and the benefits . My specific site PHL7 had a poor working culture where managers where consistently looking for reasons to write you up or terminate you. Managers are brought In for short terms fresh out of college and have no knowledge of the job functions. Senior Management is only available on nights in a limited capacity. The building promotes safety but not if it deters productivity. I enjoyed my time with Amazon but felt like certain operations managers stop or prevented my advancement for personal reasons. They have Principle Values but managers don't follow them. If you have a hard work ethic it's great for a short period but they consistently cycle in new employees and find ways to push out veterans. I would recommend working here but not if your trying to make it a career. Don't get forklift certified here most of the associates get termed for dumb reasons. It's like going back to Highschool.
good,"Very physical job, not paid enough for the labor that’s done."
good,Management is really bad. Feels like you work with people on their first job. No professional environment and lack of motivation to do your work. Worst job I ever had.
good,"Can't speak to every job at Amazon, but my management made themselves bottlenecks in the work I was trying to accomplish.  Micro-managing is ineffective.  As a result, most of the original members of my team are gone and my immediate manager only has 1 person left under him with no engineering backfill.  Dysfunctional organization."
good,Amazon has decent pay to start but mandatory overtime does not make the pay any better.  After 18 month you hit a pay ceiling. So may also not get a choice on what you do.  So you may get stuck doing something you hate.
good,"Typical work day starts with a group meeting to discuss the shift goal and to review any and all safety rules and regulations. "
good,"Turn around rate is way to high, and people get burnt out. Not to mention those who are older like on accommodations don't get treated all that well, and are looked over."
good,I think this is a good position for college students to give them some money in their pocket and balancing out going to school and work. I was not able to use it for me being a married individual because of the traffic to come to the warehouse.
good,"I was a college student it is hard to balance work, school, and family. A typical  day is 12+ hours on feet no seats or real break. No family feeling."
good,Very fast paced. Lots of rude demanding customers. Not enough management support. Seasonal do not get converted no matter how hard you work or how much time you put into the company.
good,pressure was a bit much not as relaxed of and eviroment as one might think.  Management seems a bit hardend.  Mostly typical of pressured work enviroments.  Hours to long.
good,"The management is generally very immature.  They lack vision, and thus causes panic.  In my group there were 40 projects and none completed.  No one was communicating the bigger picture.  As an organization Amazon is where hp/Compaq was in 2001/2002."
good,"The hours and work can definitely be tough, when you're 5 hours into your 11 hour shift it can get to you. The thing I always tell people is if they are looking for quick money and deal with a lot of pressure or stress then Amazon is good. I worked there for 4 years, made some great friends and good memories. Most managers there see people as numbers so they don't care and that is what causes the biggest disconnect between the workforce. Very rarely will you find a manager that is willing to give you a shot and mentor you."
good,Great company however you better hope you get a good and transparent management team other wise you will be left in the dark about most things until its to late.
good,"Amazon is great for the benefits, not for anything else. They took away bonuses and explained it away with a raise. They then eliminated almost all overtime during peak for my schedule. We lost a ton of money. We will not receive a raise for at least two to three years. They did this all as what seems to be god press, and screwed over the entire workforce. A union is needed to combat amazon, but they train their people to squash any talk of such a thing."
good,"Part of the Amazon culture is to obsess on their customers and foreseen their needs, this is deeply seen in their daily activities but they have forgotten that the employees are also their customers."
good,"The pace is crazy. Very competitive, very alpha driven type personalities everywhere. Finding ways to shine is hard because most are out for themselves. Leadership is only about results and less about motivating or inspiring."
good,I was very thankful to have the opportunity to take on my first serious supervising position with Amazon. I've been trying to use this supervising experience towards landing my next supervising position. The reason why i left the position was to go back to school and finish my degree. working the graveyard shift from 6pm to 6am did not fit well with being a full time student during the day so i had to respectfully leave that job and find a job that was more suitable for my school schedule in return that my degree would lead me toward a better job opportunity in the future.  I just hope to build off of this supervising experience while now obtaining my business communications degree that will allow me to get towards my next goal of getting another supervising opportunity.
good,I feel it's a good place for a young person or someone in-shape.  I did not like working there.  There is a high turn-over rate.  However there were many people who loved it there.
good,"Not very professional. The culture was fun but it was like modern day slavery , they expect too much from people and provide minimal equitmentt and help. It is all a mess."
good,"I was the top packer, but the management has their favorites as to who to convert. Only apply seasonal if you don't want a fulltime job. If you know management you will get full time. totally not fair"
good,"Come detto sopra, i quantitativi di lavoro richiesti da quest'azienda, sono esagerati rispetto alle possibilità e ai ritmi fisici giornalieri. Il tutto è dovuto al numero del personale in esubero, e gestito comunque molto male."
good,"Amazon is a great place to work starting out, but lacks benefits of a regular job. Employees only accrue 48 hrs PTO/year.  If you need a job that will give you opportunities to learn new skills, then Amazon is good.  Amazon is not the company to work for if you want a career unless you are coming in as a manager."
good,"Amazon as you know is a monster of a company and to keep their momentum they require everything you’ve got. It’s very high paced and very much has the get it done or we can get someone who will attitude. The employee turnover rate is high because in most cases you are replaceable. This was stressful for most employees, pushing them to get top numbers at all costs and even projecting numbers that were a little inflated to please upper management. This culture of working until you can’t anymore was tough on workers and was not sustainable for most. I think I learned a lot from this company though. Pushes you to be your very best and to achieve the highest numbers possible, but you learn it’s not worth it if it’s at the expense of your health."
good,"""if you can make it there, you can make it anywhere""  They give a chance to just about anyone, but you have to consistently earn your place by running ever faster on the treadmill."
good,"- Lavoro notturno"
good,I worked over the Christmas period including the busy black Friday period.I would start at 6am and finish at 6pm. I would be on my feet all day pushing a cart around collecting things off of the shelves using a scanner to locate the items.
good,"Terrible structure and management. But, if you can deal with all the garbage, the pay is fairly decent given the actual work that you have to do. If you are good at your job, you are rewarded by having to pick up everyone else's slack, and that is your new expected 'norm'."
good,"I worked at Amazon it was back breaking, barley enough time to get a 10 min off your feet or eat at lunch.  It was an ok company, just not something I wanted long term."
good,Some managers are great. Others not so much. Constant change. Work life balance isn't great. Poor training for positions. Lots of opportunities for growth. Competitive pay.
good,Fast paced regulated safety and production is king high turn over rate.. good seasonal job would not recommend for permanent employment  opportunities. OSHA standards met and exceeded safety standards
good,My life consist of nothing but work! I'm currently looking for a company that values the internal customer just as much as the external company. Amazon see's everyone as a number and not a team member. Very toxic culture that doesn't seem that it'll last long if it doesn't change.
good,It was excruciating. It paid well. But not safe. My feet were bleeding everytime I got off work. I changed and bought several set of comfortable shoes but to no avail. They only want to get as many people working as they can. They have favorites. And it does not matter how fast you go it will never be enough for them. I’m still wondering how some people managed to stay there when they were talking most of the time. they fired me for taking time off after asking us if we wanted to leave. We had the opportunity to leave because of lack of work.
good,"It was good pay with three days off each week, but it wasn't worth putting yourself on the line for the work you did. Some managers did care about you, but others didn't. They make it seem like they do, but only for the sake of it. It's stressful because they want you to be at a certain rate and it's consistent work."
good,Very driven by data and software did not give management much room to change gives for individual needs of their employees often lead to avoidable instances such as employees using parts of the fulfillment center as a toilet
good,"It was not a pleasant experience, just good temporary work. Good pay, simple work though they had a little bit much in the terms of expectations. Frequently rehired for busy summer and winter seasons."
good,"Amazon is a great company for the customers, but they treated their associates like labor, not people. The toughest job in the building is the Area Manager -- the associates directly report to them. All the associate issues come up to the Area Manager and if there are any problems with the operations, they're blamed on the Area Manager by his/her supervisors."
good,"You learn a lot in amazon, but I think the management needs some improvements, at least in the department I work. Amazon principles are the best, but their applications are not on point."
good,"The job itself was very rewarding.  However, I believe upper management could be improved especially regarding employees suggestions to improve work production."
good,"Working there was a nightmare. You get write ups that don't know about until it's your last. You have kids freash out of college with no people skills as you manager and you have more experience then they do and knowlrdege. How can you terminate someone for having six counting errors in one year. You check with H/R to see if you have any write ups they say your good. The next day your getting walked out after your three year anniverssary. You can't make this job a career unless your in upper management. It's not about your staff anymore. It's about the numbers and the bonuses the managers got when they rich their numbers. It like working on a plantation. There is a age discrepancy in the TPA-1 facility. Cause you are judged by someone putting numbers saying you should be picking 5,000 units a day. I'm in my 50s I don't have the energy as a 18 yr old does."
good,not a very fun place to work at. the managers are very strict and lack leadership skills. overall a good company in terms of its service to its customer base
good,Long shifts constantly moving and carrying out your duties throughout a maze that stretches thousands of feet’s . Job may become overwhelming to some that may have never been on ones feet for more than three hours straight. Non the least it’s a job that can test the employees a little better ..
good,"All team are supportive but some micro management vanish the assence of Amazon culture"
good,its draining. they gonna watch your time even your going to the bathroom they have rates that you need to be work on. phone signal is kinda hard to get sometimes you need to go outside.
good,alles war gut da und ich habe mich sehr gefreut dort gearbeitet zu haben
good,good job for people who are very self-motivated but because of the high turnover don't expect your boss or your friends to stay very long. management were usually clueless and made certain days and interactions very frustrating.
good,"I am used to the old P-S-P (People-Service-Profit) model when I used to work for FedEx many moons ago. The company took great care of their employees and in return, the employees went all out for the company that resulted in an outstanding profit for the company. This is how good companies should work, in my opinion. At Amazon, the human element is taken out of the workplace and is replaced by data where the computers rule and dictate management with an iron fist that subsequently treat their teams the same way. Benefits are good, but that however comes in the form of a give-and-take attitude (sarcastic form of frugality) that will eventually grow old with some people that will look for greener pasture. Be prepared to walk (at least) about 14 miles a day. If non stop walking/standing for 10-plus hours is not your thing, then this job will not be for you. In short, its not company, it is the way that the company is being operated that needs to be seriously reviewed."
good,"If you are in good shape, young, have no kids, and no spouse or significant other, this isn't a bad job. They pay is alright, but not enough to really live on your own. The benefits are probably the best part. But the hours are long and the shifts are awkward times. I work weekends so I have 0 work/life balance. Also, you work minimum of 10 hour shifts if you are full time, so it can be tiring. "
good,"This is a great company to work for, the hours are decent, the only thing wrong is the constant shift change. It hurts every employee, sacrificing things we have in our life"
good,Work In-home contract basis. Average 2-5 work orders per week. No benefits on any kind. I would like to pick up more contracts in the near future as the schedule is very flexible.
good,good place to work i really enjoyed it you work very hard on a production line package up items to send out to customers all over the world really enjoy working there
good,"First time when i started working with amazon as delivery driver they use to pay me hourly 14 dollars , after two mounts they changed everything they started paying daily 130 dollars and they added more packages , so instead of 90 stops per day to 250 stops , that is the reason why i left this company."
good,it pays the bills but it is not for the faint hearted. there is also no job security you can get a tap on the shoulder at any time. I seen it happen at 3am on nightshift and people were escorted out without transport
good,"If you want to make money and you dont value your time at all then I highly reccomend Amazon. It may be a warehouse but that doesn't excuse missing your holidays with your family, being chastised for normal behavior, and being treated like a disposable robot."
good,"Perfect place if you're looking to make some extra cash but as far as making a career of it , I wouldn't recommend it .. It's fine to have as an second source of income . far from enough to be considered to be your main source .. The job can be tedious and boring at times and your isolated for 10 hrs a day , well thats what it feels like .. It depends on who you are because it can be a toxic working environment .. I was there 5 years and I can't say it was all bad but it wasn't all good either .. My story doesn't stop here but why get into all that .. I'm moving forward .. Amazon gets a grade of C-"
good,"Working at amazon is okay,however. I don't feel like they really care about their employees health. They over work their employees and expect them to be fine."
good,"Working at Amazon is a place for someone starting out their life and not intended for long term work, but Amazon keeps the hourly pay at a low to keep the employees their. If any employees leave, Amazon just hires more from Mexico."
good,Place to work is OK not too great. Management is also Ok. can earn much in overtime. overall experience to work in amazon is ok well this was in india
good,Only part-time available so good first job while attending school or side job. Offers volunteer time off so very convenient for emergencies or just decide to take a day off.
good,People are Good .Management Sucked.You do a lot of Walking.Everybody has to know how to stack pallets with Various size Packages Coming Down the Line or your pallets Have to be restacked.I Learned A lot About Team Work.The Hardest Part Of the Job Was All Of The Walking.The Most Enjoyable is You Meet some Cool People Along the Way.
good,"If you like working alone perfect job for you. What I mean is come to work, get your route, get your van key and leave. The only thing I don't like is that the routes are longer now than peak season 2017/2018."
good,It's hot working in an Amazon Warehouse. It's also dusty. Cardboard box dust. It makes you sneeze and it gets into your eyes. That's literally the worst of it. The management is mostly nice and you just have to work quickly and you'll be just fine.
good,"your hoping in and out of a van filled with a (ever increasing) number of packages per route, job involves alot of movement in and out door to door, in weather conditions that vary from rain to extreme heat"
good,"the mentality was to work and have fun however this was not the way the managers acted. poorly managed, work till you drop mentality, safety was a big concern but never really acted upon when there is a big work load."
good,After becoming full time nothing changed. Pay was sub par and the long hours was straining on personal time especially in the holidays. Dont recommend
good,you are asked to work many hours while being under staffed while not allowing adequate break time. i would recommend this job as a part-time only job not a full time career.
good,"The work was fairly easy to learn and to do, however the work environment was a little too repetitive for me. Also, I ran into numerous people on power trips; this made the environment less friendly. One thing I really liked is that Amazon would have random snacks available for employees such as cookies and falafel."
good,"I started as a seasonal sortation associate for the holiday season. The application process was easy with an offer right away. The offer gave information to a hiring event in which you were given a brief orientation and take a drug test. Only then you have to wait about 3 weeks to get your results and starting date. "
good,"They know you're replaceable, so they treat you like so. They will overwork you and give you harder roles the next day if you don't take on their extra time. The people who do take extra time get better roles for the week and the people they like get the easiest roles."
good,Bonne culture de l entreprise entre collegues mais condition de travail rigides
good,"Some people like it. Some don't. It's very redundant and monotonous. Because the work is so machine-like and boring, you have a lot of time to think about what you really want to accomplish career-wise in life outside of Amazon. Depending on your job in the warehouse, you may get to speak to other people a lot or not at all. "
good,"Locate, retrieve and pick products for order invoices"
good,"Overall, a descent place to work. However, I would advise against it if you have a family or interest in your personal life. Also, every aspect is built around leadership principles that are not followed or appreciated by senior leadership"
good,I enjoyed working at Amazon. Especially for $14.00 the pay was great! The job got a little hard at times because I hat to stand from the time I clocked I  until the time I clocked out. Bit I would tough it up and get the job done.
good,You get to work on the latest cloud technologies. Amazon is vicious in it's drive to capture market share. And it tends to win more often than not. Plenty of bright people work there. Interesting place to work.
good,good benefits but management is more totalitarian than inviting to ask questions or for help. always finding reason and excuses to want to talk to you in a negative way
good,"Mi sono trovato bene apparte i turni che sono solo notturni, ed era lontano dalla mia abitazione"
good,"Es un trabajo bastante sacrificado, los trabajadores con contrato temporal no libran en fin de semana, no es un trabajo para toda la vida ya que su desempeño al 100% acarrea a la larga lesiones físicas en las articulaciones periféricas."
good,"Worked at two locations. Copelle, tx and Jefferson, GA. Coppell was excellent. Jefferson, poor management and general direction. Also at Jefferson, no pay difference for operating PITs/machinery."
good,"Amazon was a nice working experience for me although the management could have been a little better and they nee to apply benefits. I also was not getting enough hours and paid enough like I was suppose to, come too find out they also got sued for it."
good,"Amazon does things a little differently, and they use tools that nobody else uses.  There is such an incredibly large installed base of code that it is difficult to do ""maintenance"" programming."
good,"The average work day is stressful and overworked."
good,"Basically overall experience being an Amazonian was ver y helpful to grow myself."
good,If you are looking for a balance life between work and family this is not the place for you. Amazon is a company that was made for people fresh out o college so that they can be influenced with ease.
good,My opinion about amazon is i do not like to be on a timer. There is no team work you are on your own but thats not at all amazon only where i have worked.
good,In my experience it was a very fast paced competitive atmosphere. The morale was very low and people were often in a bad mood.There were not many benefits at all.The training went well. i learned what i had to.
good,All kinds of diverse people and a great work environment with strong safety rules that you are trained on following. They have a cafeteria with food to buy and they provide free food some days.
good,"When I worked for Amazon in 2013 customer care was a great concern, which is  what  should be,  but as far as employees I really do think they need to care more about them. Ratings had to be kept up and really weren't true to the employee and their customer care."
good,I really miss this job was one of my best experiences not only delivering to the customer the magic moment when you hand the customer something they've been waiting on! Also traveling different areas I didn't even know existed in the same city as me!!! Overall great job definitely would love to do again
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was unloading or loading the truck it gave me a work out without having to go to gym.Working 4 or 5 per day was great able to do things after work.
good,"Productive and fast pace environment, only part time available 20 hrs a week,  doesn’t seem like there’s much of an opportunity for advancement, very pleasant work environment"
good,Overall not a bad job just stressful meeting the means of the job with conflicting rules but in all great job great benefits just wasn’t for me . Trying to move up is the hardest thing to do it’s almost impossible too...
good,"Pays well and benefits are good, but no matter how hard you work they will always ask for more, the most physically straining job you will ever have, be warned."
good,"I worked in the Delivery Station for AMZN Logistics, we would have a boom of activity for 2-4 hours a day and due to the high volume of people vs not as high work volume (spring, summer times) we had disproportionate downtime on certain days. The only real problem I had was the disorganized management who never communicated anything with each other regarding employees, no one could get the story straight on what quite everyone's work hours were because they were all told the same thing and several times I (and others) was promised it would be fixed, and nothing ever came of it despite constant reminders."
good,"Mi sono trovata bene a livello lavorativo , la precisione e’ Amazon forse! Impeccabili ! un po’ meno  bene nel rapporto con i managers, alcuni spesso troppo presi dai numeri per considerare che dietro il login di ognuno di noi c’è una persona !"
good,"None of the managers care about you and if you don't make rate, which is constantly changing, you don't last. They tell you the rate is based on how everyone does as a whole but then tells everyone they aren't making rate and that productivity is bad. No communication with upper management and employees. Hardly any opportunity for job advancement."
good,A good place to work for teen not stable enough  to build a career because of the lack of secutrity this is not a long term job just something for the momen very hard to advance
good,"work at amazon during is fun, we are always busy, time flies by, we get a lot done and I love peak time which is 3 months out of the whole year.  other times there is little to no work, so basically we sit around, scrap tape off the floor, clean PIT trucks, sweep, fix bins, or some other non direct function.  it is so boring.  most of the time we are asked to leave cause there is no work."
good,A typical day at work is fast paced and tiresome. What i have learned working at Amazon is you have to like working at a fast pace if you want to work there. The workplace culture has a lot of good workers that wants to get the job done but still fast paced. The hardest part of the job is loading the heavy packages into the trucks and sometimes it is a lot but that is your job to do it. The most enjoyable part of the job is when there is a slow work day and there is not much heavy stuff to carry.
good,"I deliver for TBS and let's just say you do not get paid anywhere near what USPS, UPS, or FEDEX get paid. You get no benefits and there is no real chance to advance when you are a driver."
good,Fact paced environment working with various levels of workers. Highly engage supervisors and constant check-ins for goal/metric updates. Casual dress and limited flexibility with schedule change.
good,"I would never contract at Amazon again, seemed to be a second-class worker."
good,learn lots of it but the trainer were not awesome to explain to show that every one trainer different way. so whatever they teach me i try do way best for the company.
good,"Fast-paced work, not able to work enough hours, shifts are only 4 hours each and have to work 2 shifts in one day to make decent money, no paid time off, no paid sick leave, any time off is not paid, only bathroom is at front of building and is at least a quarter mile if you work at back of building, not long enough breaks to walk to break room and get back and not long enough for the type of work you are doing."
good,"they worked us like Hebrew slaves, bairly got long enough breaks. we worked maditory over time, not enough time with family and kids. very strict. the building is so big that's you take to long to get to the break room."
good,"Need money become a seasonal temp. Then RUN>! Amazon has a lot of opportunities if you know the right people. If you start on the ground floor and have no one to lift you, you are as good as sunk."
good,very busy job requires lots of walking/ No management skills  you are on your owned  wants you pass the training class  on video.Its . a big warehouse with lots of boxes and everything moving fast..you learn by errors . the good part about  you have team worker who's there to help  and The  most enjoyable part of working you  smiling  at your employees
good,"if you are able to drive out to the tracy location you will be hired. Easy repetitive work. long long hours, decent pay. expect to spend ten minutes just walking from your car to the entrance."
good,if working for amazon have to be ready to be on your feet for more then 10 hours a night. it is not easy be ready to work in a fast paced place. NOT FOR LAZY PEOPLE
good,It was quick money that JUST paid my bills.If the pay was better and the management was better it would be not as bad. I got terminated for violating a rule in policy that I was NEVER aware of.
good,"Working at Amazon, for me was great. I love innovation and rapid change. At Amazon, the customer is first, and the job is never done. "
good,"it was a good place to work but if you miss too many days, you will get terminated, they provided safety gear,like gloves, vests, also your position not consistent of normally,"
good,Benefits are good. Pay wasn't worth the work. Unprofessional leadership. They're newer facilities so that is nice. I just think they should start at at least 14.00 an hour considering the rates you have to make and the work is left on the 12.00 an hour folks while management walks around doing nothing but talking to their chosen few.
good,The place was still being built. Very fast paced and the bathrooms wasnt built full so we ahd to use portipotties. Clean but could be cleaner. But yet again it was at the warehouse of it.
good,"Not the funnest work place since i was in a warehouse , but it had it's ups and downs. I learned the importance of time and safety from the leaders , managers and colleagues since you meet quite a number of different people. Hardest part of the job might have been the fact that I was working night shift , whilst I did enjoy the feeling of helping others"
good,"You are constantly working with only short breaks, here and there. But everyone there made you feel like family and watched out for one another. Also, the security was a good metal detector and bag searches."
good,"As far as benefits and fair compensation go, Amazon is a great company to work for. Aside from that, there is a culture of college hires put into leadership positions with little to no experience and these managers typically do not have the skills to lead teams. There is also a very high turnover rate for these managers. Amazon advertises advancement from within for those with a B.A. or minimum of 2 years experience. With well over the 2 year minimum of experience with the company and am not offered the support to advance myself. I am told that I need to finish my degree before they will work with me even if this opposes the company model for internal promotion."
good,Amazon is a cut throat highly charged political environment.. A lot of clicks and long hours are required. Connections questions are difficult to mange to-do you hold your people accountable and have bad scores or play it loose and have better scores?
good,My time at amazon was a short lived one. The days were long and hard. it was really hot and pay wasn't good enough for what you did. you worked all night just to go back to work after 6 hours of sleep.
good,"The Warehouse environments are generally ""Ok"". It definitely helps as a secondary job, but tough as a main job in regards to monetary earnings. A lot of the people are excellent to work with if you are open and receptive to making meaningful connections"
good,"Amazon is your life.  Expect no work life balance if you want to get ahead.  There are great learning opportunities though, and it opens the door to many new jobs."
good,"Its a good place to work, but the hours can get very long and tried. The management don't always understand that you might need to go home at the end of your shift, to go to your next job, or to go home to get your kids off to school,,"
good,The company experienced and still is exponential growth in value and popularity. With the explosion of expansion other areas will suffer. No loyalty to employees for job security.  No real step program in place for internal development. Very large disparity gap between management and hourly associates financially creates a tough culture. There are relocation opportunities all over the world that makes for some excitement.
good,"I worked in Receive. Job was very easy. Management is not very employee friendly. My coworkers are great. Hardest part of the job was deciphering what rules to abide by. It seems like it is ever changing. Only place I've worked that I could come into work, do my job, and still get criticized and potentially fired."
good,This is job can be rewarding at times.  But this fulfillment center favors the ones they like the best.  As for advancement in this building.  I was told that I would have to quit my job to become in the manager. They hired for manager position from outside of the building.  The typical day starts with coming in and they tell you of the numbers for the day.  They have a lot of vtos.  This means they send you home. You do not get paid for that day.  When they have new management comes in. The old workers there is responsible to train them in that position.  this job is not that hard.  its can have its ups and downs.  The most of the downs come from changing management every two to three months.
good,"You work up to 12 hours a day, can't sit down, are underpaid and are barely given any PTO days and if you happen to be sick and go over your allowed days off you are under review and typically fired. They change the schedule in the middle of the night and if you don't think to check at the crack of dawn you will probably show up to work 3 hours late or early."
good,"Masseneinstellung , einlernen stand eine erfahrene Person und 4 wo lernen müssen , innerhalb 2 Tage mussten wir alleine arbeiten und man wurde nicht richtig eingelernt am pc ."
good,"This job is very good for an entry level position, but once you grab some experience, you'll be wanting more. Amazon does not offer many advancement opportunities. They pay based on how long you've been there and NOT your skill level. There are many associates who work almost twice as hard and do not see any compensation for it. Amazon also offers VTO (voluntary time off), but the workers who are ""valuable"" to the shift cannot take it. They are forced to stay and work harder than anyone who gets to leave."
good,Amazon is one of kind place to work to get a full out look on it you have to work there. Amazon is not for everyone it fast pace and stressful and rates most be met in order for you to be left alone
good,Not my kind of place. Managerial expectations are unrealistic. The benefits are fantastic though. Affordable health insurance that is actually extremely good. Really the only redeeming quality is the great benefits.
good,"There is no typical day of work, If you're a man, they will give you heavy items to stow, women get tooth brushes where they stow them in bins where heavy items should be put, Then the computer system will prevent you from putting a heavy item in an empty bin where there are 8 toothbrushes!. If you have integrity, you will suffer working for this company. coworkers are manipulative and a lot of favoritism is there. this company rarely keeps a worker for more than a couple of months."
good,"Stand for 10 hours picking items and placing them in small crates to be delivered via trucks to customers. I learned how to use a hand-held scanner to check inventory items that needed to be picked. Management wasn't immediately available, as we were in a large warehouse, but the Supervisors seemed willing to listen whenever a situation was brought up. The workplace culture was diverse, as there were a large amount of employees working there. The hardest part of the job, was that the short breaks, and 1 1/2 hour lunch (that really broke down to 15min once you were able to find a working microwave and were able to heat your food). That, mixed with being on your feet for a full 10 hours, walking back and forth on hard concrete the length and size of a full football field. The most enjoyable part, was having 3 days off."
good,Greeting new starts and coordinating their training. I have learned many HR related things and I am now interested to move into that field. Management fluctuates. Great culture there is a wide range of associates and I like that aspect of the job. The hardest part of the job is shift changes. I enjoy working with people and being able to assist them.
good,Was let go after I had gotten hurt there working. They did not have any light duty work for me so they let me go. So in short if you get hurt you ether live with it or get fired.
good,"Work a crazy amount of hours, your constantly told you can speak your mind for improvement but they managers back lash."
good,Mainly work on solving issues related to utterances that Alexa did not understand. Challenging environment. They pay a lot of attention to the happiness of the longer tenured Engineers and that make life more complicated for new managers.
good,"be fire for less of 2 min and work extra 15 min at day to leave all ready for the next shift , well that is amazon you are only a employ number and dont care if you are good or not"
good,"Amazon is a good place to work if you don't mind be treated like a  number. You don't get second chances. A lot of the bosses play favorites, and no time off during the holidays."
good,didnt like the long hours.irt breaks. The managers work you like a robot. Dont reccommend working at for. this company. Lunches and breaks are too short for the amount of hours and work
good,"When I worked there, Amazon was like a layer of Hades that Dante never discovered. At first, I enjoyed the job at least somewhat but I began to notice that decisions were being made that made it clear how Amazon felt about the little people that worked there. Working the the Tennessee area, the warehouse could get quite hot during the summer. Instead of implementing climate control (which is admittedly costly) or reducing an already outrageous workload, "
good,Management is clearly lacks experience.  If you have the ability to get close with your manager you will move up quickly. Your professionalism and knowledge means absolutely nothing. It sounds as if I'm bitter but in fact I like my job.
good,"I lost my job over an illness - I intended to be back to work when I had to even though I was still sick but apparently wasn't correctly informed when that was, I was a day late and was fired."
good,Working 10+ hours 4-5 days a week takes its toll on anyone.  It is a fun place to work but can be VERY stressful to make the quota that you are required to make every hour.  Ice packs and heat are needed for after work because you will find muscles that hurt that you never knew you had OR forgot you had
good,The fast pace and high production demands makes Amazon a difficult environment.  It is difficult to advance.  The work culture is awkward at best.  Many of your coworkers are non English speaking and standards are different for different employees.
good,If you're looking for something to pay the bills and to keep afloat this is the job for you. Don't expect nothing special and be prepared to work hard with little pay.
good,"The management process is abusive. I've seen too much ""behind the wall"" and hate how  individual performers can be treated. Managers ride employees and stack rank employees...They are forced to give good employees bad overall ratings because of politics and stack ranking."
good,"Not a place for the older and wiser fellow associate, management treated you like you didn't know what you were doing half the time knowing you came in with over 10-15 more experience then they had under their belts. Sad situation and turn around rate for employees was like a revolving door."
good,"After 3 years of working at Amazon (seasonal IT equipment coordinator, ICQA, temp PG position, and trained in audits) I have learned that they are not interested in improving the workplace and locating true issues. "
good,They really need to have more Managers not Ambassadors on the floor watching people!! They need to let the people know exactly what they will be doing. When employees don't work or slack off they  should not keep them around . They are paying these people that don't work and the ones that do they get just have to do the work for the slackers. Should not let Ambassadors have access to sensitive material. Don't let the company be run by their employees (the bad employees) that don't care about their work. Don't hire sooo many people . And appreciate the  employees that have been there for them when they needed them . And if permanent employees want to transfer to a new location they should have priority over new hires!!!
good,"Amazon is a good place to work but it is hard on your body due to concrete floors and 10 hour shifts. They do pay you extra money if you do not miss any days in the month if your hourly production count if 100 or higher. They also give you a gift card if you have the most items done in a hour or two. They also have good benefits with 401K, Medical, Vacation, PTO, VTO hours and Stock plan. Also you get 100.00 off Amazon orders."
good,"Fun at first you are learning and being competitive and are ready to go."
good,Guaranteed 40 hours a week but you'll be overworked. Management does not really care about personal issues and you may or may not be able to get through to HR.
good,"get orders done that you are instructed on the app. The app is okay but could be more improved and its something the company should focus to fix, other than that its okay."
good,Cette entreprise m'a beaucoup plus mais j'ai etait déçu du salaire et du peu d'avantages dont on bénéficie .
good,"If you just want a job that is physically demanding and pays ok requiring no skill... this is the place for you. There's really no room for advancement and if there is, it's not clearly defined or easily accessible. They have good incentive around the holidays ... a few of my co-workers won Ipads and TVs."
good,"A typical day at Amazon was to clock in, have a 15 minute meeting, sign into your scanner, check your picker/forklift, and start picking your order to ship."
good,The work is easy to me but favouritism is key at amazon. If you don't suck up to leadership you will get overlooked. I work 60 hours every week and they won't hold your hand either. Everything i learned i had to ask or i watched someone else. The trained felt extremely rushed like ridiculously rushed. They offer alot of overtime...that's it. The only good thing i have to say about them. Leadership is a joke so don't bother.
good,Working at Amazon is unique.  The training does not adequately prepare you for the position however skills are quickly acquired due to the fast pace of the job.
good,"Warehouse life is not for me. Management had a tendency to play favorites, but that's everywhere. The most enjoyable part of the job is the opportunity I was given to hone in on my training skills, problem solving skills, and administration skills."
good,amazon was fine the courier I worked for not so much they didn't have a clue on how to manage any routes and have no idea how it was out on the roads.
good,Company would rather cycle through new workers rather than working with employees that want to work.  Three small strikes and you're out.  For stowers almost every tub you have has items that are listed but not actually in them.  For pickers the scan gun will send you long distances for just 1 item which doesn't allow you to make quota
good,Good safe work environment. Very monotonous work. Decent benefits and pay. Very good work and life balance. You are very expendable and you are treated as so. There is a high expectation from you and the warehouse has no organization it is a free for all so it can be stressful to do your job correctly.
good,I am an asset to Amazon but they really make it hard for someone to advance. The right people never get the job just like politics. I work my butt off and when there is a problem the managers come to me for my input and advice. I am the # 1 ambassador on my night shift. I could easily run part of that warehouse. I have the education and back ground just need to learn how they want it done like anything else learning the system
good,"Worked the night shift as Senior Operations Manager.  Night shift operated from 5 pm until 730 am the next morning.  Problem is, I was expected to attend daytime business meetings.  Suffered physical and emotional burnout after a year, and was let go at 18 months.  Was never able to convince the dayshift management team to consider my situation and adjust their meeting schedule."
good,Hate the job. Treat sellers horribly. I would not be a seller on Amazon. They favor people. Mostly young employees not people in their older 30's and 40's.. No consistency on a daily basis.
good,"No career advancement, no structure,Fast pace environment you cannot be guaranteed 30 hours a week, as a part timer. Some people work very hard while others sit around and play all day.   "
good,Very stressful work environment. Manager turnover very high because growth of company. You feel like you are spinning your wheels and you never get anywhere.
good,A typical day in Trms Bangalore is just sad. Top management will sit in closed doors conducting meetings for around 5 hours with no results. They just drain your brains out for no reason. Amazon as a company is huge and the ones in the top DO NOT actually have any clue as to what happens in the junior level. Ultimately everyone gets sucked into the system.
good,"I have been and its is employed by Amazon since 2013,and recently have been harassed for working 12hr days, mind you it was not a problem from 2013-16."
good,"Although working at amazon was a means to and end, job security and compensation could be improved. The opportunities for professional growth are limited."
good,"I ensure that customers receive their packages in a timely fashion and I also deliver packages. The hardest part of this job is that the app which we use to deliver the packages and scan them out is not reliable. In addition, Amazon does not offer benefits."
good,Boring repetitive place to work with not enough compensation for what you're asked to do. Nor not enough hours what so ever the management does nothing but sit on facebook all day. I didn't even know who my manager was for 2 weeks.
good,I would rather not say. I do not have too many positive things to say about working at Amazon. You can make some quick money but may not be around for too long.
good,"The management I had an experience with was very rude , racist and even uninvolved. She was never there to tell us that if we did extra things that weren't at our station we could get fired. Even if our station was down ( not our fault ) she refused to help me get a schedule that would work with school."
good,"if your a lazy worker that dont want to do the ""hard"" work and your cool with the PA and manager then you are set at this place."
good,"Amazon was a very fun place to work,yet  not very professional place . I feel that amazon is a good job for a first time job not so much a long term place. Also very hard to move up."
good,"I work for BWI5 which is a sort center. It is a part-time job which is good for people who just want a second job. However, like all of Amazon facilities they can fire you at anytime for any reason. Because the policies that are in place are ""up to and including termination"".  In BWI5, you will see the favoritism of mangers, the laziest people not doing anything, and the regular frustrated  people who worked hard everyday. By ll means work at your own discretion."
good,"Amazon was definitely a fun, young place to be. However managers there were not properly trained or not equipped to provide satisfactory guidance for career advancement. Too much time is spent on training which wastes valuable resources."
good,Not a bad job but some people let their role get to their head. Apart from that the roles are fairly simple and their is always support from learning and development when needed.
good,"Its ok as a part time job, dont expect anything from her. You're just another number. Wouldn't bother working too hard cause even the lazy people that walk around and do nothing all day still get paid and treated just the same as the hard workers."
good,Too much to say in this little box. I could write 2-3 pages on what it is really like to work there and all the things that happen at Amazon. A lot of the stuff you can find on glassdoor.
good,"Life at Amazon's Fulfillment Centers are full of wonderfully different peoples' and cultures'. However, the environment is unbelievably cut-throat. The passive-aggressive drive that the employees are drawn to in order to obtain gift-cards (or other monetary incentives) is depressingly overstated. Those who get these benefits (like the top 10%) are unlikely to drop from weekly praise or obtaining of them. Those in the ""lower brackets"" tend to be ignored and lose incentive quickly. There is hardly any recognition for any personal improvement or accomplishment for your efforts unless you are in the top ten percent."
good,"Tthis company is fun to work with, they are very productive but also known to be competitive. Its best to keep a clear head when working there. Remember that everyone is not your friend. you are there to work."
good,"The job itself was decent however extremely high standards that felt rigged in a sense that only some people would make their daily quotes (because they always got higher counts in their routes) and others wouldn't stand a chance.  Giving them a ""record-able"" reason to fire you after the winter rush. Me and many others barely made our quotes or were just below their line which they were not willing to find acceptable because you had to be perfect. If you were not perfect in that department they were not willing to train/transfer you in another department even if you did better there. I left a good job because of their promises of permanent higher wages and benefits to only be fired just before my three months was up and Christmas rush was up. Wouldn't recommend..."
good,"Une tres bonne ambiance "
good,"Work place is toxic, most fellow employees are ok, but most of the leadership team strives on firing or pushing tenured employees to quit. Hours are long and the jobs on face may be simple, but the work is strenuous and will leave you exhausted day after day."
good,"I was walking at least 20 miles a day in a 4 hour shift- while walking around a small warehouse, the pay is not worth what you have to do so I would not recommend working here"
good,"Management makes it very hard to advance, lots of cliques within lower management PAs.  Sloth is overlooked by the habitual offenders if they are friends of the PAs.  Some people hustle and get the job done and others get a pass and get to just wander around.  This culture makes those who are dedicated and work hard wonder why they should even bother."
good,great company to work for choose location wisely training is horrible advancemrnt is hard plus its impossible to transfer out no one wants employees from this location
good,this a hard working place and you need to be fast and fit. the pays offs are good from what i hear but it will kill your social life for the most part if you pick a double doughnut shift
good,Worked there for awhile as problem solve in afe. Was never able to transfer out the department while working there. While working there I had 8 different managers.
good,As a disabled veteran I had quite a few issues with Amazon . I worked part time during the holiday rush and it was terrible. 10 hour workdays with 30 minute lunches.
good,A good place to work needs better management and teamwork skills. The hardest part of the job is working with cruel managers and production rate. Benefits are good.
good,"Very busy and fast paced place to work at. Working for Amazon is not for everyone. Everything is through technology, you don't get pay raise at all. You must apply within positions internal/external to get better pay."
good,I will admit I was excited to work for Amazon until I worked for Amazon. The management treats you poorly and doesn't seem to care. The pay is not competitive and they do not believe in cross training. Only good aspect is the insurance benefits.
good,Decent place to start a career straight from school. Be diligent in setting boundaries lest you burn out. Decent benefits and overall compensation but heavily weighted in stocks.
good,Amazon would be a great company if they did not have so much turn over and had more qualified managers.  Need more experienced managers and less turnover.
good,"most managers or the so called ambassadors are lost, no proper managerial skills. working environment is ok, with less pay for the work to be done, poor mangement"
good,Different from other warehouses not a good job but it pays the bills. The company only cares about themselves and money hungry. Not a lot of good companies out there. If the workers had a sense of what to take into account of hard work really means besides just thinking of money it would be a Big Difference.
good,"Over all work environment was good. "
good,just trust me its a terrible place to work not hard work but a terrible place to go to work everyday management only cares about numbers and the staff art of but its terrroble
good,I would never recommend this job because it is soul ending. It is actually classified as not safe working conditions. I used to walk around and fix the inventory virtually.
good,Integrity was the temp agency. Amazon was the company. Amazon hates their employees and they even came up with a scheme to pay them to go away so they can hire someone for less. The management despises the temps during peak season and regularly disrespects them or literally turns their backs to them. The pay is good but its very hard work.
good,working at amazon you will receive good benefits but the pay is not reflective of your work ethic and the work environment can seem more like being in high school at times.
good,"If you're trained on important processes, chances are that you'll be stuck in that process nearly every single day. The management gets hired on straight out of college with no management experience and no experience in the processes and then tell you how to do you job. It is INCREDIBLY hard to move up internally. Don't waste your life here."
good,Management is entirely based on favoritism. Who moves up in the company and who gets to keep their job is depedent on how much they personally like you
good,"good job and good company nice wages and plenty of extra hours if needed or wanted, work spaces are too crowded, not enough space to complete given tasks in efficiant time"
good,This would be a great place to work if the managers cared mored about the people and less about making themselves look good. example not enough work for everyone there they keep everyone there and wait for work to trickle in while we are still being wrote up for not making rate when we didnt have the work to make the rate.
good,"Amazon is a job where you are on your feet all day, everyday. The workplace was very busy during the day, everyone is moving around. The hardest part of the job is that you have very little breaks for a long hard day at work. The enjoyable part was competing and scanning most of the items."
good,"It was pretty boring, I only worked part time. The associates are pretty fun but it could be drama. Management constantly changed so it felt like no one really figured out the best way to run things. There was no music and they hate if you talk too much but its dreadful without friends. Really easy job, people are constantly getting fired and hired."
good,"This job is not ideal for everyday, hours are long, job is demanding, and requires non stop working. Breaks are short, and you are on your feet all day."
good,"A very big warehouse not enough break time, management just care about you making your production numbers. I like working in Outbound that Inbound"
good,I had an issue where i was physically assaulted. I had been telling the PA's about the situation weeks prior to the incident. I was still fired for self defense. I was told it didn't matter whether i was defending myself or provoking the incident. I was wrongfully let go.My Manager wasn't the problem. HR decided that in order for me to have kept my job I should have let someone physically assault me without defending myself. Other than that it was fairly easy to do the job. Transportation wasn't bad. Pay was really good as well.
good,"Lots of talented people. "
good,"For a warehouse job its definitely not the worst. 10 hr days and two 15 min break and one 30 min lunch. I was a seasonal associate so I never actually got any benefits. Ummm you don't have to deal with rude customers only weird dysfunctional associates. Thanksgiving is a cool time of year there they give you a free holiday meal. Also free gift-cards if you meet certain quotas. Some managers suck but that's at every job. Be prepared to stand for all of your shift, you will be REALLY sore the first few weeks if you've never had a warehouse job."
good,Awesome benefits thats all if you like being treated like a dog work ten hrs and get in trouble for doin your right. Make amistake see how fast you get written up even though you are doing what you are told to do
good,Amazon is a good company but they push you to the limit everysingle day and sometimes have unrealistic expectations but I am greatful for all the experience and having a stable job
good,The management constantly changed leaving little to no guidance for the employees. The opportunity to move up in the company was based more on who you knew as opposed to the work that was produced.
good,"Well-paid job with good hours but expect to be treated like a machine, only allowed outside for one hour per day, can be fired at any time. Low-morale and even lower respect from management."
good,"Peak season of 60+hrs. "
good,They focused too much on the yes/no response the customer had given the advisor without looking into what the advisor had done for the customer and whether the feedback given was justified or not
good,Long hours and not enough opportunities to move up within the company. I was there for little past 3 years as third shift. With multiple requests to move to morning I was denied and there was never any opportunity to move up in the third shift.
good,This place has good benefits. Some of the people are easy to get along with. No one is ever on the same page. Hr is not a team I would trust. Corporate does not care. It is modern day slavery with little pay.
good,"Es ist nicht alles schlecht an Amazon und es gibt härtere Arbeit und schlimmere Jobs.Dennoch ist es keine Tätigkeit für ein Leben lang- dazu sind die Tätigkeiten für normale Mitarbeiter (also keine Führungskräfte) zu monoton (auch der Dümmste schafft diese Jobs) und kräftezehrend auf Dauer- ich habe drei Jahre dort gearbeitet,hatte auch einen Festvertrag und habe diesen freiwillig aufgegeben weil ich dort nicht mehr länger bleiben konnte ohne gesundheitliche Schäden und Lebensqualität einzubüßen.Ich empfehle diesen jOb als Übrgang oder für maximal 1 Jahr-nicht länger.Die Schichtarbeit sorgt dafür,dass das Privatleben verloren geht- schnell hat man keine Hobbies und Freunde mehr, lebt nur noch für diesen Job-es sei denn man gehört zu denen die dauernd krank feiern aber dazu gehörte ich nun einmal nicht.Geld und Sicherheit sind doch nicht alles- selbst wenn Arbeitslosigkeit droht. Denn auf Dauer war es wie im Gefängnis.Alleine schon dass normale Mitarbeiter das Lager nie verlassen dürfen, kein Handy mit an den Arbeitsplatz nehmen dürfen, man ist von der Außenwelt total abgeschottet- es gibt kaum Tageslicht in den Hallen und während der Pausen sitzt man im eingezäunten Gitterbereich.....ich habe wärhend meiner Zeit dort stark abgenommen und bin auch ordentlich verblödet durch das ständige monotone Gepiepe mit dem Scanner hatte keine Energie mehr für das Privatleben.Es herrscht Ungerechtigkeit und Vetternwirtschaft- das jemand super arbeitet bedeutet nicht dass er eine Festanstellung bekommen wird......die Fleissigen tragen die Faulen mit durch,dort ist es wirklich so.Aufstiegschancen"
good,its an OK place to work for they are flexible with job/life but could care less about you as a person. they know they can replace you in a heart beat.
good,"Ritmi frenetici durante i picchi di lavoro, gestione quindi caotica."
good,"it's a job, the atmosphere is not good, no one is happy."
good,"My day very tiring and draining , I learned how to move at a steady pace. Management suck, I met some nice co-workers.. the hardest part is 10 hours and the enjoying part is discounts"
good,training is not done to well and it is really over crowed place to work at. co workes are just out of it. you get written up for just about any little thing
good,Moving around a lot and the company is currently growing and getting bigger they are now offering more benefits but amazon doesn't bend for its employees and it's chaotic at times but you get to meet a lot of people and learn things for the outside world
good,hardest part of the job would be being on feel all day long with short breaks. Huge location so rarely get to socially interact with same people
good,The benifits packaged offered is great but Amazon will work you into the ground and fire you at the drop of a hat. You have to meet the expected rates and you only get 2 ten minute breaks along with lunch.
good,"Stay to yourself and try to remain professional. Most days you come in you have to clean up behind the shift before you its not always so bad but it can be overwhelming. There is a lot of drama and some employees get away with things you wouldn't expect, the job isn't hard its the people they allow to work around you thats hard, management is more worried with the numbers than with the employee. Job security is extremely unstable."
good,"This job cared about your productivity and your rate. If you cant make the rate they will put you on the dock (loading tractor trailers) or let you go. They only tell you when you do something wrong. However, if you come into the job and truly try and give a good effort, they will work with you. I met some interesting and nice co-workers. Some of the management is very un-associative. Many need interpersonal and people skills. Lunch and breaks were, extremely, too short and rediculous."
good,90% of the jobs there are on the front line of jobs to be replaced by robots. Pay and compensation is exactly average by design.
good,"Ver demanding job, physically. Too many managers.  Co-workers are a good group. If you are three minutes late they will take an hour of your UPT. A great amount of people not pulling  their weight and management ignores it."
good,"Amazon was a very interesting place to work. As a picker, they have us constantly walking nonstop for nearly 10 hours. We have to meet a certain quota or rate and make sure items are picked efficiently and consistently to meet that rate. My co-workers were awesome. I am glad to have met many of them. The hardest part of the job was doing the same repetitive actions for ten hours straight. It eventually gets to you and makes you feel like a robot. The most enjoyable parts of the job are when we have competitions. I think it really makes working there a lot more fun."
good,"However, it is alot of favoritism here. So, it is hard to get ahead in the company unless you are friends with management. Even, if you work hard most of the employees get injured due to the over worked and hard labor on a daily basis. But, if you decided to work for them if you have a degree apply for management because you become a general warehouse worker, they put you in a box & they make it hard or close to impossible to become a manager."
good,Try many new ideas and hopefully hit a big one. The culture does not value experience engineers with good suggestions. Rather hire new grad and push them to the limit. Focus on speed rather than quality
good,"Delivering friendly, efficient customer service and creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere to all customers, with the key aim of retaining and attracting new customers. Responsibilities included:"
good,The pay is relatively low for the jobs you have to do. The highest pay  you with receive is 15 dollars an hour after being there for 3 years. Not much room for advancement
good,packing mail and putting it where it goes selcting and putting it n the right place and scaning it then wrapping the boxes when we done
good,long hours managers are always on your back. Everyday its something new. standing on your feet ALL DAY. short breaks. although the benefits and pay is good
good,Demanding place to work. You have to be very clear at setting boundaries and managing your work load. Managers are not trained - everyone is a doer. HR is only there to protect Amazon from another NY Times article
good,"Good company, staff great and very fair."
good,it was not the best place I have worked at. They didn't appreciate the hard work you did for them and the pay wasn't correct for the hours you did
good,"Had 20 managers in 4 years. Frustrating to deal with that. Hard to advance your career when you as soon as you build a relationship with a manager, theyre swapped out for another"
good,"management pressures employees like they are disposable and works them until they break.  Workers are great, hard-working people who have to put up with unsafe conditions to support families and retain the limited benefits amazon provides"
good,Amazon is not a career base company. My hour there didn't meet with my family . Worked 10 hours shift . That was really cool because I was able to spend more time with my family . Just pack the shipment
good,"Bad place to work. Short breaks, you cant even eat properly your lunch. Hard job and lot of stupid rules. Most of temporary workers fired up before Christmas without any previously notice. They promise different bonuses (signing bonus before Christmas for temps, bonus when u r leaving company - just for permanent staff, but then in real you get nothing). I was permanent associate but didnt noticed any special benefits and perks, except of emergency flexible paid holiday (20 hrs every 3 months)."
good,a typical day at work ensures that I'm most likely going to be running just to get a good  scanner  because everyone else takes 5 scanners for their friends.I learned that no matter how old you are its not going to stop you from being immature over a scanner.The management there are very rude at times and the hardest part of the job would be not to fall asleep while scanning. The most enjoyable part of the job would be some of the people there.
good,"good warehouse to work for but has its down falls with the job"
good,Amazon is a fast paced exciting place to work! Everyone around you is working on projects that are indeed going to change the world and consumer trends. You feel that you are part of something big.
good,"Amazon fulfillment center is a great place to gain adequate warehouse experience, is a fairly easy job, and also has amazing benefits. sadly the environment is alot to be desired, management and HR are absolutely no help, along with being very biased to other associates. TLDR: Great for a short term job if you're not going for managment."
good,"I currently work in LEX2, which is the Returns warehouse. My normal shift consists of processing returned items and determining whether or not the item is able to be resold or stowed away. Other parts of the job include receiving the boxes and removing the papers, packing peanuts, and bubble wrap from the boxes and sending them down the line. The job itself is monotonous and can be boring and tedious at times. The only pro about this job is that I was hired in as an Amazonian, which means I don't have to put up with the temporary agency BS along with Amazon's BS. It's also the only reason I've stayed at this job as long as I have. "
good,"A typical day at Amazon would. You will clock in at your scheduled time, meet in the stand up area, listen to all call out for the day, you'll do your stretches. Once that has been completed you'll  then proceed to your assigned spot for the day. While working a Amazon I learned to work my quickly. I also learned to lead and was promoted to Ambassador a trainer."
good,"I did work at Amazon but it was through Integrity during Peak season. Peak season are 11 hour days or nights. I chose to work nights and I was donut shift which meant I worked Monday through Friday. Working for 11 hours every day, 5 days in a row is a real killer. It is not good on your body. I worked 6:30 pm to 6 am  and I would sleep until 4 pm. I missed out on family events and skipped breakfast and lunch due to trying to catch up on sleep. The 2 days off seemed like one day. The more you work, the more they take out on taxes, but they will try to bribe you into ""free"" gift cards for working 59.5 hours a week. You get over time pay, regular pay, and a ""free"" $100 gift card. Sounds worth it right? Wrong! You have to claim all gift cards from them on your taxes, and again; the more you work the more they take out. The job packing itself is really nice but the incentives are horrible."
good,I only worked there for three weeks. Very fast paced and on your feet for 10 hours with very short breaks. Was hard to keep up the rates.
good,"Management on my shift is very good, other than that its not to good a place to work, they over work you and underpay you. Than you have to deal with a lot of peoples bad attitudes or just plan rudeness. the dress code is not followed employees dress unapporiately."
good,"At first I was excited to work in HR at such a big company. I will say there are a lot of smart & talented people that work there. Overall, I don't regret working there as it was a great learning experience. I will say it is not along term job but rather a stepping stone to your next step. I feel Amazon is NOT ideal for minorities as there is a buddy system in play that dictates your ceiling to progress there. Ive never worked for a company that made the job hardier by implementing ideas that are made by folks who are so removed from the frontlines due to their 6 figure incomes and lofty stock options."
good,"Low hours and low moral, cannot pay bills off of 20 hours a week max. work hard for little pay, They want you to work hard as possible with no compensation."
good,"The work is tough, the breaks are short, but the pay is alright. It's a fast pace environment because everyone is being timed."
good,I learned that management there wasn't as good as someone would expect but i did learn a lot of cool new things and how to perform better at my job.
good,"I've been working with Amazon for a little while, of course I have another job as the pay checks are so little after taxes. I don't like a lot about the job, but there is some good parts. I'll start with what I do like. I like that they have vending machines and all that in the job, many other jobs I've worked at didn't have that.. they have some days where they'll enter you into a drawing, some people I know won Amazon gift cards and game systems. They also would have days where they'll have pizza or something for workers. One last thing I like is they offer a lot of VTO almost everyday. Every once in awhile I'll take it(not a lot since you're not paid for that) . They also get out early most days. OH! and the pay isn't bad, as well as being paid weekly."
good,"received detail assignment(s) and followed "
good,"A typical day would start with ample work and end with ample work but the work was fun and never in the day i would feel like taking a break, i enjoyed my stint at amazon."
good,"Everything you hear about this company is true. You learn a lot, you work hard, you are a part of building something exciting"
good,Co-workers were good and had a family-like atmosphere. Management didn't care and was very ineffective at their respective jobs. Pay for the time and work hours was not great.
good,"Amazon did not want to make anyone full time. Gave only 3-5 hours a day. On December 26, 2014 they fired over 148 employees by phone. This is not a business to work for thinking that you will be advancing in positions."
good,Amazon has the potential to be a great company to work for but as long as they promote from the outside and not from within and utilize the people who actually know the job inside and out it will it will remain a place where the only thing that matters is what the numbers say on a printout never really knowing the people that make that place function
good,"I had started amazon thinking it would be great and it turned out horrible.  In one day don't be surprised to be moved around 6 times, and then still be expected to meet your rate.  The communication with in each department is a joke."
good,amazon is mainly about their production not very understanding of the employees needs or wants. If you are not able to make the rates they will be sure to let you go.
good,This would be a good job for retirees or students who need to earn some extra income. It is part time and temporary with the potential to be converted to permanent with vision and dental after successful completion of ninety days employment and provided that there are postions available.
good,"Management could have been much better, unorganized workplace that had expectations that were not practical.  Very long hours and physically demanding that should have compensated workers accordingly.  Alot of favoritism and hard to advance despite hard work and efforts.  The most enjoyable part had to have been to diverse group of people of all ages that worked together well and made the environment enjoyable."
good,"Typical day at the job was going in getting the press machine ready to go to get my orders out."
good,"High volume wharehouse environment with great co-workers and great ideas! Management unsupportive of worker advancement and heavy supervision, non trusting of employees."
good,"customer care for Spanish clients"
good,"very physical work environment. long days. mandatory OT during peak season. oportunity for advancement is based on wether or not they like you, not on your ability"
good,"Amazon is a great company from the outside, but has many visible flaws from the inside, as far as the mechanics of how it's employee environment is set."
good,"If you live for your job this is the place for you. Seriously, a great place to run with the big dogs but if you don't like throwing punches or have any expectation of ""time off"" -- not the right place."
good,"i counted bins all day to make sure product was there,learned to use math skills better,management was ok,hardest part of job is if your shift fell on a holiday you was working so no holiday with family"
good,Amazon is good company; however they lack communication and organization from within!!
good,An active role that involved lots of walking.  I walked up to ten miles a day and was continuously busy.  Physically demanding but satisfying in terms of gaining fitness.
good,"amazon is a company that claims they are caring of employees but all they care about is employees rates. attendance, and what there stock prices are. management is never there when you need them but always there to tell you when your rate is low"
good,"Amazon was an awesome experience! The hours was my down fall and the fact that your given a day or two of training and then you're on the floor. Let me not forget that the people that work there are so rude! Like, they take their problems out on anybody. Otherwise, the place is okay lol."
good,"Hardest part are the frequent mandatory hours of 60+ hours a week, "
good,peak season makes for 12hr day not many breaks. Gets really crowded with all other temp workers. on feet atleast 9 hrs aday for normal days. You can't climb the managment ladder at al all.there is no retirement. do you love your family? Then this is not your job.
good,"In working at Amazon you must constantly keep a fast pace. In such a fast paced environment, and attention to detail is a must. Safety is of up most concern, and I enjoyed the challenged."
good,Not abad job as jobs go.Unfortunately I had car problems in winter.Unable to continue to get to plainfield.
good,My time with Amazon has been a nice learning experience.  Very fast paced constantly changing role. My favorite part of the role is the ability to help the internal customers I serve. The most difficult part is the managements not giving consideration to home life and it's responsibilities.
good,"Keine Zukunft. Wenig Kontakt zu Arbeitskolegen.Übertriebene Kontrollen.Es werden immer hohe Leistungsansprüche gestellt.Höherer Lohn wird nie erreicht,da Befristungen immer vorher auslaufen.Leere Lohnversprechen."
good,Ich habe gelernt mit einen Scaner zu arbeten. Ware zu beurteilen ob sie defekt ist oder gut für den Kunden
good,"hectic non stop very focused on numbers per hour ,co workers were only good thing about the place."
good,"Good place to enjoy, especially for freshers. Very bad place to learn work culture. Happiest thing is no dress code."
good,"Picking merchandise for client that order online, I also worked packing item for delivery."
good,"Amazon is a fascinating place to work. It's a massive campus and can be very exciting at times. But the typical day to day was inconsistent with management, direction, and left little to be desired for work-life balance."
good,Inability to promote associated in a timely manner. Not very career or employee morale driven
good,"Ein typischer Arbeitstag begann mit 3.00 Uhr morgens aufstehen, 4.00 Uhr losfahren bis zu den Messeparkplätzen von Rheinberg, der uns zur Verfügung gestellt wurde. Anschließend wurden wir mit angemieteten Reisebussen zum Haupteingang der Firma gebracht. 4.30 Uhr schnell zu den Spinten, wo wir unsere Taschen eingeschlossen hatten, Toilettengang und in der Kantine wurden die Wasserflaschen auffüllt. Dann musste man durch die Sicherheitsschleuße gehen. Man musste sich elektronisch eingeloggen (Zeiterfassung) und nochmals in einer Anwesenheitsliste eintragen dann zum allmorgentlichen Wettlauf um einen guten Scanner zu bekommen. Punkt 5.00 Uhr Start Meeting mit hunderten von Mitarbeitern. Dann schnell auf dem Scanner einloggen und zu dem entsprechen Lagerort gehen, ein Cart mit zwei Kisten bestücken und los gehts."
good,Das Arbeitsklima war zum teil ganz ok es war alles nur etwas unstrukturiert und man hat sehr viel gearbeitet für nicht gerade viel geld
good,"my co-workers are very helpful and so are most managers, the hardest part is the strain on my body."
good,"I work part time at amazon. this work is become part of my life experience. I enjoy the fact that I could really experience the warehouse environment. I observed their assembly line and learned a lot about their process. The management is fine, they try to listen to associates and fix some problem but the main concern remains production although their priority is Safety and Quality first. The job is really hard and exhausting and the pay is not really."
good,"A typical day means you better have plenty of coffee, started at 6:00P.M to 4:30A.M. very boring and time drags on but it was worth it, didn't see to many co-workers"
good,although a strict and hardworking place it was enjoyable and good to work for amazon despite my early departure through an error. i learned to work in a fast paced environment in a team and enjoyed my experience and time there.
good,A typical day at work at Amazon will consist of me packing customers orders into boxes after scanning and sealing the boxes with Amazon tape.
good,"They need a whole new team of managers"
good,"First I will tell you that I never knew how good I was until I came to Amazon. While you are here you will be surounded by amazing talent. If you can make a name for yourself here then you are doing very well. That being said, it is difficult to sustain the level of stress for very long. Most of the leadership is young. Meaning that they do not have family life outside of work and can devote most of their time to Amazon. The pay and compensation for these guys is great. The down side is that most of the leadership are managers and not leaders. Not much patience with development. Why can't you get this? Is the management mantra. 70% of the entire workforce has less than 2 years with the company. This is a great company to work for to boost your career while you are young and single as promotions are given often and hard work is rewarded; however, not many people stay with the company for very long. That goes for managers and associates."
good,"it has good benefits, but you are nothing but a number to them"
good,It was a good company but they schedule alot of overtime. They also dont have an organize mangement at all. They have really bad lay offs after christmas no matter if your permanent or temporary. Its just easier for them to lay you off when your temporary.
good,"Receiving ,unpaking and sorting off goods for future customer orders.Managment target and quality orientated. co workers mostly agency ,the ones I was working with where tempory for the Christmas period the same as me. Hopeful off being kept on after the Christmas period. The weight of some of the boxes you have to unpack.when the products you are dealing with are easy to process and the shiping codes and bar codes are working ,ie when the line is runing smoothly."
good,"Sometimes there were long 12 hr days, but the fact that they did provided overtime was a definite plus. Enjoy the fast paced environment and there were always things to do."
good,The job is fast paced and works consistently with global orgs. The management is scattered and targets are always moving. It is very difficult to know what is expected.
good,We work long hours with short breaks. i learned how to pack and work with pallets. it a diverse work place. Management could do better but working with co-workers is fun. The hardest part of the job is having short breaks and working under hard circumstances. I take my job serious and apprecitate everyone who trained me.
good,"I've been working for Amazon for little of 3 months as been converted from Integrity. When you first start it seems easy, but only a couple months its not anymore. When you think about heading to Amazon. I'll give you one tip: Don't sign up for picking. Once you decide your stuck for the duration of your assignment unless you reach 90 days then you can."
good,at work you processed products returned by customers across the world. management was okay the morl was low due to lack of concern for actual employess with safety and quality. it was all about the numbers. the weeks of overtime would have to had been the hardest part considering they only give ten minute breaks and twenty minute lunches.
good,a typical day at Amazon was a scanner and a lot of walking. Not a whole lot of communication with management pretty much on your own. Hardest part of the job is the lonelyness. Most enjoyable is the freedom to work at your own pace.
good,Results driven company. Process improvement happens every day which creates an exciting environment. Work life balance can be a challenge at times.
good,"doing the same thing over and over, you learn a lot about the fullfillment aspect of companies, management is a little hard to get along with, hardest part of the job is being on your feet and walking about 20 miles a day as fast as you can,"
good,"Your raises go down each year you are there (four max). You get stock options each year, but when it is close to turn them over to you, they will fire you for some trumped-up reason to keep from letting you have the stock. They don't want anyone in there more than four years so they won't have people asking for raises. If they like your work, they will hire you from the agency you are with, then fire you after three more years."
good,Differential for night shift is very minimal. Break times are a problem because the warehouse is so big. About a third of your 1st and final breaks are taken up with the time it takes to walk quickly to the break room. (10 hour shifts-breaks are important)
good,"Amazon as a company wasn't too terrible. But the people that were in charge did not understand how to do their job. I would not recommend working for the company that I have, but I would recommend working for another 3rd party company that delivers for them."
good,a good place to work at. nice people. there is no dress code I work overnight hardest part is stowing the packages into the bags. you start out with a standup to know how many packages that you have for the night.
good,"This is a place who believe that the deadlines they have set greatly outweighs the safety or health concerns of their loyal employees, any talk of unions or quest for raises or helathcare made you a target"
good,Management is to absorbed in numbers and not the human aspect of a business.. room for growth is limited.  Hr is abysmal within loosing documents or not getting things done or removing positions being applied for in less time then to give all a chance.
good,"Stipendio e ambiente buono, ma talmente controllato da risultare stressante"
good,PS regular en esta empresa te ayuda a conocer pero no hacer parte de ella
good,You would have to choose work over school if you decide to work here. You have a certain amount of hours you can take off and those hours went towards taking off for school rather than for my own leisure and emergencies.
good,"A typical day was to sign in and set up the workstation before starting the day’s work. Start packing customer’s orders from a trolley that was sorted by the picking team. And once the goods are packed place on a conveyor belt for the next stage of the process."
good,"I can only speak for myself. It's a good place to work but there's too many strict rules to go by. It seems like the system is set up for people to easily get fired. They don't explain things properly so that no one will make a mistake and take a chance on getting fire. It's bad enough I have to take a long walk from my station to the break room. By the I get there I've already lost 5 to 6 minutes. Then I have to leave the break room early enough so I can be back my station within 30 minutes. I've had several write ups due to late breaks. Then they decide to change the break schedule which caused me my last termination. With the new break schedule, I have to clock out for the first break and clock back in 30 minutes. Then I would have to return back to my station in 5 minutes."
good,"Get the job done. Not upfront about the overall responsibilities until they need you to do it, then it is your job. The work is not hard, just very mundane."
good,"The main issue is ERC and HR. The Federal Labor Laws are not upheld nor enforced. HR Personnel lacks knowledge of basic HR regulations and communication. There's no respect for individual. Management walks throughout the Facility with their heads down, it appears it's a culture shock.  There's absolutely NO FUN at Amazon!! They want you standing for 11 hrs and 45 mins. They pick and choose which rules they will enforce.  The VOA board is useless because OPS using it as pure comedy.  They reply with lack of respect and empathy."
good,"Do 6 months at 6 days a week and then leave. "
good,"Seems really nice at first, slowly declines as time goes on. I can't imagine having a career with this company. Very difficult to advance. Overall, not a necessarily bad company, but far too large to worry about employers needs."
good,"Travail faisable "
good,Overall pretty decent but not much job stability. Was promised to be converted but it has been over a year. A lot of physical work. Good for something temporary.
good,"It’s over working, the working conditions are terrible and life threatening. People get hurt and they don’t care, all they care about is time and getting packaging out. They only give you a 15 minute break and if you exceed that, you’re in line to be fired"
good,"People are treated like robots. we are pushed to have high scan rates.  Harhly any recognition.  I worked there for 3 years and was ignored for advancement due to my age.  I was discharged for going over my UPT time by 2 hours.  I had respect from my Co workers   I bought up safety issues that were ignored.  When I bought up concerns the managers would say that's a great idea,,,  then ignored it.  ."
good,Life at Amazon is very hard. Management is very good. But work and life balance is not there. Very tough conditions. Shift is very lengthy. Top Management does not keep an eye on the lower management.
good,"Way too many Rules, not Easy to Advance, Your numbers have to be high in order to even Remain Employed There. climate control is either warm or cold Depending on where u are in the wharehouse, Many Different Nationalities and Hygene is not Peoples favorite, iles you Enter will be left Fumigated for hours.. Safety is not a big pepe eather, Considering the race tournaments for prizes will get you Ran over by a cart..and you also can lose numbers by scanning the wrong Item, that stops you from Reaching your Numbers for Each hour which is 100 items needed..."
good,It was so long ago I can not fully remember. A typical day at work was coming in reporting to my station and beginning work. Workplace culture was really everyone working independently until management sought otherwise.
good,It was a stressful job it didn’t work with my life they make you put that company before your loved ones and it’s a very physical exhausting job and they also have these rates you have to meet that you’d have to be a robot to get and if you don’t meet them you’ll soon realize their quick to let you go.
good,"It's a great job, fast, pays well, lots of hours, but I would recommend a professional to take a short contract and move on quickly."
good,More interested in quantity than quality. Management just look at figures on their computers rather than actually walking around to see what is happening. Performance rates are too high and encourage corner cutting as this is the only way that they can be regularly met.
good,"Hardly any time on breaks, 27 minutes in total, forcing you to rush around when trying to get something to eat. Timed toilet breaks, management constantly looking over your shoulder and interrupting you when you are trying to hit targets."
good,"There is an incredible lack of communication between the ""leaders"" in the building. No one is ever on the same page and the employees are very undervalued."
good,Management loves to play favorites. If you aren't one of the few chosen they don't care about you as long as the work is getting done. Safety is preached but not enforced.
good,"Hours not guaranteed, and only limited availability with employment contract. Seasonal work with no opportunity for long-term work. Job was standard warehouse work, picking and packing. Long hours, standing"
good,i personally liked the work but hard to work 10 hr shifts around two kids by yourself. benefits were not good and pay was sad. Impossible to be able to move up
good,"Great employees but bad management "
good,"This was an interesting experience, they don’t provide classroom training, your on the NOISY warehouse floor receiving safety training, and expected to hear and respond...  then you’re thrown into the section where you’re going to work... except NO ONE trains you!!!   You must be a fast learner & figure out how to work in that place, or you won’t make it!  Please have THICK skin!"
good,"In mancanza di lavoro ovviamente tutto va bene. Ambiente tranquillo e ottimo rapporto con i colleghi, purtroppo la politica di Amazon è "
good,"My experience was better but some problems to left job. Good environment in work area "
good,"During the peak season is when hours where available truly, 35 plus hours I am referring to. Out side of peak your looking at 20 hr unless your a salary manager. Incentive that the company had was not pass down fairly to all associates. It was left in the salary managers hands to pass down TV’s, ear buds, beats head sets, Surround sound Equipment to what appeared to be a coincident there favorite associate in which Received theses prizes. So come to work get your check and go home.dition"
good,"long travel to get there, reason why preferred night shift! and picking was most enjoyable aspect of the job. it is not for everyone as other aspects of the job can be difficult to achieve due to lack of space"
good,"Fast despatch transport ltd. agency"
good,"You go there to work and they make you work!"
good,It was Physical work Ina day I would Load over 1k boxes daily throughout the trucks i was the Manager of the fluid Lines  unfortunately I had to go leave because of Personal issues
good,"The floors are made of the extra hard concrete in order to support the heavy equipment, but it is terrible for employee health and happiness.  You leave every day in pain, especially in your feet and back.  No one smiles or seems to enjoy working there."
good,"Venir 11h de travaille pour effectuer le même poste toutes la journée "
good,"Working there was a nightmare only got 5 minute breaks, management never helped me out when I needed it. They only care if you make your numbers and nothing else."
good,Good hours low pay management on other shifts are willing to help you. Management on my shift you wouldn't help he would be gone for hours at a time so by the time you needed help another manager would take over.
good,"You either love it and thrive."
good,Amazon est une usine où le travail est très stressent.
good,"Would not recommend to a friend at all. It is a machine that will churn you out as soon as you begin to miss the ever-rising targets. Fine for singletons, not suited to family at all"
good,"il posto si presenta perfetto, d'altronde è la ditta più importante al mondo, ma non è così, tralasciando le cose personali come le tempistiche delle pause è il lento aumentare dei ritmi che ti distrugge."
good,"This was not an especially fun job. Managers constantly shouted at us to move faster to load our vans, and threatened with write-ups if we didn't move fast enough. This was a seasonal job, meaning it was temporary. We had no benefits, no PTO, no pay for holidays. It was nice to be on the road."
good,"Can be fun when working with the right people, but some of the targets they ask for from new staff can be ridiculous due to lay out of the fc. every is very friendly as well. if the agencies arent there anymore that would be good."
good,Overtime is mandatory. If you get sick good luck. Sick days will only count for you not if your child gets sick. No matter the excuse if you go over your max allotted points they will fire you. They push you to the limit. Always over-worked.
good,"It was hard work but worth it in the end. They ruined the whole system by adding the contractors. If they didn't add the contractors, then I'd still be working there right now"
good,The best part of the job is the various shifts benefits and pay. Management is very RUDE and DISRESPECTFUL they use their position to their advantage and when you voice the matters to upper management it’s all a joke and not taken seriously. It’s not a hard or bad place of employment but the employees makes it HORRIBLE
good,Im a flex worker but I could only snag a flex schedule at an amazon location an hour away from me. Im a picker and it is pure heck (was flagged for innapropriate language on the word i want) but ive heard from other people in different roles that its horrible on their ends too. Seems that packers are the only ones who have it good but be warned that as of now flex workers cannot be trained into another role at all. So if you have a set schedule try to get trained into packing. They need more bathrooms and should keep the fans/air on at all times and should play some quiet music in the background for the love of god. I mean even elevator music would help. Other than that....its a job.
good,Good Company to work for. The pay was good. The management and training need to be improved. The work schedule did not work for me. We had to choose 30 minute shifts to build a schedule for the shift bid.
good,Not the best experience in regard to concern for employee well-being. Better compensation and immediate benefits should be given instead of being treated with disregard.
good,"amazon is a ok place to work i do feel that when they adjust your shifts to 11 or 12 hrs your break should be a little longs so its things that are not takin into consideration and when it comes to bathrooms break idk who put a five min limit on it because if you are sick its kinda out of our control. "
good,The company pays great for the job your doing but it is not a long term option. If needed to work and get paid you will get paid. The job can get stressful at times but overall good job.
good,"The job includes a lot of learning if you are a fresher. For experienced folks, career growth would become an issue once you exceed a certain tenure. Middle management is partial while the top is oblivious to the things that go around and are being done at lower levels."
good,"The health benefits are great. Most communication flows down. They don't listen to employees. Favoritism is common, rules are applied selectively, and equipment is often not working."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Amazon. I was left to get on with the job and that suited me fine. If you work at a good pace, it's fine. Others were sacked while I was there, but generally they were people who stopped and talked a lot. I had heard horror stories prior to taking the role, but never experienced such things myself. A management role would be good, but I can't imagine a working as a pick/packer etc for a long time."
good,Too new to know. But it seems like it is very easy to get fired and they have high turnover. Lunch is only 30 minutes and two 15 minute breaks. It can take up to 5 minutes to walk to the break room and 5 minutes back to the work area which significantly detracts from the actual time you have for breaks. They aren't kidding when they tell you that you will be walking up to 10 miles a day.
good,The company has you deliver in harsh weather condtions and it gets stressful with the amount of packages.  The pay is pretty good and you definetely gain skills as a driver.
good,If there is enough work the job is very easy. The only job that might be a little challenging would be robotics. It's not hard. It's just a lot of manual labor.
good,Negative work culture. Hours are long. Wear good shoes. Job is very repetative. Overall a good job if you are young and in good shape. Very easy work but Management is very pushy on productivity.
good,"affordable cafeteria on discounted price"
good,"This job was seasonal. The supervisor would always inform you if you were not working fast enough. I did have to work in 3 different environments: Ambient(room temperature), Chilled(Dairy,fresh meats, etc) and Freezer.  I would have to put on protective clothes to work in the freezer."
good,"Responsibilities are not well defined in the IT area.  You are to take up anything and everything that comes to your way.  This may include HVAC, Electrical or even building maintenance.  The warehouse IT division has poor leadership with poor management.  They dont keep up with the operations side and get kicked around by the retail warehouse General managers."
good,I wouldnt be on this site if amazon was everything. try working there and then tell me what you think. long story short it is not the best job. ......
good,Management showed little to no leadership and made empty promises to the employees. Employees were expected to know the job with scarce training. Everything was winged so to speak.
good,Contratto mog 2 giorni lavorativi assicurati a settimana.
good,Worked in the warehouse portion of a fullfillment center using electrical forklift equipment.  Work flow was monitored using basic put up and pick counts.
good,"I have nothing to say about working at Amazon. Loved it at first, over time it became clear that I was nothing more than a body in a seat and did not matter to management."
good,I am new to the area are the culture and wok atmosphere was not what I expected. I compare working there like being in high school. Too much personality conflict .
good,"Different supervisors tell you different answers to questions, no one seems to know what is going on.Training is poor and then your expected to know your job right away"
good,Amazon has great medical benefits. They don't recognize their hard working associates to promote them and always talking about they are hiring.  It's disorganize and chaotic at times. They hire Area Managers straight out of college whom never had a job before.
good,Superficial caring of employees. They would pretend to care then to actually fix any broken processes. They hide and cover up things that the public should know.
good,I call Amazon The Island of Misfit Toys because they do not ask much about your previous past only that you pass a drug test and then you get hired on to the floor. However that means that a lot of people make it into Amazon who don't really haven't to work. So be prepared if you are a person of good work ethic to work twice if not three times harder than everyone else.
good,"if face fits and you are subservient you will do well at amazon!"
good,"I really feel that the Amazon call center is a great place to work for those who are really interested in customer service over the phone. It was not a great personal match for me, but that doesn't mean that it wouldn't be for someone else. However, I don't like management. They pick at your phone calls strenuously and you can get in trouble for anything."
good,Amazon is bad work. Everyone is tired and angry. Pay is not enough for amount of stress on your body you accrue throughout the day. Management isn't good. They act like everything is doable in a 8 hour time frame but they aren't the ones actually out there busting there butt working. They just sit in there cozy chair and yell at you all day for any little thing. Bump Amazon. Pay your employee's more! A d treat them wayyyy better
good,"its fast pace work,  and if you dont meet there quota,  they let you go. keep in mind you are working 10 hrs a day 4 day a week.  it would be a good company to work for but,  they dont work with you on getting better at you're work."
good,Hr could of been more understanding and helpful; Would have been nice to get promoted through your supervisor other than having to compete and apply for the same job like everyone else
good,"Managers don't do any work. They just talk all shift and pick favorites who they let get away with working less. Advancing in the company is also very hard. If you need the money its good, otherwise go somewhere else."
good,"Aucun pas très bien comme metier "
good,"Too much racial anger.   It felt like blacks were in competition with whites, and blacks kept playing the racist card to win and were winning, which created a highly stressful work environment."
good,"Lack of organization in warehouse meant routes were not started until 10am, full route was expected to be completed disregarding the delay in the warehaouse"
good,"Good for short term to stack some dollars on the side. Have a monetary goal, once met leave                                                      Or stay full time as an actual amazonian for the stocks (rsu’s)"
good,"I worked at amazon in Kentucky. There was a lot of racism there when it come to safety. If you were Hispanic or Asian then they looked the other way. If you were not Hispanic or Asian they fired for little stupid stuff. I think the company, who makes hundreds of billions in profits every year, can afford to pay their workers more than that they are now. Plus Amazon is expanding to fast and that is something that will lead to their down fall. You can get fire for anything really. If they didn't like the way you dress or look they fired you. This company truly needs a union. They treat their workers horribly."
good,"Promote from within.  Many tier 1 associates have master's degrees, but have managers that will not approve their applications to promote.  Hire top notch HR professionals who are well versed in Diversity and Inclusion. When hiring recent grads, please provide additional training on managing teams and the professionalism and respect that is required to be efficient."
good,Typical day is working on a number of varying issues and resolutions. Workplace culture is awesome. Most enjoyable is solving problems and to ship products enjoyed by the consumers which is rewarding. Hardest part of the job is when there is no clear direction and lack of communication.
good,"Numbers are all that matter to the higher ups. As long as you work fast and hard, you get noticed. They always are looking to promote within the company so make sure that you get to know your supervisor or manager. One of the cons was the hours you had to work and the quotas you needed to meet are crazy high."
good,The salary is low for the job skill that is obtained while there. The benefits are great. No real room for advancement and growth. Everything is timed.
good,You are nothing more than a robot. You are constantly being threatened of being fired if you dont make rate. Tot ( time off task) you must scan something every.  5 minutes otherwise you get tot. You practically have to run to bathroom. Only 2 30 minute breaks 1 paid when working a 10 hour shift. Only 10% discount up to $100.00 in a year. Unorganized management.Benefits 1st day
good,"amazon was a Okay place to work as a temp job meaning you could work there as a regular employee for inside 6 months to a year although I would say that there is no longevity in this company cause of their work dynamic is always changing on a day to day basis. Also if their is no fret to work that means you do not work which means you don't get paid so if the warehouse you are working dose not get any merchandise in you will be sent home and not be paid for that day so if there is no work for the week or so you do not get paid for that time you are out of work ,so yes that means no job security as well so if you are looking for a reliable source of work may I suggest that you go somewhere else for a stable source of income. this is not that place you are looking for."
good,"Its a place of hard work and very competitive."
good,I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. your Am set goals that cant be met every day. was fired after 7 years because I couldn't cover 2 minutes. I stay late numerous times without a thank you.
good,"I worked at the warehouse in Ruskin for many years, even as an assistant manager. This company cares very little about their employees and more about how the company is perceived and hitting ""those numbers"". For a company that does as well as Amazon, it's embarrassing how little the company actually has to offer when you peel back the recent pay increase... Good if you need a quick buck...not much more unless you have a B.A. degree and no soul to match. Amazon rarely hires from within. Your head manager will likely be a frat boy, fresh out of college, with no real world experience or management skills. He will be chosen over the seasoned employees who live and breathe Amazon."
good,"Interesting place to work, there is a lot of movement so teams tend to always have new people on them, so always learning opportunities. With global teams can mean late night calls - for months per project."
good,"you never know what you're going to do on a typical day. One day the may send you to the dock to unload trucks. The next day, you may stand at a station and stows items all day for 10 and a half hours. The next day you may be janitorial and clean the whole floor and get rid of trash."
good,"Benefits are great! Management is an obvious weakness at the fulfilment center that I'm currently employed at. I currently work BHN schedule. Pays the best due to shift differential, but be prepared to work 3 consecutive 12 hour shifts on the weekends."
good,"Liked the work i was doing."
good,"Working as a driver you will start with 80/90 drops per day and they will start to give you more and more everyday for the same wage daily of £114. It can seems a good wage but at the end what you are going to earn after tax, petrol, van, etc. is around £50/£60 without contract, sick paid, holiday, etc."
good,"If you're confident you can stand on your feet 10 hours a day be consistent,keep a pace then I say go for it, if not don't bother you'll be gone quick."
good,"It wasn't bad, it is fast paced, pay is ok if you are single with roommates to share costs. It is a good company, but people are like cogs in a machine."
good,"Uniquement la production, le bien être du salarié passe en second plan comme dans beaucoup d'usine je pense."
good,Great place to work except when they lack work you are charged time off task (TOT). When their is no work you should not be charged time off task. Expected rate is a bit excessive when no work available. After departing Amazon was informed they no longer offer stocks to employees or VCP.
good,"I am a truck driver for Amazon and every day more and since the companies lower the prices of our salaries, we do not have comfortable trucks all are old."
good,Hated the walking and they push you too hard. I didn't like working for this company at all.  Noisy and the people over you are not nice. Very judgmental.
good,"They only care about the packages, they treat their employees as if they’re disposable. Management doesn’t listen to any concerns. When you try to explain things to them, they brush it off as if it isn’t important. We weren’t properly trained, but afterwards, management loves to refer back to training/orientation. “I don’t know” is their favorite response, or they’ll give you a BS answer just so that you can leave them alone."
good,"There is a lot disorder about the flow of the job and a lot younger,. Hard to find your package to delivery and a lot mess to distribute the customer package and waist time after you were ready to deliver the merchandise"
good,"Working conditions are harsh, and hot, you are worked on rate. No matter how good of a worker you are it all depends on rate, if you keep having a slow rate or constant errors you are terminated from your job and escorted out the building."
good,"Di per se è un buon lavoro, stipendio a norma ecc, il problema sono i manager che attuano politiche di nepotismo favorendo amici e parenti, i manager si fanno dei ""favori"" tra loro facendo assumere amici e parenti, spesso non capaci nel ruolo e le persone con qualità e professionalità vengono silurate perché ormai è diventato talmente mediocre il livello di assistenza che devono mantenere questo standard per tenersi il loro ruolo ed eliminare possibili candidati che possono concorrere per il loro ruolo."
good,"Amazon hires too many employees. If there isn't enough work for everybody, they send people home. You are essentially working ""on call,"" except you have to show up for work every day."
good,"no job security, only good as extra money for xmas. short break times does not accomodate for smokers, if you are willing to pull your finger out you may just survive past xmas"
good,"Picking up a shift was challenging. Sometimes the system would fail and one time it scheduled me in the wrong location. Shifts would be very hard to get because you didn’t have a set schedule, they would be released at a certain time every week and they didn’t have enough shifts for every employee. It was also near impossible to get a hold of managers. Very disorganized but the work itself wasn’t bad."
good,Fanno carriera solo le signorine poco vestite e i parenti di persone nelle risorse umane
good,"The position and jobsite are both relatively new (3 months as of writing this).  This fact would make it seem that there is much to be excited about in coming to work for the company.  Being part of an initial group to bring Amazon-branded delivery services to the area for the first time seemed worthwhile.  However, that novelty wears off quickly as some challenges present themselves upon joining the company as a delivery associate.  "
good,"Most managers are not a real manager, they just have done enough for the higher ups to notice them to allow them to get the positions. But, most of them dont have managerial skills such as they dony know how to speak to people, they dont have any compassion towards people, and they are lazy."
good,"Some of the managers need to learn communication skills, one in particular I had blisters on my feet and it was break time and I went to a manager and asked him if I could to go my locker to change my shoes and i would be back on the line afterwards,  At first he said no so when I walked away he said oh no you can go.  If he doubted me he could have told me ok go get your shoes changed and come back and see me but he gave me an attitude.  Managers are people we go to when we have a problem but all he gave me was an attitude.  Except for this manager all managers are very supportive."
good,"This job was most beneficial to me as a college student working night shift, while attending lectures/clinicals during the day.  The pay wasn't fantastic, yet expected for a warehouse job.  Plus side, there was always an opportunity to pick up shifts and work long hours during the holidays to earn more money. This job is a good temporary job until you can line up something better for yourself."
good,"It is a good place to start working in while you are looking for some thing better, the over time there pays good money but too much work to do, after a while you will get used to it but try not to get too much used to it or else you will be stuck there, recommended"
good,"10 hour shifts 4 days work are good, but being overworked isnt"
good,The managers treated you as a number that had to be met or you would get verbal warning. I moved up in.departments and showed how valuable I was to most of the teams I worked with bnt some of the operation specialist/ internerns always set me up to see it how long it wouldt tell take me to fail no compiments or encouraging praise it made me feel horribnlr.a.d wor5hdess. worthlessly
good,"The people calling the shots and making changes (Management) are not the ones who have to live with the changes (Supervisors & Floor Workers). Because of this, you have random college kids and middle-aged jocks (Management) making job processes more difficult because they are out of touch with the work that is actually done out on the floor. They will regularly sacrifice quality and safety to cut corners and make productivity"
good,Terrible communication overall. Decent pay for type of work. No real incentive to wanna stay. No feeling of any opportunity for advancement. Mostly just a job & pay check.
good,"As a flex time employee, this job is perfect for an extra side income. "
good,"They raised pay so its a better pay rate than most part time jobs with little experience, but the culture of amazon is not good. Its a lot of favoritism, disrespect and race plays a big part."
good,High volume work with little respect given to employees. Consistent hours.Good seasonal job during the holidays but would be hard to work two jobs because it is such a high volume job requiring lots of energy. The pay is better than most entry level positions.
good,There is no cultures here it work hard help raise rates and work yourself out of s job management lacks knowledge of the process and turn over rate so high nothing gets addressed.
good,"This place is fast pace. The management doesn't really care much of your capacity. As long as you meet the numbers they require your good for them. Breaks are very short and your back on the job. Make sure you get a good shift from the start and not graveyard. No matter how many times you request for a day shift, it will fall on deaf ears. No room for advancement, what you are is what you'll be for the longest time."
good,"Amazon pays pretty good that's the mai reason I'm still with them as well as the medical benefits. The managers dont care about their people, work us to the bone and then expects us not to be tired. They promote people who dont work, they ignore those that do until they finally get sick of going above and beyond and start to slack like everyone else. They keep raising the rates and people get fired if they can't make them. No morale"
good,"Expect to work really hard every day"
good,"El trabajo en si es bueno pero la rotación del personal da mucho que hablar, se contrataron al rededor de 600 personas a las que no se les brindo un tiempo o un motivo del porque su baja."
good,I enjoyed my job very much.  Management was very unfair.  They pick and choose who they will do for. After working there for over 5 years they will find a way to let u go. I worked as a trainer the first 3 years. I learned almost ever department.  And was very good at my job
good,"The work was fine and the overall environment was more or less a place to meet new people. Though if you are looking to advance yourself then I would look elsewhere, not the place to make a career for yourself in my opinion."
good,i liked that when i first started with amazon integrity was always there to answer any questions i had. i liked the asignment i was given and the friendlyness of other employes.
good,Worked there for almost 3 years and my pay was going to cap out once you hit 3 years of employment. The only time pay raise occurs after that is when company decides which depends on location. They hire almost anyone but the tend to have lack of leadership and a concern for workers. People often get looked over and if you don't make rate then you will have a hard time keeping this job. Many people I started with quit after a couple of weeks. Many people only stay for 6 months and then quit or get fired. They have good benefits if you are single but if you are married or have kids then the insurance rates spike tremendously. There are lots of job types though and usually get rotated around often which can be a nice change if you get bored of doing the same thing all day long.
good,"Always Day 1 here. Most managers are great to work with, however the senior managers continue to fill your plate to the point that most are working on their days off and well over 60-70 hours every week just to keep up and not be rated least effective and fired 3 weeks later...."
good,Its Stressfull and bad management but good employees and you get trained for 3 days and the breaks are very short and long hours and no sick days allowed
good,"The first month is was productive, but after being familiar with the work flow and culture, you start to question your self worth as an employee. If you get sick, too many times, they have no problem letting you go."
good,"Little care for employees along with little respect, workers are seen as replaceable instead of trainable. Fast-paced environment to meet customer demands, with long hours."
good,"Only good thing about the place really is wourking 4 on 3 off so you are set days no rotating, and the majoraty of the workers are really nice and can have a laugh and really friendly. the odd manager is sound but most aren't and speak to you like rubbish."
good,"Amazon was a quick paced, very busy sort of work environment. The crew leaders were very helpful, however HR was always hesitant to provide assistance and didn't seem to care for the employees."
good,The work was fast paced and a lot was expected of you. The people that I worked with were kind. The expectation that they had for the job that I was doing was not clear.
good,"I quit the seasonal job a few weeks after working there. The work and job was fast pace and stressful. You had to fill tote bags anywhere from 0 to 40 feet from a bakers rack. The target quota for each stower who does this is 250 packages sorted per hour. After two weeks, my speed was about 160 per hour. I think that is pretty fast, but I criticized for not being fast enough. I think if you are around 200 per hour, then you don't get criticize for speed or are in a good circle. I think some people were as fast as only 100- 120 items per hour, but unlike me, they continued to stick it through."
good,"working at Amazon is fun employee relation wise but the system is customer focused rather than both employee and customer focused. "
good,Your are always learning new things due to the constant changes to make things better. You meet a lot of great people. You work closely with management which is good if you want to advance.
good,"Working in the warehouse is brutal. It isn't impossible but there is a couple week period before you settle into it.  It is near impossible to have a normal life if you work nights in the warehouse.  Sleeping during the day isn't fun and will ruin your circadian rhythm for a month or two after you leave as well.  It pays well and the other workers are generally very nice.  However, getting off of a 9 hour shift is rewarding and great exercise."
good,Well it was very stressful there but the management was great lot of people all in a small area other than that it was ok . Dispatcher were great always helpful
good,"Amazon is a great company to work for given its amazing  benefits and compensation, but with the constant rotation of management and constant change of the rules it can be very difficult to adjust"
good,"Amazon is a place that people either really love or really hate.  The culture there is to work very hard, to innovate, to question, to come up with solutions, not just highlight any perceived problems."
good,"Everything sounds good on the outside. Good hourly pay, benefits, and no dress codes. "
good,"Pay is okay but not equivalent to the work you are expected to do. They do not really care about there employees just hitting their numbers.  There is no real work and family balance, and they do not allows give you the days and hours you were promised. The good thing is this is a job and you are paid, with benefits starting day one."
good,"Amazon is a great place for the young and energetic. Advancement opportunities are available, some with no college necessary. Benefits are comparable to others in the logistics industry."
good,"While i was at Amazon the environment was very clicky. The managers had thier favorites and I dont think they cared if it showed. I asked the Learning ambassadors a few times, but never recieved the opportunity to be trained as anything other than a scanner while everyone else who was hired around the same time as me were trained."
good,"Working at Amazon is NOT for everybody, if you want an easy and quick job as a part time go ahead and work at Amazon, but know that they are always changing how things work and always changing shifts every season. I had my shift times changed three times, from overnight, to evenings, to mornings. You can make some good friends at Amazon, but mangement are not always your friend, had a girl who was really nice to everyone but got promoted and changed completly because of how the Ambassadors (managers that would watch over accosiates and warehouse needs) acted, they would talk bad about people in the warehouse and barely help anyone. Also the rules at the warehouse can be easily broken and no one will care."
good,I dont want to wright a summary. Why are u guys making me wright a summary i dont want too wright this summary its good i guess if u have second job..
good,"Proceed with caution. It's the Amazon machine mentality. You're late?, you pay. One minute late from lunch, you pay. Know what you are getting into. Definitely not a long term option."
good,The pay is great as well as the schedule because it’s a set schedule. You’ll always know your schedule but the management is terrible. First day on the job they gave me a defective badge so i automatically got points for lateness when i was hired in November which wasn’t corrected until late January. Also on the first day we weren’t trained properly nor did the shift managers care so we had to basically ask around & teach ourselves. During the hiring process they explained we would receive certain benefits within hiring and our first 90 days but after being hired we quickly learned that’s wasn’t correct information and it’s depending on if you’re chosen to become a blue badge or Ambassador. I never even actually met my supervisor personally until i resigned in February and she’s allegedly supposed to be on site.
good,naja kann man machen. muss man für dieses Gehalt aber nicht !
good,"Excellent benefits, however, you are worked very hard for minimum wage.  Difficult to work with some people, when there is a communication gap (i.e. different languages)"
good,"Does not pay well. Customer surveys were not geared towards the associate who helped the customer, even though the employees grading was based a lot on customers reviews."
good,"Profile is realted to live communication via phone , chat or email on B2C."
good,"Amazon is still a young company and is in need of improvement when it comes to the leadership of upper management.  Unfortunately, sometimes they hire by educational level and not by skill and this causes conflict."
good,The atmosphere at Amazon can be vary relaxed depending upon your direct leadership.This unfortunately causes varying expectations on how the workplace should be treated.
good,"It was always busy there. The management team sucks an if you are not willing to ""kiss butt"" chances are way harder to move forward. There were multiple schedules to choose from which was good. Including days, nights, weekends. This was a 24hr business"
good,"Le travail en lui même et l'ambiance sont plutot agréables, Le fait d'avoir un véhicule de travail pour le trajet maison/travail est un plus, mais il faut un peu travailler comme un esclave ! a titre indicatif un entreprise de livraison autre demande en moyenne 70-90 colis par jour, hors amazon en demande 120 a 160 !il y a des jours ou j'etait à deux doigts de devoir installer une remorque sur mon traffic remplis  a déborder de colis je travaillais parfois de 10h a 22h non stop, effectuais un nombre d'heures supplémentaire tellement élevé que ça en devenais illégal, et bien sur aucune n'était payée alors qu'ils m'en avaient assurer le contraire"
good,"Work was good during peak seasonal hours."
good,"Pay not bad. Lunch room was fully stocked with vending machines, TV, and microwave ovens. When faced with deadlines, management would add allow for over flow of boxes."
good,"Amazon did not meet my expectations. There was not enough break rooms. I did not have a relationship with my manager and also, not enough break rooms."
good,"You work four 10 hour days - lots of MANDATORY overtime during Christmas."
good,My typical day at work lasted for 10 hours and would start with me getting ready for work immediately and heading straight there and ended with me coming home and immediately going to sleep so that I was ready for work the next day. This job would be good for some but I personally found it to be to much for to little pay off when compared to other warehouse positions.
good,"A hectic place where the only thing that matters, are the numbers of quantity as opposed to the quantity of well-being of employees. There are more rules that affect what you can do, versus what you cannot. "
good,"IF you are not afraid of hard work with big ambitions, this is a great place to start out. However, it comes at a price of little to no balance. You do not have flexible schedule, be expected to work for 13 hours a day on your feet for at least 10 hours. You will learn a lot of transferable soft skills though."
good,"Amazon is not a career job. They pick on the employees by way of write ups for production, which they change quite frequently. They also will give write ups for time off task, for instance, restroom time. I feel that the job is for robots, they demand fast pace work and very long hours. No sick time just very little PTO."
good,"I'd wake up at 6 in the morning, drive about an hour, and clock in at 7:30 am. I'd begin my job of swiftly navigating the warehouse with only 30 seconds to spare between each stop before I'd be considered ""falling behind."" After a few hours, I'd get a short 15-minute paid-break, then resume running around until lunch. Lunch was a 30 minute, unpaid break where, unless you brought your own food, would have to pay $5 for a tasteless vending-machine burger. After that, it was back to running around (now in pain) until my next short, paid break. The last quarter of the day would be the longest and most painful before the bell would ring and you would finally be able to clock out at 6:30 pm. I'd have walked a total of around 10 miles that day (which is not a joke, according to the job description and standard picker statistics). I'd walk to my car and spend an hour driving home, arriving at 7:30 pm. I would then eventually go to bed, wake up, and repeat this whole process for 6 days a week, with a pay of $11 an hour. "
good,"The stack ranking and promotion-by-committee system within Amazon's design organization creates a culture of backstabbing, mistrust, and one-upsmanship. Great place to go to get your start; not a great place to advance."
good,"The atmosphere could be a lot of fun."
good,"I worked as a part time seasonal worker. the work was good if a bit painful"
good,"Amazon was a great place to work, however the two agencys that work alongside them are hopeless. On boxing day they disposed of a tonne of employees myself included without even a word. Not very good."
good,"You need to be in really good shape to work in such a fast past environment.  If you do not meet your hourly numbers, you may be fired.  They tell you in new hire orientation they will place you in a path you can perform well in, but they do not."
good,"Recommended if you are single and in shared housing as you do not earn enough to help cover family costs."
good,I was employed by the company paid a reasonable  pay rate for reasonable work.  I was able to advance one pay grade in five years.  Benefits are comparable for this community.
good,Très bonne expérience dans ce domaine.chef d'équipe très compétent
good,The managers are arrogant and lie to the employees just to make sure they hit their numbers. It's not a family but a pyramid and you don't matter to them.
good,"alot of negativity from employees and managers, its a fast paced working environment with goals to be achieved and met in a small time frame, could be managed alot better."
good,This company only cares about the numbers it makes and not the employees. Lack of career advancement and the managers show a lot of favoritism. Ten hour work days is a bit much given the load of work that is  distributed daily.
good,"The company is good to work for but long term career advancement is not much of an option. Its more about who you know instead of what your capable of doing. Advancement is slim, and after an interview chain, all the interviews need to agree on you, which means if one of the interviewers has a ""friend"" you're out of the loop. There are employees that truly care about working hard, and wanting to do a good job, but they are often overlooked. When your supervisor is trying to get a promotion, why would they possibly help you?"
good,"if you want a Life amazon is not for you."
good,"At first management was okay. They seemed to passive for the most part. Then got onto a team, where the manager made it their job to get people fired. Worked for the company over 2 years. No complaints, only positive feedback. Always was a top performer, between top 6-12% of the company. Then got onto a new team, and would up quitting, because manager had it in for me. HR did nothing to help situation either."
good,"Management was hardly around and always made things more difficult when it didn’t need to be"
good,You can bust your tail just for management to toy with you and say you are going to get promoted and fill out for openings and transfers.. Never get a call back..
good,I only worked for Amazon for the peak season. For a short term job it was okay. But I would not be able to sustain working 10 hours a day at this job full time.
good,I worked during this past peak season.  The hardest part of the job was the repetitive workflow of doing the same thing over the period of hours.  It felt similar to factory work. Getting to and from work was about 2 hours each way with public transportation. I had no problem with the amount of hours or the night shift as I was able work the mandatory extra time which amounted to 50-60 hours per week.
good,"I enjoyed my team, but not leadership. Most of the leadership team was replaced in less than two years. Worked long days as a salaried manager. Sad experience."
good,"Amazon is a great place to get started in a career but keep an eye out on your manager and what they are not telling you. Amazon has an OLR process which weeds out what they call underperformers. They may designate you underperforming even if you aren't. This is because they have a forced attrition goal they must meet. "
good,"demanding labor and long hours, would not recommend unless you hate people"
good,"The company is an ok company to work for.  The company has great parking. The company break room is nice and clean. Not much room for advancement. Not a loyal company, don’t care about employees."
good,"Very poor employee relations nobody has a team work ethic, i knew nobody and nobody cared to know me. Very poor warehouse design. On your feet for the whole 10 hr shift including breaks and lunch."
good,"Great benefits, but i was working weekend over nights. Half way through our shift everyone would just use pto and leave. This would create a massive work deficit and would have to over work the people left."
good,"While working for Amazon through Integrity, i will say that the Amazon aspect of it is fantastic. Workers here were very nice and helpful and treated me as if I was one of them. The night shift hours are very hard to have any sort of social life as its basically work till 5 am then sleep then do it all over again during the weekends. I however do have jobs that require you to hit a rate as it puts to much pressure on people."
good,"Ambiente nuovo e stimolante socialmente,e ben strutturato per sfruttare la bassa manovalanza nei periodi di picco,cioe' i periodi natalizi.Troppe persone vengono illluse da un possibile posto fisso,ti fanno sembrare che sei prezioso per loro,cosi' nei mesi di contratto  lavori come un mulo,per poi prenderlo li insomma..Fissati con la sicurezza,ma farebbero guidare il muletto persino a un cieco,purche' corra e s'illuda anche lui di vedersi il cartellino blu."
good,"It is what it is, they churn people out regularly but if you can make it past you training period and learn your task to a key, its pretty easy the learning period is just really hard on some folks. Some days the communication between management is abysmal making your day more stressful than it should be. The hours are long too expect to practically live in the building around the holidays and leading into prime week. Like i said its a job, and the turn out rate is high so there always looking for more people all year round, if you want it."
good,Amazon had GREAT health benefits and education advancement resources.  Some educational perks were not accessible until you were there for a year but I couldn't believe employees worked in the area I did for that long.  I started this job knowing that it was just a means-to-an-end position and that I wasn't going to be there long(lasted 6 months).  You are required to pack items at a certain rate and if you don't after a certain amount times you get written up and if too many then fired.  Your shift manager has so many associates working that they barely take the time to learn your name let along get to know you.  Working in packing for the medium large orders was very physical.  I lost 30lbs during the time I was there (not complaining) because your breaks-two 15 minutes and one  half hour lunch were timed to the minute.  So you don't have time to enjoy your meal or relax really.  You are standing on these cushioned mats your entire shift.
good,"In amazon I learned how to escalate the problem, How to treat customer as a friend, Answer the question ask never guess , reducing customers efforts.I also learned how to keep promises to the customer."
good,"I really did not like working here. the cowokers are great of course. the manager and ambassadors just expect too much from you no matter how fast youre going, they will want you to do better."
good,nobody has their information correct. you can never get the same answer from another supervisor that the first gave you. The mandatory overtime is obsurd
good,"My decision to leave was instantaneous I was pulled from a packing line and asked to go do another task which I couldn't do with a partial disability. I walked out, went to HR completed the relevant form, waited to speak with some one from operations. The wait was for 30 minutes, I couldn't wait any longer. It must be said that I had indicated my partial disability with the unit Manager in a previous conversation."
good,"This position was in the runup to Christmas , Amazons busiest period."
good,"Physical work. Lift boxes, move boxes, scan boxes. Everybody comes in, does their thing, then goes home. The culture is do your job and mind your business. Not very enjoyable or rewarding. Only benefit is a (small) Amazon Prime discount."
good,"Your able to meet new people from all around the globe and all walks of life. The hardest part of the job were meeting certain target within the shift hour. "
good,"Stressful due to working graveyard shifts from 10pm or midnight. "
good,"Worked there as a seasonal, was promised a permanent position after the holidays if we stayed but we were never given a permanent position and they had the seasonal guys do all the grunt work while we were paid $1 less and we were doing all the work. Had to bribe Area managers for PTO"
good,They have a strict set of rules. A good hard worker is not praised there. The breaks are a joke. In a huge warehouse they give you a 10 minute break but it takes at least 5 just to get outside. If you stop picking for longer than 5 minutes you get written up so you can't even use the bathroom without getting in trouble.
good,I loved working at Amazon but they would not accommodate me for child care for school. All I asked for was what I applied for and that was 40 hours. Every day when I arrived I was notified that I had to work mandatory overtime. I could not work the extra hours so I was forced to quit. I would work there again if they would have just given me 40 hours and no more.
good,Customer service rep. answered questions from customers and assisted them  on how to use and buy items. We were required to advise our customers on how to use the system to buy things. Many of our customers were not computer savvy.
good,"Work started early"
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time at amazon and the work culture it promoted. However they decided to gut everyones benefits (stock/monthly bonus) in exchange for a very small bump in hourly pay.
good,"Ein sehr fester Arbeitsplatz, allerdings in einem Gefängnis-Ähnlichen Zustand mit schlechter / unzureichender Vergütung."
good,"Job was stressful , I enjoyed working there for the most part cause the job was simple but the rate was ridiculous, it was very unreasonable. Barely can go to the restroom without getting dinged for time off task"
good,"This wasn’t a great place to work for the amount I was paid. The breaks is what I looked forward too and by the time I sat down, I had to get right back up. It feels like an assembly line there. You’re doing the same thing over and over for up to 10 hours. You can’t even start as full time. You start as part time and then full time"
good,"Pros"
good,"Agency management are rude, you are only a number, they pretend they care about you’re health needs but when it comes down too it they don’t care. 40hrs a week and then compulsory overtime, so 5 days at 11hour shifts and if you have any health issues they don’t consider your health just why you can’t work. Addecco draw you in with good wages but if you can’t do what they want they kick you out and treat you like a nobody..."
good,"Work load in excess as regards the amount of time allowed, colleagues seem to be a bunch of great guys including the bosses. Well paid, especially when doing extra work."
good,I did not feel valued for my hard work. I felt passed over for advancement because of my age. The work is very physically demanding.  I got a hernia and a torn tendon.
good,"Amazon is an extremely competitive and political environment. There are a lot of opportunities to work on incredible and exciting things, but the competition to do the most interesting work and to advance your career is fierce. Amazon's own internal competition between both business groups and individuals undermines the company's 'leadership principals'. The promotion process is so politically driven that people spend more time jockeying for position than thinking about real, long term solutions to scale. If you want to advance, you have to burn brighter than the rest- but be careful, it can take a long time to ascend to higher levels in the company and it is difficult to sustain that kind of performance without faltering. If you falter, others will strike at the opportunity to highlight your weakness. It is often easier to leave the company and come back at a higher level after a year or so, than to get promoted, even if you are a 'top tier' performer."
good,Could not get hours while working on the floor. Therefor was only getting 10-20 hours a week at the end. Poor construction of cooler/freezer. I fell and got hurt 11/2017.
good,"Everything is fast pace. they will be on you if they feel like you didn't reach your rate for the day."
good,The company has grown to fast to be able to handle the problems that are come up. All the upper management just keeps putting the problems on the next person.
good,"During my time as a Picker, the production standards were very unreasonable.  Temporary/contract employees were included in holiday meal and snacks during afternoon breaks but were not given other perks available to ""employees"" even though we outnumbered the regulars significantly.  Parking was a nightmare.  Long hard hours of work walking 20+ miles most days, with 6 day work weeks for Peak."
good,"Amazon is very fast paced, non stop and stressful. This is coming from someone who was promoted in less than a year to assistant manager. I was let go due to to wrongful termination."
good,"Inefficiency of management and no advancement! but for the rest, in terms of benefits and salaries, all are great. Corporate Culture are somehow weird. Never say hello to people other department. I guess it probably is just being Seattle."
good,They have their favorites and they watch who they want to watch and not the ones the should be watching. Plus you don't get the proper help or guidance that you need...
good,"Hard rates to meet, hard to advance, management picks favorites, bad communication, mandatory 60hour weeks from mid November til the end of December. But those paychecks are nice, you get stock every year, chances for monthly bonuses, benefits are good, they pay for some schooling! You get chances to move and travel helping open up new sites around the world."
good,"Companies work to take care of their shareholders, their customers, and their employees, but they can only pick two. Amazon is very good to its customers and shareholders."
good,"Job's not bad, you'll get a lot of calls with people asking where their deliveries are, because they won't call the actual carrier to ask. People feel like you can make their packages arrive sooner."
good,"The only thing I like about Amazon is the benefits. I feel there is no room for advancement. Also, when an employee and myself tell management our concerns, they look like we are crazy."
good,"If you need a job then they are fine till something better comes along. The air is never as it should be. You will sweat or freeze daily. No one appreciates anything you do they will always show you ways to make things ""better"""
good,"The job is very solitude, you are around be daily but you work by yourself. Fast pace job and a lot of walking stooping and bending. It helps you get in shape."
good,"Amazon is not a bad place to work if you are ready to work, the only thing is that HR has all the power at Amazon.  If someone goes to HR with any type of allocation they investigate and even if it is false that tell you not to do it again.  As far as moving up they don't look for hard workers and those that go above and beyond and they look for those that are yes people and won't rock the boat, the ones that get the results they ask for get left behind."
good,Don’t enlist for their enrollment hire plans (ex. They pick your schedule) there’s no such thing as flexibility here for this company . Please choose full-time On fulfillment jobs.
good,"Great Learnings and the office is at a great location."
good,It was all about keeping busy. Where there really wasnt anything to do to keep busy. A lot of slow days. And the stress of having a certain rate for really no reason. In my opinion was pointless.
good,Amazon is a job not a career. Pays the bills. Fast paced and very demanding. Must be able to stand for long periods of time and work through any weather condition.
good,Rates to meet during the week which are not impossible but you have to be moving very quickly at every moment. Really tires your feet since you're standing over ten hours a day.
good,Not much to say.. Its better for you to figure it out. So you get an honest impression yourself. I don't like to talk bad about a company that has given me a job and paid me. It's not my character but I will say try it out for yourself and you'll see the truth
