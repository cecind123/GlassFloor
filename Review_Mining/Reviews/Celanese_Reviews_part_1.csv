rating,review
bad,Demanding and thankless place to work. Equipment and processes for the most part are archaic and poorly maintained. Hard core union with entrenched entitlement mindset. Professional staff is treated poorly. Salary is below average. Don't even bother comparing with oil and gas.
bad,It’s a good place to learn and get experience but I wouldn’t stay long term. Mangers and operations specialist are all about getting the work done. There is a union but favouritism plays a major role. Many employees have been there all their lives and family members get priority. I would get 2 or 3 years and if possible get your steam time a leave.
bad,"Very poor management "
bad,When you drive your daily actions around what will financially reward you in the next quarter you fail to prepare for the future. The current leadership is driving change linked to their personal reward that gets paid in 2016. You will see a dump out of leadership at that point. The BOD must be asleep at the wheel.
bad,"Most depressing place I have ever worked for. Employees are bitter"
bad,This company will offer you the moon then tries to stab you in the back while your looking at it.
bad,"After a few months you become no one, they move personnel from department to department frequently, most of the time demoting them. There's hardly any answers to valid concerns. Not much respect for employees special needs, HR harrassment. Not the best place to feel empowered and no sense of job security."
bad,Probably the least enjoyable position I have ever held.
bad,"Agree 1000% with previous reviews ""Depressing"" and ""Verry difficult work environment"".  Terribly disorganized plant with old boys club management consisting of a few unqualified and clueless.  Not bad if you're in management or union side, but staff is terrible.  Avoid!"
bad,"Management does not have their employees ""best interest"" at heart.  The sole focus is on money/profitability regardless of the cost to their work staff."
bad,Managers do not communicate with shopfloor workers.
bad,"Strange vibe at this place. Senior management dictates projects with little regard for the technology in play or time involved for complex projects. Extremely cost sensitive to anything related to IT."
bad,"Management is poor, no good pay , no compensations, racist sometimes , IT provides very poor service, old workers are nice with the new people, I did not enjoy any day there"
bad,Very stressful environment. Working is very dangerous chemicals and the people can’t seem to mind their own business. The people are mostly all related and there is so much discrimination there. If you work hard you are looked down upon and treated differently because you make them look bad.
bad,"The former 'Ticona', now known as Celanese Engineered Materials, is in a state of flux.  The Ticona I joined once had eleven (11) distinct polymer product lines (today it's 6); all engineering grade materials and not run-of-the-mill commodity resins. It took pride in it's material technology and expertise in application development; it had developed volumes of data for all of it's products, for use with helping customers innovate and create incredible products. Ticona was at that time was, 'customer-focused'.  "
bad,There is High turn over of employees for many reasons. Management is not trustworthy because they make promises they never intended to keep! Cost of living raises are minimal to nonexistent! If you are a salaried employee you will work as much as 300 hours per annum of overtime with no compensation.
bad,Received good extruder experience and five years experience in the industry. Difficult to manage 12 hour shifts and third and first shift rotating schedule.
bad,"Very detached management style that is unwilling to listen to basic facts. Little interest in development, more focused on growth via acquisition. Company however, has great products that are well defended by IP, but less likely to develop organically."
bad,"In 17 years of Pipefitting I've never worked at a plant that was managed completely from the bottom up. The turn over rate was unreal in the staff positions. For example, in under 8 years I saw 5 maintenance managers, 7 foreman/supervisors, 5 HR managers and even 4 plant managers all come and go. Most of the lower level supervisors were simply fired, and the rest would quit after only a few months to a year! The result was a plant that became completely dependent on the maintenance workers and operations to run the plant and ""guide/coach"" the latest batch of management. It was total chaos, mostly reactive maintenance, as there were no competent people in the planning and scheduling departments, until the union took over those positions as well (high turn over rate here too)! The only benefit to working here was the strong Union and close nit relationships my coworkers had with each other. If you're a manager or supervisor, or even someone looking for a ""staff"" job (non-Union) avoid this place like the plague! You'll thank me."
bad,"good environment, nice people, clean  production place, professional "
good,"Management was forever changing and not always for the best. It was a very cut-throat environment. Once your reached age 50, it was almost always a good indication you would be let go."
good,The work schedule is okay. But the employees do not want to work and say they do not get paid enough. Plus they do not come to work. So the supervisors have no power.
good,"Good pay. Horrible new management. Horrible work to life balance. High school mentality. Insanely hot, and ridiculously cold. Shift change is horrible on the body and your family."
good,"Celanese has the potential to be a leader in the chemical production and distribution industry; however the culture in corporate offices (Texas) shows some noticeable deficiencies. I did get to learn many things about SAP and the operation, logistic and inventory side of a global company. Management is very much a reactionary team and changes come often and many times without forward thinking or impact analysis on how one change can change the entire complexion of groups down the process line. Management too, appeared to be inconsistent in other areas, but I will not go into too great of a detail, as not to appear bitter. The co-workers are where the company can shine if the clique system is eradicated. Some of the best people in my business life continue to work there. They are a hard working lot for the most part, but enforcement of rules are sporadic because the line blurs between management and employee sometimes. The hardest part of the job is just the workload and the constant putting out of one fire after another. The best part of working for Celanese was some of the flexibility it allowed me and the benefits are not too bad."
good,"They became bigger based on repeated M&A.  So, their parent company vs. child companies were fighting and law sue issues.  Very complicated organization."
good,Celanese is a great company but the HR department is a horrible group to work in.  DO NOT work in HR!  It is like high school and the leaders think they are prom queens and you are lucky to be in their presence.
good,"Pay at Celanese was good for the position I was in.  I worked in shipping loading and unloading trucks, wrote of Bill of Ladings, inspecting product and various other duties.  I worked well with the others in my department.  The hardest part of the position was the heat."
good,Operating and maintaining a large chemical plant with a small team on shifts
good,"Celanese was a good company to work for; however, they are operating with a short handed crew in all areas, and the result is employees being over worked."
good,"Amerikansiches Management Stil fokusiert um Leistung, Projektexekution und Strategisches Marketing."
good,"After more than a year with the company, I was dismissed for offering to help another group in accordance with the ""One Celanese"" culture shift.  Other than the hostile work environment, had some pretty awesome coworkers.  Management was detached and uncaring and not at all interested in the long term goals of their subordinates.  All's well that ends badly though, I make more money outside the company even as a contract employee."
good,Not sure where you stand for job security. Job description and tasks have to be addressed when first starting the career path. The leads and co-workers are great to work with. Management has to be more involved in day to day operations. They ask for jobs to be done but are not in the world of the operators. Leads and operators try their best with the conditions and equipment they have to work with.
good,"Changes made for the worse, it was a good place to work 10 years ago. Corporate change that makes things more difficult to achieve any advancement. Just like all the others."
good,"The best part is probably the work life balance and the benefits, as the health care plan offered is good. Promotions are tough to get and compensation compared to the job market is way below average. Give and take though..."
good,Company closed the facilities due to external business factors. It offered a good work environment for most the twenty years I was there.
good,There are two interdependent departments that are working on a joint task using two different sets of guidelines forcing the lower level employees to try merge the instructions and leading to conflict. Supervisor's in one of the departments move freely through the other department challenging the other department's employees and often threatening investigations and disciplinary  action in spite of lacking formal authority to do so.
good,"Supervised 11 AP accountants in a shared services environment. Helped department convert from SAP 4.6 to SAP 4.7, documented policies and procedures to strengthen internal controls as part of the SOX team, daily batch audits, prepared monthly metrics reports, assisted with research for 1099 reporting, approved time-cards for temporary employees, documented AP issues and resolutions, and presented new policies in town-hall style meetings. The hardest part of the job was finding the right contacts within the company to assist with problem resolutions. This is a very large company and some manager's areas of responsibility overlap each other so there might be 2 or more answers to the same question, or miscommunication as to who would answer and therefore no answer. The best part of the job was the team of AP accountants in the department. They were dedicated to doing good work and knew their jobs well."
good,I like the people that i work with but management not so much
good,"A cég alapvetően támogatja az egyéni célokat. Sok fiatalt foglalkoztatnak, akik tapasztaltak, azonban ez a tapasztalt kollégákat terheli meg."
good,Celanese Pharmaceutical branch was acquired 3 times during my job tenure.  Each time major changes were implemented and the plant gradually downsized to a 1/5 of what they were when I started.
good,"Celanese was and ok place to work .  Management never took responsibility for there action, there way of management,  constant of procedures that places all responsibilities on employees.   It a very hard company to get management to except and change things for employees,  the promotion system based on buddy buddy.  Unfair hiring, caused a lot of issues in the company,  low moral"
good,Pay and benefits are above average.  Work environment is very dirty and dusty.  Work schedule can be very stressful with having to rotate between days and nights every 2 months and sometimes being forced to work on scheduled off days
good,"Started as a workplace that valued your individual talents, but the ever changing management became less and less competent! The management really got in the way of the process!"
good,"The site went through a reduction in force back in 2015. They released 33% of the salaried workforce on one day. Those of us that remained were always wondering if there would be ""another round"". They are now in the process of going through a major organizational change. A lot of people in new roles, so there may be some growing pains."
good,Company provided me a living for many years and I am grateful for that. The job was not for me. Too many politics and too many chiefs and not enough Indians.
good,no comment my working wit hem was approximately 30 years ago and majority of my work was associated with maintaining existing operation with their engineering department.
good,Required to be filled in but haven't worked there in 30 years. Have no clue what to put down here so I am just typing mindlessly. Looks like I needed 21 more characters...
good,"set up assembly line, packaged rolls, changed packs ,loaded trailers, troubleshoot all problems that may come up with the assembly line, handled waste."
good,"great company to work for but very poor eithics when it comes to supervisors and the favoritisum to certain employees.hard work but good pay and benefits. ""clicky"" groups to work with."
good,Would you like to review Celanese?  I did already but this site just keeps popping this stuff up. So I'm just entering anything to get past it.
good,Nice place to work not sure about job security as I was a temp employee my was duration of 6 months
good,"Growing company - growth opportunity"
good,"many changes with a new CEO, a lot of employees do not work well together"
good,"Hard business, great people work with. Just the location has been changed many times, and far away from city"
good,Great experience for college graduate with Accounting degree.
good,"Projects given for interns were great and you are treated like a full time engineer the whole time. "
good,"It was a traditional male's job, but surviving in that environment  and getting off of welfare got me recommended for the Governor's Award by the Shallotte, NC  ESC office in 1995.  Although I did not receive the Award, I felt like I won to be recognized for an Award I did not even know existed."
good,work temporarily some dept were laying off due to some changes in management overall was nice place to work learn a lot while being employed their had good benefits
good,Excellent safety program and attitudes.  Opportunities for advancement.  Jobs available at all levels (high and degreed).
good,Your responsibilities can change daily according to what area you are assigned to. A lot of fast paced work but in the safest possible way.
good,"Loaded LPG trucks, ran test on mix product and amine."
good,Large company with a very competitive work environment.  Coworkers where great.  Hardest part about the job was the travel.
good,"Since new CEO came in 2 years ago, change has been slow but for the better overall.  Eliminating some middle management has been good, but has limited the growth opportunities for the rank and file.  The culture of fear under the old CEO has largely disappeared, but it will take a few more years to completely purge the ""old ways"" of thinking."
good,"make your own breaks,healthcare good,mangers change.you have to have good health to preform there,overall good place to work."
good,If u are afraid of sweating or freezing do not work there.. no climate control... very dusty...very loud... alot of paperwork and alot to learn...ther are many progressions to get raises.. pay is good..benefits are ok... location is busy area... but overall not a bad place to work for the compensation
good,El ambiente de trabajo fue muy bueno no teniendo problema con ningun personal que laboraba conmigo
good,"O Grupo Celanese é comprometido com suas metas e clientes, porém a pequena estrutura no Brasil não permite que os colaboradores tenham crescimento pois predominam diretrizes de favorecimento no gerenciamento da mesma."
good,"Management of human resources in a chemical company. "
good,"This financially-driven corporation has high expectations with respect to employee output. I always felt up to any challenges, including educating myself on new systems and working the extra hours needed to get the job done efficiently."
good,as an Operator intern shadowed a operator on shift . Management was . I enjoyed my coworkers and being. a part of there team. Thankful for all i learn and those who put efforts towards helping me improve
good,I first worked for Celanese as a consultant.  I later worked for 5 years in the general ledger department of accounting.  It was a good experience.  I was given various tasks and enjoyed the work.
good,"The schedule is terrible. Not only is the schedule terrible, every operating unit in the plant is understaffed and a mandatory overtime system is in place that routinely calls for process operators to work a 16 hour shift."
good,"great work place, good breaks, and alright management. good hours and great benefits . hardest part of the job is getting inside tanks 100+ degrees. work days are 7am-330pm"
good,The people you work with on the floor and floor managers are great but  the staff  has no clue as to whats going on and are complete idiots trying to do a job they are not trained for .
good,Fue este mi primer empleo y me gustaba poner en pràctica todo lo aprendido durante mis clases de instrumentista
good,"Long hours, frantic work pace.  Supported C Level executives.  No culture, no work-life balance.  Very stressful and long hours. Left because the position was thankless."
good,This company is all about culture and how they can seem exotic .  The sales reps are allowed free rein on the underlings.  They are paranoid about losing business and must make their quotas
good,"A great group of tradespeople.  Great operations staff.  "
good,ambiente de trabajo bueno la parte dificil es gtrabajar bajo el sol buen gtrato con mis compañeros
good,Great place to work. Hours are hard. Have to adjust to long hours and swing shift. I’m not a fan of swing shift but it is a great place to work for. And great pay
good,"- Boa gestão com foco em resultados, ambiente colaborativo, melhorar cultura para ser mais Customer Centric . "
good,Easy job some days other days you'll want to walk out.  Some supervision is very respectable others you'll be curious as to how they maid it that long.  Very hott to cold job.
good,"Celanese was a good place to work for in the R&D dept until new management decided that R&D was unnecessary. Great place for operations, bad place for QC and R&D."
good,"Please consider the employer claims of having great compensation, great benefits, and training programs.  Why is it written in the present tense if it is by a former employee? Why would an inventory assistant use HR jargon like ""great compensation"" and ""vibrant work culture""?  Why would they list a con of plant-based work given that they don't work in the plant itself?  Who is this mysterious individual - no one has left such a position."
good,Great place to plant your roots. The longevity within certain locations have made this a great place to work. Many workers have more than 15 years of service leads to a plethora of knowledge and great leadership.
good,"Very demanding job. Lots of hours, but was paid very well. The hardest part of the job was the overtime hours required to work. I would recommend this company to friends."
good,Man muss ganz viel arbeiten dadurch kann man sehr viel lernen. Wir haben fast jeden Tag eine andere dringende Angelegenheit das macht doch Spaß. Die Kollegen sind sehr nett und hilfsbereit.
good,"Tienes que hacer un recorrido de area para saber que es lo que esta operando"
good,"Learned a lot about safety at work and home."
good,Interesting chemistry and they desire to upgrade the plant DCS.
good,"It is an OK company.  Nothing really stands out, but nothing really bad either."
good,"Fruitful days at work "
good,"A typical day would consist of a production meeting or shift hand over involving your opposite number where any issues in production would be highlighed,this information would be loggged onto a data base by either the ingoing or outgoing shift where each member would take up the respective machinery on the production or manufacturing side.There was always something that you might come across that you have never experienced before thus adding to the learning process for future reference.Team work was always at the forefront of your working day so a good relationship with your colleagues always made the day more enjoyable.Working 12 hour shifts could sometimes leave you exausted"
good,"Interesting, challenging, sometimes stressful environment. Celanese was once a family oriented, fun, place to work. Through the most recent years, layoffs, restructures, and management changes have made it a stressful, very demanding, uncomfortable work environment. On a good note, safety in still the number one focus, but with much less people and bigger demand for production, the stress level has increased. Overall Celanese is a good company with decent benefits."
good,Great overall place to work. Good leadership and good benefits.
good,Enjoyed working with people. A good company for beginners.
good,I had a great time working here. The only reason I left was personal reasons with family outside of work. The management staff changes a lot and its different per each one.
good,"La empresa tiene buenas prestaciones, sueldos acorde al lugar y capacitación constante"
good,"Empresa actualizada en sistemas de seguridad industrial, comprometida principalmente con la seguridad, buenas capacitaciones otorgadas actualizadas."
good,"This company did not pay its corporate employees very well; however, this is a great company. This company fostered a great working environment. It was a fun place to work."
good,"Celanese was a great place to work, as long as you are not looking for upward mobility and advancement.  The career progression for operators is non-existent."
good,Other than the swing shift Celanese was a great place to work. As long as you show for work management kindly lets you work at your on pace I wish I had stayed with them
good,I enjoyed working at Hoechst Celanese. I was also proud to work at a large organization that took care of it's employees. They had a high standard of professionalism.
good,A very busy workplace with alot of overtime. not much help from management if issues arrise. You have to work with different customers and can cause problems in getting your job done.
good,"buena empresa, el compañerismo bueno, prestaciones y sueldo muy aceptable, actividades acorde al perfil."
good,The part I do enjoy most about Celanese is the forward looking culture and striving to be the 1st-ranked in the products Celanese produces. A very focused business strategy that transcends in its management style as well.
good,"Overall a good place to work with a few flaws. Few groups have the ""good ole boy"" mentality. Rewarding if you stay focused and keep your nose clean. The company does give back to the community in many ways. The CLK site does have a pavilion, gym, golf course, hunting lease, archery range, basketball ball, park and a softball field for it's employees.  Most of the people are good people."
good,"Celanese is a competitive company, fast paced with something always going on. A decent work life balance amongst the chaos. The plus's out weigh the cons. With a few key stake holder changes, this company could be right on track for big things!"
good,"Celanese small set up , however big exposure considering one man show, you learn to get many things in the organization at the same time  growth is little faster."
good,"Good pay, benefits, good company culture.   Company strives to maintain good community involvement and encourages employees to volunteer in their communities."
good,"1. Typical wok day, pleasant."
good,"Good company if you work in R&D.  I was able to set my own hours, and met a lot of interesting people.  The workforce is very diverse.  The only reason I left was due to reductions."
good,"Depends on the mentor, a typical day can be very busy or very relaxed. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with people on site and learning about everyone."
good,Celanese is a company that is well structured and equipped to provide their employees with everything they need. The work culture is vibrant and the union is very supportive.
good,"Run Card machine, pack out product. Inspect product, trouble shoot machine if I have problems. Put in sap for maintenance if needed. Also do preventive maintenance."
good,This company offers great benefits and union. The job I perform is easy and tedious and exciting! Employees are always looking for ways to better the process and make the job work better for everyone involved.
good,"Career developed in the Accounting/Financial area over the past 10 years in managerial positions, with experience in Accounting, Taxes and Payroll."
good,"Typical workday was preparing equipment for maintenance and handing over equipment in a safe state taking readings on outside equipment to identify problems, running lab samples to ensure quality, and analyzing console data to solve problems."
good,"Хорошие отзывчивые коллеги, великолепная атмосфера в Европейском офисе, русскому офису необходимо многое почерпнуть оттуда, интерсная сама по себе работа, в процессе принимаешь самостоятельные решения и ведешь работу именно так, как считаешь нужным, нет ненужного навзяывания из вне."
good,1. Get workoreders for the day's assignments. 2. Worked on process chillers. 3.Management was a lil unorganized. 4. Great co-workers. 5. Learning knew procedures and plant. 6. Very close family oriented business
good,"facing different taskes to undertake. leant from failures, managing of team and taking initaitives"
good,"a typical day could be good or bad depending on how the machine ran. The learning experience was that this process had to run 24/7 because it was so costly and time consuming to have a machine shutdown for whatever reason. The hardest part of this job was when I started we worked rotating shifts, and getting used to working all three shifts was not easy. Then we started working 12 hour shifts, which with anything had its good and bad. The most enjoyable part was working with people I'd known for a long time and good pay and benefits."
good,"My normal shift was always busy with alot of situations happening at the same time, so I quickly developed the ability to plate spin problems and to tackle the most important one's first. I was detailed to manage a five person operating team manufacturing filter tow over twelve hour shifts, this was a continuous 365 day a year process, we became a tight knit team working very well together, aiming to progress the process with regard to right first time and reducing waste. Sometimes the work load looked like it was becoming too much, but we always close ranks and pulled things around. The most enjoyable part was making improvements to the product quality and increasing first quality yield ."
good,Good benefits helpful manager performance oriented  team work material handling forklift operating staging machine readings and preventive maintenance 3 breaks
good,Job challenges with opportunity to grow  and follow career goals.  Management is concerned with employee satisfaction and compensates good work.   The hardest part of the job was working on month end close on holidays.
good,Safety oriented company that cares about its employees. Extracurricular activities that focus on bringing employees and families together. Good work life balance. Employees work well together in this laid back environment. Plenty of opportunity to shine.
good,"Typical day- working in a hot environment on machines and packaging."
good,"Celanese is a great company, but in all business the bottom line is the goal and downsizing happens, so you pick yourself up and dust yourself off and find another employer who will value your skillset."
good,"A empresa possui um grande programa de segurança do trabalho, que tem foco total no bem estar do colaborador, estes treinamentos levam os cuidados até a nossa residência, a empresa proporciona além de crescimento profissional também gera um crescimento dentro dos relacionamentos familiares."
good,"Positive place to work, just far away from my home. Schedule is terrible, rotating shifts which is very difficult on your family ."
good,"Lots of experience in all types of maintenance and machine operation.  Learned PLC equipment operation, maintenance, and programming.  Would have been a good retirement career until the company was bought out by a German Company (Hoechst AG).  they bought seven plants in this country; robbed them of all assets and then closed them down."
good,Solid industry leader in their markets.  There is a realization that to be successful long-term they can't be over-weighted in managers andunder-weighted in technical personnel.  Good place to work.
good,Good co workers. Friendly and enjoyable place to work. Worked day shifts. Good managment. Sometimes very noisy.
good,Getting turnover from previous crew. Performing quality checks after doffing the 14 positions every 24-50 minutes according to which product we were making at the time of shift change. How to take readings make changes to the machinery and to flush the lines before changing finishes. Management talked with the employees about issues with quality and would help with any decision on change to be made to the equipment if needed. We all helped to perform the quality checks and any troubleshooting issues. Swing shift was the hardest part of the job. Always enjoyed the time off during the week and the long weekend once a month.
good,great employer - laid off when plant closed - would still be with them if possible
good,"Good company, long hours but good working environment.  Parking can be an issue.  During peak season you might work 60-65 hours. Travel is often necessary."
good,GREAT WORKPLACE and excellent workers and employers were involved and engaging. Work was scheduled appropriately with occasional overtime opportunities.
good,Productive and engaging place to work.  Very family oriented environment.  Great safety culture and overall a wonderful place to work.  I enjoy coming to work.
good,It is a good company to work for. Good culture pay and benefits. I would recommend this job to any one I would like to work here again. It was well managed
good,"Worked rotating shift work keeping process within operating guidelines. Obtaining readings, samples and submitting work order requests. Safe work place culture. Enjoyed being on an all volunteer emergency response team."
good,"Celanese is a great company with a long history. The organization is filled with tenured staff that had very generous benefits and retirement packages. Many of those benefits have been cut, but the company still provides attractive compensation packages. "
good,I would return back to celanese a very advanced company I would need a remote scrum master position because the location would be to far for the travel
good,"Over all, my work experience was pretty good. Its actually the best job ive ever had. The work can get hot and dirty but management does something special for the operators at least once a month. They will have a grill out for everyone, sometimes steak and sometimes burgers and dogs. thru the summers they have Kona Ice come and pay for whatever you want from the truck. that happened about 4 or 5 times in a couple months. Insurance is great, 401k match is probably the highest or close to it, that you'll find from an employer. Pay is good and if you like OT and wanna make extra money, you can work as much as you can take. The company really cares about the employee and that shoes in the safety. Outsiders or contractors might think they're too strict or they try to pick on you but its not to get anyone in trouble. Celanese and the management are always looking for ways to keep us safe! If there is anything unsafe on the floor, they want it to be shared! Not to tattle tail or get anyone in trouble, but to let everyone else know what to look for and to get suggestions on making things more safe. take it from me, i was there for 3 years and i left. Its hard to find an employer to have all those great bene's and pay PLUS all the extra stuff they do for their employees. They really do care for their employees. I would come back in a heart beat if there was a position."
good,"The work was mostly fast paced because we were in production and had orders that had to be filled.I learned many different jobs including doffing yarn and packaging the yarn as well.I also learned how to drive a squeeze truck and operate a pallet jack,manual and with motor.Hardest part of job was the 11 to 7 shift,and rotating shifts in general.Four day breaks were nice and the pay and benefits were good.Knew many people there and made many friends."
good,"This is a competitive company to work for and strives for best in class in all areas. With that comes a lot of hard work, daily challenges, and tons of opportunity to learn and grow."
good,Good work life balance. These guys are terrible. They are forcing you to write up more than 20 words for each of year ancient employers.
good,"I learned here how to get involve in the work without any boreing ."
good,"Se trabajaban 12 horas al dia, en tanto en diseño como en la construcción de las obras de los proyectos"
good,Great place to work.  12 hour rotating shift Du Ponte schedule.  My co-workers were great.   Learned alot working here.  Worked with startup and commissioning of a Methanol unit.
good,"I really like that Celanese is dedicated to a safe working environment. A typical day for me would be first a morning meeting to go over activities in the unit and and issues that need to be resolved. I then spend about an hour either addressing issues in the unit lab, or I am performing maintenance on instruments and checking instrument charts. Then most of the rest of the day is spent either working on on-going issues, reading technical documents, or trying to identify ways to improve the process."
good,Was a small company at the time but was of great help in training me for chemical operations.
good,"For the most part I enjoyed my time at Hoechst. There was a true sense of accomplishment in working hard to get the job done. In most positions I held while working there, the job relied on teamwork and I enjoy being a part of a team. The hardest part of the job would definitely be getting used to night shift, but having four days off at a time is a great plus."
good,Entreprise qui m'a permis d'évoluer dans le secteur de la chimie et d'obtenir une expérience significative.
good,"centralized network and decision making"
good,I was given opportunities that have been very beneficial to my career. Celanese acknowledged one's initiative and provided advancement opportunities.
good,Celanese offers plenty of opportunities. Provides challenging opportunities
good,Overall experience good.  Healthcare is the worst.  You pay 100 percent until ded paid.   They do give you $1000 HSE but that goes quickly if you have something done.  It is difficult for non-exempt employees to advance.
good,A typical day was in the control room monitoring temperatures and flows of the raw product. Learned to pay attention to details as even a slight rise in temperature could ruin the batch of raw material. Very diverse culture and team players. Hardest part of the job was the smell. The most enjoyable part of the job was the learning experience.
good,"El área laboral era excelente. Con buenos horarios, disponibilidad de días y buen ambiente."
good,"It was a challanging work . Every day was different I have learned a lot about business processes and SAP system. I became interested in Logistics and manufacturing."
good,"Great place to work"
good,Worked there for 2 years till the Lebanon plant closed. Worked with a great team.  Management was willing to work the floor right along with there operators.
good,Great compensation and benefits.  Workplace culture has improved over the years.  Management is very professional and caring.  Company has been in business over 100 years.

As a member of the R&D team, every day presented a new challenge to accompany the everyday routine tasks. a typical day would start with firing up the line, letting everything get up to temp - sometimes very hot - usually a meeting of some sort during this time, or catching up on paperwork or other projects. Once the line was ready to go we would fire it up and conduct our trial/production run until we were satisfied - or defeated. Taking the line down was usually the last mission of the day which typically includes an extruder purge and disassembling and cleaning the die. Could be very hot and very stressful at times but never was I unhappy with my position."
