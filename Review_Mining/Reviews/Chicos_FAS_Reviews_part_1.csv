bad,"This is the low down on this company...They reward people that are dishonest and get rid of people that rock that boat..."
bad,At 1st when I was hired I was excited to be able to help a more mature all the way to senior client base but the nature of the company and the management are to use you because they're tired So they get the management pay but share running the store essentially.  Very hard as an African American to move of especially African American female very outdated company
bad,"Pasadena Paseo Location"
bad,Poor management she didn’t communicate much wish she was a better manager she was in her office all the time complaining about her health and had everyone else do her work for her
bad,Supervisor there was super rude. Rude to the employees as well as to the people who came to shop around the store. On manager would make racist remarks toward shoppers.
bad,Manager of the store was a workaholic who set unreasonable goals and attempted to bully sales personnel into selling customers clothing they did not ask for or need. It was all about the money!
bad,"If you are not a Caucasian female you will be overlooked for advancement and proper training. Not only that, but work long hours with pay that could only be described as permanent poverty placement"
bad,"After over 2 years of putting up with toxic personalities and teams that throw each other under the bus, after moving people into areas they did not know, and the entire team either leaving or getting cut, I could not say enough about how disappointed in the upper management’s inability to affect the change needed to recruit and retain the talent needed to turn the tanking business. Additionally, there was never any strategic business plan shared with anyone there, so as things keep changing, everyone there is kept in the dark as to what the actual goal is."
bad,"Management lies! Hostile environment!  Harassment and threats on a daily basis.  "
bad,Company has very bad management. Always a lot of drama and a lot of stress put onto associates. Work is not distributed evenly and favoritism plays a large role in that.
bad,"Went from full time to literally no hours at all, they treated me like a mule doing all the work they didn't want to do or spend 4 hours pacing back and forth to greet the non existent customers that came in, the other employees would talk about me in another language, no commission basically, had to do an overnight once a month."
bad,"I don't know what you want me to say, in my experience they are horrible. Upper management has no clue what they are doing bit the little guys get the back lash"
bad,"Underpaid, taking advantage of people separate to have a job with benefits. The pay does not balance with the amount of responsibility and the incentive does not balance with the push to sell and make numbers that are out of reach. Beyond the pay is the job culture and atmosphere in store, the drama, the accusations and threats by managers causes employees to quickly exit before their reputation is tarnished and their career sabotaged beyond repair."
bad,"There is no work/life balance. You are expected to risk your life during ice storms, etc to get to the office and answer the phones. There is no career path once you reach management."
bad,"Company chooses its favorites, the individuals seem to think they can do whatever they want- The pay is minimal for the tasks you are assigned, although family aspect of the company is nice"
bad,"Chicos was a good company to work for PT , they didn't offer many FT positions but offered lots of OT and bonuses .Plenty of food and fun events and the company store was a plus"
bad,I do not recommend working here. It is not a job work/life balance. compensation and benefits could be better. the most enjoyable part was working with my coworkers.
bad,"Coming into Chico's was ideally going to be fun, but the honeymoon was quickly over when working for such a low wage and not being able to capture sales in an environment where a majority of the clientele where looking for markdowns and bargains. Most of the sales team were upbeat and fun to work with, but there was no team cohesion and at times motivation to keep the store organized ran low. Our manager did the best she could, but because of the low wages turnover was constant, and finding associates who could do the work seemed impossible. In a day where the corporate workforce should be embracing  workers who are loyal, responsible and quick minded, in this instance Chico's does not care about their workers and does not value their worth. The commission structure was impossible to navigate successfully."
bad,"typical day your in meetings hardly any desk time. everything is urgent or an emergency. They have the ""most amazing place"" to work idea which should be ""most awful place"". Leaders don't listen they think they're always right and your their little assistant. worst management place. leaders don't know how to lead. Dammn if you try to show you can do the job and more because you get told not to do that. And lets talk about deadlines; always a crunch and always behind. the calendar makes no sense. food in the cafes suck. I think the only decent place is the gym. oh yea and they cut the sick days to 3 days when there was no limit only use when necessary. raised insurance and added a cost in the visit the nurse practitioner office after enrollment of  benefits deadline was up. "
bad,To have employees try to sell to customers for commission in this place is despicable. There were never enough customers coming into the store in the first place. Maybe one of the most boring jobs I've ever worked. Tidying the stock room and replenishing the floors were the highlights of the day.
bad,"In simple summary, not by any means the best place to work at! Extremely ridiculous overtime requirements. No real work benefits for employees. Unsympathetic and nasty attitudes from upper management, plus favoritism, sexism and racism..."
bad,"Chicos used to be a great place to work, now it isn't. New management is now making you use your PTO  each time you call out where it used to be a choice so that would leave hardly anytime left if you were planning a vacation."
bad,"Chico's was not a pleasant experience whatsoever.  It is very competitive and cutthroat working with associates who would stab you in the back for a dollar.  They do, however, pay well.  I would not recommend Chico's."
bad,mgt is there based on ego alone. they follow  a broken work structure and protect the older management employees.  they don't listen to their employees
bad,"The customers, for the most part, are great, That's the main reason why I actually want to show up to work. My biggest complaint at WHBM is management and HR. I've called HR several times and I still have yet to get a call back, which was weeks ago. I feel like HR and management doesn't seem to care about your personal needs or anything about you. The place is like a high school event. There is always trash talk and, the manager is very rude and disrespectful to all the employees, which sometimes happens in front of customers, making you feel belittled. Also, don't bother calling HR to complain about management because as many employees told me, they won't do a thing about it because this specific store does well with sales and apparently that is all HR is concerned about, rather than their employees and making sure they are taking care of! It's a very uncomfortable and competitive environment. You don't make commission but yet they push you to hit a sales goal every day which is very stressful without getting any positive result from it, The hourly rate is garbage and when you start, they tell you there's room for advancement in the company and raises, which isn't true from what I've seen. I have witnessed people come and go so quickly there, which says a lot in itself. I'm only sticking it out till I finish paying off financial issues and then I'm gone. This place is a joke, honestly. It's hands down the worst job I've ever had. I don't recommend this location to anyone!"
bad,"Store manager was not fair to the part time employees always cutting their hours, making false allegations against the employees, had a bad attitude, was judgemenral, and snooty. "
bad,"Poorly managed employer with no regard toward employee compensation , work environment quality or acceptable procedural business standards. Compensation scale is very sub standard and retail facilities are poorly maintained ."
bad,"The work hours a Chico's FAS can be horrible for a new employee. The hardest part of the job is my work schedule; I'm never off on the weekends, I've worked on every holiday, and I never have time for myself nor my family."
bad,"Initially I took this job because I desperately needed it."
bad,"This workplace shows too much favoritism, from the Senior Manager (all three shifts) to the Supervisors they have ""created position for staff that wasn't posted and yet wants every team member to follow the Chico's values when they don't even follow themselves, staff cheating to get an Intregity award, you will not have advance placement at this warehouse because they bring new employees from the outside and have the old employees to train them ""talking about a slap in the face"" ""Great place to work"" is the motto I don't think so, if your looking for that look elsewhere. The management not friendly they walk pass you and don't speak. They end temps go left and right because ""management shows too much favoritism"". If you have a great idea just keep it to yourself because they don't care what have to offer this company on becoming better,  No Growth No Chico's values No integrity"
bad,As a temp you'll be lucky to be hired on full time. Work load varies everyday. You might come in one day and get sent home immediately or work a 14 hour shift. Management doesn't care about you as a person but as a number and you'll be let go if you're not meeting the requirements within the first couple days.
bad,"Not worth your time"
bad,"worst retail experience ever. Poor management, too much computer tutorials. Did not buy us tissues to blow our noses, we had to pay for it ourselves. hourly wage was a joke. I ran the store when we opened , as sales lead, one manager, busted my butt for nothing. They hire too many sales people, and your bonus is a real laughing matter. I wasted six months of my sales professional career, they paint a real disgusting picture."
bad,Management is a joke to many changes no one knows what they are doing! Change of policies without never notifying employees! Now all of a sudden you can't take an unpaid day off from work! WFM states you have to be paid either way! Not true pto policy doesn't state that anywhere! They will give you a very short notice that your schedule will change and they will not work with you on it! Trying to get a response from someone in upper management or HR is like talking to the wall! Everyday emotionally and physically drains the life and sanity right out of you! Very depressing environment and stressful! You DO NOT GET PAID ENOUGH FOR WHAT YOU DEAL WITH AND HOW YOU ARE TREATED BY MANAGEMENT OR CUSTOMERS!
bad,"Honestly, a typical day at work in the call center was praying that each call that came in to you would be a nice sales call and not someone cussing you or paperwork that you were going to have to spend 30 minutes filling out and would count against your productivity. Now some people dealt better with getting cussed out than I did however in this environment you can't say one cross word to the customer because the customer is always right and if you do, that customer will file a complaint on you."
bad,"A typical day is making a sales goal, upt, ridiculous email goal, and cleaning (if you don't your hours will be cut and you will receive no hours for the week or even get sent home early). The pay is minimum and is not worth the amount of work. They are always hiring because everyone who gets hired quits. The only manager who actually cares is the assistant manager who doesn't get enough credit. The rest of the management will talk down to you and not value you as an employee. The coworkers are fun, energetic people to work with but most of them are gossipers and drama starters. The hardest part of the job is having to put up with the management and employees who will steal your sales. The most enjoyable part is going home after a horrid day at work. If you don't like being fake and don't like being a complete stereotype of an annoying sales associate then don't apply because you will waste your time and gas money."
bad,"Training was very bad, was told the third day I worked that there was a thief among them, not an environment I want any part of. Waste of paper. Very cut throat business. Would not recommend to anyone."
bad,"When i was working for the company i was about 8 months pregnant and bought juice out of there machine and i noticed the expiration date said March of 2018, they fired me right after."
bad,I would not recommend the company. Customers are OK and management is rough and expectations are unrealistic.  The benifits are fine but getting time off is very difficult
bad,"One of the worst jobs I’ve ever had. You are trainined to be extremely pushy on every customer to the point of harassment. If you don’t meet your sales goal for the day, you get dinged and told that you will get fired if it happens 3 times. They say they will give you commission for the sales you get, but I NEVER received anything. Commission was supposed to be given on a separate check that I never received. Fellow employees become so competitive to the point where people begain stealing other people’s sales by putting their own name into the register while ringing up, even though someone else helped that customer the entire time. Conversely, my own store manager got angry with me for putting my name on a sale that I helped the entire time, simply because she initially greeted that customer....there is no way to win."
bad,The management lied constantly and was completely untrustworthy. You get worked to death and are shown little appreciation. I'm glad I'm no longer there.
bad,"The way they are set up,  you have to sell multiple items to one person to make any money.  I sold over 100,000 dollars worth of merchandise in the month of December and received just a little over 200.00 dollars in comm.  Something is wrong with that!"
bad,"The atmosphere at Chicos is pressure filled and unfair at multiple levels.  They expect full availability yet may cut your shift with little or no notice.  You are competing for sales with sales managers who are already getting 40 hours and bonuses as opposed to your (as little as 4 hour work weeks). "
bad,I take pride in everything I do . I give 125% to my job . In Chicos I helped the store I managed reach heights in kpis and successful customer service it hadn't seen. The staff had never been so happy as this management team nurtured them and rewarded them . Corporate had an issue with managements time worked . We are restricted in hours but had to meet all requirements and projects set forth .
bad,Did not have repest for older workers manger a bully hrs were not given to part time workers I find a complete. No response. I was forced to leave because of poor working conditiond
bad,"The store manager at New Orleans River Walk was very arrogant, and talked to customers with a rude under tone, and stole some of my sales  commitions in-front of my face a few times, and antagonized me one day behind the shoes I wore to work."
bad,Was never even told I was done.  Just never put on the schedule after last day worked.  I wasn’t pushy enough for them and I have a bad back and couldn’t vacuum.
bad,"Company is cutting jobs at all levels.  Job security is at risk for everyone.  Role out so many programs that are meant to motivate, but they are not an incentive for the stores."
bad,"Micro managing is a real thing here. The managers don't care what your talking about only the numbers that are put out. The pay was horrible for the work they wanted you to do. To much pressure to be perfect. No raises, only once a year in April for .25."
bad,"One of the worst companies I have ever worked for . Management can be very rude , Their is no respect towards anyone. Schedules constantly changing because the turn around rate is horrible you would see s new person every week and they are gone by the next week . No open door policy very clicky by that I mean by your skin color. The discount is horrible . Working with mature ladies I had the most drama and met the nastiest people I wouldn’t ever work for them again . Run"
bad,"Typical clothing retail store.  Clothing is expensive but lacking in quality.  As with other stores, you are expected to up-sale the customer customer's purchases."
bad,High pressure sales and the commission was cut 6 months after I started work. The store was not maintained. Lights were out for months and we only had a cleaning crew twice a year.
bad,"Management is awful. Everyone gets treated differently stay away from this place call of a company. Bad environment not enough hours, deal with rude spoiled customers daily. Don’t do it to yourself."
bad,"At the beginning I was greatful for this job. I loved working with most of the ladies and the customers where pretty nice.  I gained a lot of knowledge on retail and how management shouldn’t be. As time went on you could tell that there wasn’t much structure and that management needed more training, including the district manager. Overall the job was pretty easy and the pay was alright."
bad,Don't put yourself through it. It's just not worth it. Store and upper management don't care about employees at all. No work/life balance and the pay stinks.
bad,"clientele is amazing, merchandise great, District manager was a bully who boss people by humiliating , and putting  you down."
bad,"I worked at Chico’s for 3 years and it was interesting. Management was lacking and consistently acted too busy to handle problems between employees. There was a huge problem of people “accidentally” stealing another associates comission. The biggest problem is you’re required to read from a script and if u don’t u are “coached” which means a condescending, passive aggressive conversation with a manager. Also they employ managers who have their own businesses, which never made sense to me, how are they able to give full attention to their position when they are worried about their own business?"
bad,"N/A. Educate customers about the products and services applicable"
bad,"Typically your work schedule depends on if the store makes its' numbers.  So you only received your schedule one week in advance. District manager is extremely wired!!  You may or may not receive an annual raise.  But you are still expected to give 100%, which I did."
bad,I have work for Chicos for 5 years and have found that the managers from the District to the Assistant are unorganized and poorly managed on all levels. They have unrealistic goals and it should be a requirement that a person in management have some form of prior education in the field of management.  I am pretty much dealing with managers that are unqualified to lead and manage.
bad,"This place is below average in almost every category. It doesn't pay well, management is horrible and you'll probably never get promoted. The new CEO has a good plan but there is no real change in thinking at the director level so past practices and bad decisions are the status quo."
bad,The team lead counts how long you go to the bathroom for. no more than 5 mins. it's like a prison working here. management sucks. especially on the C shift
bad,"Most of the position seems more for kids or after school programs.  Not a living wage for a responsible adult.  The bonus is tricky, during the busy holiday season, the company brings in the temporary help and then pipe majority of sales call to them.   In the meantime, they pipe all the problem and customer service difficult calls to sales associate.  This cause the sale employee not to make bonus while Chicos does not pay bonus to the temporary employees.  Many people accept the $10.50 per hour to start as a sales person only because its stated that you start earning bonus on sales of $100 or more you earn the first dollar.  125.00 = $2.00 bonus and so on to a maximum of $75.00 per sale depending on the amount of the sale.  Unfortunately after one accepts the position, Chicos change the rule requesting that sales also accept 10% customer service calls.  They are sneaky because customer service gets paid $12.00 per hour and less bonus.  Once the sale person for $10.50 an hour is made to start taking 10% customer service calls - more days it is 70% customer service and no bonus.  I feel that approach that Chicos takes is very dishonest!"
bad,This is an absolutely horrible place to work. I tried to make a career of it but it is impossible. This is only a temporary job or place to gain experience at best. The management is very unorganized and very disloyal to the employees. Typical politics dominate this company and determine exactly how far you will go. No matter how much you succeeded and how much you go above and beyond it is not recognized nor appreciated. The only way to obtain a competitive salary is to negotiate before you are hired. Once you are in the door the annual raise based on performance is a joke. A good review will get you 28 cents. However most annual raises for most normal employees were 10 cents. Also promotion from within is not compensated fairly as well. Per pay grade the increase is 10%. In a very skilled position the pay was very close to 5$ or more under being competitive. They push through programs designed to help and improve the organization however they are not acted upon. It is all a dog and pony show. If you desperately need employment it is a place you can get by. However when hired don't stop looking. Use it to build your experience and move on.  The culture will never improve as the leadership structure never stays the same and its never the same people from year to year so the improvement points never get better. The same problems repeat time after time.
bad,"As an experienced retail professional, I was at first excited for the opportunity to work for White House/Black Market because of their beautiful quality fashions, and my passion for wardrobing. However, the aggressive manager who had more to criticize than to praise after working busy shifts with no breaks and achieving big sales...I decided $8 an hour and ZERO commissions offered in their OUTLET venues was not worth the stress I endured. If you like having to push sales very aggressively, bang on dressing room doors of women changing to push more on them, and constant micro management with low wages, then this is perfect for those who like that."
bad,The Manager at the Chicos that I worked for was absolutely Horrendous. she has absolutely no management skills nor did she have any skills working with her employees . I was a general manager for over 28 years and went in as an assistant as I wanted less responsibility however this was a horrific experience .
bad,This company does not value the happiness of its employees and does not pay for what they require of employees. It makes it hard to acquire and keep staff.
bad,Worst place to work. Ive never seen so many accountable people unaccountable. The level of incompetence is unparalleled.  Absolutely zero training and micro managed.
bad,Working for CHICO’s FAS was the worst decision I ever made. I have never encountered a more negative group of people who are willing to put everyone around them down just to get ahead. There is NO sense of teamwork whatsoever. There is NO training. You are left to figure out everything on your own in hopes that you mess up and make someone else look good. Steer clear of this company. I had such high hopes when I was offered a position. Now I wish I could get back the past 8 months of my life and not waste it being so depressed here everyday.
bad,"Incompetent doesn't even begin to describe the management team here; the problems started at the top and trickled down for everyone to suffer with. It's only been a month and I believe 7 people have quit---4 associates and three people who didn't even start. Numbers sometimes don't tell a completely accurate story, but here it tells a perfectly accurate picture of how dreadful the work environment is... Problems are supposed to get better with time but here they continued to get worse! Sad very sad, great company however! "
bad,"My co workers were a happy lot, we had a lot of fun with fashion and dressing up. I learned a lot about what women want."
bad,"This was one of the worst overall experiences of my life. Not just ""work life."". The atmosphere was one of intimidation, bullying and name calling.  And this was management!  There was no one to help. The pay is ridiculously low as well.  They Foster a ""get even"" attitude and totally believe it's okay to demean and embarrass employees in front of customers.  I wouldn't recommend Chicos to anyone, ever."
bad,"Was hired in as support staff, wanted to move up to sales associate, but was told I am not pretty enough for the position. Any sales i did make i had to give them to my fellow associates as i was not allowed to have my own sales. Manager talked alot of bad things about other employees and clients. The manager was on vacation more than at the store. Clients were very sweet and the best part of the job. Good hours at first then went down to almost nothing."
bad,"There is no free lunch, no game room, no employee lounge, no social climate, no fun. "
bad,"Friendly workplace  lots of time on  your feet good customers friendly co workers    clean store,  not enough hours,  lots of lifting, lots of cleaning and folding"
bad,"I was fired when I asked a question. I asked human resources if it will be okay for me to call off due to the fact that my Master cylinder(Part in a car that controls brakes) was leaking fluid and failing and I needed it replace asap. The day prior to that i was involved in a minor car accident due to the brakes not working correctly. I explained the situation to management and human resources. I was contacted later the day telling me I am being terminated. I didn't even call off, I asked permission to take the day off to deal with a real emergency."
bad,"Chico’s asks for so much from its employees but offers nothing in return. You’re paid minimum wage and expected to go above and beyond. Customers get better discounts than employees. Upper management is never available and shows no interest in the retail employees whatsoever. Customers are rude and nasty, and rather than take employees word, would rather take the customers side."
bad,"The company used to be a good place to work, however since they have change the bonus structure to literally nothing..( now my bonuses are $20 a month- when they used to be at least $450 + a month) people are starting to realized is not worth it to work there anymore for hard work and no pay."
bad,Chicos WAS anamazing company...now it's just as bad as all the other retailers out there.  Taking away fair compensation and expecting more and more from employees.
bad,"Disrespect is a dialy issue at Chicos No1 to hold management accountable for how they spoke to their employees.Stay clear of this place, it's horrible"
bad,"This place doesn't care about it's employees, they will work you until you can't work anymore, there's no support for upper management, you're left to fend on your own."
bad,"Management is rude, disrespectful, and they do not care about their employees at all. i have so glad i do not work here anymore. they do not pay well."
bad,"Chicos FAS presents the many challenges of retail sales that is common in this industry.  I have learned many customer service skills, in that is an area this company places strong emphasis. An enjoyable aspect is the fun we enjoy in the workplace.  Our goal is to establish a personal relationship with each customer by demonstrating our style expertise.  This company has many dedicated and loyal customers that love the clothing style and fit. The hardest part of the job is that decisions are made at a corporate level and do not always provide a positive result in specific areas.  We do what we can to meet our customers needs."
bad,I took the job here because I loved working with fashion and coordinating outfits and displays. Unfortunately the staff was less than friendly including the clientele. My salary was not enough to put bread on the table so I quickly left.
bad,I loved working for this company until they brought in new management which I think slight destroyed a great work environment.
bad,"era de total armonia, onde todos da equipe se entendiam e se comunicavam bem."
bad,NO respect for employees or there families.  Does not show any support for new mothers with sick children.  No benefits will use you up and make sure they adjust the hours not to become a fulltime employee.
bad,picking and packing orders as they are received from online customers. what you will learn form this company is that the communication skill from the management are not very good there is not really anything hard with this job if you have the right people training you
bad,"Management was difficult to work with and typically would undermine employees.  Benefits are lacking, although the environment was very pleasant."
bad,"very high paced, tiering you don't really have time for yourself because you're always working weekends and can't spend time with friends or family and no vacation time."
bad,"Very sales driven, pay is low, not very busy year round so hours will be cut in the off season. Management is ok not great, I would say this is a good second job."
bad,"Micro managed every hour by the District Manager"
bad,Managers have favorite employees that they give the best hours. They are not necessarily the hardest working employees. A new manager started working and sabotaging employees by secretly changing their work hours and not telling them so they could be fired and she could bring in her own people.
bad,"Boring, cheap materials- high prices, damaged garments are "" fixed in the store by the crew"" and put back on the rack. Low hours , low pay , no advancement. Management has a God complex and takes all the customers and bonus . Demand you to wear their clothing but it's expensive and ugly. The lost and found gets taken home by the manager. Call you in even on your day off expecting you to come in. No respect between co-workers."
bad,Terrible management. Good benefits. The culture is very highschool.
bad,"I think this company has fabulous clothing for women. They fit everyone. But, they are unfair with pay for the jobs you have to do and the grief you put up with in the store! I also think some management treats employees unfairly."
bad,Manager made fun of employees for how they were dressed.  We were required to wear Chico's clothes but were not given a stipend to purchase them with; only a discount.  DM did nothing when manager ran off all the employees.
bad,Zero work life balance with this company. Unrealistic expectations that are always changing because upper management can not get on the same page with the needs of business.
bad,"Chicos is CHEAP---they want a lot and give nothing. They do not value their staff or team members. Senior leadership is lacking, tempermental, egregious, and vendictive.  There is no consistency in  policy, its more emotionally based versus the adherence to policy and procedures; lack of transparency yet moreover at discretion of the DSM based on mood or need.  Any step beyond sales associate has way too much responsibility or accountablity for $13.00."
bad,"At the time, the store I worked in was undergoing constant management changes. They were also dealing with internal and external theft which meant work hours were limited."
bad,It was competitive with the ladies that work there. If you’re younger it’s difficult to get the older women to trust your judgment with suggestions since the clothes is definitely for and older age range.
bad,"this job relies mainly on commission, I went from a sales associate to cashier but did not get any additional compensation for no longer getting commission. My manager was more concerned with her time off to spend with her boyfriend and would schedule herself off weekends and holidays. While this did not affect me personally assistant managers would get worn out covering her absence. Hours for part time sales are based on your ability to sell, the more you sell the better hours you get."
bad,My assistant manager and all the associates are wonderful. There are times when we have a lot of fun. We care about each other and are all very supportive. But the general manager is another story. She can be outright mean and selfish. She does not have the right personality for management. The only thing upper management cares about is the bottom line. They DO NOT care about their employees and they prove that over and over again. The only reason to work for Chico’s is for the clothes and to have something to do. Seek employment elsewhere!
bad,"What a shame this Brand does not support it's associates.  I had so many employees that were discouraged and left at an alarming rate."
bad,"Love fellow employees. I am good friends with most and we"
bad,Chico's is a good place to work after high school or better yet if you are retired and just would like a little extra cash. However it's come to my understanding you don't get many opportunities to grow within the company. The more the company grows I feel the less they care about their employees.
bad,The workers were very dramatic. The manager didn't make it a fun working environment. Was always given more than I can handle. Also wasn't allowed to take off for important days
bad,This position helped me to cultivate a foundation for my management skills. The commission based selling helped me to learn divine sales skills. The environment was negative and stressful due to management.
bad,"Company does not care about employees and makes this very apparent. Raises are laughable, benefits are continually cut."
bad,"Not fair within the values of the company. will not be happy when we make our numbers. the customers are great though, no growth opportunities within the company"
bad,"I began work with the company when they first came to America from the UK. They tried to station me in a store in Queen Creek even though I lived in Tempe and they had a store in Tempe for me to work in. They dumped all the information about their products on you as soon as training begins, made a song about regimen and it was absolutely garbage. The product was not as great as they insisted it was the best, but in reality it was mind over matter."
bad,I enjoyed the creative aspect of this job. Setting up the store and displaying new merchandise. I also enjoyed helping customers find clothing items that made them feel good about themselves. It was a very good day when customers left with a smile on their face. We all know how clothes shopping can be quite a chore.
bad,"I got hired to do shipment and back up customer service. All of a sudden nobody had any hours, nobody had hours except the co managers. We would go weeks with out being on the schedule. They over hired and didn't think about it. So pretty much the co managers worked the store. But hey, what do you expect with a retail job?"
bad,"Customer service is top notch, and the culture around interacting with customers is a fun and positive one. However, Upper Management does not listen to lower Management, nor associates. Any criticisms of the company or product are poorly received and dealt with. Schedules are not prepared for the following week until Saturdays, so none of the employees can plan other obligations, and Management looks badly on the need to change schedules."
bad,My job at Chico's in South Florida was mainly as a cashier.  They were very understaffed and difficult to get the proper training.  I requested a better salary as I was making no commission on the sales floor and they gave me 10 cents more!!  I have been faithfully shopping at Chico's former than 15-years and though this would be a good fit.  I was so very disappointed at the whole process and finally gave up and left.   How does one earn a living on 9-dollars and 40-cents an hour?
bad,"Manager is not a motivational person, constantly changing routines, constantly changing schedules.  Talking to employees about other employees not professional."
bad,Do not train employees correctly. Supervisors do not act in professional manner towards employees.  No job security no matter how hard you work.Management needs to pay attention to what goes on with employees. Do not care about personal needs or problems with employees.  Play favorites.
bad,This company has had many layoffs over the years. Many hard and seasoned staff are/were let go to make the numbers work for board of directors.
bad,As a previous Assistant Manager I felt as if the Store Manager rode you hard but in a negative way. She had strong workers which made her numbers look good for her store. Nobody likes to be scolded like in a school environment.
bad,"No room for advancement, very high turnover, lots of politics.  Don't join this company if you have higher aspirations of moving up.  Our store has had 4 different managers over the course of two years."
bad,The management showed bias attitudes towards individuals and made judgment based on ethnicity and gender.
bad,"Stressful, and over whelming daily.  There is no more I could or what to express"
bad,"Camarillo has the worst store manager I've ever worked with! Shes a total twoface, a brick wall & makes working there the worst experience ever! When she interviews you shes one thing but once you're hired its all downhill! & oh shifts will most likely only be 2 days a week for 4/5 hours IF LUCKY!"
bad,"Taking a WIDE variety of calls while operating through seven software programs simutaneously. Guidelines and business practices change frequently, must stay up to date at all times. Providing consistent, accurate, and best possible customer service is a mandatory requirement with each situation."
bad,"Chico's FAS had a lot of promise when I started here in 2014, but it's been all down hill after a series of very bad executive decisions coupled with an aging customer file and bad stigma on the brands.  "
bad,"This company is in serious trouble  Mismanaged on all levels   "
bad,They lure amazing talent with great benefits and a beautiful campus. Once there “under contract” you are basically trapped for two years. They changed their production strategy four times in two years. They expect their employees to keep up and management is totally complacent. So many people burn out and turn over is rampant. Horrendous office hours and no help from HR dept.
bad,Team leads are rude and are not fair. They tend to reward only those they like. They don't care about your well being. They don't have a good motivation strategy. Management is too busy to care.
bad,"Love the clothes. I love helping the women when they come in to Chico's. Many of these women have stories. Stories of many things that they have overcome. When I help them find a new wardrobe or outfit, it makes me feel good because I have pout a smile on their face."
bad,"not exciting, customer's are grumpy usually. not enough hours to give. challenging situations when it comes to customers."
bad,There was a lot of walking involved. You had to multitask constantly. The managers weren't very friendly. I learned to use my speed accordingly throughout the day. The hardest part of my job was moving from floor to floor. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers.
bad,"Don't get sucked in by all the amenities on the campus, those are only good if you have time to use them. The work loads are extremely heavy in all departments, most people do a lot of work from home as well just to be able to spend time with their family. At the end of the day it don't matter how many hours you put in and the quality of your work because they will fire you in a second to make the company look more profitable. It's all about the shareholders..."
bad,Quality women's retail boutique that offers stylish clothing and accessories for the woman who wants to stand out in the crowd with fashion sense.
bad,Need more hours than what is provided.  Sales are competitive.
bad,Provided sales and design consultation to customers for women's clothing store. In-store customer service sales. Consistently received bonuses due to exceeding sales targets. Processing returns and special orders.  Assisting with inventory management and stage set.  Cash and credit card sales.
bad,"The day of my interview, I wasn’t provided with clear directions on where to go for my interview. The building is locked and the only way into the building is by using a pass. I was running late for my interview and trying to find someone who would be kind enough to help direct me to where I needed to go. The security staff claimed they did not know the lady I was scheduled to meet with, which was one of the many concerns I had. The staff seemed real disorganized and not very knowledgeable of what was going on. To be employed with their call center, you must be available to work all shifts and your shifts can change without notice. I had accepted the job only because I needed a job at the time. Majority of their communication is done via email and trying to contact them by phone is next to impossible. They only responded to one of my voicemail’s and they had ignored my husbands numerous voicemails. When I would reply to the emails to clarify where I was supposed to go and how I would get in (secured building), I never did get a response to my questions, I felt this was very unprofessional of them. They expect you to be on time and prompt, but fail to give you clear instructions. The day I was supposed to start training, I called and left a voicemail indicating I was no longer interested working for the company."
bad,"Workplace culture was difficult to fit into. Closed group essence in each building.  Turnover seems to happen every two years with lay offs based on shareholder needs. "
bad,I would not recommend working at Chico's. They expect an awfully lot for very little pay and no benefits except for a 40% discount on their full price items only.
bad,Stressful place to work. Company unsure of direction it is taking. Low pay and no set work schedule. Shifting initiatives daily. Not a good company for communication.
bad,"Co-workers were great. Customers were great. Company goals were a little unrealistic. Management was horrible, liked to play head games and pit employees against each other along with spreading gossip and lies.  However, other employees taught me great tools for customer service and sales techniques that I applied in other jobs. Great life lesson."
bad,I would not recommend working here. They reward employees that leave the company by hiring them back at promoted levels with higher salaries within a year of them leaving while the employees that stay are not rewarded or incentivised.  The finance department is not what I would recommend as a place to work.
bad,"Chico's is a company that has cultivated a devoted clientele.   They are attempting to rebrand the company in order to acquire a larger share of the 50+ demographic. "
bad,"Environment: management only wants to hear your thoughts if it fits their agenda. Lack of inclusive environment, if your are not liked, they will bully you out, until you quit or are fired. They have hired unqualified people, because of their personal relationships; then have favoritism and turn a blind eye to issues and turn the tables based on the story/agenda they are pushing. HR is only their to protect management and do little to nothing when matters arise."
bad,"I relocated to work at this company but the culture was not very pleasant and wasn't a friendly place to work."
bad,I worked at the Chico's in South Windsor CT I loved the customers more than I liked the people that I worked with esp the managers. I felt like they were intimitaded by me. Then on top of that the managers told my old co-workers that I was 3hrs late to work one time and that I was unreliable. I honestly felt disgusted after hearing the lies that they spread about me after I left the state. I wouldn't recommend no one working for the Chico's in South Windsor CT! Especially if you're a woman of color.
bad,"Decent benefits, but very long work hours. Layoffs occur every 3 years that puts the office into a frenzy. It was very difficult to think long term at this company."
bad,"Not my most favorite retail job. It was hard working with older women customers. They were very difficult to please. Also, the area I worked in probably didn't help."
bad,I told the Manager when I work my two weeks notice that if she wanted continued growth she needed to help her employees to feel respected for their hard work.
bad,"It was a fun place to work, but some of the branches were very disorganized. Clientele differed from location to location, but the quality of the clothes remained the same."
bad,"The clienteling and cold calling are brutal. Also work life balance is difficult, and everyone takes this job extremely seriously. The pay is low compared to other companies, but they expect you to make it up in commission which doesnt really happen."
bad,"Worked their 10 1/2 yrs let go to cut backs"
bad,If you are looking for a sales based environment in which you can enjoy helping women find the perfect outfit then this job is for you!
bad,"Personal attention to customers"
bad,Commission plan is almost non-existent. You have to sell one customer $600. Asst Mgr stole all my big sales. Inconsistent scheduling. Low pay. Had to call customers regularly about sales instead of helping customers in store.
bad,working through temp agency job didnt last long was assigned to work for a couple of months and then had to stop
bad,"Enjoyable working with people, but very competitive work enviornment."
bad,Tried very hard to work here and make the most of it. The store manager played favorites and did not care for me from day one. I did make great friends and my co-workers will be life long friends.
bad,Company has lost its vision and the designs to no resonate with its customers.  Sales are decreasing every quarter and the leadership has no idea how to stop the trend.
bad,"The leadership at Chicos is out of control able to alter your clock and and or remove points at will with no regard. It is so bad the group leads are allowed to do this without even having to ask a supervisor, much less anyone in HR. It was exposed many times the leadership sleeping with employees and giving them promotions and extra or less hours without penalty. They have absolutely zero check and balance system in place and often lie to manipulate those that have difficulty with English."
bad,"Typical stressful retail job. Corporate not aware of how much they expect/ are asking of employees. Get paid as little as any other retail job. Get just enough commission to make things competitive with each other at work, but not enough to be worth it. Employee discounts okay."
bad,"As a sales lead with a college degree at a Soma Intimates store, I am dismayed that after 3 years, I could go to my local McDonald's and be hired at 27 cents an hour less as a high school dropout."
bad,Treated associates poorly and only focused on the money brought in rather than a customers happiness. If a customer had only a few items more associates and managers would ignore them because they only focused on making a profit.
bad,"The biggest problem is nobody is on the same page there, you have 3 or 4 people telling what to do unfortunately its all different things like your three people."
bad,"The pay is mediocre, but the potential to make bonuses will be to your advantage if you are motivated.  The problem with the Strongsville, OH store is the management.  It was so bad, I had to file a complaint with Human Resources and got nowhere.  From the store manager, to the district manager, to Human Resources, I could not find one person familiar with Employment Law, policies & procedures, or unfair labor practices.  For this reason, I was left no choice but to resign & pursue my issues with an attorney.  If you are lucky enough to work for a store with a great management team, it's a decent job.  Unfortunately, this was not the case in Ohio."
bad,"They pushed, pushed and pushed for sells. They made us be way to attentive to the customers which would drive some away. The life and work balance was hard because hours were all over the place and, you had to work holidays. The hours and shifts you worked were said to be based on your sales performance but were clearly geared toward favoritism, you could end up working 4 hours a week. This is how I saw the employees being treated as a sales lead, if the managers wanted someone out they would cut their hours down to nothing and schedule themselves the high peak hours to make more sales to add to their bonuses. The managers I worked with were very vindictive and weren't beneath stealing sales when you worked with the customers the entire time. Breaks were never at the same time sometimes you wouldn't get one. Stay away from these types of jobs unless you're retired or don't really need the money because it's never consistent."
bad,"Work/ Life balance was not good...I was replaced with two people - star rating would be a 2 - would not let me change. I was replaced by two people. Overload of work, minimal support from management. Learned an extreme amount about the counseling industry. Actual counseling was my favorite part of the job."
bad,"Received many positive comments from customers who appreciated my knowledge of product, personal assistance and great customer service which brought me a lot of joy.  Learned to operate a computerized cash register.  Probably the most difficult part of the job was being on your feet for extended hours, but found I did get used to it.  There was a fun, smart team of style experts and each shift was a slightly different combination."
bad,"It's ok... like they said it was a great place to work. You have paid time off and vacation. You aslo have your weekends off, Friday- Sunday that's was awesome especially if you're a single mother."
bad,"Working at an outlet mall has its perks; many hours, always busy, good flow of new products coming in. Thats it though, the management was always disheveled, they knew the business part, but would complain towards the workers towards things that were very obvious to not be at their fault."
bad,"A typical day at work for me is styling women and making sure the Boutique looks its best. "
bad,"Chico's once was a small family. As the company grew, everything changed. Most of the employees are women with children, and it's very hard to try to get a weekend off, or days off to be with your children. Once management changed things are not the same anymore. I've learned a lot from this company, but it's just best I move on."
bad,"Great people to work with both internally and externally. However, there is so much micro-management from upper level that it provides very little room for creating a team environment as well as it creates a  sense that one cannot think for themselves and that our input is not welcome or desired. Promotions for management seem to come from outside rather than internally."
bad,"My day would begin by reviewing all in-store operations online,stratifying for the day, making outlines on how and what to coach the associates on. Run and maintain the store , customer service. Deal with visual updates and in-store events."
bad,"Chico's stores are in a constant struggle and its biggest competition is its own on line business. Online gives customers prices that stores can not compete with which makes in store business slow. When the store has little traffic, then sales associates"
bad,Good 10-20 hour job. On-boarding program is antiquated. They mandate  uneccessary video tutorials rather than time spent on hand-on training. Most of the clientele go there for the sales and rarely spend full-price on anything which makes it hard for bonus. For every $250 the sales associate get $1. Not worth it. If you are a new hire working part-time hours make sure you have great KPI's otherwise you will be stuck with shifts that have the lowest traffic.
bad,"In 2012, I was offered the ""opportunity of a lifetime"" to move to Florida and work for one of the industry's top retailers.  They offered full relocation and VERY competitive compensation."
bad,this is a great first job for someone who has never worked. it can also be good for a person needing to get back on their feet.
bad,"The work is basically enjoyable except the higher management and executives are extreme micro-managers who do not give you a chance to do your best. Much frustration and unhappiness. "
bad,"Overall used to be a great place to work. Benefits are still great but the work life balance is tough. To their credit, management is working hard to fix the problems."
bad,Not an easy environment to work in. Very competitive for a part time employee looking for a job while still a student. Friendly staff and customers are decent as well.
bad,"Have 14 years of experience in implementation of SAP R/3 SD (Sales and Distribution) Module including 3 life cycles of implementations of SAP R/3 4.7, 4.6C, 4.0B and ECC 6.0.  SAP R/3 implementation experience covers all the phases of the SAP R/3 implementation life cycle, including business process design and configuration, data conversion, designing test plans and conducting users training programs. Cross-functional knowledge in MM Purchasing, Goods Movements, Invoice Verification and Finance & Controlling like G/L Accounts AP, AR, Cost Center and Profitability Analysis. Have excellent Communication skills and a team player."
bad,"The job started off well but things have definitely gone down hill. On a typical day I find myself searching for tasks to occupy myself with until I can assist a customer. I have learned nothing that I will take with me. The management team is poor, supervisor is a real push over. The co workers are the best thing about working with Chico's although I can do with out rumors. The hardest thing about the job is that hours are slim. there is no future with this company unless your content with your current status."
bad,The store manager was not good when she had me work more hours for 5 days a week.  She almost made me work 7 days of week which is not good.  I left after 1 year of working there because no request of for July 4.
bad,Chicos is a nice place to work if you don't have to support a family. If you are a manager that is different. The clothing are beautiful and easy to sell. They have great sales. It you want to work here go into sales.
bad,"It's a fitting job if you enjoy retail and working with customers. However, the pay is not necessarily worth it. Unless you are an incredible seller and know how to promote the product, then wonderful, you will make a huge amount of commission. The commission part is interesting but also difficult - you have to pray that a woman is willing to spend more that 149 dollars in one transaction. And there's nothing to prevent your commission being taken away should the customer return products that you sold her. My shifts were either constantly changed the day before or the day of, a minimum of 2-3 times. Which is really nuts when you have to rely on public transportation or transportation by family members/friends. Not to mention the little amount of hours given. Not to mention that my shifts were calculated so that I don't have to take a mandatory 30 minute break; just the occasionally 15 minute break if I needed/wanted. My team leaders and management were absolutely wonderful, but were aggressive with their sales. I understand that our job is to push for sales, but even I felt uncomfortable for customers who obviously did not want to purchase any more produce but were too nervous to say so."
bad,"Coming from a job that was very stressful, the atmosphere was fun and easy going. Everyone is very helpful, down to earth, easy to get along with as well as supportive."
bad,"It is an okay place to work, just not so flexible with work and school schedule. I would have stayed had they worked with my school schedule. It paid alright, but not nearly what Im used to or worth. The customers are great, they spend a lot of money. The workload is basic, nothing too intense. Overall a cool place to work."
bad,During the time I worked there the store was going through a lot of internal conflict and was struggling to be successful.  This created a very stressful work environment with everyone always on edge and worried.  Eventually everyone left and they had to start all over.  There was some thinking that they may even close that particular location because it was doing so poorly.
bad,"Would not work there again"
bad,I would not like to answer this or make a statement about this company.
bad,"Nice staff, nice clothes, not a good work environment for me. enjoyed the customers"
bad,"Assist customers as a sales/fashion consultant, responsible for register, freight, put-backs and store maintenance. The management was something that needed work. I enjoyed creating entire wardrobes for the regulars that came into the store."
bad,Chico's is a company that has been going through lots of change along with the rest of retail since I have been with the company. Since August 2015. I do not agree with the bonus program which is essentially a commission program. It is a way for the company to get away with paying their employees so little. There are some positives. They offer good benefits to full time employees as well as a low stress work environment and good work life balance. This company has a lot of work to do. They have yet to figure out who their core customer is and really hone in on product to fit her. They have a new CEO and the growing pains are definitely showing.
bad,Chico's has lost it's culture.  If your not in the in crowd you are on the line to get fired.  It's not about your skills its about who you know in Chico's.
good,"I was very enthusiastic to work at Chico's FAS when I began.  However, I found there was a lot of infighting between sales associates and the manager.  This infighting created a hostile environment to work in.  "
good,"Open store operations, review stats from previous day layout goals for store and individuals based on store goals for that day and whether or not the previous days' had been met."
good,Good place to gain customer service experience in a call center arena.
good,"A typical day for me begins with me looking forward to coming to work; meeting new people; working with my teammates and enjoying being at work."
good,"customer service is an area I learned a lot about, I thank all the people I encounter on a daily bases, that is the area I enjoyed the most."
good,- communication of expectations continuously unclear
good,"There was a constant change in employees as well as management within the store, within the district and within the region. You felt as though you could never take a day off and the scheduling and call outs were also a huge problem. The store closes at 12am or 1 am but you could be there until 2 or 3 in the morning. Not good for a work-life balance. You are also expected to wear the company clothes, which one shirt is the cost of an entire shift, and two shifts equal a pair of pants- which is a little ridiculous to me. The store also constantly gets destroyed by customers and you are fixing it probably 20-30 times a day. They also talk about how easy it is to earn commission, but it realistically isn't because to make a good commission, your customer has to purchase 400+ in one transaction, for purchases under 100, you don't earn anything outside of your hourly."
good,"Use rf scanner to check in orders,pick orders put in tote, stack totes on pallets, use pallet jack to move pallets to loading dock to load boxes on truck."
good,Chico's is full of unqualified managers (with a few exceptions) and underpaid staff. The processes are ever-changing. Micromanagement is a huge reason why I would not recommend Chicos.
good,"Management doesn't respond to employee with issues.Left multiple messages for the manager, NO response. training should be consistant.  Not one day here and there."
good,"The most stressful job in my career but at the same time the best experience in my career.  Learned a lot about the fashion business and about juggling the most complex calendar system I’ve ever seen.  Took a toll on my health which I’m still paying for today, but enjoyed the early time I was there."
good,"What I don't like is that they only judge you on your sales, it doesn't matter how hard you work or how dependable you are all they care about is sales, and that makes for competition and stealing sales and I hate that"
good,"A typical day would be supervising a 2 shifts of sales associates as selling. "
good,"At chicos im a customer processor. I arive at 6am and clock out at 4:30 pm est. My job consist of picking orders, packing orders, shipping orders, and processing international orders. Im proficient using systems such as PKMS, AS400, and RF scanners. I also perform shipping and recieving. Im forklift certified on the cherry picker, sit down reach lift, electric pallet jack, dock stocker, walking reach lift, sit down propane lift. I love Chico's, but I dont think they see my potential."
good,"I so enjoy assisting and selling fashion - and suggesting/coordinating wardrobes with and for the woman in the boutique that i work in part-time.  I enjoy using that word Boutique, it seems obviously a word to describe a high end store like Chicos. But - we just do not seem to have enough of the petite sizes for the 30% of the woman that have mentioned they would shop at Chicos but we do not have their petite sizes to try on. Management should listen to the employees and check out the demographics. This is what they ladies are saying. I am thrilled when we ""make our day"" !!  Hours are too long in the shopping plaza at my boutique, no one shops after 8:00 pm so why do we keep the store open till 9 pm? Understandably maybe a Thursday or a Friday evening & during Holidays season, but up in New England these woman stay at home after 7:00 pm. Or all go to their Beach Houses on the summer weekends. The store needs a serious interior over haul, too much cashier and wrap desk and not enough display space. I get it, !!!  the cost of renovation may not be in the budget - but a fresh brighter look and a few contemporary accents plus better lighting would be more attractive. Change desk area add petites. Dressing rooms should have fresh paint or paper. Maybe no money in budget? The styles and offerings are beautiful - love what we receive weekly to put on the floor and fortunately I have a lovely group of women that i enjoy working beside. Please look at how you ""market"" and the events that the Boutiques should plan - where is Corporate Marketing/ management to market these with enough"
good,"The Seattle store was one big clique. I worked in East Coast stores many years ago, and they were very nice workplaces. Maybe the corporate cultural changed, but I don't appreciate memorizing lines to tell customers!! My favorite day at Chico's was my last!"
good,High amount of tasking required while still required to sell and meet sales goals. Compensation not competitive with requirements of job. Very irregular work hours with heavy adjustments even throughout a scheduled week.
good,I enjoyed helping the customers and the the employee discounts. It was a nice part time job and I wish that they recognized employees with advancement opportunities.
good,Not a good place to work.  Company does not promote work life balance. Days are long and executive management is mediocre at best. Company promotes integrity but does not live or operate by their guiding principles or values.  HR department can not be trusted. HR department protects their executives but not their employees.
good,Not a friendly environment with mid management. No respect or communication with store level mangement. No consistency company wide on management training.
good,"The customers are who will make you want to work here forever, not the coworkers/managers. Management puts too much pressure on sales instead of experience. Clothes are comfortable and most are stylish. If you want to wear denim it must be CHICOs denim which is hard for younger/smaller women to fit into. If you work in a store with a GSM they will probably move you between the two stores, and make you work both stores in the same day even if you don't want to. Often times will work you close one night and open the next morning, especially if you requested an evening off. If you request vacation time, you will be scheduled to close the night before your vacation starts and open the day you come back. Bonus system is nice but leaves something to be desired and usually only benefits the higher ups in management or the employees with the most hours."
good,"The product is good.  The store is never stale. There is a great deal of internal strife due to bouns selling. The atmosphere of the store is clean and pleasant. No breaks unless you work 6 hours. Then you get a 30 minute lunch. As far as pay they will start one at 8:50. Others who claim to have been modles at 10.50. the nepatisim policy is unclear. It is used in several ways. Mother daughter same position. Mother daughter one keye the other is not Aunt manager neice , sales lead ect. Creates tension. mission statement integrity."
good,"New Orleans, LA River Walk location only hire part time employees, which says your schedule will be flexible may change to the convenience of Store Manager, and supervisors, whom may not want to work on particular days, nights or weekends."
good,"Unfortunately, a lot depends of management... I had awesome years and others very discouraging. Changing fast accordingly with the new era, expecting more and more from associates, fast pace, same salary more responsibilities, less opportunity for bonus with the amount of discounts given to the customers...less salary..."
good,"The company is continually adding paperwork and responsibilities to the management workload without increasing either time or pay allowed."
good,"Chico's mission and guiding principles are a great foundation but the company lacks structure, consistency, and their upper management is very lackluster. They keep restructuring the company, laying people off and cannot abide by a structured calendar creating chaos across the company. There is not much career growth within the company and people tend to get stuck at the same level without any possibility of advancement."
good,Job advancement is scarce and the new Director in the DC is inexperienced in Change Management. Job security is non-existent and the culture is oppressive.
good,truly a great place to meet wonderful people. lots of work and fun at the same time. demanding competitive and enjoyable. where else can you shop everyday with someone else's $$
good,"A typical day at work consisted of opening shipments and steaming clothing. Once a month, we would change the floor sets."
good,"I loved my job when I first started  in 2011."
good,"There is not much room for advancement, however the job itself is fulfilling and fun."
good,"Don't get me wrong, the Chico's FAS brand is a great brand. It offers great products with good quality, and its a brand that truly want women of all ages and sizes to feel beautiful. However if you want advancement, you're VERY limited always a bunch of promises but not many come true."
good,"Lovely store, very salable merchandise, great location on El Paseo in Palm Desert, Ca.Compensation is an hourly base plus a generous bonus system. Store hours Monday -Saturday 10am-7pm Sunday 11am-6pm many shifts available. Very generous employee discount."
good,"Low pay "
good,"Started out with good management team. They were replaced when corporate team changed as well.  Now they are all over the place.  Associates are not valued  team members, it's become sale or be replaced  by a temp."
good,"The customer culture is something to be aware of. They tend to be significantly older (65+) and do not usually treat the workers respectfully. You are expected to wait on them, and I noticed older customers tend to need a lot more help, and sometimes treat you like a servant. The training is inadequate- and the CHARM system is so out of date. Its all on an IPAD.  Also, remember that this is a partly- commission based job- meaning it gets competitive and downright high-schoolish at times. Your co-workers will take your customers and it creates drama within the company. There's no sense of camaraderie since you're essentially competing for numbers. This is not a job where you can stand at a register. You really have to, at times, harass customers and are pressured to meet ridiculous numbers. If you're young, this might not be the right job for you. The employees tend to be significantly older too- meaning you won't make friends or enjoy your time there. But if you're older- and actually like the clothes, then work there. There is a decent employee discount. They are amazing at working around your hours, and the store is never busy. Had I researched the company beforehand- I would've reconsidered my employment. Work-life balance is great. If you like older people and sales-this is the place to be. Culture- not so much."
good,"Chico's is huge on customer service and displaying merchandise."
good,"best part is pay but just watch your own butt if they still have shar is still at the company she is the worse "
good,"Lots of pressure to sell from management. Difficult to make good commission with so many associates on schedule, particularly on weekends. Commision's policy was recently changed where returned merchandise goes against your bonus."
good,"I don't believe sales associates are compensated fair, not very good at knowing what they want to be or what they want to do, keep changing their sales plan and approach to customers. Manadgment is not always fair."
good,I loved working there.  Then there was a change at corporate level.  The family first and work/life balance seem to go away.  It became more impersonal.
good,"It's a job, but not a career. Everyday is different. There are a lot of tricks and shortcuts to make your job a little easier. Workforce management is very good about working with your schedule."
good,"The fun part of the job was meeting and helping customers.  Many customers were return visitors and would ask for my assistance.  If there were new arrival items that I thought would be of interest to my clients, I would call and encourage them to make an appointment to meet with me."
good,"The company lacked infrastructure and lost ground as leadership shifted in mid 2000."
good,"Never worked in a warehouse before, I was a returns coordinator, workplace culture was oppressive, hard work, management difficult. Loved data entry, best part of the job. Learned to get along with all types people, positions, etc.  Mandatory overtime was not enjoyable on weekends after working four 10 hr days a week, but we managed."
good,"Chicos is a great company for full time employees but as a part time person, it's only average as far as a retail employer. It's very physical and hours worked aren't predictable."
good,"I would come into work and be ridiculed on my attire, even though it followed all company guidelines and was completely professional. Then my manager would come into work wearing an almost identical outfit. I was told to purchase items from Chico's for each new collection or seasonal trend, which I absolutely could not afford. I was let go for not wearing Chico's-style clothing, even though I had purchased several articles of clothing and accessories specific to the demands of my manager and corporate. It was also made clear that another reason for my dismissal was an infraction against a customer that was not proven to be me. They refused to look at the video recording of the incident and assumed it couldn't have been my coworker, which it indeed was."
good,just working hard and long day. its an easy job. the breaks are decent and everybody comes there to do there job. We work hard and get good bonuses.
good,A typical day at work would include moving pallets and moving boxes. It was a distribution center. It was a blue collar job.
good,Never been in such a politcal environment where leadership is very selective about who they interact with. No common decency about them. Horrible experience!!!
good,"workload increased, but they won't hire more people"
good,Much pressure on quotas in many areas. More directives and ratings to negatively affect attitudes.
good,Love working with customers helping outfit them   Not enough hours for sales associates   6 managers on staff   They take up all the daytime hours nothing left for sales associates  5 to 10 hours a week
good,"I loved my clients and enjoyed my coworkers.  The amount of task work that was required within the store by staff on a daily basis while still being required to meet and exceed sales goals was excessive.  Scheduling hours allotted were not commiserate with the sales volume, but with the number of hours open for business and hindered the ability to adequately staff the store with anyone other than managers/assistant managers or sales leads."
good,"company always keeping employees at part-time except for Manager & Assistant manager. was told there were commissions, but you received 1% if the sale was $500.  how laughable was that!!   the former manager at time I worked 2017, was rather dishonest and tended to think everyone who came in were sales for her."
good,"No work life balance "
good,"Non-stop pace"
good,"Store Solution Center handled nonstop calls from non technical clients, salespersons, requiring technical issue resolution.  Repetitive nature of calls for ongoing non resolved, long term issues was the most difficult aspect."
good,Chico's FAS is a great women's clothing company. But is not what I want to continue doing. Work/life balance not the greatest. Looking for other job opportunities where I find like I'm making a diference.
good,"It is an ok place to work, it can be fun at times, the pay is low, and you have to work your way into better hours. I worked from 6pm to 2am for a year, and they didnt want to change my hours.  You have to apply to get a shift change and if you meet their standards to deserve one then you can get one.  I quit because i desperately needed a shift change but they would not grant me this request, and i just needed to find something else that would work for my family and my health needs."
good,"A typical day at work involves advising women on fashion choices.  Selling jewelry, shoes, fashion accessories and clothing."
good,The environment is nice. Reccomend only if you like retail. Is a slow pace job. Get bored easily. Get paid commission. Adavancement opportunities. Be ready to be creative
good,"Working for chico's was a great experience. My team that I supervised was amazing. We worked so well together we became a family. However, with the constant changing of management and the lack of communication from the higher ups, our team broke apart. I loved the experience I had with my team, I just wish that the company stuck to their motto of being a family, because the only family experience I had was with my team in the store."
good,"The customers are extremely needy, which there is no problem with but for how fast past this store is it just didn't work for me. The managers were okay, the co workers though, not nice at all. They were very fake. They were nice at first but that lasted about three days, then I couldn't even stand to be near them."
good,"What I admired the most about working for Chico's/Soma was that we train to have a very effective working environment, not just with the employees but with the customers. I always enjoyed working with my customers because we were trained to be different roles for our customers on the sales floor. The working environment really develops one to work as a team because although individual sales are looked at, the management team, including part time sales lead have a responsibility of raising everyone's capabilities of selling. "
good,"This was a good place to work for a call center. Fun colleagues, flexible hours, and not only paid holidays, but you can accrue a decent amount of time off. "
good,"The pay includes bonuses however associates are divided up supposedly by percentage so that associates who meet metrix are the ones who get all sales calls, while associates who do not meet the top twenty get all customer service calls.  This has divided the team spirit that Chicos supposedly encourages in the company.  This does not give the associates who take customer service any chance of getting on the top 20.  This is the typical day at work.  I have learned many new things about selling clothing, accessories and shoes.  The hardest part of the job is how associates are critiqued on phone calls as not everyone says the same exact things. The company has a script they want everyone to say the exact same thing.  The most enjoyable part is receiving calls from customers who appreciate you for a good job done!"
good,"I was with the company for three years and got promoted twice. I love the clothes and working with the customers, but my store had three different managers during my time. The current manager is why I left. She is controlling and takes all the sales. I spoke to the district manager but nothing was done."
good,I enjoyed working here but with the schedule I had I would not want to be stuck working these hours without any kind of options for flexible shift changes.
good,I have worked for Chicos for the past 7 years. It started out as a good company the first couple of years. I think when the economy changed it took a toll on the business and the different changes they made.
good,Overall working environment for me is good and I have a great manager. I have gained a tremendous amount of experience over the years.  Management in general various depending on the area you work in. Some areas have horrible schedules and poor work life balance. Morale is poor in light of multiple layoffs over the past three years and limited advancement opportunities.  People are not as friendly as in the past.
good,"The people are great and the discounts on clothes are awesome! Another great perk is the onsite gym that is available 24 hours 7 days a week. Lots of leadership changes which changes the culture often. Leadership ask for your feedback and input, but Director level does not utilize the input of their leadership team which would help offset pitfalls and increase morale."
good,"The customers are stubborn, they are mean, and they treat the employees like scum. Occasionally, there is a nice customer who makes you happy to be at work. Your fellow employees will try to steal your commissions and they will almost run you over to get to the customers first.  Long hours will little reward."
good,Nice store to work for as long one dresses more reflecting the store style pushing you to wear their clothing. Pressured into making numbers for the company to benefit while the employee doesn't get rewarded.
good,"I like working at Soma, but, I need to have a job that has more stability. I never know from one week to the next what hours I will be working, and so it is hard for me to make plans. Also, I was guaranteed 25 hours a week, and am not getting that many hours in most weeks, I don't particularly like working weekends and evenings, and my hourly pay is less than $10.00. I cannot afford to work for that. I have been paying for my own Health Insurance, and need to find a job where I can get benefits, or earn enough money so that I am able to keep my health insurance. I am very eager to find a position that I am qualified for, to do great job in, and to have more stability."
good,A typical day at Chico's consisted of signing in and a brief discussion about the days goals. I was able to obtain a firmer grasp on the workings and organization of the inventory rooms. My manager was always helpful when I had any questions about the work load or the way the company desired products displayed or promoted. My co-workers were very professional. The hardest part would have been when their was an influx of costumers while we had to hang and stock inventory. The most enjoyable part was the costumer interaction.
good,"The customers are what MAKE chico's! "
good,pretty good company to work for but they focus way too much attention on the passport members than they do other customers.
good,Company Expanding through acquisition and growing to Canada
good,People are great to work with but new people will get more hours then the people that have benn there for awhile and the manager cuts people's hours.
good,I have learned to face the current ups and downs of commission sales and keep smiling and stay professional.
good,"Great place to work if culture is what you want. However, your job can be changed based on executive team’s direction without notice, many employees have been let go once they have been promoted to management due to business doing poorly, and then over-hire after business picks back up only to lay-off again."
good,One of the fastest paced environments. Management keeps changing and until that settles be prepared for changes of direction. The company has a rich history and many good people.
good,The customers are the best part of the job. There is a lot of competition internally and sometimes you would give up a big sale to keep things peaceful between your coworkers.
good,"Chico's is a wonderful company with amazing products but there is way too much to be responsible for NO pay! The expectations seem almost unreal. The schedule is terrible, you can't maintain enough hours to make a decent check in CA."
good,You were told to keep pushing clothes at customers until they said no. Management stole sales and email captures. Otherwise pretty nice coworkers as long as they didn't steal your sales.
good,"Throughout time Chico's moved from being an entrepreneurial company to a true business.  A part of that was a necessity as it grew but this was also, in my opinion, where they lost their way.  They became focused on the shareholders and lost sight of where they came from and therefore their customers."
good,"Fun place but the management is not rewarding. Education level is down. Of course, there might not always be money for a raise, and the salary is not competitive (Very low) .Flexibility in the team structure for a promotion based on who you know"
good,"The atmosphere when you first come to this job is appealing, but after being here for a few months I can tell you that everyone is after everyone. you take a sale by accident you won't hear the end of it. when you do better than another coworker in sales you will get hated. its sad"
good,Managers lacked the ability to mentor associates and showed a lack of respect to reports. 
good,Loved the associates I worked with but in the company I wasn't seeing any growth in my future in this company. I learned my visual skills. The hardest part of the job is when you have too many staff on the floor and your fighting for clients.
good,Low stress high energy job. you need to be self motivated or you will not do well.  Hardest part is dealing with the constantly changing management.Each new manager comes in with a different agenda.  Hard to advance.
good,"Chico's is a good place to work if you enjoy fashion and helping others creative a look or build their wardrobe. Sales assistants are expected to offer the type of customer service expected in high fashion boutiques, you are more or less the customers personal shopper. You are expected to develop personal relationships with customers and are given very specific financial goals to reach on any given day or week."
good,"The job would have been a great place to work if the management was more understandable when it came to production. They always require a 100% for production with no work , which was hard to reach because work was low."
good,"Chico's is a high touch retailer that bases its competitive strategy on the quality of the customer experience.  Customer surveys are always welcomed so that store personnel can improve or change.  Until recently, the surveys provided a basis for discussion for any compliment or improvement or coaching opportunity.  Recently, management in the south indicated that if a customer survey was negative, the employee will be terminated in no uncertain terms.  It is rather amazing to me that any corporate manager would threaten anything like this.  It certainly makes for a hostile work place environment.  I questioned whether or not the manager stated the termination clause as presented and the answer was ""yes"".  Unacceptable."
good,Job is a great warehouse job. Steel toes were not required and pay was beyond low. The schedule is great for a warehouse job. EVery weekend off. Work is easy but also tedious.
good,It was ok the job was nice management did very little to make me feel comfortable also they wouldn't understand life problems but over all it was nice.
good,A nice place to work with great weather and lots of nice benefits - hard work however and isolated in fort myers - not many cultural choices there and everyone knows everyone else
good,I enjoyed working with the customers and staff.  The hardest part of the job is standing and walking for up to 8-10 hour days.
good,"Chicos FAS has an unique culture that promotes entrepreneurial skills, creativity, & customer first mentality.  However, their systems are archaic for today's retail standards causing more re-work.  Work life balance is problem due to this as well as lack of leadership vision to continue to move forward.  While the customer is great to service, leadership brings down morale."
good,"Chicos is a great place to work and grow with, mostly all of the dept. are small and pretty tought to atvance.  The work is not hard at all and the majority of the workers are very friendly. I'm looking very closely into getting by into Electronics."
good,"I am on the phone for 95% of the day,. The most enjoyable part of the job are the people I meet over the phone. I have wonderful co-workers and most will help each other in any way possible. Management is not as supportive as they once were but the people who work there have great personalities. Chicos use to be a great place to work, grow and play but things have changed."
good,"Open/Close functions"
good,Work starts after exercise and a review of the goals for the day. It can be very fast paced when the workload is heavy. The staff must learn to adjust to each task as it becomes necessary. Management has definitely changed over the years and there has been a lot of changes with the company as sales have fluctuated. It has been a joy to work with many different types of people from different backgrounds.
good,"A typical day at work would involve customer interaction, which I love. Working hard to meet sales goal, which is sometimes difficult only due to the amount of traffic in and out of the store. Working with Chico's has shown me a way to interact with the customer to ensure they're comfortability. My co-workers are very easy going and also hard working, very enjoyable group to work with. Management team is good, but could be better. Most enjoyable part is interacting with our regular customers."
good,Chico's was a place where productivity mattered also we weren't paid based on productivity it had a major part in our employment.
good,"This is a good company to work for if you are a young female who wants to get away from the cold weather up north. The work life balance could be better as many salaried employees are expected to work 50+ hours per week. There are many benefits that the company offers female employees, but very little for males. Men encompass roughly 15% of the employees at the corporate headquarters, so you must be tolerant of the female fashion market no matter what department you work in."
good,I work From 7 to 530 with a pay of 8 an hour work only on weekends
good,Most enjoyable was my customers and staff. Learned lots about slim secrets to help create a amazing look on customers. Hardest part was not agreeing with the values.
good,"Initially a fun and rewarding place to work. I absolutely loved and supported the company . The culture of the company began changing spring 2012, leading to more aggressive selling strategies that lead to a very cut-throat and competitive atmosphere. The change in DSM and SM in the outlet district during this time also created a toxic and negative environment. Hardest part of job was making sales goals that focused primarily on Bonus selling, which caused a lot of sale 'stealing' and nasty behaviors amongst sales associates. Mgmt seemed to encourage this behavior by focusing on their personal Bonus goals and not managing store operations."
good,My issue with Chicos is the lack of accountability in management and the lack of consideration for contact center employees.   With the continually changing upper management there is no sense of stability.
good,"Lovely women's clothing and accessory boutique where customers expected more personalized service than they received in other larger department stores.  Chico's customers are VERY loyal.  Though we were not always staffed appropriately to provide the ""Most Amazing Personal Service"", we would bend over backwards to do what we could.  We were encouraged to build a clientele and to set up appointments in order to give the customer more attention. If you enjoy sales and it comes naturally to you, this job is for you! There are daily sales quotas which are a high priority especially toward the end of the month.   You have an hourly wage and then your sales are commission based after reaching a certain $ amount PER sale.  Retail has changed so much over the last year.  It seems that Chico's stores have evolved into return and fulfillment centers because of the ease of online purchasing. Quite a bit of your day involves processing returns, phone orders, online orders and also restocking. You can not depend on consistent days or hours, and you need to have a very flexible schedule to get good hours and also be willing to work some nights and weekends. Schedules are made 2 weeks in advance, no further. There is no extra staff to fill in for you if you get sick. The other employees, who are stretched to the max, are expected to fill in. On a positive note, I really did enjoy working with my coworkers, the store manager always treated me fairly, but I was disappointed in the overall management style of the store and especially the company.  After almost 3 years, I decided this was not"
good,"Chico's was my first experience as retail. "
good,"Chico's fashions are whimsy and fun. There is a good customer base who love their clothes and are loyal shoppers. Sales in the store can be great. A typical work day is fun. I learned how to engage with customers and be unafraid to greet strangers. Workplace culture is upbeat. Hardest part of the job is assessing customers' style so you help them the best. Also, in retail and a small store, it's sometimes hard to get a break and pay is not the best. Overall though, it is a fun job if you need a little extra cash and you get a good discount on clothes."
good,I believe the company underpays their employees. It was difficult to bonus due to coupons offered to customers by Chico’s. I originally accepted the job offer because I had retired fro FedEx after 28 years and felt the need to go back to work.
good,"This job is basic temporary. The company is a good company to work for if you can get on permanent. The pay is a little low. But the work is easy, a little fast paced especially through Christmas."
good,The company had unreasonable accounting around driving email among their customers. Customers whom are at the baby boomers age who don't want you to email or have their personal information. The dm lied and was dishonest they are about them selves not about their people
good,"A typical day is fast paced, can be a fun place to work.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the manager and co-workers. I enjoyed meeting new people/customers and seeing them return to the store.   I learned a lot about management and trust."
good,Friendly place to work but pay is not compensatory to duties and very limited advancement. The atmosphere is more relaxed than most call centers and they provide excellent and extensive training.
good,"The company has left it's core competency and lacks direction. The focus is clearly on the stock value and not on company performance. In the past the company cared about people, process, and products. Now  the upper management only cares about their bonuses which are based on short term goals."
good,management is ok  as long as you are there to do your job its an ok place to work long periods of stand and walking but you do get 3 brakes in between day
good,"Chico's is a great stepping stone job if you're freshly out of high school or if you're looking to retire soon. If you want a career from this company, it's little to no room to grow."
good,"The job doesn't offer a lot of hours, so it's not somewhere you can make a living. Managers are given too many hours, and associates are offered hardly anything. Also not a great environment for young people to work."
good,"typical day at work includes customer interaction to provide styling and wardrobing, secrets to clients to provide most excellent shopping experience."
good,"Everyday brought new laughs and challenges. There was always something exciting going on and new customers to help. It was hard to get all of the operations tasks done each day due to the amount of traffic coming into the store. "
good,"The temp associates were not around when needed."
good,"Took inbound calls from store personnel requiring assistance in troubleshooting hardware and software issues within the store."
good,"Start the day out with opening and daily,weekly, monthly and yearly numbers.  Banking, mail, emails.  Customer service is big in my world.  I treat each and every customer as a friend and family member.  I let each on know how important they are and that I am there for them."
good,"Typical day was full of operational duties. From then on main focus was delivering superior customer service and finding creative ways to grow clientele. Lack of support from upper management."
good,"I loved my coworkers and loved working with customers. The pay is to low for anyone (except management, and they are low compared to other retailers) to live on. During the season, you are busy and it's great. Off season, if u are part time, they will give u about 10 hours a week. You have to wear their clothes and they have to be the current seasons colors, so stick with a lot of black or buy new clothes each season. They are very generous with their employee discounts. They pressure you about sales goals but it's hard to sell in off season when there aren't many customers. Your commissions are based on each individual sale and not overall sales for the day, so one customer needs to spend over 600$ for any kind of decent commission, but if I have 20 customers who all spend 200, I wouldn't get a commission. They talk about advancing you into management positions but then end up hiring from outside."
good,"A typical day at work included quick janitorial tasks, inventory and re-stocking sales floors, markdowns and promotional racks and signage, greeting customers, maintaining clientele book, dressing and wardrobing the clients, phone call campaigns to promote special store events and sales, cash wrap and register.  The most difficult part of any sales job and the best part of any sales job is closing the sale in such a way that both the customer and management is happy.  If you can do that, it is a successful sale and work day.  Sales training is comprehensive.  Incentives and discounts are a plus."
good,Good atmosphere and work/ life balance. Unfortunately the pay is relatively low.
good,"I would hard to show myself to earn more hours also I ask for help when I needed or to understand what needs to get done. "
good,"A typical day at work included processing new shipment and then either filling it on the floor or back stocking it.  Also some time is put into general organization of the stockroom as well support of the floor through cashiering, recovery, and answering customer and employee questions most often concerning available inventory.  I enjoy almost all of my coworkers very much including the management team.  However there is often confusion and disagreement among managers making it difficult for employees to efficiently complete their jobs."
good,"A typical day at work:  As an assistant manager, one has to be well versed in the area of multi-tasking.  This includes managing the overall daily business as well as personally providing 100% excellent customer service."
good,I quit after 6 months because a couple of managers were too frustrating to work with and abused their job position. The other managers though were sweethearts and helped me get through working there.
good,"I enjoyed working with most of the employees and the store manager. Company is customer focused and has a very loyal base.  There are commission opportunities if you can build a large clientele, but the constant price reductions make it difficult to earn much.  Did not think the corporate managers who visited the store on occasion understood the needs of the employees who work very hard to make the business a success - but I suppose that is typical.  All in all, I just got tired of retail and working some evenings and weekends."
good,"Chicos is a nice establishment to work at. If you enjoy sales, you will enjoy this position. The pay is part hourly/ part commission, so the more you sell the more you make."
good,"Reviewing company communication and product.  The hardest part is not  buying all the clothes you like.  It was enjoyable meeting new people everyday, however it was nice building relationships with regular customers."
good,The work is mainly sale driven. Good knowledge of clothes and style can be helpful at workplace. Customer service is first important.  Employees need to follow policy.
good,Wonderful staff of Sales Associates.  Need to enhance management  skills.   Earlier schedules would be helpful for family planning. Off season hours are very slow.
good,Chicos is a good company to work for. Company is moving towards a more corporate environment from a small business mindset. The facilities in Georgia a very good.
good,"this place is a nice place to be, the employees are nice and the store manager works with your needs. The customers are also very friendly and are very personal."
good,"They have an excellent fashion for the more mature woman."
good,Liked working with customers and doing store sets. Enjoyed helping people find clothes that looked and felt good on.   Good quality in jewelry. Clothes seem to be tailored for older people.
good,"Assisting customer service to everyone who visits the store."
good,"Chico's fashions are whimsy and fun. There is a good customer base who love their clothes and are loyal shoppers. Sales in the store can be great. A typical work day is fun. I learned how to engage with customers and be unafraid to greet strangers. Workplace culture is upbeat. Hardest part of the job is assessing customers' style so you help them the best. Also, in retail and a small store, it's sometimes hard to get a break and pay is not the best. Overall though, it is a fun job if you need a little extra cash and you get a good discount on clothes."
good,Chico's was fun helping women purchase items that looked good on them and giving the best customer service that I could. The draw back was that it was hard to make any money because everyday would be some kind of sale going on.
good,"I work with wonderful people but I cannot make enough to live working at Chico's.  The only way to work full time is to be in management.  Hourly wages are low, even for assistant managers.  Bonuses can be difficult to earn.  I could have 25 sales in a day and not early a penny in bonus if none of my sales are over $149.00.  Also, the amount of bonus is ridiculously small compared to the amount of work that goes into getting it.  Also, I was not made aware of any benefits for part time employees except the employee discount for clothes."
good,Chico's was a fun place to work but in no way would it pay the bills. Very minimal hours and outrageous demands - the clothing was expensive and I was making $8 an hour and couldn't afford to wear the product and pay my bills.
good,"stressful at times...although it is customer based, give in too much and the customer scream and get upset even if you try to help them in the best decisions."
good,I had a great time working at Chico's. I learned much about sales and increasing sales. The hardest part of the job was when I did not make any sales.
good,"Very challenging running, staffing, & merchandising 2 of their top stores in tourist destination w/ lack of upper management support.  I loved those that worked for me and clothes were great quality"
good,"I worked at Chico's as a vendor, as part of an integration program that the company provided. I believe the program could use some improvement, as it did not feel like an integration but rather a way for their vendors to do the data-entry work that they did not want to do."
good,"Open store. County money.  Could boxes, and begin opening stock, check store for cleanliness, etc.  Do morning paperwork which took about 20 minutes.  Talk to staff."
good,This is a fun place to work with nice people. Management was great to work for and was easy to work around my schedule. The pay is not great though and I would recommend Chico's raising their pay.
good,"I left because some of the women were too greedy. Otherwise I enjoyed the work and working with the women customers and suggesting outfits to fit them. My manager, Ann, was super. I learned never to work another job on commission with other women."
good,"Ok place to work, but if working 12 hrs a day, need to have better pay. Other  then that it is a ideal job for someone just starting out, or a high school graduate."
good,Nice management and co workers some opportunity for advancement would recommend to others good place to work but would prefer full time employment. Good experience.
good,"working at a smaller, newer location, it was very slow paced and you only work with a handful of women. with that, hopefully you click with them otherwise it can make for a long day."
good,All jobs have pros and cons.  If you are in a niche field like security there is very little upward mobility.  The biggest positive is that you work 30 minutes from the beach.
good,I got a chance to build relationship with my customers.  They would recommend me to their friends and family because of my style expertise and customer service.
good,"Busy and OK Fast pace,Big place. Call Center in Winder Georgia. The customers were fun to work with and very demanding. There was always something to do"
good,"4 hrs. a day, to address customers wants/ then build a sale, well enough, I like to dress that way, nothing, its fun to dress a person from top to bottom."
good,"i needed a job, and got lucky to work here. helped customers, stocked shelves and made displays. nothing strenuous about this particular job. just be good with customer service"
good,Positive fun place to work if you don't have serious career aspirations and need a good part time job with employee discount. Fun to sell what you love to wear! Great clothes!
good,Very structured in daily operations. Required to wear and purchase their brand of clothes and accessories. Not current in fashion trends. Great associates.
good,"Most enjoyable part was helping the customers find the perfect outfit for vacation, wedding or just getting a new pair of jeans."
good,"A slow on ocations but interesting customers and attention to detail is requiered wich I posses, my sales are always the highest and styling customers is the best part of the job"
good,"Chico's is a great place to work...at first.  After several years working there, the company has been unable to get past their horrible communication skills, lack of interdepartmental cooperation, low pay and low staff development, and flagging corporate culture.  Nothing changes, no matter who is laid off or who steps in."
good,"My job was very low key and not challenging. I liked my manager and team members, but I was not given much meaningful work which made the day go by slowly and drag on. I left after 1 year. The campus was very nice, but living in Fort Myers was not for me. Nothing to do for a young person out of college unless you like drinking at Lani Kai with Ft Myers Beach locals. Not for everyone."
good,I only worked at Chico's for a short time. It was convenient & close to home. I did get a discount on their clothing but it really wasn't that great because we could pretty much only wear their clothing & accessories! the pay wasn't good either unless you made A LOT of sales.
good,the micromanaging and the demands to get things done with a small staff were close to impossible. certain tasks could not be done at certain times but it was the only time that staff was able to do it. i learned much about how to manage and take care of situations.
good,This was my least favorite job because the location I worked at was very unorganized and everybody wanted to be the boss.  Even though I did love the job I still worked it until I got laidoff.
good,... Its ok for part time work around the holidays. Just make sure you sell alot and everything will be ok. The staff was nice.
good,"The Corporate are never satisfied with managements on how the store looks. The previous store manager work to hard to get the store back in shape. But seems like nobody in the Corporate office cared how much the Manager's try to change the store to make the right. After all the they work there hardest to clean up the mess of the Manager before this previous manager. Corporate has not appreciate her in ways now she no longer a store manager cause corporate never saw how much she try. well it was fun been there also the only reason why I go back. Now no longer, I hope they gave her the best pay rate also give her a good benefit."
good,"Limited hours for Sales leads, but overall great place to work. Nice staff and customers and great company to work for overall! The company gas a great sales reputation and stands up to it. I was very happy here, just need more hours."
good,How to take on multiple task at a high percentage rate.Bring a good attitude to work everyday. Work hard with quality and efficient work.
good,"Identify, develop, or evaluate marketing strategy, based on knowledge of establishment objectives, market characteristics, and cost and markup factors."
good,"Loved this job! Taught me a lot about work ethics! Developed great customer service skills, Great management and employees. Developed great people skills"
good,"While employed in this position, I learned how to organize clothing in the back room, and where to find it if it was needed on the floor. I would sometimes have to go out onto the floor and check certain parts of the store to see if there were any pieces of clothing that needed to be brought out."
good,Chico's FAS is a pretty fast paced work environment. The employees are a joy to be around and also is the management. I have learned almost every aspect in their distribution center. I have learned to work their operating system which is AS400 and ICW. The most difficult part of the job is just switching from department to department. The easiest part of the job is pretty much all of the work that is assigned.
good,"A typical shift was usually about 4 hours. During this time, I was responsible for selling as much merchandise as possible, with bonus incentives. We were supposed to keep and continually update a client book, which we would use to cold call people and ask them to come in. However, this system had some major flaws as the city was not big enough for this type of sales. Senior staff had books full of ""usual"" customers, so new staff typically could not get any clients to return to the store. "
good,"Beautiful place to work for. It's retail so life balance is tough during the holidays.  My store closed with little warning only reason I listed low, company has great potential."
good,Good place to work. Great location and products. Upscale retail boutique. Great quality apparel. I've worked there for five years and I'm the top sales associate.
good,"Must get busy at all times in helping customers in assisting all customers in putting up outfits for any occasion. Manager needs more customer's people skills. Co-workers are very nice, they love to work together as a team with a exception of the third key manager. Hardest part of the job was not getting enough hours. Enjoyed earning bonuses as long as I had a great sale."
good,"Overall great place to work.  "
good,every 3 days 12 hour shifts. managers expect more everyday. even if you exceed the last days productivity.
good,"Great employee discounts, great customers, great customer service philosophy, the upper management lacks structure."
good,Good Company still growing. Good people and management. A little unorganized but a fun place to work. Pay is not what it should be due to being a distribution center. Hardest part of job is ten hours on concrete floors. Best part of job is steady work and the people.
good,"Fast paced, friendly environment that let's you build a rapport with your costumers. Pay isn't great, but if you have enough sales it makes up for the lower hourly wage. "
good,"working at Chico's FAS was enjoyable- although, it was my first management position, i worked with some of the greatest employees. The customers were a blast to work with!"
good,"I love the job, and the hours. the employees were good also. The management was good."
good,"I learned to monitor opening and closing of cash registers and accounts. I deal with daily sales operations and monitoring the daily, weekly and monthly sales. I organize and arrange store merchandise to coordinate with corporate designs of store settings. Customer service is a huge part of the job and I deal with several customer and clients issues each day. Resolving these issues is a fun challenging part of my job yet it can also be the most difficult task."
good,"I would arrive at my scheduled time and clock in on the computer. On Saturday mornings I would deposit the cash, checks and credit card payments we received the day before. Clean everything up so it looked nice for the customers. Management was great and so were the co-workers. The hardest part was putting all the cloths back after they were tried on. Also difficult to keep clothing folded and in nice stacks. People would just go through the clothes like you wouldn't believe. The most enjoyable part of the job was to put a whold outfit together for some one."
good,"Since I'm much younger than the target demographic of CHICOs, it made it difficult to be enthusiastic about the products and give recommendations to customers. The target demographic is women 45 and older, so people that age range would probably enjoy working there more. But for younger people, I'd recommend working elsewhere. The discount is fine but I rarely used it."
good,Every year you would get less but have to produce more. Live in constant fear of missing an unobtainable goal. Management does not a firm grasp at what goes on at store level
good,"My overall review would be that the job was good for a starter job but the pay was low. the enviorment was good , management was also .customers traveled from all over the world to the Chico's I worked and it was fun meeting new faces."
good,"Fun work environment, fun co workers and management. Great learning experience for a first job. Minimum wage plus commission. Have to be outgoing to make sure you meet sales. Overall good work environment."
good,Not the most relaxing work environment. Great discounts and lot of fun with the customers. Often felt micro managed and had to do the same to my employees.
good,"The people who generally shop there are extremely ""entitled"" individuals-- and they will throw it in your face. I am unfortunately biased on this particular thing as I have little patience for persons who will turn their nose up at anything and everything. Most of the coworkers are friendly enough, though a majority of them are in their late 40's and up-- this makes for competitive business and a lot of back work for the younger associates who the workload gets shifted onto. On too many occasions do the associates become cut-throat with each other and forget to separate business with personal since the work is able to be commissioned. They then sulk in their duties and don't really interact with the clientele properly (i.e.- becoming snappy with them or dismissive), or they are stood chatting away among themselves and just wave a hand at a new walk-in."
good,Chico's Fas. is a good place to work. My co-workers are great and we have fun when working.  Not real stressful. No pay increases are given these days.  Management works well with the employees.
good,Not much support from upper management.  In store atmosphere is usually fun.  Creative environment.  Enjoyable to work with women and fashion.  Low  pay with minimal if any raises.
good,I liked the ob however it was difficult you never can take a break or sit down at all furring your shift. the culture of the job is definitely WHBM is the most important thing bar none and there is a great deal of gossip that goes on and try as you might to stay out of it you might find your self in the middle if you don' t play a part. When my father died I was expected to get over it. Oh and if we didnt make quota the boss called us at home and tried to get us to come in and buy things. Even if we told her that we were trying to save money. it put us in an uncomfortable position. then there were other days that it was like family. Hard to stay and hard to leave.
good,"Serves a very loyal customer base, friendly environment. Management role very simple and basic.  Wonderful staff, very friendly.  Great sales spiffs and very motivational crew.  Very competitive, yet everyone gets along great.  Would recommend."
good,I was the music appreciation teacher. I learned how to communicate with middle school students on their level and was successful. The admin was supportive but this was a new elective for the students so I had to really create the program myself. Hardest part of the job was working with students of a lower socioeconomic status and really learning what their life is like and how it differed from mine. Reactions and behavior plans had to be well thought out as to not create a situation were they never wanted to come to school. Trust and compassion were the biggest lesson I learned. Most enjoyable aspect of the job was I made a difference in these kids lives.
good,It was a fun and passionate workplace environment that rewarded employees who reached their incentives. I enjoyed following through with difficult and challenging taks.
good,"A typical day is deal with customers some are nice and some aren't. "
good,"A typical day at work, might include opening or closing registers. Opening or closing the store. Greeting each customer as they entered the store. I learned that I really loved working as a team, with many fantastic co-workers. We were like a family. Management would change a lot, so we got used to change when necessary. The hardest part of the job was very heavy lifting, when it became necessary to do so. My absolute most enjoyable part of the job was meeting, and helping people I a fast paced environment. I enjoyed talking and resolving any concerns a co-worker, or customer might have. Finding solutions, is very satisfying to me."
good,Working at Chico's opened my eyes to a different world. Going fromkids cloths to womens was a bit of a change. I did enjoy the job. The staff I had were great. They would get the job done on a timley and organized fashion.
good,It's a great company to work for but the pay is terrible. And the HR people wonder why they can't retain people.
good,Company Growth has been tremendous in the last few years
good,A great place to work if you have been out of work for a while or have gaps in you resume. Not really a long time job. I would not recommend making a career out of this job. It's a great job for getting on your feet.  Not great pay for the work you are expected to do.
good,"For most parts of the organization, it is a good culture.  There are nice amenities on the campus and a good work / life balance.  It is a corporate environment so expect all that comes with that."
good,"lots of training,you learn many different areas of the company.need to work on doing more for the employees.like making it more of a fun place t work."
good,"I loved Chicos. Unfortunately, the work environment drastically changed.  Which changed to tone and culture. No one appeared to be happy anymore.  Prior to the change,  the company was simply awesome!"
good,"Chico's is a nice environment to work compared to a Marshall's which is on a different size scale. This particular store size was great, for the summer hours you always left before 10pm. As a style expert, you just catered to your client, their likes/dislikes, and creating a great experience for those customers."
good,"As of writing this there is no front end framework/build system its monolithic JS. Its good for a beginner job. "
good,"While showing exemplary sales performance and service goals met, I fell victim to poor manangement. Initial growth and promotion to assistant manager in 3 months until manager realized I would be relocating. Held a personal grudge and gave me a poor reference for having to relocate due to husbands job transfer. Really sad. Loved my co-workers and the company. I would work there again but never under the manager that hired me."
good,An open variety of people with a varity of personalities liked when the customer left the conversation feeling at ease of how we left the conversation.
good,Chico's FAS has beautiful clothes and I enjoyed the perks invovled in working there.  I was able to learn Border Free Orders and assisted customers from around the world.
good,"Was a place to grow."
good,"A typical work day consisted of replenishing of inventory to the work floor from stock and dressing rooms.   Straightening and folding clothes, assembling floor displays and wall displays, answering phones, and routine cleaning."
good,"The main focus of your job was to help customers with their clothing purchase. The more you sold, the higher your commission. Basically you walk around the store making sure the customers are helped at all times. You assist customers to the dressing room and even offer advice to add accessories if need be. When they are ready to check out, you escort them to the cash register and check them out. You always ask if they want to sign up for emailed coupons and the store credit card. If they accepted, that's another small bonus for you. At the end of the night, you made sure that the floor was swept and all clothes were hung up "
good,I've had a 50/50 experience here. Sometimes the hours are good & stable and other times not so much. District puts a lot of stress on management which in turn makes them be tense with us. Not saying this is the case with all Chico's just my personal experience.
good,Nice retail store to work for. Sometimes cut into work/life balance
good,Great merchandise and wonderful customer service values . Great compensation.
good,"The company has come a long way on the technology front. New computers; new stores; new aquisitions for the company, but no consideration for store employees who all took pay cuts across the board when the economy took a turn for the worst."
good,"I worked for this company for 5 years as a full time assistant manager and was promoted to a higher volume store.  They did not  compensate me but I was lured by the sales volume of this store and the possibilities of store bonus."
good,"I love working with our clientele, doing sales/register/displays and  organizing.  I have worked for nearly 13 years and have seen the company change from caring about their with a good commission rate to a company less organized and not able to hold on to their employees."
good,The Chico's culture and product has changed much over my years at the company. They have tried to change their target audience and product but seem to be upsetting the core customers.  The product quality has changed and they do not carry the range of products the customer is looking for. The boutique has too many events and promos which makes the customer more of a bargain hunter.
good,"I enjoy the ability to maintain a healthy workplace balance however I did not feel professionally challenged on this job.  I was able to learn a new level of providing customer service and providing my customers with what they needed was satisfying.  "
good,The internship was for three months and you will receive compensation. I came from the front line and was excited to be within meetings with leaders that make major decision that would effect the over business. I chatted and learned so many thing from great leader.
good,"the new CEO will run this business to the ground very soon. but its stable the bonus is excellent and the pay is average, no real advancing though. the holiday season is hectic."
good,"I enjoyed the whole time I worked there, unfortunately I had to leave because I was unable to maintain a standard of living with the pay and hours provided. If I would have been able to provide for myself better, I would have loved to stay. Everyone who worked there treated me like family, and it was always an enjoyable experience."
good,great place to work if like like meeting new people daily and are up for a challenge. Fast pace environment with great clothing for the everyday woman.
good,"Post daily goals, keeping store in presentation state at all times,  gave sales meetings and worked to increasing individual sales and boost overall sales of store.  "
good,"When I started out, I absolutely loved my team until I transferred to different location. "
good,"The company provided good benefits, flexible hours, and a fun environment to work in. I enjoyed my time there especially because of my co-workers who put in effort every single shift and us being able to work as a team. The clientele is okay, they can be difficult, but definitely manageable. Professional company that does give back and shows customers appreciation through coupons/deals and follow up phone calls/emails. The styles are really nice as well and anyone can really shop at Chico's."
good,My job in to make sur we get mamaum prroduction in the time the employes clock in intill they clock out
good,I loved working at Chico’s! Loved my coworkers. They made so fun to come to work. If I had the opportunity I would love to go back and work. It was a great job overall.
good,i loved a lot about this company and job. I mainly love the customer base and the co workers i had. upper management went downhill once CEO changed. I left when a lot of changes where being made due to not liking the culture that was beginning to form. They also do not pay
good,"It is a fun place to work, fast pace easy going never boring, some of the employees are fun to work with"
good,"Diverse customers to wardrobe"
good,"Overall an ok company to work for.  Their problems are the same as all retail; poor pay, poor scheduling, over scheduling...  "
good,I have over 20 years of experience ranging from medical records to retail management.  I am always willing to learn more and advance my experience. I am a team worker and work well with others.
good,The company was great to work for.  I went as far as i could position wise. They were not helpful with scheduling. i am a single mother and could not get help in changing my schedrule so i could sign my son up for karate.
good,Complete computer training prior to start of shift. Take clothing out of boxes if needed and place out on floor ready for sale.  Attend to customer needs and assist in apparel selections. Trained to be a style expert. Go backs had to be constantly put away.  Performed cashier and point of sale responsibilities. Loved helping people and the people I worked with.
good,"As a part time manager, you are expected to work as hard as a full time manager.  Responsibilities are very much the same; however, you do not make the same kind of bonuses.  The company ask a lot from any one.  Every week, there are goals to be met, contests to be completed, challenges to be tackled, phone calls and other tasks to be completed within a certain amount of time, it's a lot to be able to handle for any one, especially when the main requirement is to help the customer!"
good,With my first boss I was treated great at first and had a lot of hours. Then it changed to her treating me with no respect and only 1 day a week always a Saturday. The new boss that I received right before I left seemed very nice and treated me with respect. I had fun working here besides the first boss.
good,The company overall was a good experience and customers were the best part of my day.  Typical days were busy with new merch being put out and changing around all the products.  Never met the region manager and very rarely had interaction with corporate.
good,"Although the work is rewarding and easy enough to do, employees that aren't managers are only given 4 hours a week, if we're lucky. The managers constantly steal my sales, under the guise of ""helping me learn the register"". There is no training outside of the computer training, yet you are fully expected to know everything already. Most of the employees are incredibly kind. The customers, at least in my location, are all incredibly kind and understanding; they walk into the store to have fun, and everyone is fun to talk to."
good,"Fast-paced environment, yet fun and organized. The customers were happy and managers always made the work interesting and personable"
good,Loved what I did. Top part time sales associate in sales. Manager harrassed me for years. Could not work with her anymore. Never thought I would ever leave Chicos.  Had great customer service. My customers loved shopping with my assistance.
good,"Great company, No payroll and the company wants very personalized service but you still had to get all takes completed daily. complcompleted.ddone.Mostly 2 employees on"
good,High end women's fashion boutique.  Position was part time and worked with a great crew.  Shift required standing for 4-6 hours with 30 minute lunch break.  My least favorite was the rotating of the hours as I prefer a set schedule
good,"This is a small boutique like store in an outlet mall. There are classic, fun, and quirky styles in this store. It's fun to style customers. "
good,"The campus is a great campus to work at with a great atmosphere Overall . Three cafes, bikes, on site store, and some other services. Very Hire and Fire for contractors. If you're an internal employee they keep you around, but I've seen many contractors taken for two weeks and then fired again. They don't care."
good,We strive at Chico''s for unparalled customer service for all our customers. We have a great working environment in which we are all part of a team to help each other and our customers.
good,Fun place to work. Fast paced and good experience with all kind of customers. Very diverse clients. More advanced in age. Clean place to work at. Would recommend
good,"not sure I would want to go back to Chico's...they micro manage adult women and it's not necessary.  Overall a decent company to work for--but you get stuck in one position and it is hard to move up the ranks if you want to make this your career."
good,"Good experience while learning the retail end; nice environment to work in; had complete restructuring of the upper and middle management and took complete turn of structure for the company.  Which, apparently, has worked well for them."
good,"Chico's has a great culture of customer service and great training materials."
good,"work is fairy easy, extremely repetitive. One of those: Too many Chiefs, not enough Indians Jobs. Disgruntled coworkers can often make the work day seem forever, with the constant complaining. Although you can sympathize with them."
good,I personally manage a great team at our store.  We are all team players and greatly value our customers.  Style and fashion is one of my passions and ensuring the store makes plan.  Chicos does support their employees with many training videos that assist all associates.  I love the visual side of my position and this is reflected in the exceptional appearance of our store.
good,"Nice place to work at, the clothes a beautiful and well made. Worked from open till five on the week days and closed on the weekends. Very sales goal driven, and the staff is very competive to each other. Always had to greet every person that walked in, and keep asking if they need help if they were just browsing and try to offer them help on what you think they would like. Too much cold calling the customers. "
good,"Overall, a good place to work for retail, good discounts on clothing, opportunities to lean and grow new skills, lots of different customer service experiences"
good,"Great company. I enjoyed my time there.. . Lots of special discounts.. wonderful customers, fun 'fellow' associates! Management was young and inexperienced. Didn't understand the importance of customer and providing strong service.. stayed in the back room too much, including upper management!!"
good,The job is enjoyable for the most part. Entire tram here's along and is supportive. The only downside is the lack of increases. You wait over a year basically you only be given between 25 to maybe 50 cents per hour. Definitely not enough to match the cost of living.  It's in fact barely noticeable at the end of the week.
good,"Customer service is priority #1 all operational tasks would stop as the store would get busy. The morning ritual would be to process new shipments to the floor prior to the store opening, opening registers if you were assigned to complete the schedule this also would be part of the morning tasks. Each associate would have a sales plan for the day and would be discussed to each employee before each shift. The challenging part of the job with a specialty store verses and larger corporation would be sick calls and replacing them however the store I was working at the team worked together and call outs were easily replaced. The most enjoyable part of this particular job was the customers interacting with the employees by that I mean finding the appropriate outfits for each customer based on information shared by the customer. What I learned from management in this job was how to manage operational and selling goals to ensure I would meet and or exceed my daily and weekly goal."
good,Working at Chico's was a lot of fun. I never intended to stay in retail but the company takes care of all of its employees. Provided opportunity for advancement.
good,"apparently you must use one hundred fifty character minimum to write a  review, when updating a resume, so this is that is what this, chatter until 150 characters are met."
good,"I was a sales associate who worked at Chico's prior to holidays that usually require sales staff to work constantly in order to make the most of a sales season."
good,It's a nice place to work if you are in a compromised position. Hours are reasonable and can be flexible. Wouldn't recommend as a career. Pay is minimum wage with a chance at bonuses.
good,"I worked as a  Manager assistant  which was demanding a lot of hours ."
good,"A typical day at work would entail completing assigned tasks for the day(i.e., promotional/markdown/visual changes) and manages staff to ensure daily numbers are met.  Throughout the day, emphasis is maximizing every customer experience."
good,"Qith my schedule of school and other part time work, I was unable to have many hours at the store, but the coworkers were nice and the store was laidback and not very busy so it was a good way to kill 8 hours and gain $100 every two weeks."
good,"Chico's FAS allowed me to work fulltime, but not more than 40 hours a week, they offer great benefits including PTO that start on the first day of employment."
good,"Pros: My experience here started off awesome. Everyone treated each other well and upper management tries to work with the employees. "
good,You are expected to work holidays and weekends. If you are looking for a part-time retail job and are interested in women's fashion this is the job for you.
good,"some flexibility in work hours but lots of holiday work expected"
good,Parent company for 3 other ladies clothing brands. Beautiful clothes. Company empowers women. Fun environment. Nice stores. Good leadership. Good pay.
good,My duties at Chico's consisted of opening or closing of the store in a support role to the Store Manager and Assistant Manager.  My focus was on client service and sales.  Interacting with clients for sales was always exciting.  The best challenges I faced were when a client would come in with a product return and I would convert that into a sales opportunity.
good,Great opportunities career and upward mobility.  Learning environment that builds solid skills applicable in all retail environments. Solid work life balance.
good,"Chicos had really pretty, stylish clothes and it was fun to show customers fashions that would compliment there particular style.  The company was very good to work for and the hours were OK."
good,I enjoyed working here until my coworkers tended to down me for being one of the top sales men. I did not feel that i was supported at the Utica Store once I went above and beyond everyone else
good,"If you want to make more than $9 per hour you need to sell clothes. My availability was mostly in the evening due to a second job, in the evening there was very little traffic. Little traffic = little money"
good,"Come in inspect  boxes and  unpack, hang clothing, disperse to the floor. Had to train the new manager how to do her position. Culture changing that the older employees no longer needed, that the younger generation know what older customers want."
good,"Chico's is a wonderful company with a good heart.  Some departments (Design, Product Development) work much harder and longer hours than you usually see here in Florida, but about as much as in the fashion industry in New York City.  The payscale is good for Florida, but the work/life balance is not there.  If you are passionate about retail and product development, and are willing to put in the time and effort, this could be a great place for you."
good,"Loved the environment and the people I had the opportunity to meet. wonderful hours and great pay for cashiering, acquired lots of skills in the short time I was there."
good,"Great chance to meet wonderful people. Hardest part was the inconsistent schedule due to inadequate staff, but that is something that could change easily with additional associates."
good,The women are wonderful to work with and the customers and fun to interact with. The products we sell are beautiful and we keep up to date with the latest trends.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Soma Intimates and spent a few years there working with a great crew and doing something I loved. I transferred to White House Black Market which is also a Chicos FAS affiliate and it was much more ""Dog eat dog"". It's great for very competitive sale people but I found myself much happier changing mannequins and working on the visuals (which was my primary job anyways) rather than being on the sales floor."
good,"Chico's is a lovely place to work. The shifts were short, usually 4 hours so it was, at times, difficult to give the customers a complete shopping experience. I loved dressing my ""ladies"" and kept in close contact whenever new styles I thought they would like became available. Co-workers tended to come and go rather quickly but I always did my best to get along with everyone. Management was fair and considerate, while some of the corporate dynamic was often too broad based to fit our market. The product was fairly priced and fashion forward and the employee discount was great!"
good,culture for this company is not. the only good thing about chicos is the training. they are good at sales training. anyone who wants to build relationships and learn to sell should work there at one point
good,I enjoy helping customers pick out the clothes that make them look fabulous. I work with a great team. It's a nice place to work.
good,"I enjoy my job; selling and working with the public. However Chicos does not have in place a system to assign customers as they come in the door and certain employees tend to ""grab"" the most customers they can. Chicos may consider this good customer service, but I call it greedy."
good,Not for everyone. Have to be really patient because customers can be irate and out of control at times. Not too many open full time positions and part time can only get up to 30 hours. Commission is an awesome way to make some extra over the top.
good,"production was amazing. we met our shipping goal everyday, sometimes we even went over. the supervisor ans my co-workers were very friendly."
good,"Chico's is a good company to work for. Great management, wonderful coworkers and great they respect work/life balance."
good,Chico's customers love the merchandise so much the travel to different Chico's locations around the country. I enjoyed meeting new people and listening to their stories.
good,"This was a nice place to work, the pay was not great. The environment was fun."
good,The hardest part is not having a real schedule of certain days.  The best part is having to try all the clothes to see how they fit and be able to educate the customer on what would be a good fit for them.  Love coming in and seeing all the new items that are out on the floor each day.  Love to help customers and see them happy with their look and happy with my service.
good,"loved putting up displays, stocking, cashiering. working with the public."
good,WhBm is an amazing company to work for. Nice work life balance and decent benefits.
good,"Database entry of client information"
good,Good company to work for. Hardest part was sitting alone in a cubicle working shifts
good,"great structure, friendly people.  Treat employees with care and professionalism."
good,"Chicos is a productive and friendly environment. A typical day would be focusing on complete customer satisfaction. Everyone there was extremely friendly .A difficult part of the job was that management was always changing due to shifts in department heads. I always did enjoy ensuring that whomever I was assisting, in person or on the phone, was completely satisfied by my performance."
good,"A typical day at work includes handling the cashwrap, providing customer service for each indivisual customer, offer style and fashion advice and opinions, and regularly calling customers to notify then of sales and appointments. I've learned how to work with customers and co-workers that are a different age group than previous employment. The hardest part of my job is having to meet corportate expectations regarding sales numbers and goals. The most enjoyable part of my job is developing relationships with women from my own community and helping them to find clothing that they feel comfortable and beautiful wearing."
good,one on one customer relationships
good,It is a growing company with successes and opportunities. Leadership is taking the company in the right direction.
good,"A typical day working for Chico's was fast-paced, productive, fun, and energetic. Very rarely was there a slow day. I learned how to manage a stock room, count and unload shipment, do inventory, cashiering, customer service, and I had became a certified fashion coordinator. Management was very organized, and friendly. Co-workers were very friendly, and helpful. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry/frustrated customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the smiles that people got from my help."
good,a typical day working at chicos was upscale for a retail store....
good,"Every day we need to check the new promotions to offer."
good,"Liked working there, it would get a little crazy sometimes, but time went by very fast. Like working 10 hours for 4 days and off 3. That was nice like my boss"
good,Love the corporate training and encouragement to try new ways of selling.  Store manager is knowledgeable but her tone is belittling and has gotten worse lately.
good,Productive mostly and very fast paste . Very good benefits with paid time off . Mangment sucks everyone just does what they want because of there position .
good,"I am only a PT worker. I would say that the PT sales associates are the low men on the totem pole. All of the tasks that the Assistant managers don't want to do are given to me, ie. trash removal, bathroom clean up, sales rack, etc. Also, when there are a lot of customers, the other sales associates are a bit cut-throat. There have been times when I helped a customer and another sales associate range them up under their associate number. They are extremely competitive. However, the main manager is a dream. She is a calm and generous and reasonable person. She is flexible about hours and time off. I don't think I will be eligible for benefits until I have worked there for a year. If I didn't need this second job I wouldn't be doing it because it demands a lot of hours for very little pay. I like some of the clothes and most of my co-workers.I like that this product supplies quality clothing to a mostly neglected segment of our society -- women of a ""Certain Age."" I think that most of the clothing are of good quality but not as good as they were several years ago. Still, most clothing lines do not make stylish and flattering products for ""Baby Boomer"" women and I can always find something nice. The MAPS customer service is fantastic!"
good,"Answering phones, training associates answering questions and fast paced customer service industry. Great management. Excellent co-workers very positive atmosphere."
good,Great place to work and develop skills for the next level. I love the personal connection to the customers through phone calls and appointment selling.
good,"My typical day is a high paced, on your feet thinking that requires you to notice trends and assist with quick resolves. We average 400 - 700  calls per day. Training for our associates is vital to the success of the team and to meet business needs. Meetings happen to help reach resolve, mentor direct associates and look for innovative ways to reduce the amount of outages the stores may have. "
good,Chicos is a good place to work with flexible hours. I learned customer service here. Fun environment to learn how retail works and how to set up a store
good,"working with customers on a more personal level and creating your own customer base,"
good,"I learned how to pack items,  recieve items, and ship items"
good,12 hour shift go by slow if there is no work. Employees are nice and great to work with. Move around to different departments to find work. get really busy during pick season.
good,"Coming from the Medical Field, this position has taught me the start to finish in designing women's clothing.  Very fast paced and long hours.  I have never worked with such great people who are always upbeat, hard working and dedicated to the business whether a good day of business or bad.  The hardest part of my job would be learning  the timeframes of the different seasons.  The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to learn something new everyday in a totally different field then what I am use to."
good,Wonderful staff and environment. The customer always come first in this store. The location of the store is in an outside shopping mall and a beautiful place.
good,"I worked very little with this company, but enjoyed it. Pricing, Customer service, management was good, my co-workers were fun to work with. Helping my customers finding something that makes them look good so that I can a customer come to me the next time they come it."
good,"A typical day at work involved greeting clients and building a clientele by helping them put together outfits or find the right pieces they were looking for."
good,"One call resolution"
good,"Manage Intra day business"
good,"As sale associate I greet customers get to know them and their wants in store.  help them  with shopping and selections throughout store, which she will become a Chico's lady.  great co-workers make the day go by enjoyably.  have training program in place through out the year.  We stock, display merchandise which is quite fun to do and inspires our clients to shop.  maintaining store clean is usually the least thing most employees don't like but know that it must be done in order to be presentable.  "
good,"Oversea management duties always multi-tasking.   Opening/closing store with administrative calculating store KPIs sales while maintaining top of the line customer service product placement. Constantly learning new and productive ways to maintain the balance.  Setting and reaching sales goals, with bonus incentives.   Merchandising as well as assisting associates with product knowledge, sales.  "
good,Salary and commision is a plus. Make my own paycheck. Upper management applies too much pressure to staff. High turnover in management
good,Develop relationships with customers in order to sell Chicos products. I enjoy the people interaction and the products sold. I enjoy all of my coworkers. The hardest part of the day for me is the background stocking that has to be done. The best part is working with the customers and knowing I have helped them look and feel great.
good,"Open store which means opening registers, sending daily figures to home office, keeping sales floor organized, and greeting customers.  The training classes were good at Chicos and done online.  The customer is to be greeted immediately and waited on professionally so their shopping experience is one that they will remember so they will return another time.  The hardest part of the job were the days that we had many customers and waiting on them, trying to get clothes back out on racks while telephone is ringing and the delivery service man is ringing the delivery door bell was a challenge in multi-tasking. "
good,"Personnel very encouraging"
good,"Company is good. Values are good. District manager was pushy, rude and passive aggressive. Store manager is amazing. Paid 10 minute breaks were always given. Balanced work and life schedule"
good,"pros"
good,My time working at Chicos was temporary. It was a job that I secured to help pay for simple expenses while I was in college at the time. When I applied for the job I explained to the employer that I would need certain days off for classes and essentially told my employer exactly when I could and could not work. When I learned what my schedule would be I found that my employer had taken everything that I had said into consideration and provided me with a schedule that met all of my needs as a college student.
good,"A typical day at work involves setting goals and looking at our opportunities. We assist customers with their every need, complete tasks to make the store a better place to shop."
good,"Fast paced and pleasant, physically and mentally challenging with much multi tasking.  Friendly customers and co-workers.  Very structured work culture."
good,the job was easy and the management was great. the posistion was through a temp service so after my 90 days i was let go with out a reason other than i was temp.
good,"Chico's Fashions was a great company to work for. I learned about sales management, payroll, scheduling, training, marketing, sales promotions, product turnover, meeting company sales goals, networking will local community partners."
good,"In a industry that is struggling to keep up with giants such as Amazon, Chico's FAS is a good company to work for. CEO and upper management is very engaged and actively seeking to grow the business. For a fashion company, associates are very friendly and collaborative. "
good,"Great company to work for, with amazingly talented individuals."
good,"It was a nice place to work.  The benefits were excellent,  Work life balance was good except during busy season.  The product has changed over the years but the quality is still there."
good,"Loved the clientele and the products.  I love sales and for having been a job in a retail environment, I was able to schedule my hours based on my family needs fairly well."
good,"A typical day as a manager in Chico's is coming in to open the store. You'll check the MAIL,  manage payroll, make a daily sheet with your sales goal and MAPS Leader for every hour. Once you've finished the paperwork you will than count the registers and open the store for business. Throughout the day you will process locates, provide customer service, ring up customers and accept shipment deliveries. On somedays depending on your MAPS role, if you're in charge of visuals you'll come in earlier to update the store promotions and move merchandise accordingly. Even process markdowns, and transfer them out monthly."
good,I have great people I work with. Everything is constantly changing so you need to be on your game. Some days are slow some are fast. Don't expect to hit your goal everyday and you will deal with some characters. But you will also make friends through your customers and it make facing crazies worth it.
good,Chico's FAS is a growing company that gives opportunities to each and every associates that wants to advance their career. It has taught me a lot with how to manage and build get relationships with other people.
good,"The company itself depends on the management, location and staff. If they are great and work together than you will have a great experience, just work hard and sell as much merchandise as possible."
good,The company has great merchandise and I enjoyed working with a great group of people.  The work life balance is a bit off for management but it is great place to work if you want part time work.
good,"good retail experience. I dealt with different people daily. Helped set up the store, worked as a cashier. Helped customers find the items needed. I enjoyed seeing new items being delivered to the store."
good,A fun environment with upbeat vibe. Customer service is number 1 and giving customers a great shopping experience. I didn't like the constant pressure and competition for sales and to meet sales goals. This made for a stressful day and sometimes bad situations with fellow associates. Great discounts and fun promotions frequently.
good,"The positive experience with every Custumer "
good,"Great way to learn about business, I've always had really wonderful co-workers and mangers. Commission sales are tough, you really have to have a passion for the Company."
good,"Chicos FAS is a great company. It was a fast paced job that always keeps you on your feet. Management is well trained, but very corporate. There was little rooms for mistakes. Co-workers were fun, but the job is very competitive. High sales goals were stressful and hard to accomplish during slow seasons. I loved the fast paced environment. It was enjoyable to meet so many different people, and help women feel beautiful."
good,"The manager always makes sure there's snacks in the break room area, she does it out of the kindness of her heart and her own pocket."
good,Loved dressing my ladies every day.  I always loved the latest fashion styles. The turn over in this particular store is and was high.  I love people in general.  There was nothing hard about the position.
good,"Customer service driven workplace with a helpful management team. Customers call in with situations from good to bad but I was trained to handle them all with a positive attitude. With a company this size you experience so many different things and learning situations. Also with a big company the hardest part is really the ethics and policies of the company but that is expected. My co-workers are like my neighbors in my area we help each other like a family. The most enjoyable part of my job is turning a bad situation into a good one, like when a customer didn't receive her dress for an upcoming wedding that was a few days late, according to the excepted delivery date. I was able to find the dress she needed and get it shipped over-night. The next day I called the customer to inform her and to make sure she received her package. She in return gave me two kudos, but my job isn't about the kudos but about making sure each customer has an engaging and enjoyable experience."
good,"I worked with a great team.  The original management team was the best.  I was promoted and was given the opportunity to expand my skill-set.  I learned quite a bit in this job and enjoyed it very much.  Overall it was a positive experience.  Unfortunately, a new CEO and management team came in and eliminated my position."
good,"As new management you'd expect to be trained, but I have not.  If you are young, the older individuals don't seem to hold you that level of respect. "
good,"Typical day at work consists of learning the sales, knowing where products is on the floor and making sure each customer has the best shopping experience. My coworkers are of the ""more mature age"" so sometimes I find it hard to communicate with them because of the age difference. They forget we are all working the same job and want to mother me instead. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with different people everyday."
good,"A typical day at Chico's was very interesting seeing how we were in a casino. At times we would stay very busy, for hours at a time. I got to meet new people, some of which I built very good relationships with."
good,"Both stores were great places to work. I enjoyed helping people. I made some life-long friends with co-workers. This could be a very tiring job with being on your feet for hours. I was expected to dress in the company's clothing for the most part. These were both very upscale boutiques, and I was able to meet some very sophisticated people. I do not think that the pay was sufficient for the expectations required of employees."
good,"short hour for part employee, so much high goal not good"
good,"Chico's FAS is a good place to work.  LOVE the area."
good,The 10 hour shifts give enough time off and work is fast-paced enough to not be boring while not being too demanding.
good,"I have been here for a year and our days seem to fly by.  There is always something to learn from one another.  The staff members are always helpful and management is very fair in helping us with hours and clarity about our duties."
good,"Assisted the manager with operational and administrative processes to keep staff on task and goaled for the day, week, month, year."
good,"-A warm greeting makes the difference in your attitude.  I've given the same friendly welcome and service I would expect for myself."
good,Engaging all customers & making their shopping experience fun& fulfilling
good,Great place to work if willing to relocate to Florida. Good environment that allows for growth.
good,"At the time I worked there Chico's main appeal was it's unique clothing line geared towards upmarket travelers. From an employment perspective, it also provided the environment for driven sales people to develop a book of clientele and build personal relationships. I can't speak for what it is now, but at the time it was a very successful model in my mind."
good,I would continue to work for this company if I was remaining in the current state of Georgia.
good,"Although I was a temporary employee they didn’t treat me any different from their full time employees. There was a very relaxed, chill work environment. Your fellow coworkers and management was kind and respectful towards you."
good,"I liked it overall, training was rushed so have to kinda be a fast learner in the classroom or take good notes. The job itself is fun you get to explore fashion"
good,Great place to meet new people and build business relationships. Work life balance was one of the better experiences I've had with previous companies.
good,"A typical day at work consists of resolving other employee technical support issues, making sure that business critical systems and processes are working as expected and within defined SLAs, resolving often complex technical challenges, proposing solutions to the company's technical road map and practicing cost-containment within the IT umbrella."
good,"Chico's corporate is a great place to work in general -- they hire the best of the best, the associates all seem to genuinely care for one another, and teams are all pretty closely bonded. Everyone is helpful and nice and overall it's a wonderful experience."
good,"Can be both a fast paced work place or relaxed depending on the day."
good,"always learn something new, team work ethic and do great customer services for our customers. crosstraning, classes "
good,Loved working for Chico's great environment great people great incentives. Always loved fashion and helping ladies choose what is right for them. The store was always neat and clean. Management always helpful and understanding of all associates needs.
good,"It was a wonderful place to work but became increasingly more ""challenging"" as the online impact began to ripple through the entire industry and jobs were eliminated and stresses increased"
good,"great for sales and freedom in selling and clienteling but management is poor for settling disputes and managing associates. Also it wasn't until recently that they started docking for returns and therefore everyone's pay decreased a lot. If it weren't for that, I would probably stay at the company. Sad."
good,"I just a started in January. Unless you’re a store manager, Chico’s is more for a woman who is retired, and wants a “fun” job. It is very hard to advance in the job, and management is poor. You have to be hired as an assistant or store manager in order to advance."
good,Great location in Florida.  Not as much room for internal advancement as they pay outsiders more to come in.  Leadership is on the right track.  Overall a good place to work.
good,Great opportunity to network and partner with women’s organizations to help bring more exposure to the brand.  Great chance to obtain a true job work/life balance.
good,"There is much expected of you, so the time flies by. I've gotten very good at connecting to customers and developing an eye for fashions that best compliment them."
good,"If you are used to Retail then I definitely recommend this store. The only disadvantage is you will have different hours each week and all positions, except management are part time."
good,"Good times  "
good,I love the clothing and I helping women find the right items for their shape and size.  The hardest part of the job is being expected to drive numbers up on days when there are more returns than sales and the sales staff is blamed for the numbers being poor.  The best part of my job is seeing a woman's face light up when she sees herself in an outfit or outfits that I've helped her pick and she feels beautiful.
good,"- either preparing store for opening or closing; assisting customers, resolving customer issues"
good,"We are lucky because our customers are great. Most of them love Chico's so they are fun to work with.   The pay is not great and you end up spending most of what you make.  The company does not make you; but the need to stay with current instore style is underlying. Management is agreeable and what I have come in contact with has all been good to get along with. I love my Chico job.  "
good,"Very pleasant fun work environment. Awesome customer base, very loyal. Need to be able to work closely with more than one customer at a time. These ladies are older and want to look stylish. Able to create your own traffic by having events in stores. Working with community for these events. Get to travel to different outlets and see how stores are set up. Create close knit friendships through out company."
good,"A typical day and life at Chico's was exciting,fun,enjoyable,and co-workers were delightful.The clientele was at times a bit stressful and a handful but seeing the after effects of wardrobe coordinating/ artistry made it ALL WORTH IT! I loved doing the Visual Displays and Window Dressing/Artistry Stylist. Knowing all my displays selling out and people loving what they are wearing IS GREAT!"
good,"I have been with the company for a very short time, but have never been so comfortable with starting at a new job before. Chico's thrives on the ability to be enthusiastic as a seller, portrays a wonderful idea of positive body image, and continues to succeed with their exceptional one-on-one customer service. As the visual communicator, I am in charge of implementing style-set each month and replenishing the store on a day-to-day basis. I look for opportunities within the walls to create a more aesthetic appeal, not only for the consumers, but for the employees. I also support the selling associates on the floor when traffic is heavier, maintaining the customer service levels. I learn every day- whether it's from our very-informed stock associate regarding distribution/allocation mistakes, or from the management team as they delve into our sales audits. The manager at the store does a fantastic job on treating employees with respect. I have been fortunate enough to sit down with the district manager (who is also fairly new in the position), and she makes me believe in working for the company. Chico's standards and ethics are a prized possession in the retail world- to be a part of the team is phenomenal!"
good,"Fun atmosphere"
good,"I enjoyed working at Chico's outlet in Aurora, Illinois.  I learned a lot about the retail business and working closely with customers and my co-workers."
good,"a review of what needs to e done, how we are going to get in done and the time tis going to take."
good,"Management was difficult to deal with. Other than that, it was a good experience and a fun and productive workplace. Customer service was naturally learned because of great customers."
good,I really enjoyed working with customers and helping them to feel good about themselves.
good,"Typical day would be Opening boutique, setting the stage for our customers to enjoy their shopping experience. Making sure the boutique is presentable.  Scheduling/instructing the sales associates about our goals for the day.    Providing most amazing customer service for our customers.  Have fun with and take personal interest in co-workers and customers"
good,"A typical day at work - CAD designer"
good,"Chicos is a very busy place to work!  There is always something to do,  e.g,  setting up new product, marketing and understanding latest sales for the store, and giving the best possible customer service.  The hardest part of any retail position, wanting to get everything done as soon as possible.  The most enjoybable part of working at Chicos, is our customers and the people I work with.  If the customers have a great moment, it is so fun to celebrate with them!!!  Our associates work as a team, and each person has so many great ideas and attribute so much to the business.  They don't just come to sell, they come as a family/team."
good,"Typical day is meetings, conference calls, setting up presentations."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Chico’s for the most part. Upper management was supportive and tried very much to make staff members feel welcome and appreciated!"
good,"Overall, it was a great place to work.  I learned to help associates work through conflict with their coworkers."
good,"I started out working part time and ended up as an assistant manager within a year and a half.  I don’t know if it was just my store or all Chicos but my coworkers were all wonderful. The store manager was very knowledgeable, helpful, friendly and empathetic.  She had a positive energy that everyone could benefit from. The atmosphere was relaxed and with the  bonuses on your sales you could earn a great deal more than your hourly wage. Granted, when the store was very busy you really worked your tail off to help customers, put away clothes and clean up.  All in all it was a great experience and I will always remember working there very fondly."
good,"I worked for the company for 12 years.After my fifth year I asked to be transferred to Florida from Atlanta and it happened quickly. I have no regrets, I just needed a change"
good,The managers are wonderful and the work and message were strong and encouraging. The message to make sure the customer walks out confidently and happy with their purchase. The new CEO cares more about the newer customers and pulling a younger crowd rather than maintaining the high-quality product that the long-time customers have come to love. They allowed and hired employees that cared more about the sales bonus rather than the customer experience and customer satisfaction resulting in a high return rate and unhappy customers.
good,"It was a great job to have if you were trying to get some hours. It was really more of a part time job. I had some good experience on unloading the trucks, working in my department, and how to use a scan gun.plus everyone was friendly, and their support system was really good if you were a great worker. You can get overtime. Sometimes we left and went home early. Sometimes we didn't. But,overall I had a good experience at chico's."
good,"A typical day would be filling online shipping orders, helping customers in the store, and calling customers about their accounts. They are usually happy to hear from me and like building personal relations. I've learned a lot about retail but also about life. I have gotten a lot of valuable information from other people's life experiences that a 20 year old would not usually otherwise have. I love the managers. It is a very supportive environment that is fun and comfortable while also productive. The hardest part of the job is probably keeping up with how and when to apply certain discounts and sales that are always changing. The best part is a toss up between making jokes with my amazing coworkers or helping a customer find something perfect that also has a discount and making a good impression on them."
good,"The Store Solution Center at Chico's is a very fast paced environment dealing with the many troubled IT solutions that are rolled out to the stores. There is a supporting family like environment among the team. Everybody feels the same exhaustion and frustration and carries each others burdens and consistently collaborates  with the same end game in mind. Keep the stores selling. All  the folks out in the stores calling in were patient and compassionate with us. It is a great job to have as you transition between jobs. Not exactly an IT job, but close enough. Kinda like if you wanted to work in the restaurant  business ( Ruth Chris Steakhouse ) being your goal  The analogy here in IT companies would be for instance; Team Logic, Impulse Creative, ITVantage, Greenwire Technology etc etc.. Suppose there are no openings yet at at Ruth Christ so you decide to put your time in at McDonalds. The analogy here would be The Store Solution Center at Chicos. You get the basics of IT but not quite serving Steak..Store Solution Center is a great local place to start or re start your IT Career..."
good,Different ethnicity employees work together in a friendly environment.  we are as a time work.helping the customers to chose right out fit for them is the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"The work culture was team oriented.  The management promoted a happy cheery atmosphere.  The company offered many perks such as company store, work out facility and a nice break area.  The customers were usually happy to be calling and were fun to interact with, and even the challenging customers were nice by the end of a phone call.  Hardest part of job was the customers that could not be satisfied, it is not nice to let someone down who is expecting a perfect product and experience.  I learned loads about customer service.  How to give excellent customer service.  I learned different computer skills that were unexpected and that I was grateful for."
good,"As my job Title (packer) i have worked in a packing station"
good,"You answer phone calls from customer assisting them with placing orders, answer questions about some of the products, applied credits to their accounts or checked the delivery status of their orders.  "
good,"I was lucky enough to have a great manager who taught me much to make my time in the boutique fun yet challenging! As with most retail, the hours could be hard to balance work and family life."
good,"I was one of two assistant store managers. My store manager was sick a great deal, which resulted in me doing far more of the work. My other assistant manager was not interested in the other aspects of the job, the paper work, so I did it all. The ladies that worked on the floor with me in sales were great. Friendly, helpful, wonderful crew. I felt my manager could have delegated better, especially being sick so much, but that didn't happen. We had a nice group of regular customers, the clothing we sell is beautiful."
good,"Great women and men within the stores.  The retail environment is changing rapidly.  Chico's is diligently working to stay ahead with "
good,"Job was very flexible in everything: hours, location, return policy, other policies. You would be told stick to the policy and customer service would tell you to go ahead and disregard the policy. Not a lot of job advancement but had some really great managers."
good,"Good management and good coworkers. I am looking forward to working with Chico's everyday. We sometimes wish that there would be work everyday, but it is okay for some slower seasons."
good,I genuinely enjoyed my time working for Chico's. I worked for a fabulous store manager and district manager. The company provided fair benefits as well as a generous bonus structure.
good,As a manager for Chico's you will have their support and they are constantly changing their philosophy on marketing direction and direction for brick and mortar stores.
good,i just wish management (although even i am on the management team) was considered more. it's also unreasonable to ask so much from stores who are in locations that don't get as much traffic as others
good,the culture this company comes with was one of the best in my experience. Management team is really friendly to be around.
good,"Great work life balance"
good,"I begun at SOMA Intimates as a Assistant Manager where I learn all management process like recruit, evaluates and coaches associates through develops strategies to increase sales."
good,"Not a job for a College student trying to pay tuition.Every simple job for retired woman or men with a lot of time on their hands.Managers are wonderful and helpful,understanding when it comes to school.But the pay barely pays my rent and hours are very little."
good,"Increased sales through excellent customer service while coaching team to "
good,It  used to be a good place to work but now the leadership has is becoming biased if they Like You they're going to treat you nice but if they don't they don't care about you if they like you you can talk all day but if they don't you have to work every minute
good,Even though I was seasonal I had put in my two weeks but they wanted me to stay and one of the managers told me if I were to stay I would be full time and they would keep me. Me believing them I stayed and it didn't happen.
good,"As the Assistant Manager I felt our team of ladies were well trained to assist the customers with our amazing personal service to help the customers coordinate outfits ."
good,"Great place to work and develop sales drive skills as well as developing the skills to meet customers needs with sincerity. "
good,One on one shopping with customer. I learned how to interact with people and my coworkers were a lot of help with helping our customers needs. Management is also very helpful
good,"it was very interesting and different then what I always do. I learned so much about fashion, loved it"
good,Meet the targets we have for the day. Learned new concepts and technologies.
good,"A day in the life at Chico's is a hustling and bustling experience, it keeps the workers busy no matter what, it gave me the experience to operate mechanical equipment while attaining my education. Furthermore, my co-workers always treat each other with respect and manners. Additionally, the most difficult part of the job was being patient with team leads to give assignments, while the most enjoyable part was being able to experience everything the warehouse had to offer."
good,the people I work with. I have learn about merchandise the product.
good,"bank runs, how to work with all types of people, managing school and work, checking in shoes putting them out on floor, managing employees, workkplace full of college students which made it fun never a dull moment, hardest part was trying to please every customer"
good,"Friendly environment with supportive supervisors. Company gives many overtime opportunities for those needing it. "
good,"I felt at Chicos FAS there were many opportunities for growth if you're willing to apply yourself. Many of my work days as Operations Supervisor were spent making sure that the day to day activities were carried out, as well as communicating with associates to find out their needs, and how my department could best assist them. Additionally, I met with my managers on a daily basis to update them on the status of existing projects, or be assigned something new. I found all my Managers to be of a professional caliber and always approachable. My coworkers were always supportive and understood their responsibilities, while carrying out their assignments to a high degree. The hardest part of my role was addressing a wide array of professional attitude types that were all very passionate about getting their job accomplished. Though difficult at times, I felt I approached those situations with calm, and sought resolution in the most expedient and unbiased manner possible. I took great enjoyment in fulfilling my tasks and special projects assigned, and felt that since my managers continued to give me these assignments, they must have had a great deal of certainty of my abilities, and that gave me a great deal of satisfaction."
good,A great day at work for me is just fast moving and seeing my ladys happy and most of all team work 
good,"Enjoyed being a sales associate, the hours worked for me."
good,Chico's FAS Inc. was a great place to work however be aware that a lot of time in the office is expected.
good,a typical day consists of about 30-50 calls from stores all across the country solving a variety of problems.
good,"Chico's is a very large company and is very profit driven. This made for an incredibly competitive sales floor and as a manager it taught me to teach teamwork, and find ways to continue to motivate the team on a daily basis."
good,"Great team work. good communication with DM, Product line always fresh."
good,Chico's FAS has strong core values. Pay and benefits are exceptional.The customer-centric nature of the business is ideal for its target customer base. There are opportunities in certain disciplines to grow and develop in one's career.
good,I have enjoyed working at Chico’s and I have learned a lot. They have taught me a lot working in a Warehouse for the first time. Their priority is the customer comes first which is good. Chico’s is a women clothing distribution center for several stores around the world. If I had choice I would rather work in Accounting because that is where my biggest interest is.
good,"Great opportunity for fashion-loving participants!  Developing a client base and Working with customers with a variety of style needs, chances to be creative!!  Management overall--very supportive & involved."
good,"I greatly enjoyed my time in entry level management at Chico's. This company is definitely mission driven, and instills that mission in every new employee."
good,"My job here was soo much fun! Great environment,  lots of incentives. Lots of room for advancement. The reason I  left was my store manager left and went elsewhere."
good,"Never a dull moment. Customer service, team building and development, inventory management, coaching and training and visual merchandising skills are among the many daily challenges."
good,"I worked at Chico's during the Holidays, which I really enjoyed.  They asked me to stay on and be a Manager but I decided it was not the career route for me."
good,"Like most retail brands in todays climate there are business challenges.  The teams are focused and strategic with the go forward leadership of the CEO.  Everyone is expected to ""do"" no matter what the level is given resource challenges.  Must like to dive in and get dirty."
good,I had a very good experience at Chicos. My upline was very encouraging and supportive. The company is making changes in style and sales technique that I think will be great once it all comes together.
good,Every day we would do a touch base with the DM to start the day and there were also many new  promotions that had to be done in the morning and then sometimes there would be a change in the afternoon
good,"Enjoyed selling and wearing clothing and accessories."
good,"This is a great company that truly lives the work life balance of reenergizing its team,definitely is flexible and open to those who also goes to school."
good,"Great co-workers: Positive cohesive team atmosphere"
good,"Location in Albuquerque"
good,"Friendly and collaborative environment."
good,"a typical day at work depends on the days, Tuesdays and Wednesday are the busiest. Most of the customers are relaxed. the hardest part of the job is escalating issues."
good,"Chico's promotes transparency and advancement across the family of brands.  Collaborative cross functional teams work towards the success of the brand, the company and the individual."
good,"Thorough training in Chico's culture of selling.  Product is easy to sell as it's a very well made, affordable product.  Love my management team.  Bonus structure is adequate."
good,Chico's was my first real bartending job again I learned a lot it's just a place that again there was no room for advancement I was looking for somewhere where I could work my way up and possibly become a manager and being a bartender there is no room for advancement at a place like that
good,I enjoyed this job because it was fast paced and you had a chance to advance. We were very competitive for production and making sure that we sent the product out in a timely manner.
good,"You work under pressure because there are goals to comply with. The workplace culture theory is great;respect, integrity, vibrant spirit, customer is first. I love retailing because it let you create that connection with customers.As Manager you have to comply with different areas:operations, administrative work,merchandising, visual and team building and development, daily monitoring and coaching.The hardest part was to keep a peaceful and fun environment, you have to work daily to keep the team motivated. The most enjoyable part is when you see real appreciation from your team, a smile because of customer satisfaction, and when your boss tells you that ""You are an Amazing Leader""."
good,A typical day is fast paced . I can easily take 80+ calls on my shift. Management is always available with their office door open. The work environment is always  speed orientated . Its all about how fast can you answer the call and resolve the issue. A speedy one call resolution is not as hard as it sounds if you know how to utilize your given tools. Hardest part of the job its attempting to be fiscally responsible and sometimes not be able to give a customer the best deal . The satisfaction of helping a women look her best despite how she may feel.
good,Chics FAS is a great company that works with your hours and wants to see you succeed on and off campus. They are well organized and are all about customer satisfaction.

good,Fast paced work environment.  Very wide scope of commodity responsibilities.  Some very talented people as counterparts.  Typical day goes very quickly because of the pace.
good,"A typical work day now is project management, reviewing what's on the pipeline, business requirements, prioritizing business critical reporting needs, meeting with senior leadership to align on specifications, and building the reports using Excel, BOBJ, SAP/BEX, new Queries, Access, SQL, etc."
good,I worked all different kind of hours and days so I was either opening or closing.  I would help customers with their outfits or ordering new items on the computer.   I would answer the phone and use the cash register.  I would organize the new items that would come in the store and steam them.   The hardest part was our management was not great.  There were no meetings.  I did like helping the customers.  They usually were clinic patients so many stories to tell.
good,"My day begins with me assigning job responsibilities for the day. Then begin supervision to make sure the jobs are done."
good,"Chico's located here in Las Vegas,NV is a face paced, productive environment. You're able to grow in sales & create acquiring clienteling !"

good,"greet customers as they come in, introduce them to the new fashions that have come in, assist them with sizes and jewelry. co-workers and management fun and easy going. the hardest part was doing the stage set for the new product and only having 3 hours to do the whole store before we open for the day. the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the customer smile when they get their purchases at the end of the sale."
good,"Chico's is an upscale woman's boutique where our main focus is customer service and building our clientele to exceed the customer's expectation. Chico's takes great pride in delivering excellent customer service and maintaining the brand standards in our boutique. In our store, we work together as a team to reach our daily sales goal while maintaining the core values of the brand."

It s a fast-paced, ever changing, exciting organization that believes in open communication, accessibility of leadership and recognition at all levels.  Chico's has allowed me to learn a whole new aspect of the retailing business to which I had very little exposure in my past experience.  "
good,"I work part-time in the Erie, PA location. I generally only work 5 hours per week however, I would like to work more. The management team is awesome and so are the associates. I just earned a 50.00 gift card for making the most phone sales calls to Chico's customers. I love going to work and I always smile during my shift. The discount on clothes is a great perk."
good,"I received and processed  merchandise for the selling floor. Then I would set up displays, and accommodate customer requests. I worked closely with store management on organizing and monthly paperwork.  Interaction with co-workers and customers was the most fulfilling part of the job. The most frustrating part of the job was lack of work space."
good,"Duties include, keeping racks stocked and sized, checked in stock and placed on hangers, greeted and waited on customers, ran register, pulled stock for customers and took items to dressing rooms.  Fun place"
good,"Answer incoming calls from Store Associates"
good,Working with the customers is the most fulfilling aspect of this job.
good,"Open tills, call in staff if needed, sales, stock, steam clothing, introduce new merchandise, display, timekeeping, bank deposits. Hardest part of the job was being on my feet for 8 -9 hours a day. Most enjoyable helping women look and feel better and customer contact."

good,The campus consist of 3 individual brands with shared services supporting each which enabled cross brand experience opportunities.  Work / Life balance at the Soma division was very good.
good,Had excellent staff. Everyone was welcoming. Everyone was always willing to teach. Whenever If I ever have a question someone was there to help. Very enjoyable work environment.
good,"As in any retail environment, this job can be a little stressful during high volume shopping times.  I really enjoy my job and the people I work with.  The discount helps too, but mostly love the employees.  I am NEVER bored, because I work in the backroom mostly there is ALWAYS something to get done."
good,I felt the need to find a way to get involved more with people of special circumstances. I enjoyed my job and my co workers hover I needed to find a better way to use my talents towards the needs of others.
good,"I enjoyed the clothes, my coworkers, and customers.  The only thing I didn't enjoy was the pressure to make sales and the competition or jealousy that arises from the bonuses.  I think it's normal for retail sales, it just didn't fit my personality well, I'm too competitive."
good,"Always learning something new. Fast pace environment. Always working on people skill daily. Work together as a team . Working in different departments if needed."
good,"When it comes to benefits it would be difficult to top Chicos but the ability to earn a higher salary is stagnant."
good,"My day at work it’s open or close the store, following with open and close registers, managing payroll and others report including. Emil’s reviews and responses.. following sales goals as need for the day and provide the best customer service."
good,"I loved working for Chico's. Great sense of community among all associates. Unfortunately,  the company decided to restructure and my position was eliminated without warning."
good,I loved working at Chico's. I would love to be either the Store Manager again or work as the District Manager. I was blessed to have a secondary Assistant Manager who had experience as a District Manager at another company. She was a great resource for me to lean on as I was learning the ins and outs of Chico's management.
good,If you enjoy helping and engaging with customers this is a great place to work. you have to be willing to meet your sales goal because bonuses can get competitive.
good,"Opening/closing duties as manager to support a successful sales day and associates team work."
good,"it's good to search position and getting easy to positions,"
good,"Nice working environment and co-workers. The company offers a lot of perks and shift variety. Also, the company offers professional advancement opportunities."
good,"Working at Chicos FAS Inc. I have learned how to deal with multiple situations with a positive attitude, swiftness, and ideal customer service. The hardest part of the job is the physical labor.  Retail is a very hands-on job and can be tiring after one days work.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the look on a pleased customer's face.  Knowing that I had something to do with their satisfaction is the highlight of the day."
good,Great working atmosphere.  Management always involved.   Overall morale was satisfactory. Clean environment.
good,It is constantly changing and adapting to the changing demands for the Retail industry
good,"Chico's was my first time working for a large corporation - I learned customer service was most important and most stressed by the company. I handled opening and closing of the store, interviewed potential employees, handled cash and made bank deposits, dealt with customers in difficult situations, etc. - my integrity was never questioned. I enjoyed customer relations, contact/selling - the hardest part of the job was a process where headquarters/operations required a complete change in placement of our clothing/products throughout the entire store. We were required to do this every three weeks making it difficult to find products for the customer because we were a large store. Just as we would become familiar with where an item might be located, the three week period passed and a full-out change occurred again."
good,Great managers really nice customomers. Not great if you have personal spac issues as you have to get close to customers. Overall great place to work.
good,"This is my first part-time job in Canada, and I am so glad to accumulate my customer service experience of here, I am so glad to join this team to start my career."
good,"Good team spirit, Great Associates and team players. Learning is a on going process. Good support from Management. A clean work environment. Chicos promotes from within with Associates who show a passion and desire to succeed."
good,"I was with Chico's for close to 14 years... they were my family!"
good,Great place to work! The only thing is to dress professional isn't enough they won't you wearing they'er product which isn't cheap. They do provide a decent discount.
good,"Typically an older crowd, which makes for less drama both behind the scenes and with customers. Although, depending on the individuals can make it harder to bond with coworkers (20-something years old vs 50+ years old)."
good,I worked at Chico's for a few years and it was so much fun.  I learned a lot and meet wonderful people who some became my regular clients.  The management team was inspiring and so were the people I work with on the sales floor.  We worked as team players.
good,"My experience with Chico's was one where I learned to be a stronger and more diversified leader. Most days were filled with various meetings with each of the functional areas that reported to me. My favorite part of my job was having the opportunity to work towards growing a business while also mentoring and developing my team. One of the more challenging issues I faced was finding work life balance. I learned that being a perfectionist was a challenge and that it would be key to my future success to better manage that aspect of my career. The hardest part of my role was that most of my days were consumed with meetings, hence never having enough time to get all of my responsibilities completed within the normal hours of a work day. I enjoyed the culture of the company very much.....it was very much of a team oriented culture.....and one where each and every employee had an opportunity to make a difference."
good,Pay is just too low.  I don't know how anyone is suppose to represent the company and their clothing even after discount offered to employee.  Required to wear their clothes but you spend every penny you make on their clothes.
good,"Great place to work"
good,"Great Management and a fun place to work. Great learning opportunity."
good,Working at Chicos as been a great experience. My Co-workers are great and the management team is also great. The hardest part of this job is the days when business isn't so busy but that is much expected in retail. The most enjoyable part of this job is the customers.
good,"A typical work day was it wasn't very busy I mostly unloaded boxes, put things away, and steamed clothing. I did not learn much from this job. Management was very friendly. My co workers were very friendly it was a little weird with the big age gap."
good,"Love working at Chicos, great culture. Integrity and respect shown to all from the top down."
good,"great place to work, great managment, and fun place to work and meet new people."
good,"Chico's has the most amazing tools and resources for training. This is a job where you can learn and broaden your skills just by having fun and getting to know your customers. Employees are encouraged to try on merchandise and not only look great but build sales using the knowledge they gained during the process. This is a place where working hard is always easy! If you love people, love clothing and still enjoy having a life outside of work, this is the job for you!"
good,"very busy, bettered my multitasking skills, management and co-workers where awesome, hardest part of the job would be making sure every piece of clothing had a tag, most enjoyable part of the job was seeing new faces everyday."
good,"i love working here, great benefits, great customers and fabulous coworkers!  everyday is different from the next because you always have new cujtomers"
good,"I loved my job. I do wish Chico's could provide a better work/life balance by allowing employees to rotate weekends to afford them the opportunity to be with family. There is opportunity for advancement but also a lot of favoritism but that's with a lot of companies.It's all in who you know. Otherwise, great people, great benefits and wages were comparable to the position."
good,"I loved going to work. My bosses were always helpful and open to suggestions. Great clothing and fun to work with customers to help them feel good in our line of clothing. Wonderful, fun group of ladies. Our discounts were wonderful but the special ones were on specific pieces which sometimes I didn’t want or need. My Issue!"

good,Chicos is a great work environment with great opportunities of advancement.
good,"Its a great company, people are great.  The management is not to honest the pay is not great."
good,"A typical day at chicos would be coming in and helping a customer find exactly what she needs ,setting up a fitting room, and adding accessories.I learned that you have to really be a friendly person for this job and that i am, so it works out well for me. The management team is very helpful even the district manager. They provide training online.The co-workers are very hard working friendly people. They work as a team.The hardest part of the job is not being able to return an item for a determined customer. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that each customer got there own personal amazing service."
good,"Working at Chico's gave me an opportunity to learn more about the people in the area. How to dress them for their lifestyle and special events. Every part of the country is different and this gave me an opportunity to learn more about this part of the nation opposed to the part where I grew up. I enjoy learning different cultures and interacting with people of different cultures. The workplace was extremely comfortable which made working there so comfortable and was able to think very clearly due to our crew being such an open group of individuals. The hardest part of the job was probably only dealing with overflow of clothing in the back. It was more of a challenge that I took on to organize the back room. I made it fun, not difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job was my awesome boss and her patience to help when I first began. Having a great boss makes everything more enjoyable."
good,"I would usually arrive before the store opened to help merchandise and to call clients about something new that came in. As soon as we opened, it was non-stop selling, with some days so busy there was no time for lunch or a break. Very fast-paced."
good,"Culture and teamwork needs to improve. "
good,I love the team that I work with. And the company is training you for what you need for the position. It’s easy to talk with my managers. They care about you.
good,"Good learning experience for me. Fun place to work. Customer focused. "
good,Started as an intern and worked my way up to a full time position. I loved working there and the people I had met in the field. Great company and even better work environment.
good,"Great Place to work at and, great people to work with. However, the hours are terrible!! Part time hours are given to less than 25 hours if new. The full time people get all of the perks. They get all of the hours and more of their salary in the end. Training is severely short and trainer ignore the new people. Work is fast that is a great plus. If you are into a fast company this is the job for you. But, if you want major pay and little hours. Then this is not for, you at all."
good,"I enjoyed working at Chico's part time. It was a great environment, the management of the store was very easy to work with and the staff were treated very well."

good,"Wonderful place to work, great associates and wonderful customers."
good,What impressed me about Chicos from day one was their intense focus on providing excellent customer service and empowering their associates to provide just that!
good,"A typical day at work for me was managing the unexpected from visits by corporate executives, to receiving, logging in, and distributing  as many as 200 boxes of stock. I learned how to work with folks who thought differently than me and to soothe ""ruffled feathers"" when needed. The hardest part of my job by far was our whole store inventory accomplished in one day!  We always made it! The most enjoyable part of my job was satisfying a customer's need. This always gives me a great sense of accomplishment."
good,Chico's has provided the most excellent corporate environment that I have ever experienced.  Associates are hard-working and dedicated because of the value placed on respectful communication with customers and co-workers alike.
good,"A typical day involves working as a cashier and handling other things  that a support team member does like taking out trash, cleaning the mirrors, and greeting customers. Most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the wonderful women that shop there and getting to know the women that work with you."
good,"Busy, always things to work on and do, to unpacking new seasonal items, to working on displays, to helping clients creating a new wardrobe. I learned that it is truly all about the customers and their needs and helping them. Management was exceptional, extremely helpful in your progress and sales, the co-workers were very friendly and enjoyable to work with, had a great working relationship with all.

good,I love working there it just doesn't have enough hours for what I need.
good,An overall good experience as a part time job. A typical work day was very unexpecting. There was always something to do and new people to meet and help. My coworkers embrassed each other as family and treated the company as such. The hardest part of the job was letting go. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with an amazing group of people and customers
good,"Each work day is different. Some days are crazy fun and other days are relaxed and easy going. There is always someone there with you so you do not have to worry about trying to handle things on your own, altough you are trained to be if ever needed. Co-workers are friendly hard working imdividuals. Management is great. They are easy to talk to and work to make sure you have met your goals. They make sure that the store is keeping up with its set goals and every thing is running smoothly."

good,"opening and closing the store, lead cashier, multi tasks, enjoy working with the public"
good,"Clock in stretch and go to your seperate lines. Scan boxes and count! Most co- workers were friendly but a lot of them were very lazy, including some of the managers. The hardest part is the constant repitition of counting. The most enjoyable part were the company gatherings."

good,"It's changing now, but at one time this was not the best place to be. You feel so insecure in any role due to the instability of the company. I do miss my team they were (are)great!"
good,"This was a great company when i worked there.  The values and what they stood for was amazing, but greed got into the way and quality went out the door along with the companies values and what it stood for.  No longer was about the customer was about the dollar amount."
good,"Chico's was a great place to work.  There was ample chance for advancement.  They  offer mostly part time work, and in most cases, no benefits.  Therefore, their staff is primarily persons of a certain age, who do not require benefits."
good,"Every girls dream. You get to play dress up every day and have the opportunity to help create a fashion savvy shopper turn client. Thought building a woman's closet we get to know our clients likes and dislike, building a bond and rapport creating a experience like no other.

good,a typical day at work would be to have a meeting in the morning to inform us on how much work we have to get done. after that management lets us know where to go to work at . we are somewhat departmentalized. but we pick and pack orders not much of a hard labor job.
good,"I enjoy working with this team, but the industry has been slow."
good,It is a very good company and a fun place to work. Co-workers are excellent; I have learned a lot working with this company. The hardest part of the job is not making my quota as far as sales. It feels good and compensating when I make my quota.

good,Chico's is a fun place to work you meet many different people who  can add spice to your workday. I enjoy helping customers to put together a winning outfit that they could have never done without my professional expertise. I enjoy meeting new people and engaging with them as their personal shopper. I'm always excited to see new floor sets and new merchandise. I give most of my paycheck back because it's hard to work around beautiful fashionable clothing and not want to buy it to wear to work. Customers see it on me and want it too!!! I'm a CHICO'S GIRL!  The atmosphere is warm and inviting for both the customer and the employee. We are team players and it helps in a fast paced environment like Chico's!

good,I enjoyed my job at Chicos and would still be working there but the downtown location closed and I enjoyed walking to work.  I was offered a chance to transfer but did not want to drive long distance to work when I might be able to find a job I could walk to downtown. I learned a new computer system when ringing sales and also learned valuable customer skills in my interaction with customers as they tried on clothes.

good,"A typical day of work involves making sure the store is arranged perfectly and satisfying customers while also trying to make my personal sales goal in order to help the store achieve the daily goal in order to please our DM.  I have been very pleased with my coworkers and management.  My only complaint has to deal with recent events which have damaged my part time employment.  As a college student, I was always able to come home and work during breaks.  For the past six months I have been unable to be ""rehired"" due to computer glitches and miscommunication between corporate and my own wonderful manager.  I love working at Chico's and regret the days I have been unable to work.  I hope the situation is remedied as soon as possible because I greatly enjoy working for the company."
good,A typical day at work would be helping women of all body types find nice clothing to wear. My job is to make then feel and look great to the tee and to build up there confidence in there clothing
good,"Great company, great customers."
good,"Coworkers are wonderful and welcoming, ive loved working here and dont plan on leaving. They become a second family and the clothes are nice. Happy environment"
good,"Worked in marketing at Chico's for six years, was promoted twice. Amazing coworkers, clear structure, fostered collaboration, clear expectations. Sometimes hours can be long, but overall a fantastic experience. Worked at corporate office in Marketing/Creative department."
good,Management allows new hires to learn on the job while making an hourly wage and commission.  The training is perfomed via the buddy system which enable ;you to learn various techniques.  The culture is team spirit.
good,Chico’s is a pleasant place to work. I like the manager and the assistant manager. They are flexible with scheduling and very nice people. I like all the associates.
good,"Chico's embodies a strong customer service culture with a competitive selling environment.  Compensation is not commission based but Chico's provides a bonus structure for its management team and sales associates and holds them accountable to achieve monthly individual and store sales goals "
good,"had a wonderful time building portfolio of clients. management very very helpful and encouraging for every effort. was always up to date on new trends, challenges and opportunity for more imput."
good,"Merchandise is easy to represent, good quality, many opportunities to make extra cash with bonus structure, repeat customers that are loyal to Chico's brand."
good,"A typical day was from 2 to 6. Hours weren't flexible due to the demand time that was needed which was understandable. I loved being able to be in a place where I could make an impact on our youth. Some days it would be tough, but it was very rewarding to work for this company because of the children."
good,"Flexible hours that work for you, team is great and friendly, commission is a small bonus, customers are more often friendly than not, Management is super nice and friendly, Overall pretty great!"
good,Openning and closing the store on daily basis.  Holding associates accountable for their sales goals.  Providing excellent customer service.
good,Greeted customers warmly and made them feel welcomed during their visits. Communicated with customer and introduced them to new and different clothing and accessories for various events. Ensured customer satisfaction during the customer's visit.
good,love working with the ladies on a daily basis and the quality of clothing is amazing. great opportunities to grow within the company
good,A typical day a work should involve you giving your best effort whenever you clock into a job..
good,"Greet customers as they come into shop, all cashier functions, answer the phone, ship product out, help with any other task"
good,"I love the fact that it was a personal connection with each customer. I learned how to create a shape on any body type.....most of my co-workers were great and easy to get along with just found that the managers needed to work more on being on the same page. Three managers on the floor at once all giving different directions. The only other thing that I feel would've helped would be for the store to be zoned out because you have 6 associates on the same customers over & over to the point of it becoming a problem. The most enjoyable part of the job for me would be coming in contact with so many great people of all race, age, and size ."
good,"This is a part-time job that I took while looking for a full-time position. It doesn't feel like a job, but a fun place to work."
good,Management was very helpful and encouraging. Customer where the best and other associates were super nice and helpful and always found a way to help you build up your selling units. Flexible hours and good part-time job if you are going to school.
good,"Great place with great people and fashion (at the location I was in). If you love connecting with fashionistas of all ages, sizes, this is the place for you!"
good,The job is fairly easy; you work four 10 hour days. Management could use some improvement. They cross train you so you're able to work in different departments. The pay is descent.
good,Great place to work for! You definitely learn soooo much more about customer service. After working for a couple months you end up getting your own cliental and you meet some wonderful women and get to know so many people! Never thought I would enjoy working as much as I do hear. Nice part time job.
good,"I loved working for Chico's! Great hours of operation, great company and beliefs, great benefits and always something to do. I only left the company to persue a full time manager position at another company. There was no more room for personal advancement at our location."
good,I really enjoyed my co-workers and my managers.  Loved the clothes and the discounts I received on them. This was my second time with this company.  My first time with them was in Key West. I loved my  co-workers and my boss there as well. I love how they teach you to put together outfits and jewelry.  Their products are A+!!
good,"Chicos is a fun, fast paced retail job. The clothes are great as were the coworkers. The have very few full timers so a lot of staff is part time which is unfortunate."
good,Good place to work with very flexible hours.  Fun environment selling women's clothing.  Fun environment if you want to learn how retail works and how to set up a store.
good,"Chico's is one of the most amazing places to work. I loved my internship and had the opportunity to get to know so many hardworking and friendly people from all over the company. Even though I was only an intern, they didn't have me going on coffee runs or doing boring grunt work. They treated me as a real member of the team and I was sad when the summer ended."
good,The culture at Chico's is great. Co-workers are friendly & salary is good for the location.  I learned a lot of skills over the years that helped me be successful in my positions.  There was too much work load put on associates to have work life balance.
good,This is a great place to work.  They promote good customer service and have been great to work with personal schedule requirements.
good,"Responsibilities: "
good,"Good process, just subject to sales and market conditions."
good,I love working with my co-workers. Everyone is very helpful and works as a team.  I have learned to assess clients and wardrobe based on their needs.  It's so much fun! It can be exhausting too because you are pulling merchandise and running back and forth. My managers understand the need for work/life balance.
good,Chico's is a learning environment; its a productive and fun place to work.  After a hard day at work you can work out at our 800sq ft gym right on campus.  There's a company store where employee has the luxury to shop from 11am-4pm Monday to Friday.
good,This  was a nice work place.  The volume of work was plentiful.  Chico's was  very loyal to it's employees.
good,Management was very positive. Helping customers prepare apparel for events. Learned some inventory management and Chico's computer system. The best part was new merchandise coming in everyday.
good,The days at work are quite sometimes most time we talk to help others. we work together at all times. 
good,"It was a very nice place to work at, had nice employers and employees really enjoyed working there."
good,I loved working for Chicos. I was cared for and I had fun while working. I loved the people I worked with.
good,"Being an Assistant Manager is alot of hard work, but you learn new things every day. You have to  be able to help customers and make sure they are happy."
good,This fast paced store is fun and challenging. Our customer base is very loyal which adds to the positive work environment. Management goes out of its way to make sure we have the tools we need to perform our jobs effectively. The only disadvantage I have had working at Chico’s is that it is very seasonal. The season is very short and schedules are dramatically cut.
good,"Great Company to work for! knowledgeable leaders that are invested in the growth and development of their teams. Financial benefits with working for this company, you are paid hourly and are paid commission per sale opposed to meeting minimum quota."
good,If you're into retail sales Chico's FAS is the way to go. The base pay at the time I was employed was slightly above minimum wage but they have a decent bonus structure based on your sales.
good,"Chicos was overall well balanced place to work,learn about all aspects of managements,  public relations, inventory of all the products and how to deal with team members."
good,"Fantastic work environment! I have learned many software products and Instructional Design, etc. Great CEO and Leadership team, compassionate people, many fun and innovative events that also help the community. I am only looking elsewhere so that I can move back to Sarasota/Venice area."
good,Great company! Customers are great and I love the product. No benefits for part-time managers. Its very fast pace and when there are changes to be made in pricing they dont give you enough time to complete.
good,"I love my store great workers , always smiling. Always make sure to make you feel comfortable when shopping. We always have amazing coupon deals within the store!"
good,"Great managers and staff, company is based out of Fort Meyers Florida. I enjoy the challenges I face everyday  working in the distribution environment."
good,"Great and fun place to work...catering to the high end shopper. "
good,"Love my customers and work place .  Have a lot of good work advantages.  Chicos is all about the workplace and keeping customers happy"
good,"It was enjoyable working for the company, the associates and management were very professional. I was sorry to leave but there comes a time when personal responsibilities out weigh the needs of the professional responsibilities."
good,"Even as a part-time employee at Chico's, I was entitled to receive health benefits.  I received a base wage plus commission on all the sales I made.  The management was caring and helped me to improve my communication and sales skills.  I'd work there again.  It's a good place to be."
good,"As a whole Chicos FAS Inc. is a great company. We strive to make sure our customer is at her happiest on a daily basis. The amount of time we put in with our cross-functional partners to create unique, yet modern merchandise is clearly shown off by the smiles on our customers faces! While being at Chicos FAS INC, I have learned to time manage, work ahead instead of on current timeline, priorities all my tasks, and overall build strong lasting relationship between customer, vendors, and co-workers.  The hardest part of the current position is to make sure you are always aligning with all your partners. This can be challenging as merchandise changes and still need to make delivery dates/deadlines. The more organized you are the better you are able to allow exceptions without hurting any of your other partners timelines."
good,Professional job with wonderful people. High energy with a can do attitude.  Great place to work. Wonderful quality of Clothing and Jewelry with a combination of quality work from employees make it a joy to work there.
good,Chico's is a great place to learn and grow. I currently work at a high volume store and it has been a wonderful experience.
good,"Boston Proper had great associates and it was wonderful to work with such amazing employees."
good,"Sales on floor, recruiting, hiring, payroll, scheduling.  Coaching team to make the day."
good,"Great work/life balance. Fun job, great customers and co-workers . Nice discounts. Would have liked FT hours & benefits but almost all positions are PT. Mornings can get pretty busy but nights are extremely long & usually slow."
good,"A typical day at work was I always had more than enough work to keep me busy during work hours which is something that I like and I knew what my duties were when I started my work day. I learned the different ways to search information in database, catalogs, and on the items sold. Management was a great experience because they made you feel comfortable when asking for help and needed advise about the job. My co-workers got along with each other which made it a great place to work and we always were team players. The hardest part about the job was looking for codes on items when customer did not send back the correct information needed for refunds or exchanges. The most part I enjoyed about the job was I could look at items in person, website, or on the floor and determine what type of clothing, shoes, handbags, or jewelry I would want to purchase."
good,"I loved working in the Rehoboth store. I was able to increase traffic, productivity and gross income for the store."
good,"Worked with a professional, talented and dedicated team which enabled me to quickly dive into new and ongoing projects. Enjoyed the opportunity to execute design projects from conceptual to completion stage, many times with minimal direction. I learned to collaborate and prioritize deadline driven projects. (Time management)."
good,"Set store goals for team."
good,"I work in the call center as a Universal agent, which means I take sales calls as well as customer service calls."
good,I had a large loyal clientel. I enjoyed working with the customers on a daily basis. The store manager was not willing to work with the associates and their schedules.
good,"My experience with Chicos is amazing! I love the company and when the time is right i will approach my supervisor for a transfer as a District Manager.  However, I want to see what other opportunities are out there. "
good,Chicos has grown into a company that truly values it's employees and respects the need for work/life balance. They recognize and reward hard work. The perks are unending! I have truly enjoyed my experiences there.
good,I loved doing the window displays and visuals for the store. Built great relationships with the customers! I love my team.
good,"Fast pace environment. In recent years encouraged work / life balance. The company recently added two cafe's, work out facility and healthcare on campus."
good,"I initially took this job as a temporary job while making some career decisions. While I definitely love the job and have enjoyed being part of the management team, I need to find a full-time position with benefits and a better pay scale."
good,"Good company, fairly easy job. Flexible schedules and great training. Be careful if you start working there through a temp service. You may have passed the temp services background check but when Chico’s offers to transition you, the person reviewing the background reports just judges based off personal perceptions and stereotypes. Again, how can I work here through a service that Chico’s uses regularly for almost 6 months, but when Chico’s ran a background check, now all the sudden you’re not eligible for hire. It’s the same background so something ain’t quite right in the Chico’s HR dept. Then on top of that, I was told Chico’s asked that I do not contact them. They must’ve forgot about MY rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Needless to say, I will be in touch."
good,I enjoy my team.  The customers are great and have enjoyed developing client relationships with them.  Helping with Style Set is one of my favorite duties.  I have the most amazing Store Manager in the world.
good,"If you love fashion, styling, shopping and dressing up than this is a good job for you. The distance isn't that bad. You end up getting use to the drive."
good,"Great place to be, no complaints on anything other than maybe some requirements for advancement.  Overall a really great place to be.  One of the best in the area."
good,Chico's has there on unique sells approach. Used daily to assist every customer and our team teaching and training therm.  Daily freight merchandising.
good,"Chico's is a good company with a good reputation.  Chico's has been in business for many years, and has withstood the test of time.  Chico's sells women's clothing, accessories and jewelry.  The merchandise is of a high quality with a variety of styles to choose from.  My manager was talented and fair.  My store had a strong base of repeat customers.  In a typical day, my primary responsibility was to greet customers and interact with them in the process of identifying their needs and wants and helping them to create flattering wardrobes.  I enjoyed my customers, and I also enjoyed my relationships with my coworkers."
good,"Chico's is a great place to work.  Our manager is so flexible, and I love working with the customers.  The Outlet Mall is 3 blocks from my house, so it made it attractive to work there, even though I had never worked retail before. I intend to work maybe 1x per month there to receive my store discount.  Most of the people I work with have been there for many years, which is unheard of in the retail industry.  But, that just accounts for the manager, she is so flexible and forgiving."
good,Working at Chico's is pretty easy they allow you the proper training to advance in your career as well as an opportunity to grow a customer base and idea of fashion. I learned alot about myself and others both employees and customers while I worked there. I think the hardest part of the job was making sure that you met quota each shift and dealing with some indecisive customers. I think the most fun part of the job was the customers that dont know what they want and allow you to go crazy with ideas and dress them up.
good,"I am so glad I started working here almost 2 years ago. I have made life long relationships and love my coworkers. The store is always so clean and beautiful. The work environment is very professional as well as management. The work is always simple, and never overwhelming. I genuinely enjoy my job at Chicos, and don't plan on leaving anytime soon!"
good,It's a wonderful place to work retail especially as the store manager the environment is very positive and people work together as a team I would highly recommend working for this company the benefits are amazing the people are amazing and the pay and benefits again are great!!!!
good,"Chico's is a wonderful place to work if you love people and know how to pick up quickly on someone's personal style. Being a younger associate it was favorable because women desire to be in style, but not dressing too young for their age."
good,"Absolutely love this company and fellow employees!  Management is amazing as a team, and their mentoring and training is one of the best in the industry.  Great opportunity for bonus if you can step up and rise to the challenge.  Advancement is there if you are willing to relocate to another store.  This team is like my family."
good,"I loved it, it was always fun and would always look forward to work, great management team and everybody was very welcoming when I was hired, steady paced so there was always something to do."
good,Great job; wonderful working environment. Management was very flexible with my hours. it was a pleasure to be apart of that team.
good,Many floor sets!!But it was great to work with a winning team!!! I also learned a lot!!I also loved one on one selling with customers
good,"I enjoyed working at Chico's. The Clients were always in a good mood and great employees to work with. I helped clients choose clothing, shoes and jewelry. Serviced them in the dressing room removing clothing the did not fit and bringing them new options."
good,Thinks could of been done better and fasten in a timely manner tif the buyers took a great interest in placement of the materials.
good,This is a great place to work and I love the people there. Creative thinking and taking ownership of your work is always encouraged.

good,"Everyday at Chico's was a fun, exciting day! The company gives the tools to be able to sell their merchandise and have fun doing it."
good,"but overall a great place to work, i've been with Chico's for 2 years now!"
good,Awesome management team! Great place to grow and advance. Co workers are friendly and always willing to help.
good,The manager has a tendenacy to not give out assignments to the whole staff. She has a heavy work load and tries to do it all by herself which leads to her to sometimes become stressed out while at work. She is a great person but needs to control how she handles her work load under pressure.
good,I enjoy working with people and helping them however I am able. I'd like to continue working at Chico's.
good,"Chico’s is a great environment for learning management skills, having meaningful relationships with clients, and a fun interactive job. I have learned and enjoyed this job for the past 6 years."
good,"Absolutely love working at Chico's. Only downfall is only being PT. I really would love to have a FT position. Other than the PT positions, this company is absolutely amazing and awesome to work for. This is a company that actually cares about the employees. We aren't just a number. District managers are amazing at teaching out and making sure each store is doing great."
good,"This is a great place to work. The manager is very understanding and professional. I would recommend to job to anyone.   "
good,"I was let go because a worker that was there permanently coughed in my face, which caused me to lose my voice for 3-4days. I called and explained to my hire dynamics supervisor and she told them a lie and i was let go.. saddest day of my work life in a warehouse."

Work on any reports, conference calls with district manager.  Making appointments with customers and collecting apparel that they would Love.  Checking appointment book for all associates.  Helping them with sales building.  Communicating with HR for any new associate information.  Receiving new merchandise, getting it on the sales floor asap.  Workplace culture was we all worked together and celebrated our customers and their purchases. Customers would dance to the music that we played and sing.  It was like a big party when we had special events for the customers.  Everyone Loved it!  Hardest part of the job was having to leave. They closed our store and changed it to a sister store with a younger demographic.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the big event celebrations for our customers and making the customers Happy!"
good,"Chicos FAS is wonderful place to work, with great benefits for management, amazing opportunities for advancement, flexible scheduling, great discount on clothes."
good,"I like this job and my coworkers, but I'm looking for something more substantial. With the right hours, an associate has time to grow and become more knowledgeable about products and customers."
good,"Hardest part of the job was managing the people along with doing my job.  More  opportunities for jobs to be offered to work from home/office, this would help with work life balance."
good,On site full-functioning gym on campus.  Great discounts at company store. Hardest part of any of the positions is during Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

good,"I had an amazing experience from my initial interview with my most favorite mentor in the world. The CEO, EVP and several other high level execs made personal visits to my stores and chatted with my teams and myself. Our suggestions were made into real policies and I was asked to sit on several roundtables to make a difference. I loved that you were valued and sincere."
