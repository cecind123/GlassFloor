rating,review
bad,I feel that the company has done a poor job of taking care of their employees'. The schedule is one of the most messed up schedules I have ever worked. One week on days one week on afternoons one week on night shift  stupid
bad,"It was obvious from the interviews and methods used Dow was forced to hire minorities. During the meeting/greet of the Department head he told a joke where the punchline included the phrase ""f*cking Mexican"", everyone laugh but me. This is the culture. I experienced during my 21 years of service."
bad,Always micromanage people. no balance between life and work. No job security they can fire you anytime. I've see people are forced to retire. Good for co ops.
bad,They don’t care about you and disrespect you you are no value to them.  Management needs big improvements micro manage everything you do your just a number to them they don’t care about and your family.
bad,It's a Job pretty much. Always being watched by someone who can't focus on their own work. Alot of work and things asked to do with no raises or appreciation.
bad,Global company with many opportunities to work across regions and functions while growing professionally. Strong commitment to workplace safety and best practices.
bad,"Training is Process flow diagram, and they send you to your unit.  You have six months to figure it all out.  Management could care less if you pass your review board.  They have thousands of other operators who will take your place.  Turn over is high, and there is an I don't care mentality through out the entire company.  Engineers run the place.  Operators just follow there lead, like it or not.  They usually don't know anymore then you do."
bad,"Terrible place to work -- I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemies. Micromanagement runs rampant, leadership is terrible and often replaced so never conistent."
bad,This job they are hiring for right here is its own work group. This is not a foot in the door to Dow and other jobs. They promise all sorts of things to you. They have too many workers not going anywhere at the top. The bottom of this work group is a revolving door. The swing shift you have to work is not worth the pay and loss of time you go through from your family on weekends and holidays. This job is a waste of time and only should be taken if you need to put food on the table.
bad,Worked with several engineers and was always busy entering in data and collecting information while working as a team.
bad,"Unfair treatment of workers. Management walks around all day trying to start trouble just to justify their jobs. If you accept a distribution job, it doesnt matter if you are close to getting your degree because you are locked in the block for at least 2 years before they will let you go. You are just a number at this place. If you like throwing your hard earned money in the toilet and pulling the handle then join their union. They really stand behind their operators over there. My advice is to get your degree and then apply for a job in a process plant (a process plant far away from Dow Chemical). They are the lowest paying plant in this area and expect the most from their employees."
bad,"Site logistics is a very cut throat environment. Very high employee turn over going back at least 10 or more years proves that nothing has changed. Operating Engineers Union has little or no backbone to stand up for its members."
bad,I was employed with Jacobs engineering group for 16 years at Dow SCO Before taking a Dow position.  One day I was brought in and was told I was being sent home because my job is being evaluated.  A week later I was told my services were no longer needed. I had four out of five ratings on my annual reviews I was never put on any action plans for  insubordination. Terrible leader ship because of the high turnover rate
bad,"This company was horrible from the start. They promised the world to people only to get them there to try and sway the contract in their favor. Once the contract was settled, they cut all overtime and after 3 years the good paying jobs are going to be 16 to 17 an hr. to work with very dangerous materials. And anyone new hiring in loses all advancement opportunities.  Very ksnobby company. If you are not in the cool group. Theywill force you out. They like to get rid of people within days of their probation period being up, because the union can do nothing for you. Very weak union as well. You can tell they are more for the company than the employees.  Worst mistake I ever made was working there."
bad,"Ever since Dow has taken us over, I am former Dow Corning employee, it has been down hill from there. We are losing experience people and getting college trained chemical tech or whatever we find on the street to try and run this place. They make very hard demands on personnel and then we can not complete the expectations due to no product or no money. The Engineers are stressed and over worked and demands are high on there time. Its is hard enough running with so limited people that we can not seem to get the smallest of tasks. Have set up a system that makes maintenance of equipment impossible to get done in a emergency and would rather leave equipment down instead of paying overtime."
bad,"I worked in Core R&D and was responsible for Tooling Design since I have 30 years of experience, 3 years at Dow Chemical."
bad,hardest thing about moving stuff is lifting but other than that i work with a good group of guys i like to mite new people how to pick up heavy stuff
bad,"It's ok to start and get an intro into the industry but there's alot of backstabbing, game playing, and manipulation from management amongst the union employees. Pay is decent. If you keep to yourself and do your job you should do fine"
bad,"DOW has global wide technical issues, outdated tools, and a we don't like the way we do it, but we don't want to change attitude. The company spends a lot of money and time on inclusion and diversity, and they need too. The people are not kind to others, and often shut people out, or refuse to assist them. Long time employees run the show, and keep it in the dark ages. Management was awful, gossiping, unorganized and unethical. There is no advancement, don't bother."
bad,Was extremely unhappy there and was not offered help when I asked for it he was no help and they made me feel unwanted and stupid on a daily basis swing shifts were hard to manage
bad,"I would stay far away from here. Do yourself a favor and find a better place along the ship channel unless you just want to get some operations experience. They like to micromanage, salary personnel does not like union hands. We have fought hard against them just to get a fair cost of living wage. They are low down and shameless."
bad,"Overall, if you can get past the disregard for ""normal"" workers and act like a robot, than this company is for you. This was before the merger, so if it has changed, that would be nice."
bad,Literally the worst organisation I have ever had the miss fortune to work at in my life with staff so clicky my ears bled. No organisation with very poor leadership and some still living in dows heyday that finished years ago and total neglect of the site financially. I cannot think of anything positive about the firm especially its management.
bad,Directs are useless and couldn't survive in the real world outside of DOW.. Very Slow paced.. where has been  Structrural Designers go to retire.. They use Smart Plant 3D which is like shooting urself in the foot as far as productivity is concerned..
bad,"- Management is out of tune of issues on the Operations floor. "
bad,"The pay is not as high as most. Job security is not good, there is always somebody in management looking to fire you! An operator at Dow Freeport is viewed as a expendable commodity, you will not be respected and views and opinions will not be heard. The company says they are all about safety, but, the first time you put in a safety suggestion you will be told that "" we don't have the money to fix the problem. The company is all about engineers and contractors. The contractors here are more highly regarded than a operator and if you want to move up you'll have to have an engineering degree. Don't come here!"
bad,"This company was working on a large project with Saudi Arabia, which they hired practically all contract people in the procurement department.  We were not allowed to assign a PO unless it was reviewed by the Saudi Engineers and DOW Engineer Project Managers and then it was entered into an old system that another department entered the orders.  There was probably 18-20 Buyers who were all trying to get work done, but it took us 3 - 4 months just to get one PO out the door because of all the red tape they wanted to go through.  I learned that there were too many meetings and reports that had to be done each week, which interfered with doing my job.  Most of the Buyers were great to work with, except the young contract people they put over us who were horrible to work with.  They had no professional experience and talked down to all of us constantly.  You never knew who was really in charge.  There was no enjoyable part of working there and I would never recommend anyone to work at DOW on that project.  Maybe the other DOW Procurement group has a better system, but this project was the worst."
bad,"Unless you are desperate for a job, dont work at Prentiss. Management will grind down your moral so low that when you are driving to work you think about switching lanes and hitting one of the semis head on.. Its that bad. Bonus's are a performance award, (which if you do nothing wrong even send an email that can be perceived badly will be near zero) pay is good for a 4th class plant in central Alberta, but dont ever ask for a raise. They do send you on cool training trips to the states and such, but when you get back they scrutinize every receipt you have like you stole from them."
bad,12 hour swing shifts poor management porta johns hazmat suits low pay under minded by management operating in below-freezing temperatures without proper insulated clothing rain and snow
bad,Dow ran off of what they called empowerment.  It gave the operators the run of the unit with guidance on how to accomplish the correct specifications for the products.  The bad side of this is that there is no mentorship or training programs.  Employees are given a book of questions to answer to learn how to run the plant.  The employees were very hostile towards each other.  No one worked as a team.  Everyone was only in it for themselves.  I was miserable for four years.
bad,Stay away from Dow this place was as toxic of a job that I have ever seen.  The engineers are cut throat and they want to make you look dumb.  No team work and plenty of blaming people.
bad,"This company is laying off Canadian workers to beef up Indian office staff. "
bad,Do not report any issue with your supervisor. HR is not your friend. You will be moved and fired eventually. Claiming no position is available for you. Supervisor will black ball you so that no one else will want to hire you. Nothing you can do about a negative Performance Review even if it is untrue.
bad,"A culture that does not value shift workers and maintenance staff. These individuals are seen only as drones who have no input on day to day or long term decision making. The result of this culture is demoralizing. They claim to have an empowered workforce, this unfortunately was not my experience."
bad,To much work for one person to do and they want more for less  management does not know what’s going on and the pay is so low here you can get the same pay at fast food
bad,"The pay is about 10% less than most other plants in this area.  Some managers are alright, but all upper management treat you like garbage.  Every contract has to be negotiated very hard as the company hates unions and does their best to get rid of them.  The 401K match and retirement are less than every other plant around us.  I would not recommend working here unless there is no other plant job you can find."
bad,"Where to start.."
bad,I worked very hard every day at this company. All other workers at my unit were so worried about themselves and there advancement that they did not care about one another and would do and say anything to make themselves look better. 
bad,"Tijdens een TA waarvoor ik was aangenomen, werd ik na 4 dagen gevraagd om vrijwillig bij de Arbo-Arts van DOW te komen. Dit netjes toegezegd, reden was vanwege de fysieke beperking. Ter ondersteuning van het lopen gebruik ik een kruk. "
bad,"I've heard horror stories about this place like cut throat, messy, un-professional, back stabbing, unethical behavior and over all stagnant career path unless you like cafeteria food. This place is a mess, get in get paid and get out. Don't discuss your business with the admin staff and half the employee's are sleeping with each other. Loserville"
bad,co- workers were  great but the site attitude as a whole  was bad. It strated  at  the very top.  Facilities were  terrible many beyond a state of repair. Many practices on site were ethically and legally questionable at the expense of not spending money and keeping headcount low. I can’t believe this site hasnt  been closed by now. I am so glad to have found s better job.
bad,"Management doesn't seem to care about the safety of their employees. Retaliation is in full force when bringing to light your concerns for not only your own safety, but the safety of your coworkers. Always had to worry about making it home alive, with the carelessness and immaturity of a coworker. Higher ups did absolutely nothing about the situation. So while the pay is good, the worry about dying when you go into work is NOT worth the paycheck."
bad,"good MNC to work for. with lots of real-life work related / practical experiences. handled virtual logistics, along with creating excel based reports for maintaining KPI , and used SAP MM."
bad,"There was a lot of nepotism in my dept. These individuals would walk around all day while others such as myself would strive to complete their work tasks to be complete, accurate and well done. The mindset there was that 'they really didn't care how well the work was done' but rather they were interested in us turning out multiple projects regardless of how well they were put together! I don't perform my job that way!"
bad,Its a cut throat place and almost no room for any advancement.  Its a who they like place there is no work/life balance and harsh punishment for the smallest things
bad,Clean up after techs
bad,"Inside the plant libraries, there is always so much to do.  "
bad,"Dead end in Midland, it’s Dow or McDs  everyone knows your business and personal life  "
bad,"Management has two different contractors working on the same projects.  One of the contractor group undermine the other contractor group. Management calls it competitive why the contractors call it back-stabbing each other.   One contractor in charge of other contractors.  They will micro-manage the different contractor group to the point where they either quit or get fired.  They call it contractor has ended.  "
bad,"Studies for legal patent abuse. Ran and picked up samples from plants to analyze for plant support."
bad,Horrible company to work for. Everything i was told in my orientation about what to expect as far as promotion and pay increase was completely false. They DO NOT promote from within the company. You must know someone in a high position in order to be hired on full-time. Management usually contradicts each other and will write you up for anything they can find in order to get rid of you.
bad,"As such, many of the managers do not have a clue how to manage employees.  Some managers are great, but those who are not are allowed to continue to make decisions that damage morale and counter many aspects of the culture that the company claims to promote."
bad,Too many chiefs not enough Indians. Poorly managed plant. Very hard to advance in your role. Production has to work 12 hour rotating shifts while every other departments  works normal 8 hour day shift.
bad,There is practically no life outside of working for this company due to its high demand of overtime  you are required to work.  There is a lack qualified trained personnel to help you.   You pretty much learn as  you go
bad,"no job security, high-stress level, no career opportunities, not a place for season people, a good place for right out of college or resident of the area, good people from days gone by, too many middle managers with self-reasons for personal agenda, cutthroat environment, layoffs occur frequently"
bad,Once you've made it past a certain point you'll figure out you've trapped your self in the worst company in the Tricity area! Low hiring wages and no room for advancement make a pretty decent job a nightmare. You miss out on family life and events regularly. Management is a joke forgetting where they came from and what it feels like to be on the bottom. So please please PLEASE do not apply here keep moving on!!
bad,"Typical day as a process operator starts at 4am. Make shift relief and read logbooks, master task list, check emails, moc's and any other computer based Dow tasks that upper management seems to think are more important than anything else before 7am morning meeting. After wasting close to an hour on the computer that is shared with the other operators, you rush to make your rounds in your plant, check your equipment,collect and analyze  your samples. Then with maybe 5 min to spare, your able to use the restroom before the daily morning meeting begins. Then the fun starts. Day staff and operations go around talking about the importance of the MOC's, EAT's, MyLearning modules, BBP's, and so on. Basically your told you have more paperwork and web-based work to do on top of doing your job as an actual Operator. After 45 min or so, you then proceed to issue and safe work permits to the contractors who have standing and waiting patiently for you to walk out and review the job scope of whatever they are trying to work on. After all the permits have been properly written it's usually time for lunch. Eat, then go outside and work, help out other operators if needed or whatever you can do to keep yourself out of Operations' crosshairs. It seems as if they get bored lying and backstabbing each other by 2PM, so they come into the control room or go outside( if the weather is nice) and look for something your doing to say is wrong, unsafe, not effective and so on....by 3 you start getting things prepared and finish up your tasks the next shift so they aren't stuck doing what you couldn't"
bad,"Not my type of company, they tell you to be careful but rush you."
bad,The Human Element does not exist no matter what you read or hear. To many changes in Management~ they only have their eyes on the next higher level job.
bad,"Company is currently too large and they do not communicate to their employees. There are too many groups involved in a single item, thus making the item unresolved for months."
bad,"I did not enjoy my time here"
bad,Very long hours and poor management with little to no care for the employees working the long 12 hour rotating swing shift schedule. Safety wasn't taken seriously until after someone would get injured or the process was stopped.
bad,"Batch process that can be very busy. Major issue is the management and day staff could care less about Operations. The Operations Leader and the Production Leader are always first time managers. This site is known as a trial ground for management which leads to poor leadership and poor morale. Very cut throat and zero support from management. You are made to feel that you are below day staff on a daily basis. Some great Technical Advisors and there are a few day staffers that are good to work with but until there is a culture change in management it won't get any better. Most Operators are very good folks and are very helpful but very competitive trying to get a day job. Training is a joke, very disorganized and no outlook as to what positions need to be filled leaving glaring gaps despite Operations asking to get people console qualified. High turnover ratio. Excellent safety culture with zero tolerance for unsafe acts. If you need experience it's a good place to start and then leave but unless you have an engineering degree don't waste your time because Dow in general does not value anyone without an Engineering degree. Period."
bad,"Not a good place to work.  They work you long hours, more than 50 hours a week.  If you are not in the click, then you aren't treated fairly"
bad,This was a great company. The issue I have is the forced ranking for raises.  It causes drama at the work place. The work life balance was absolutely perfect.
bad,"Most employees are overworked because we are understaffed. We are managed by an accounting firm that knows nothing about the chemical industry and therefore the bottom line seems to be all that matters. On the positive side, the employees that I work with are hard-working, highly intelligent, goal oriented, work driven professionals."
bad,"Dow is a great company, but this position at the Midland site is very poorly run. The decision makers are rarely around to see what really takes place while work is taking place. The people in this position are also treated like dirt by at least half of the upper level employees, and this site truly exemplifies that it's better to kiss butt than work hard."
bad,If your going to work here I would do it as a contractor. employees are disgruntled and in constant fear of loosing their jobs.
bad,About 12 to 16 hours per day. Company worries too much about shareholders. Cuts too lean when economy is bad but doesn't expect a drop off in productivity.
bad,I worked for Dow for only a few months. Swing shift became unbearable to balance with visitation with my daughter. Also very long hours for minimal pay and no benefits.
bad,To much micro management. Co-workers back stab each other to much with the new hires. They don't look out for one another as a team should. Poor training techniques for new operators coming in.
bad,"The company are known for over loading their employees with work however fail show their appreciation through rewards which causes employees to feel unappreciated and unhappy."
bad,"Shift is 5am to 5pm, swing shift."
bad,Currently locked out. 2nd time working for Dow in operations at different sites and it's still the same nonsense. Dow only cares about salaried personnel.
bad,"Dow is a great place to work as long as the department you work for doesn't get stuck with a leader that isn't worthy of the job. There is no HR department at Dow anymore, the leaders run everything and do not follow proper policy and procedures. If a leader is horrible they do not get rid of them they put them in a department that no one else wants to lead and let them do whatever they want. "
bad,"Low opinion of this company, but that may be biased as its not dissimilar from other corporate cultures. Much to much of time is wasted in meetings justifying others employment.  80% meeting that were non-value added and 20% actually doing job."
bad,They expect you to work 50 plus hours a week but will only pay you for 40. People will stab you in the back to get ahead. It was very competitive and a bad working environment.  Most people are extremely stressed and unhappy.
bad,when working there I was in a similar field is electric boat setting pumps in working order and repair the same as well as building keeping maintained
bad,"separation of salary and hourly workers"
bad,"Lack of structure.  Micro-Manage, Tedious tasks, mundane work experience.  No sense of accomplishment.  Many emplyoyees stay contract for long periods of time with little to no growth opportunities.  Strict work environment."
bad,Pay is very good and benefits are average.  Formal training is somewhat self guided.  12 hours shifts 48-72 hours per week.  Leadership has little to no formal management or HR training.  Company has a tendency to say one thing but expect another.  Resulting in a tense work environment where operators are blamed for things out of their control
bad,"When the work load was heavy, it was a great place to work."
bad,To go up in this company you need to be able to play up to the management. Your skill or hard work mean nothing ! 50% + are looking to leave there.
bad,"High paying but completely lopsided expectations put on employees.  Management believes they are kings.  Company thinks they own you when you sign on with them, thus expect 50+ hour work weeks, extreme output (world class as they put it), a complete work focus with contempt given for outside interests, expectation of a Type 'A', alpha-male ""leader"" personality, with contempt and a condescending attitude bordering on arrogance expressed towards other types.  Forced ranking performance system with accelerated promotions given to 'gold' ones; with others being stagnated and eventually forced out.  It is an 'up or out' system.  No longer a place to work an entire career - just go there for 5 years or less to get the large company experience and then move on.  The headquarters, Midland, MI is a rich, conservative, stuffy place completely centered around Dow.  Do not go there for life balance, variety, individual expression, or anything else unrelated to Dow."
bad,"I took this job because I thought it would be better for my family and it has been nothing but bad. The only good thing about working here is the 9/80 and flexible scheduling options, and the pay is not bad. However the insurance is mediocre and the 401K is not that good. They have some smart technicians and engineers but the management is terrible some are grossly incompetent. The culture is very passive aggressive and people will smile and laugh with you as they are stabbing you in the back."
bad,The lab at Louisville was old and in terrible shape all 2 years I worked there. Improvements were very slow and management was always moody. It was inconvenient that the most helpful individuals were in West Virginia.
bad,"Dow may be an evil corporation, but they have pretty good people working for them.  however, as with all things, do not work there as a contractor, they will treat you like dirt and expect you to smile about it."
bad,Work there is not enjoyable  The hourly people there will try and get along and work together but it management that makes it bad .  Overall it a place
bad,Managers suck. Can’t talk to you directly only tell people to tell you what to do can’t do it face to face. Lack of management. People stab you in the back.
bad,Not very friendly work environment.  Different departments have Silo Cultures.  If you are in the wrong department - you're in trouble. Do thorough investigation before accepting a position with this company.
bad,Seems like the direct hires do not treat the contingent staff with same respect. The management do not listen to contingent staff suggestions and morals of contingent staff are low.
bad,A lot of meetings consuming the day and then after meetings there was the regular work that had to be accomplished. This consisted of filling out production reports on the unit and then doing assigned tasks from the meeting you attended all day.
bad,"There are some people in management not qualified for the job ,there's a lot of unsafe areas inside and of the mill area ,needs a lot of improvement,would not advice employment there."
bad,"The compensation packages are generous but you will work for it.    All employees are expected to be able to work late hours, weekends and be reached at all times.   If you are married and have children it is often a difficult choice between family and work."
bad,the work is good but there can be improvement in the management. not bad for what it is. work is not that hard and the environment is ok til it get hot.
bad,"You can take it from me as a 5yr contract employee working in R+D. Kelly Contractor is a euphemism for a different term “permanently temporary “  in Midland. I knew a lot of  fellow contractors there and I never heard once  anything positive said about Kelly Scientific. I heard a few neutral comments some  of which I made myself. I didn’t realize how bad it was until after leaving there 3yrs ago. Dow treats contractors poorly and  hands out pay cuts to contractors only,  in 5% increments. That’s right, with time your pay goes down not up. They will still hire new contractors at their going rate which isn’t a lot .I went though only 1  of the 5% cuts, but some went though 2 or more. Dow hires a few contractors but a minority. If someone wants a full time job, they should look elsewhere. The Kelly administrators will never be your advocate on anything since they don’t want to  offend their big cash cow in midland. I am glad now I’m doing dignified work elsewhere and not a kelly livestock contractor.."
bad,"Typical Public American company.....job security is a concern,"
bad,In una tipica giornata di lavoro si ha la possibilità di entrare in contatto con persone di diverse estrazione culturale e persone da tutto il mondo
bad,I wouldn’t recommend anyone work in this unit. Management does not appreciate their employees. They work them to death and are constantly adding more to their plates. They do not care if you have time home. They do not care how much good you do they only dwell on mistakes. They expect perfection from their operators but day staff is not accountable for anything. Operations are treated as laborers.
bad,"To move up from entry level positions, must have four year degree.  Not a great place to work if you want any type of family life.  They seem to go out of their way to make schedules that screw workers and management."
bad,This company has lost it's focus on work and work related issues. They are more concerned with shifting positions to other countries rather than to focus on true value to customers and products.
bad,"You will get the feeling, initially, that this is the most dangerous job in the world.  Once you drive through the gates, your life is in extreme danger, so watch out for everything.  Because of this safety mindset, I'm surprised work actually gets done.  "
bad,Dow does prepare you for a job somewhere else.  The culture had dramatically changed over the years and I would not recommend anyone work there unless you like being just a number.
bad,UNION SITE EQUALS LOW PAY. Low pay compared to the area. wage adjustments for prior experience are available but the requirements are not cleared at the time of hire. Pension is a subject no one could truly explain.
bad,Safety is not a priority of leadership. Mid-level management is consistently incompetent. Employees who display job competency are routinely passed over by those who do not for promotions.
bad,"Schlechtes Betriebsklima, hohe Fluktuation von Zeitarbeitskräften, werden mit Versprechungen gelockt, die dann nicht eingehalten werden. Zum Teil Mobbing gegenüber den Zeitarbeitskräften."
bad,"Worked here for almost 7 years, in that time we had 4 different production leaders and engineers swap out on a yearly basis. I also had 5 different bosses in that time. Every day showing up to work you really had no idea what to expect, communication between management and employees was lacking. The 12 hour swing shifts were hard to get used to and making time for personal activities and appointments very difficult. Co-workers were the people you saw the most in your life, so they kind of became your family."
bad,"I worked at Dow in Sales and Marketing for 20 years advancing to the Director level. Many good friends. Develop your mentors and watch your back. The company is a multinational old boys club with more cliques than most Junior High Schools. It's a great place to work if you are an unsophisticated apple polisher. Be ready to do a good job, look good in the shower and kowtow to the local Lord."
bad,Typical day at work is wriitng safe work procedures for maintenanance to be performed and puuting equipment back in service once maitenanve performed or clearing more equipment to be tagged out for more maintenance. Making rounds and checking for maintence problems is important part of the daily routine.
bad,"Dow pays great money and has great benefits.  The Emergency Services and Security Department does not have a good reputation, and lays good people off about every 5 years.  They out sourced most of their positions to contractors who pay terrible wages.  You are exposed to dangerous chemicals.  The building they operate out of is down wind from the smoke stack that burns all the dangerous chemicals, which travel into air system of the building.  This organization has seen its golden era come and leave."
bad,Dow's culture has changed for a self directed workforce where taking risks in research was appreciated and respected.  Now they seem to prefer the Micro Manager.
bad,i was in the shipping location and it is very hectic at times management not being able to prioritize  and organize when trucks come in for pick up pulling order pickers away to help load trucks and making 3 or 4 trucks come in at one time when there are only 2 loaders sometimes 1. safety is a good thing but they are overdoing safety pickers having to where gloves to pick boxes and write on paper having to wear hardhats and safety glasses while picking up boxes and low pay for to much learning computers being a lead having to learn how to ship over seas and do all the paperwork is not worth the pay but as long as you do your job you can listen to music and get a nice learning experience to move on to a bigger and better company
bad,"Swing Shifts will always make you feel tired and is terrible for health. Its not the Dow of old where you can make a career out of it....really hard to advance especially with merger with DuPont. Great co-workers though, kind of feel like family working with the same shift for a while."
bad,"Pro's and Con's of working here. biggest con is job security, they are always letting people go but always hiring. Makes it difficult to feel secure. Work environment is poor, open concept. Noisy & distracting"
bad,"Cut throat, back stabbing.  Only follow safety rules when people are watching. Not a place of integrity.  No help when you encounter a problem.  Broken system but "" I learned it that way so can you."""
bad,"I have learned a great deal about finance as it relates to a customer's risk versus reward for Dow - analyzing a company's financials to determine the credit line Dow can support for that customer. Unfortunately, I do not have a heavy enough workload and seem to have too much down time."
bad,"The work process is sound but the implementation is poor. There are a lot of reactive/fire fighting works, inefficient and gaps through out the process. It takes forever to get a job done. Management do not knowing day to day ""real"" issues, have no desire addressing the issues, and do not care about employees long term career development. Annual budgeting is poor. Project execution is terrible. Cost control is swinging so much and out of control. Warehouse performance is terribe. Many good engineers have been quitting their jobs. The company hired many 8-16 years of experience engineers but having zero background of chemical and refinary. And it is not surprise to see that it takes 2-3 new senior engineers just to fill in for one open position. And the negative trend keeps going."
bad,"Ruled by iron fist sadly. no concern for employee welfare, HR department is non existent. forced to do plant cover with no reward or recognition. however job is well paid which is the only thing positive about Dow currently"
bad,Dow Chemical in Hayward Ca purchased Rohm and Haas Chemical Company. Dow was in the process of switching policies and procedures to mirror all Dow companies. Dow policy is to have half Dow employees and half contractors.
bad,"They pride themselves on the excellence of ""safety first"" but the employee is last. They are below industry standards in pay. As people retire they are not replaced. Instead, remaining employees take on the responsibilities."
bad,Dow has an ethnics problem with some of there employees and management . It is a good place to get some experience and move on if you are a new hire.
good,we don't do anything here.  the culture has to get better.  there are new employees that is just starting and they are trying to establish themselves in a leadership type of role
good,"Making sure traffic is directed to and from work are, make sure nothing is coming in and out thats not approved, management was ok just didnt come out much and check on employees or provide the right tool to perform the assign job task. enjoyed the people i interacted with. and love my work hours."
good,ok for a first job they teach you well but there pay is behind the times when you work for Dow you learn a lot Safty is very good at DOW and it’s a very safe place to work
good,"Responsible for handling raw material orders, 3-party liaison; tracking inventory.  Tracking customer complaints and find a resolution."
good,If you are higher up in the business than working there is great but if you are apart of the lower scale than your days are numbered.
good,Pump out the pounds. That is the name of the game for their chemical production division. I learned how to drive a fork truck much better. The most enjoyable part was working by your self at your own pace.
good,"Dow seemed like a great company to work for, Training is not great, typical workday is pretty steady and you have to learn how to manage your time. everyone isn't held equally accountable, the most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with our contractors"
good,They will train you and teach you and brainwash you pet you play the best of the best employees. Then they change your minds and go a different direction and want contractors because it saves money don't matter that there's no job over shape anymore and they just beat it together and get out of there call it fixed. Ownership made the equipment last longer when it was installed properly and discovered what the failure was and quit fighting the fires.
good,"Culture is still legacy Dow and is very slow to change.  Attempts to introduce new ways of business are thwarted by the legacy that feels threatened since they are still in position and ultimately not adequate to operate in today's new workforce.  Until the legacy is removed, change to position them with true top 20 companies will never happen."
good,"You only will succeed with the company if you have family that also works there. If you want to know what your chances are of staying in your job, search your last name in the company directory. If the directory is full of people with your same last name you will be mysteriously successful."
good,"You can't really put down the whole company because a block is bad.  The company is so large, each block is like a different company. So I cannot really say how the whole company is on this review."
good,"Working at the Dow Chemical Company, for me, was very. Interesting. It was easy to create relationships with my coworkers because I saw the same people every day. In the downtime, the workload was almost nothing, so it was very hard to find things to do when the building is shut down for cleaning. You have to be very precise with your job and all of the things they want you to do."
good,"Most employees don't do much work so you have to pick up their slack."
good,Company is good. Very diverse. The work load is ok depending on which department you work for.
good,"A lot of paperwork"
good,Company gets into finacial hardships by bad decisions in mergers then start lay offs to recoup losses
good,I have been at Dow for 4 years. They have a high turnover rate ... Just read in between line. Most of the mangers are very sensitive. I am hoping it will get better.
good,"The Process & Control Specialists (P&CS) team worked tirelessly to share information and support each other to ensure that the project management and forecasting database that we collectively maintained was accurate at all times."
good,Season Employees destroy new employees. They delight in their failure. New Leaders have something to prove and destroy their subordinates. Leaders are looking out for themselves.
good,Good place to work if you are young and white.Good pay and benefits. Tons of mandatory overtime. Hard to have any kind of a social life. Company plays favorites. Lots of boring safety training and stupid testing. I hated it there.  They didn't treat me fairly. Must work literally all hours. Hard to get enough sleep.
good,"Dow is a good company to work for overall, easy work but attention to detail and safety is critical. Lots of time off with a Rotating schedule but also a ""con"" with a rotating schedule sometimes having to switch from day shift to night shift in the same week, depending on which rotation you're on. Unfortunately at this particular plant, its more about who you know and who you're friends with more than your work ethic and abilities. The ""Good ole boy"" system as they call it is strong here."
good,"Started their thinking I would retire form their, but straight in the door you are treated as an outsider, and are expected to train yourself with minimal guidance, getting reprimanded for not knowing when you didn't know what you needed to know.  Promotions are not the same as in other companies I have worked for.  Other places when you get promoted you get a raise with it, not true for here.  Even though you are the candidate they picked, you still need to prove that you deserve the money for the role you are now performing.  A promotion is strictly a pay increase, not a role change with more responsibilities. Management, while there are good and bad managers, they way they go about it only benefits the managers.  Managers stay in their role for 2 to 3 years, then move on.  Great for them, not for the people who stay in the same area.  This cause the daily dynamic to shift, so that what was once the normal way of doing things, changes to suit the whims of who's in charge now.  This also creates work load increase since the managers are climbing the ladder, they need to institute new programs to add to their accolades, great for them, but the works are stuck following these along with all that came before and what will come in the future.  I wanted to work till retirement, but the compounding workload increases the stress and my health continues to decline."
good,"Regardless of what you do at the Dow Chemical company, your first month to two months will be nothing but trainings and safety seminars.  Every three months or so you will be retested on these items. In addition, whenever you are promoted or transferred, you need to undergo this process again.  "
good,"good job, managed poorly.  You can make a lot of money but your home life will suffer.  If you have kids that are active you will miss a lot..  the job itself isn't bad but there moral makes it hard to give this a better than mediocre review"
good,A warehouse job that has you on your feet all the time. I was able to lose weight due to having to walk through the whole building to get to my work place.
good,"My day consist of packing thousands of pounds of different plastic additives(Powder) in different size bags or containers.  I run samples of the batch that we are running.  Sometime I do grade changes to run different batches. Once the powder has been packaged I or we load on trucks by forklifts.  Frequently I will make labels for our batches, review procedures, write safe work permits for our operators or for contractors to do various repairs or servicing."
good,"I work smart and hard to meet my goals.  Am 25 years overdo for a promotion.  As a female, I do all of the heavy lifting and my male bass gets the promotion.  It’s very much the good old boy network!  I gave 30 years of my life for pay for performance and never got a promotion."
good,If you are unable to adapt to change on a consistent basis then this is not the place for you.    Every six months you will be wonder if you will have a job or not due to mergers/acquisitions.
good,"Production over safety and pay. This company does not value its employees, the community around the facility or its industrial neighborss.  If I did not have so many years with the company I would be and I am looking for another employer"
good,"Generally speaking a good company, even if with very low growth opportunities."
good,Buy out everything is unorganized. Not a place for advancement. Swing shift not a plus vary hard on sleeping. All about bottom line not the workers. It is a job.
good,"I work in the lab almost everyday as a lab tech.  My main duties were to restock the lab with chemistry and equipment, run the small scale electroless line, and occasionally analyze electroless copper parts.  There is a high workload for one tech and 3 other PhDs who work with me.  90% of the time I will be working on my with experiments handed out to me.  Learning about the process is interesting, but I will not learn anything beyond the structures and reactions of the chemistry involved."
good,"Dow was a decent company to work for, however I feel that I was under paid. I did have the opportunity to work from home if necessary which was a great benefit."
good,"A great company has a long history and many breakthrough innovations, which changes people's life."
good,"The group I worked for was well-intentioned, but inexperienced as it relates to EPC work.  They are years into this effort, but are still developing processes and guidelines that should have been in place before beginning this venture."
good,If you are unable to adapt to change on a consistent basis then this is not the place for you.    Every six months you will be wonder if you will have a job or not due to mergers/acquisitions.
good,"Organized, initiator, detail and knowledgeable of work expectation and the change of management was not always fair in how they conduct business regarding the employees."
good,"A typical day at work is customer service which involves weighing vehicles in and out of the plant, answering phones, signing visitors/contractors into the plant, complying with safety regulations, emergency exercises.  My co-workers are male.  It's very much a male dominated environment."
good,I worked with them for almost 14 years and i did love my job. The people in my dept was a family and we all took care of each other. I worked to my hardest to make Dow happy with me and do my best.
good,"Empresa agradável e ótima pra se trabalhar, sempre está em As melhores empresas para trabalhar da exame. Bons salários e benefícios. A parte difícil é conciliar o trabalho com a vida pessoal, pois exige muito trabalho, quase sempre extrapolando o horário comercial. "
good,As a pipeline contractor this is a good plant to start off in safety is their top priority and everyone is entitled to a opinion when escalated to the right personal.
good,"The job probably fit me the best. I was good at it. I brought in millions of new commodity business on service and value. Only trainee to bring in new business. Became #2 in the department, #1 had Dupont as a customer. No one cared. No one. Had 1 wonderful boss who didn't have any political clout.Then I had a complete jerk so I quit. They couldn't retain new sales people. That was ok because there was no where to go. Midland? Please."
good,"Most employees are not happy with management and hectic, demanding  work there.  "
good,My daily work day varies on what activities the plant have going on.. I am a Environmental Technician for 6 plants.  I cover all their waste and water water needs or issues.
good,Great place to work with good people. Pay was too low considering the commute from any of the surrounding metropolitan areas. There was no room for advancement and wages never increased.
good,"Ambiente bueno, excelente escuela para empezar a trabajar. Inicio de carrera"
good,I had a daytime work schedule while continuing my college degree which worked well for the time I was privileged to work there. Samples for testing had very specific guidelines to follow.
good,Great place to work with flexible hours. An open office environment to allow for interaction between fellow coworkers and other departments. Opportunity to attend additional training courses.
good,"Good training programs"
good,"Stable company for over 100 years. Though, management culture is old school. Bad location for offices. Work life balance is poor."
good,"7 nights in a row (12 hour weekends), then 48 hours to transition and be ready for 7 days in a row, then 5 afternoons. "
good,"High management turnover, different messages through the layers of management"
good,"On any job i find out what I have to do, how I have to do it, & the time limit I have. I talk when I can but mostly I stay quiet and focus until it's time to leave"
good,"Great pay, and benefits. Dow Chemical is a large stable company that is relying heavily on it's work forces commitment to help it sustain growth.  Dow could benefit greatly in improving their training programs as well as advancement culture."
good,I am very busy at work. I spend a lot of time working after hours when i need to complete things. I believe the culture of Dow is a good culture but needs to be leveraged over the entire company to ensure that company values are met by everyone. I love working with the technicians and figuring out the problems in the Oil and Gas industry and pipeline.
good,Great group of employees. The 24hr turnaround is hard on employees. Company has good employee standards.
good,Large matrix organization that allows employees to learn many new processes and systems.  There are a lot of opportunities at this company to grow and learn new skills.
good,Dow is trying to create a better culture but it will take a lot of change in the people that have been spoiled a very long time. I hope they are able to reach their goals for the sake of the people that want to enjoy coming into work.
good,"If you are willing to move to Midland, MI there are ample opportunities with plenty of opportunity for advancement.  Good school systems, supported by Dow.  Opportunity for travel if desired."
good,"Great place to work if you fit the mold. Both effective and ineffective managers. Shells of employee resource groups aimed at providing an impression of diversity. Sustainable investment and resulting compensation. Great people, but heavy pin the work processes that are sometimes a detriment."
good,The management is easy to work with and they are quite safety conscious. Overall the working atmosphere is comfortable and allows for personal growth and improvement.
good,Empresa multinacional de alto nivel para desarrollo profesional.
good,The Block I was assigned too had issue before my arrival with Management. Operators would try to transfer every chance they could get and the feuding between operators and management created a stressful work environment.
good,"They are always restructuring and laying off people.  Security is an issue with this company.  If you are retained, it is a good company to work for but they are always moving folks in and out of there."
good,For the work that u have too do everyday the pay could be better for the  employees.I come in at 7 and work until 3:30 i have too work wirh the nurses for 4 too 5 hours than i have too clean up 7 bath rooms than i have too clean 5 doctors office than the break room than the area were the patient comes in at than take the trash out than i have too clean widows.
good,Overall a good place to work depending on what business you are in. Most managers only stay in their role 2 years and promote up so you really never get to know your managers. If you do not have a bachelors degree there is very little room to advance.
good,Ok to work for . they are a good company to start at and they take care of thier people. Large company that has a good safety culture and want the best of their employees.
good,12 hour days can earn you alot of money. But poor Management and lack of proper training. Would cause you to stress and work extra days to cover for manpower.
good,This company is a fast paced chemical company with many opportunities for an individual wanting to learn. The various activities the company is involved in offers multiple opportunities for engaging in advanced business processes.
good,Decent company. Good benefits and vacation packages. Long hours and no work/life balance. Very strict with rules and regulations to the point where you can barely work.
good,"Enorme entreprise, on a eu des formations dans la pétrochimie intéressantes mais le management n'était pas optimal. Pas de possibilités d'évolution car il a eu le crash des tours jumelles."
good,"Great learning experience and co-workers are fantastic. If you are good at your job, you are given more and more work. Which leads to great exposure and experience, but also burnout and lack of quality recognition. There's work to be done in ""walking the talk."" A lot of hot-air when it comes to management actually supporting and utilizing the benefits available."
good,"good place to work but very risky due high attrition in the units"
good,"Internal politics available otherwise working atmospheric good , learning lot of thing      "
good,"I am a contractor for Dow.  There are no benefits.  They are mainly only hiring contractor because they do not want to pay benefits, vacation, 401K etc."
good,great company. worked inside in the a/c. Worked at night/day. New management turned the place.Co- workers were really friendly. Would go back in a heart beat.
good,"At the moment I work constant 12hr nightshift. A typical shift is usually running 2 production lines which can run at various speeds."
good,".I learned how to run the plant from inside and outside. Learned how to catch, run samples and make adjustments from the results. Learned good troubleshooting skills, preventitive maintenance skills and repairing equipment."
good,"strong culture, resulted oriented, good people, good management, everybody knows the company strategy, very well communication flow."
good,"Newly purchased from Texise, DOW automatically encountered conflicts with long term union. Labor disputes forced company to shut operations in parent location and to keep operations going, a temporary plant was established until a new automated plant could be built."
good,Dow needs to improve on it's human resources department. People are leaving to seek other employment in droves.
good,It's the place I go Monday thru Friday to work. It is a job that offers good health benefits and paid time off and allows me me to pay my bills.  They are trying very hard to be culturally inclusive.
good,"Did not have the best experience. Started out good, but things turned sour after a while. Workplace cultures vary from business to business. I learned a lot while working there."
good,"Gestart in de zomer vakantie en veel verschillende collega's die niet allemaal de moeite namen om je te vertellen over de werkzaamheden, de training etc. Mijn eerste mentor heeft me ook niet goed begeleid gezien hij zelf in training was voor paneloperator en me uitgelegd welke route ik moest volgen. "
good,"The Dow Chemical company is a pretty decent place to work. There is a great deal of overtime, vacation given, 401k and even a pension. Excelling in the company can be pretty difficult."
good,Company very much values family and work life balance. They also love to give there contractors time off in an effort to save money. The people and workers are great and the atmosphere is great though.
good,Swing shift is ruff on the body and dow changed contract details 6 months after being hired. They have some good management but out look on advancing diminished.
good,Career opportunities that you have to put your time in for. They pay fair for the work and skill level needed to do any job you’re doing. Benefits are good. There is some form of sick leave and until you hit a certain level you earn your days off. Management can be difficult but usually are good and can be helpful. You do work a swing shift in most of the plants and that’s a difficult thing to get accustomed to and it’s hard on a family life usually.
good,This was a great place to work. The pay was excellent and I met some cool people while i worked there. I was a contractor for 3 years. I was offered a full time position but I wasn't able to accept it due to the rotating shifts.
good,"Dow offers a lot of programs to develop young scientist however, if one does not have a PhD promotion will be very difficult as you continue to grow in your career."
good,"Its good company to work specially giving work life balance and flexible  working hours."
good,Company is always looking out for the safety and health of employees. Top notch for environment protection also. 
good,"They will work you hard but pay you well.  The work environment provides all the tools needed for success, but the company is addicted to ""cost control"" so they routinely fire about 10% - 20% of the workforce to declare financial victory."
good,I gave this company three stars due to the fact the upper management is so bottled up. They do not make rational choices very often. They want you to move up in the company but with hold any communication with the upper management.
good,"DOW is a good company to work for. They have good benefits, a good stock options program, and they pay very well. But, it not all roses. Each individual leaders expectation can be stressful to their employees. The work load is fair and so is the management. The workplace culture sometimes is weak(that is per individual), but as a whole its fair. The hardest part of the job is meeting leader expectations. The most enjoyable part of the job is, once trained and certified, doing the job you've been trained to do. A typical day as an operator starts with making a complete unit round to verifying unit status followed by preparing for any maintenance activities, collecting lab samples, and so on."
good,I met a lot of nice people who worked here and had a nice experience.  a typical day at work involved technical computer and analytical skills.  I provided answers to scientific inquires.
good,"Was eindelijk blij om na bijna 3 kwart jaar solliciteren dat ik bij DOW kon beginnen en ben daar open ingestapt en afgewacht wat ze van mij verwachtte en anderzijds het opleidingsprogramma welke ik moest volgen. Echter heeft de begeleiding gefaald en ook de juiste terugkoppeling naar mij."
good,"A fast paced work environment. I did prefer fast paced over slow paced. Over time was a definite advantage and appreciated. The constant shift changing was not good for work-home life, mental health nor physical health. This company was very religious and tried to force religion upon employees. Discrimination was then then exhibited.  Benefit package was very good as well as compensation."
good,Imposes their culture on acquired businesses and moves as many legacy Dow employees into the management positions.  Workers were wondering when the axe was going to fall on them.
good,The most challenging effort was to support integrated disciplines between other plants. There was an issue with the teams being separted and not truly integrated. There was a disconnect with management initiatives vs. internal project management.
good,"I got a chance to learn a vast number of different skills during my many years at Dow."
good,"Typical day at work wasn't too hard, kept you busy for twelve hours, basically putting powder in a bag or pack. Learned how to read the BDS and make sure the product went into the right package. Co-workers are good they are lively depending on the shift you are on, some are useless and some actually work, but management wont do anything about it because they don't have a backbone. Management is lacking, they play favorites and its basically a ""what can you do for me"" mentality that they look for before they promote you. Hardest part of the job is dealing with their disregard for safety yet the say they are so advanced and focused on safety its sickening. They actually go out of their way to not fix problems rather than suck it up and fix it to make the employees safer. the next hardest part would be dealing with the political tango of how to get promoted and whether or not you even want to move up in a company that doesn't appreciate your hard work and the only thing you essentially are to them is an employee number and a dollar sign. other than that the most enjoyable part of the time is the people that you work with, mostly because your all trapped together that it actually does make it fun to make the best out of a bad situation. God have mercy on your soul if you work there."
good,"Some departments in Dow are very good.  Many are not. I had some very good bosses, but most were not. In recent years it has been plagued with indecision and an almost constant state of reorganization."
good,"Working with Dow chemicals is  really a nice experience, The Dow staff and the team with which i was associated with is extremely supportive and co-operative."
good,The Dow Chemical Company is a nice place to work with plenty of new and exciting business niches.  There is something to be learned around every corner with the vast amount of R&D and manufacturing.
good,"This is a good job for some one that just needs to get the experience. For the most part the plant is stream lined with very little personnel. They like for their operators to change valves, gaskets and other minor repairs to the unit."
good,"Flexible toward a beneficial work/life balance and an identifiable safe working culture.  Salary and benefits competitive with local industry, but job security seems to be poor."
good,"Conducting timely and standardised experiments."
good,I work for people via Virtual Offices in and out of state.  I miss interacting with people face to face.  I have learned at The Dow Chemical Company how to communicate better via e-mail and oral communications.
good,Excellent benefits & good technical mentors.      No value on diversity of style or opinions.  If you don't fit in here you are best to move on before you're moved out.
good,"compensation is not bad.   very bureacratic."
good,"Good place to work if you don't like to be busy or can't handle stress."
good,"A typical day for me is from 7:30 AM to 6:00 PM.  We are a very busy, fast paced office.  My co-workers are great and I enjoy working with them as well as my Managers."
good,Analyze and assess market trends and needs. Develop opportunities through consumer and key brand owner understanding and Market Blueprinting exercises. Create and validate Critical Success Criteria for new products. Implement innovation plan; leading cross-functional teams. Formulate and implement participation strategy for key markets.
good,i worked a small time at Dow  it was one of the most spread out industrial site with a huge aspect focused on safety... was fast paced environment with great community of workers
good,"I learned a lot about project management and the product scale up process. However, a lot of the politics and bureaucracy quickly got frustrating. There were people who were deemed 'favorites' who seemed to get the preferable opportunities."
good,Great advancement to move up it’s a job not the best but it has its perks ... think they could pay employees starting out more but after you move up good pay & benefits
good,fast paced environment. safety driven. Quality driven. Hourly pay. Six sigma. 3m capable. Lock out tag out. Maintenance staff. Fast paced environment.
good,Company merged with Corteva Agriscience. Long work days (12 hour shifts). Learning a great deal about Dow products. If you looking to become an operator this would be a good company to start.
good,Ive been at dow chemical company for just over two years now. My pay is good and my schedule is great. My coworkers are great. It can be a bit boring at times
good,"Was on okay job, the only issue was that all the operators got their kids hired and then their kids got the promotions and it was impossible to move up if your family wasn't in the company. I saw a lot of good people get turned down for promotions, and simpletons would get it. But it paid well, and was safe."
good,The site has very poor management  and doesn't really have basis for progression. There is a lot of targeting and retaliation throughout the site from managers to employees.
good,"Your boss really makes a difference on your happiness as an employee. I have had both pleasant and unfortunate experiences. Bosses can block or bless you next career move, and once they make a decision it's hard to change it or get around it; you're pretty much stuck."
good,"Very safety focused with high chance for promotion if you're ambitious and focused in your work. Don't go through a temp agency because you may not get hired in. High turnover rate, but a very safety oriented organization with a good training program."
good,Large corporation where management follows a structured format with not enough outside the box thinking.  There seems to be a tendency for micromanagement.  Safety is the number one priority.
good,"good company to work for, but job prospects, training opportunities and advancement are very limited unless you are willing to relocate to a larger site. Salaries are good. Company culture is mostly fair and respectful of diversity."
good,"Many opportunities to learn and develop your skills in the chemical process industry.  Many talented, experienced people (technical and non-technical) worked there."
good,"Overall, the culture is driven from the top down and it takes a VERY long time to change. Still an old boys club and the company is not going to change anytime soon. Seems like the company doesn't take action on the ""under-performers"" so there are many who are just riding along and do little work."
good,"Despite Dow Chemicals in Terneuzen is a very nice multicultural place and working there is very enjoyable, the matter that most of employees are hired by recruiting company and are being replaced just before the first contract is finished (in order to avoid permanent contract) make this workplace very unstable for many employers. Moreover, the communication between the management and recruiting office and between the recruiting company and personnel can be interrupted, which ends in miscommunications and dissatisfaction of the parties, As a major employment source in the region this is a very unfortunate condition. Apart from that the relations between the employees is generally very nice."
good,Very large company but the sites where I worked was less than 1000 people therefore it was not difficult to get to know most of the people and get help when needed
good,We was sold. The new company does not have a great 401k. You have to put in $750 to get just $500 a year toward your 401k. Definitely could be a better 401k
good,"Worked four 10hr shifts and had a nice three days off. Started early and ended late. Some people got along, others were distant or like to cause trouble."
good,"Dow is a great company to work for but the Pennsauken plant is not a typical Dow plant, Every week is a new adventure to complete customer orders, fasted paced production line, all team work."
good,The company has good benefits.  Two years ago they added a good vision program. My most enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers and the constant use of knowledge.
good,Not right fit for me.  Short handed requiring excessive overtime from all in the building.  Second hand knowledge that the lack of employees is a problem throughout the plant.
good,"Dow department management allowed me to set my own goals and goals for the department.  My organization was results focussed on deliverables including service, value preservation, and innovation.  Group and personal performance did impact rewards, however corporate performance was the overriding factor in determining pay increases, bonus, and promotions (in a given year)."
good,Company is going through several spins a lot of uncertainty! With the merger of Dupont the work has increased with not enough people to do jobs. People are wearing multiple hats.
good,"They are very safe oriented. I like going to work for them as they have every employee`s safety in mind. The pay is competitive,and the employee`s are easy to work with."
good,"The company talks about work-life balance, advancement, caring about people, but the bottom line is the bottom line here.  That environment works well for some but not others."
good,"It's a good place to work, with great benefits. Sometimes I felt opinions of lower level employees were not valued. But that may have been an issue with just my group."
good,"A very interesting maze when you get inside. Very strict rules about safety, make sure you follow them or you could be terminated. A high security place."
good,It's a great place to work when you don't have to constantly worry about your job or if it will be eliminated. It's a fast paced company to work for..
good,"they were good, there was a nice working environment. tHE PAY IS NOT THE HIGHEST BUT IT IS A FAIR OLACE TO WORK................................................................"
good,Good environment of work crew but management lacks knowledge of what actually goes on. Employees willing to teach and help others learn. Way to many chiefs and far to few Indians.
good,"Heavy workload with little recognition.  Disorganized structure, no accountability for persons that are not performing well. Act now think later atmosphere"
good,"O Projeto Dow Chemical foi dentro da IBM, onde atuei como Analista Intel e depois como DIspatcher, delegando as ordens de serviço de acordo com criticidade e skill dos analsitas e também com liderança."
good,Decent place to work. The jobs at Dow chemical are all very different depending on what plant you work at as they are all owned by different companies.
good,I worked for this company a very long time ago and really cant recall a great deal about the company or some of the management to give a fair assessment.
good,The evaluations were somewhat political and based more on hearsay over facts and real life examples.  I enjoyed most of my co workers and some of the managers.  Many employees felt as if they were walking on egg shells.
good,"pay is decent plenty of overtime. decent benefits. management and promotions suck. vision, 401k, medical. paid vacation and holiday pay. coworkers are cool to work with"
good,Big company where you are just a number.  Great place to work for advancement.  Working in chemicals is not for everyone.  Located in Midland Michigan
good,strict rules on time. Had to punch a clock to enter and leave and break and lunch times were monitored. Pushed for work to be produced on a quantity basis not quality.
good,"Very structured day regiment that include many learning sessions and the co-workers are friendly, but some management is ok depending what department they are over.  It was not the most difficult job but as new management took over it became very stressful."
good,I learned alot of how to use the tools you had and also didn't have a lunch break; was so busy didn't have time for one; and i had to eat at my desk when I had the time to.
good,"Ok place to work and develop. Job is flexible, opportunity to travel. Could be less hierarchical and while some places are micro managed others allow for plenty of breathing room"
good,"I would not like to divulge any personal or professional opinion of this company on a public site. Thank you for the open platform and information, but my opinions will be kept private. Cheers"
good,"Long days "
good,"Don't be a contractor when layoffs come around.  Even more experience, responsibility, and workload than new hires will not save you.  Contractors in Dow Engineering Solutions have at least one thing better than Dow-direct employees in that there is more actual engineering and much less project-status-budget-detail-tracking-TPS reports."
good,"I worked as a contractor.  It is not easy to get hired in.  For the most part it is okay, some times are really rough, as in any job."
good,"Dow businesses are highly structured according to role, process, and benefit to the core business. Highly organized with clear and concise business objectives."
good,Work environment is flexible with a strong management focus on the Goals and Objectives deliveries aligned to the organisation targets. Structured Performance management system with growth opportunities to the employees with proven performance records.
good,"The job was a good job while attending college. They pay was good and the easy."
good,"DOW Chemie bied je de mogelijkheid om thuis te werken. Je hebt een eigen laptop waar je ook thuis mee kunt inloggen. Dit kan erg handig zijn als je auto een keer naar de garage moet of iemand komt langs voor onderhoud aan je CV ketel."
good,You typically put in long hours but are rewarded with above average benefits.  Layoffs are rare so stable employment has long been a staple there.
good,"Work 8-5 M-F, i work in Midland MI and enjoy working in a close environment w/team. I have a computer, two dogs one son and a hubby. I love them all."
good,"Great benefits. 9-80 schedule. Very safety oriented company,"
good,"Large company with a strong focus on the environment, health and safety. Positive job site culture and community ties to the town and surrounding areas. Working for the semiconductor industry. Opportunities for growth and development available to employees."
good,"Great benefits, and pay, however the politics leaves a little bit to be desired. I was ""Downsized"" because of a medical condition of Migraine headaches. Although I cannot prove this, I feel this to be true."
good,"Corporate marketing related roles some of the first to be cut in downsizing."
good,"Dow has given me the opportunity to expand my experience and education globally. They offer a good compensation package and flexible working hours. The diversity and cultural interaction is wonderful. "
good,"This career has helped me grow professionally and explore new markets and customer segments that have improved my overall knowledge and experience.  Working closely with the government agencies and supporting contractor network has given me unique experience in a challenging market.  "
good,Keeping safety is a priority in Dow. There are opportunities for growth if you work in the right department and division of Dow-Chemical.
good,"Good chemical company, although the company is union based"
good,"Sat at a computer desk all day using various programs.  Learned a lot with Rail.  Hardest part of the job was working on the weekly reports, taking classes."
good,The day begins with a morning meeting and then i would manage the receiving dock unloading trucks with a forklift and entering data into the computer.
good,Co-Workers are awesome to be around. They have benefits given first day.
good,I have learned a lot from Dow. In my typical day I wear many hats. The chemical business is very demanding and this alone has helped me to improve myself in the long run. The most enjoyable part is that I have learned what all I have to help me to expand my entire breadth of knowledge in my entire field to include fields that do not typically belong to my career field.
good,People are great but the second level management is very poor especially the last 2 years. Don't feel like the job is secured at all.
good,This company was very uptight and not very good with diverse backgrounds.
good,"This was a co-op position, learned the aspects of being in an office and how to handle confidential information"
good,This company use to be a great company to work for. Over the last 20 years their values have changed and is not the company that it use to be.  At one time it cared for it's employees and the community this is no longer the case.
good,"Dow is a great chemical company that makes a lot of good products. Dow can be a fun and productive worplace, depending on department and particular position, just like any other large corporation (for the last 12 years it was great there for me; but nothing is forever). Often, things aren't well-controlled, optimized, and a bit chaotic; often, business decisions are made without deep thinking about long-term future, despite the claims of the management about great ""vision & values"".  Overall, Dow is definitely a good company to work for; but one has to be realistic about expectations. "
good,"Boxed up Foam Installation Cans for shipping and i leadned to work faster in the save rigth way told me to i had good co-workers that worked with we all was like a team and we got the work done really didn't have a hard do at this job but i really like this job , my just ended its nothing i did they just had to let somepeople go"
good,Enjoyed working with my co-workers. My division was very customer focussed.
good,My typical work at Dow as to review logbook as soon as I got there. Read and reply to any email that needed attention. Did Chlorine and ground inspections of entire block. Updated logbook with any findings and repairs to equipment that needed to be made. Put in work orders for any equipment that needed to be put out of service. Cleared and tagged out that equipment for repairs.
good,Performed Database and documented customer inquiries.
good,Worked assembly line
good,Not been there for a long while but it is pretty obvious that this organisation is run by engineers who are sharp as knife and do not have the well-roundedness among others.
good,"Dow's selling point is that you work less, family oriented and etc. They use the selling points above to justify the low pay. However, at the end of the day you will work long hours just as you would anywhere else. Dow is very understaffed in the engineering roles, so engineers spend a lot of hours at work. The work isn't hard but it is a lot. Dow wants to top the talent but are only willing to pay average. Also, they do not take the time to develop their new college grads. NCG will be thrown out to the wolves with little to no guidance. Again, not hard work but definitely a lot for average pay."
good,"My typical day at work begins with checking my daily schedule for any project meetings, meeting with any co-workers and any possible meetings with the user for details or data I may need to design my construction package."
good,Strong emphasis on safety
good,"After the company locked us out for two months the company culture has changed drastically. We were cohesive and now were just all individuals. We go up for a contract review again in 4 more years, who knows what's going to happen."
good,Nice place to work and culture is good. Hardest part of the job is the constant changes. It seems like you can never get proficient. Overall I would say it's a good place to work.
good,"Dow chemical company is a great place to work. But in chennai, India, local managemnet was not good. They shown partiality to some personnel. But all policies and work life balance was very good"
good,These are industrial jobs and as such can be dangerous and physical jobs.  Safety is a priority.  These jobs are generally working on a production line and can become monotonous and a struggle to get through the midnight shift.  Promotions are available but I found it to be very political.
good,"High Stress, Fast pace, Work overload, Too much OT, but that's in the block I work at, others aren't like mine."
good,"typical work day was pretty straightforward. culture was okay. during the short time I was there, I learned quite a lot and I was taught by several different people "
good,"Dow is another company that wants to 'do' Agile but are not willing to learn what that means nor make any real changes to how they operate in order to pursue Agility.  In the Chicago office, they adopted some of the Scrum practices, but if any of those practices interfered with perceived delivery, out they went.  The leader of the office was very much a disciple of 'Command and Control'but didn't mind if we slipped in a Daily Stand-Up meeting with the team."
good,"Working at Dow Chemical Company was a good experience. I was able to learn about the process operation of latex and latex byproducts, from loading and unloading tank trucks, to screening product."
good,"I worked as an HR Intern in 2017. It was a phenomenal experience and all of the people I met there were incredible, but due to the merger, they did not hire any interns from my group."
good,"environnement agréable a l’exception d'un technicien en labo qui dévalorise toute personne travaillant a ces coté , a part ça , entreprise au top pour ceux qui aime l'industrie de la chimie"
good,management needs to change and listen to the employees and have better training programs for craft worker so that they can move up when there qualified not when the boss finely thinks  your ready .
good,I was there for a short internship (3 months) and do not have grounded insights on the work or culture in the organization. My review is only based on preliminary impressions.
good,"Learned a lot of things during the Rohm and Hass tenure, but the ship began to sink once DOW took over drowning employee moral.  Newark, DE site had its pros and cons, but overall was an okay place to work."
good,"I worked at DOW for over 4 years. You are required to do shift work, while under their employment. For a younger person this is not a bad gig at all, but as you have children and a significant other it becomes problematic. Working nights/weekends/holidays takes a toll on a family. I attempted to promote through the company in order to get a more stable schedule, but the company doesn't allow you to move very much. They kind of hold it over your head like a carrot on a stick but never actually allow you to move due to understaffing and an inability to acquire new employees prior to retirement/termination etc."
good,I was  in a smaller plant so really did not get a good feel for the overall culture in the 'bigger sites.' Our site had a great culture that visitors really admired.
good,"Dow offers an excellent compensation package. And, if you're willing to relocate (particularly to corporate headquarters), there are definite opportunities for career growth and advancement. "
good,Plenty of growth opportunity. Busy. Enjoyable. Constant changes. Plenty of networking and volunteer opportunities. A lot of diversity groups to join. Opportunity to attend training classes.
good,International corporation known for a collaborative culture but clings to traditional values; salaries not commiserate with market; corporate headquarters located in Midland; closed culture.
good,Not Much to say. Just not my cup of tea. Poorly ran. entitlement rude not friendly conflict always no ownership to work lazy people stuck up people now
good,"I am handling personal and beauty care."
good,Liked my job very much. Pay was pretty low. Upper management leaves some to be desired. People there are very helpful and good about training others for new roles.
good,10 years for a development program is too long. give more opportunities to go to texas or lousiana or other locations. corporate jet is cool.
good,I enjoyed walking into work everyday.  I accepted both of my positions in the Dow Chemical Company without there being any training or work processes available.  I mainly had to train myself for both Dow positions.  I created a work process which was sent across seas. We had to train the new employees on the work processes that we created.
good,"Dow lets you manage your work life balance. Leadership has a vision for the organization & regardless of consequent changes in the strategy, Dow has been able to make shareholder expectations. "
good,"A typical day at work is fire-fighting more than usual because in addition to successfully delivering at a high level despite lack of resources, management in the environmental group often doesn't have experience in this field. The result is leadership that's out of touch with their staff's roles and responsibilities."
good,"Great place to work as long as upper management likes you.  lots of areas for in-house training but little to no support for off site training. I have gained knowledge of troubleshooting instrumentation, method validation, and quality control. I’ve work with many advanced technologies like Sulfur chemiluminescence detector (SCD), Capillary Flow Technology (CFT), and pressurized liquid injection system (PLIS). There was a wide variety of co-workers at Dow many are nice few are not. The hardest part of the job was always justifying your existence and the importance of your position. Since I started a career at DOW two plants where shutdown and lots of cutbacks. The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexibility to get the job done. No one was over your shoulder telling you what you should do and in what order. You had your job responsibilities and you needed to do them."
good,typical day consist of ordering supplies along with any clerical duties needed. stocking coffee bar and completing weekly expense reports
good,"It was for a start up job and learned so much over the years I was there from writing procedure to following all sop""s...they were not selling the product and laid us off"
good,It is really hard to become a permanent employee at Dow Chemical in the science/operator field. I enjoy my job even though I'm contracted in.
good,". We expect and nurture leadership in every employee as we challenge each other to be the best. Our commitments include:"
good,"A Dow Chemical é maravilhosa. O trabalho é realizado em um ambiente agradável, clima leve e muito descontraído."
good,"7 Midnight shifts in a row including weekends, 7 Day shifts in a row including weekends, 5 Afternoon shifts. The rotating schedule is a tough schedule when trying to balance family life with work life. This is the biggest negative aspect of my current career."
good,"For the most part loved working for Dow. Daily responsibilities were complete key account management.  The day depended on the problems, needs of the customers. I enjoyed most of my co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was working with some people that liked to throw people under the bus. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers and the sales team, and helping the company grow."
good,"Good six sigma training, compensation, benefits, work life balance."
good,"Good job, great pay and benefits, awesome coworkers and support staff, but management leaves something to be desired."
good,"Muy buena compañía de gran escala, el ambiente de trabajo podría ser mas colaborativo pero la escritura de calificaciones lleva a que sea un entorno de mucha competencia"
good,"Working in the lab is fun.   Coming to work knowing that I will be working with a team.   I'm able to relate to my co workers by being a sport fan, parent, or just be sibling.   I'm able to train on new equipment or learn more about upcoming events. I'm always willing and eager to learn more everyday."
good,Fun place to work. Stressful on most days. Management issues. Long hours. Coworkers that didn't have the same ambitions as myself and made it a tough work environment.
good,"This company was family oriented but after a few years, the family oriented way of life faded and it was like everyone became a number and your value to the company seem to disappear to never return."
good,"Dow Chemical had great benefits but it is located in a small town where everyone who lives there works for the company. The company considers itself a ""100+ startup"" and has slow growth."
good,"I enjoyed the freedom with accountability.  There was an opportunity to interact with many professionals working in different functions.  Coworkers are very good.  Managed Import/Export, Trade Compliance & Customs, and Sea/Road Transportation roles. I had to leave due to the mergers happening in the organization."
good,"good to working there, i got a solid knowledge in there"
good,"not a bad place to work. Just very unstandardized and lacks proficient training for positions, kinda of on your own for most learning and adapting"
good,"-start and shutdown reactors"
good,"12hr rotating shifts"
good,Great opportunities for career development and challenging problems that will contribute to continuous learning.
good,"Dow Chemical has changed oover the ears from a Texas company that everyone wanted to work for and retire from. However, with the world changes Dow Chemical is a large global company that has very flexibility for anything but the rules which is not bad. The problem is culture and people has changed and it is not as fun as it use to be."
good,"Monitoring the Process, issuing out SWP's. Isolating energy. I have learned to never take anything for granted. I am a people person. I enjoy challenges and I embrace them."
good,Enjoyed working there. Always busy. Great work life balance. Paid Holidays. Friendly Co workers. Great location and a well established company world wide..
good,"For the work you do it didn’t pay enough. To make a good wage you had to work lots of overtime. They expect you to work overtime there , but you better hope your body doesn’t brake down . They have no value for employees, expendable"
good,Great place to work. Flexible work environment with great pay and benefits. Lots of room for advancement as long as you have at least a bachelors degree.
good,Joined Dow as a junior chemist.  Learned preparative techniques in organic chemistry.  Supervised by a recent PhD.  His supervisor was a world renowned organic chemist (he received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in the 1990's).
good,"Had a great Manager, the environment was fast paced always a challenge which I did enjoy on a daily basis.  Never got bored and learned so much working here, unfortunately it was not a permanent position,"
good,i love the shift work with the 7 day long change off               the work place culture has changed so much since i have been here           some things good   /    some things are a little excessive
good,Depending where you live this may be the place for you.  For me it was a struggle going over the bridge every day.  The training dept. was the only thing I didn't care for.  You basically had to learn everything on your own and then were brutally questioned on the information. Was told if I didn't pass I would loose some money.
good,"Very busy being the only (WAC) taking care of 4 plants very Under staffed"
good,"-	Preparation of G.A Drawings and Isometrics based on P&ID   and plant layout."
good,"Stage batches, add powders to mixers, perform alot of specialized task: had poor management, had to think of fly everyday, dealing with chemicals everyday, lots of overtime."
good,"In Dow, you have the independence and ownership to run you business with your actions. You are not micromanaged and given the freedom to take decisions."
good,"Solely, I provided support activities for Oil And Gas Extraction.I worked LITERALLY 24/7 on call 24/7. Lead quality control, trouble shoot and initiate corrective actions. Maintain and assure proper and efficient operation of 13 gas, oil wells and related equipment (oil well pumping and gas/oil separation equipment, compressors, vapor recovery equipment). Schedule maintenance, pick-up, and delivery of chemicals, oil, and equipment. Document and report all readings, equipment status, and 24-hour production to three corporate headquarters. Perform minor maintenance and repairs to valves, regulators, pumps, etc.."
good,Dow has plenty of benefits and great health insurance. The zone that I worked in was very demanding and detail oriented. keep this in mind when applying.
good,"Benefits are great, good advancement chances also."
good,Diw was a great place to work. It is like family there . I looked forward going to work everyday. The management is helpful and always ready to teach.
good,Data entery was the task i was preforming. I would copy data from the web and paste into excel. The information was concerning biocides percentages in wells. This is a new addition to Dows marketing department.
good,"Fun fast paced job. Loading rail cars is a fun fairly simple job, management is usually willing to hear about work improvements. Good culture, friendly and easy to work with employees."
good,"not competitive as far as hourly wadge and bonuses with other plants. you will have to do many other things most operators don't have to do. that been said, great job security and safety is a #1 priority at Dow."
good,Loved working there and never had problem with anyone. Picked up non-stop overtime hours if asked. Was never late and never missed a day. Was very disappointed in my boss for the actions he took for my ankle sprain. That is literally the only complaint I had with the whole company.
good,although they get some low marks from me they are one of the better companies I have worked for
good,It was okay working there. Nothing special working in the plants. Whatever pays the bills. Small plant so cant get lost in there. Parking lot across the street so dont have to take a bus.
good,"A good company to work for, just don't plan on retiring here. There is no loyalty to employees anymore. The employees here make this place seem like home but unfortunately they are always trimming fat or making changes that force people out of the door."
good,Fast Paced production. Easy going work. Little room for advancement though. Nice job as a stepping stone in life. A very community oriented group. good if you want overtime.
good,This company is a very Big company with a fast paced environment. It is very hard to maintain a work/life balance but can be managed.
good,"Most positions are very stressful.  Management overloads the employees to see what they can handle.  Very little take tasks away, just demanding more."
good,"as above, not a great atmosphere, bullying rife with ineffectual management the main reason I left. Too much jobs for life expectations with little movement. very little training given, more expected to learn as you go but heaven help you if you made a mistake"
good,"Compensation was great but when change of management took place, the job became stressful and depending if you were apart of the elite social circle, also depended upon your advancement and performance award. The Production Leader that’s in place now wouldn’t be the ideal leadership that’s desired if the company is concerned about how well their employees are valued."
good,"Huge Safety Culture"
good,"I was hired to build Reverse Osmosis, but I was also a volunteer on the on the Safety Team and I was also a Trainer. They keep changing their system when I left. Therefore, who knows what they're doing now."
good,Friendly people in a productive environment but often susceptible to corporate stereotype. Contract employer makes job security feel weak but employee immersion is no worry.
good,"Receiving material from truck, UPS, FedEx, hotshot drivers."
good,"Very great experience."
good,"It was a fairly standard type of IT support environment for a chemical production facility which adds more potential workplace hazards. Due to the nature of the workplace, there was a large amount of on-call time, which complicated work-life balance."
good,Great place to work.  Everyone was nice and let you do your job. Very relaxed environment and working hours were flexible. Job was temporary and ended in 4 months.
good,"i joined Dow in 2014 as a technician. Here i received the best of the exposure which can not be achieved in any other industry. But this exposure is limited to only your job profile. For learning Dow is a great institute but the management is somehow the same. if you perform nobody cares. In any company to grow in your rank you need to perform but i have not seen any company working on this model. and same is here too those who lick will grow and those who work for company will remain as slave. "
good,DOW has a very strong safety driven base behind it. with the expectation that everyone goes home the same way they came in. management is going through a change and that in of itself presents challenges. Great pay and benefits
good,"Worked closely with Site Leadership Team to develop and set individual and plant Health, Safety, and Environmental as well as production goals and metrics."
good,Very clean and very modern factory.  The work is not physically strenuous but it does take a lot of mental agility.  An employee has to be able think and react quickly and learn to operate many computerized systems.  That is what I miss the most is the challenge of the job there.  Typically you are the only one you would see for most of the day though and that was fine it was relaxing.
good,"A typical day can vary greatly, and is part of what I enjoy about the company. Individuals are great to work with, and are very professional."
good,"Work life does have balance. Expect to be on call and handle more work than role description dictates. "
good,"Productive, and enjoyable place to work learn and thrive, good communication with several disciplines, pretty good management, really good design guides and design criteria, relatively poor in design calculations software"
good,"Corrido, instrumentais, razoável, ótimo ambiente de trabalho."
good,In this position I did employee physicals on new hires and also on executives. The hardest part of the job was actually doing some portions of the physicals due to cultural differences of the individual to myself. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting many people of many different cultures.
good,"The push to complete projects required long hours, but it was part of the processes to get project online and producing. "
good,"Most employees have a high level of stress due to the multiple roles they are expected to fulfill. Long work hours lead to less time to spend with family and friends. Overall, Dow does have good benefits and I did enjoy the role I fulfilled."
good,"Working at Dow is fun, but at the same time challenging as the whole company is going through massive changes during these days. Therefore many processes are not yet defined and have to be defined by scratch. Many tasks are operational and transactional for a highly educated resource."
good,"DOW is farming some of their engineering out to unqualified foreign sources.  Also, they have bought in to promoting LGBTQP which is inherently immoral."
good,"Everyone I worked with was very professional and not too personal, which I like and feel is appropriate. Way too many meetings that weren't really applicable."
good,"Great operations teams that really care about the success of the plant. A good combination of day-to-day firefighting, process improvements, projects, and cross-functional interfacing. Dow has many experts in-house for various fields, which is great for support and learning. Management can be rather heavy with a significant amount of red tape at times. As is often the case in manufacturing, the work culture can be rather old school and resistant to change."
good,My work at DOW was a contractor executing capital projects.  It was a low stress work environment and had a great nature reserve (lake) area to retreat to everyday for lunch.  This was the Houston Dow Center for engineering.  This review is not now applicable because is was so long ago that the facility had moved somewhere else.
good,"Very relaxed atmosphere, everyone was friendly could do as much OT as I wanted, was very understanding with my personal life and kids schedules. Fun atmosphere"
good,"Paid well but be prepared to have a limited social life. If you're career focused, then this is the place for you. Large network for new professionals. Culture is collaborative/competitive 50/50."
good,Do more with less... Operators often work 16 hour days and are forced to work most scheduled days off due to lack of staffing. The work can be very stressful and very competitive. Work with toxic chemicals that require wearing breathing air and full body PPE entire shift. Management sees Operators as numbers and replaceable.
good,"Job paid real well. Shift "
good,Good learning experiences with this company. Many of my co-workers were well trained and informed of processes and changes. I would recommend this company to others.
good,"Inspect equipment for damages and preventive maintenance.  Trouble shoot control valves and write work orders."
good,"Due to the lean workforce, we are able to train on most jobs to be as flexible as possible."
good,"They offer great benefits, but it's very hard to advance at all. They pick one or two operators and put them on the fast-track and don't even consider other operators. They've even made positions up for those ""golden children"" and put them in to a new position/shift without posting the position for others to get a chance."
good,"Tons of opportunity to learn, very helpful for new employees. "
good,"A process oriented company with a deep institutional knowledge base. Information technology is pervasive,  informs all aspects of the business."
good,"Work as a warehouse operator, good job.it needs a new job hiring process. It is a great job but needs improvement with hiring process. I am a good worker but feel unappreciated there."
good,Working in such an international and differentiated environment has made me improving bot personally and academically
good,Dow maintenance is multi craft trade which I enjoy very much.  This allows you to have a very diversified skill set.  I doing anything from rebuild pumps to plumbing to instrument calibrations. The work is great.  The maintenance group has a sorry union and each person is not treated equally like it should in the union.
good,Co-oping at Dow has been a great experience. I’ve learned a lot of new things that will take me far once I’m out of high school. Working at Dow my senior year allowed a lot of opportunities to rise.
good,Working at Dow has been a great experience.  The culture in Plaquemine and the company overall is very positive.  The company is very flexible on work/life balance but the plant life can still be demanding at times.
good,"Good environment to work in"
good,"I enjoyed and learned a fair amount when fresh out of college. Great benefits, good management. Just make sure you are fit in the right role it is difficult to succeed without prior experience in the area and industry."
good,"Dow is a good company, but the position I currently work in is designed to be a stepping stone to move on to process. The benefits and pay are fair, and you will be able to go to school for process tech."
good,This review is not relevant to today as it occurred over 12 years ago after Dow took over Union Carbide.  There is nothing more to say other than Dow moved the jobs from Connecticut to Michigan which was move that cost a lot of very talented people dearly.
good,good place to work kind people all around good experience. the people were so good there can't get over the people. Did I mention the people so good I mean it the best people out there.
good,Job was working in a box.  Some of management mico-managed and caused unrest amont employees.  Most of my group were contract.  Several were let go during my employment.  Not sure if you would have a position sometimes.
good,"I started my career in Midland, MI. moved out of state for spouse promotion and after some time ended up back working for DOW Chemical in MN for one of the subsidiaries to DOW."
good,Pay is great for the area. Rotating shift are hard for family life. For me personally the drive to Charleston is too excessive. There is not a lot of ways for an operator to move up. Most operators stay operators for their entire career.
good,"Great company, with strong views on ethical practice and safety for all employees. Personally, I had poor managers, 4 within 2 years. With the merger my position was eliminated."
good,"I consider lucky to work with the company, providing exceptional opportunity to learn new technologies. The managers have the flawless operation of where want the company to go. Definitely would recommend for starters looking to make a career in IT."
good,The Dow Chemical company continues to be at the fore front of technology and innovation. They take the best care of their employees not only on a business sense but also their mental and physical well being.
good,It was a great learning experience and I love the developing culture of the company. I learned that I am more than a translator and that I can do and learn new things every day.
good,Dow is a good company to work for. If they didn't close down I would have stayed for a very long time. If you get the chance you should work there......
good,Relaxed culture; New challenges everyday; Great pay; Truly a chemical engineering company given that chemical engineers are in upper management; Efforts to build community amongst workforce
good,I really enjoyed working there because it was fun and a got a long with the other employees and I learned how to load a c-can and the proper maintenance on a forklift
good,"DOW Chemical treated me good while I was there.  Comprehensive pay, excellent benefits, good balance of work to time off ratio.  I would work for them again if possible."
good,If you are a self-starter and motivated by your own performance you will do well here.   Those needing more direction/guidance may or may not get it; likely to struggle or be deemed incompetent.
good,"There are many positives at Dow as well as many negatives that will need to be considered.  "
good,A comfortable workplace with seasoned experienced employees. they utilize the most current and appropriate software with constant feedback from and training for employees.
good,Had the opportunities to work in multiple functions of the petrochemical industry from manufacturing to technical services and Process Engineering.  Company has a strong focus on safety and technical training.
good,Great learning environment. People are always happy to help you out and exchange ideas with you.Freedom in thinking approach is a big factor.
good,Nice environment to work in.  Very big on Safety.  They are very concerned that you go home the same way you came to work.
good,"Dow is a career-focused company, providing enough options and departments to allow employees to get a wide variety of experience throughout their years."
good,"It is a big company and it takes a lot of effort to get ideas off the ground and into implementation phase.  It is by far the safest place I have ever worked.  I was never concerned about my safety or reproach about speaking up about safety issues.  Depending on job location and time of year, work schedule can be demanding but the pay compensation is average - above average."
good,Dow is a good company to work for. Good pay for those without a college education but have a strong work ethic. Good benefits package.
good,very focused on safety. make sure that u show up to work and leave safely. also very clique tho. if you werent in the right clique you had problems
good,"Nice, understanding management. Co-workers are great. Lab I work in is very clean as we test low concentrations of Metal contamination."
good,"There are a number of roles around the world to the qualities vary widely.  Typical big corporation - decent benefits, above average job security, snails paces change culture."
good,Ik heb bij DOW Chemicals Terneuzen altijd met veel plezier stage gelopen en hier ook enorm veel geleerd.
good,I have learned a lot from my management team about all aspects of my every day task that I perform. I learned more about inventory control and to understand obout our products.
good,"Self directed work days."
good,"Fast paced, challenging and rewarding every day."
good,Over all a great company to work and develop networking skills around a larger then life chemical company. You can have any number of experts help you with any project that you are struggling with in person or on a WebX meeting. Dow EM formally Rohm & Haas Electronic Material is a the forefront of Electrochemistry and open to new ideas & process improvements one hundred percent of the time.
good,"Grew as a professional by working in manufacturing of polymers and chemicals, moved into environmental affairs managing a tough regulatory period of our history which required facilitating a paradigm shift from the old way of managing chemicals and the environment to a new more closely watched managing business."
good,Co-op employees have a great place to learn the skills needed to help them through future.  I had a wonderful time learning from the people that I was put around to help me.
good,"A highly desireable place to work with professional engineering development, challenging project opportunities and growth potential while solving complex engineering problems."
good,Great place to work. Coworkers mostly get along and the company put a big emphasis on the safety of the employees. The pay is very good.
good,"Great opportunity to learn about a large billion dollar chemical. Many, many moving parts that can help you grow as a professional."
good,Good company to work for but their Global push is making them not only leader in the industry but also a not so family oriented company anymore.
good,"You will work on many things from customers samples, product improvement/development, team projects, safety, they offer many online classes and training."
good,"It's been a great learning experience assisting with a global company's SAP system upgrade.  I helped with blueprinting as well as data cleansing for each region's upgrade.  Understanding the complexity of compliance for a global company has been an asset for any many roles I would obtain moving forward.  "
good,Proud to work at Dow but I think the overall short term focus of Dow is frustrating and the leadership vision does not meet my expectations. Dow's safety standards and practices are best in the industry.
good,"Great working environment, excellent cooperation between employees. Good benefits , great location, easy access to west side of town."
good,"The Dow Chemical Company is a giant corporation that looks after its employees and is definitely a family-friendly firm. Although I only work in a very small sector of the company as a contractor, they have brought me on and treated me as though I already work for Dow. The management style is different with a laissez-faire approach. The working environment is rather independent with weekly meetings on goals. Since we are doing research and development, everyone knows their role and what needs to be done from day-to-day. The only thing here is that they will attempt to keep you as a contractor as long as possible to cut costs on their end."
good,"Dow is a Giant Company. Everyone is going to have a different experience based on the time and place they are employed. For me I was never in the right groove for it to work out, by the time I got a stable position and appropriate pay progression I had already made other plans. However, I would recommend it to anyone willing to pay their dues and stick for the long haul."
good,it was a good experience for the 36 years of work met a lot of very nice people there(very professional) and knowledgeable people . made a lot of friends there.
good,Most of the emergency services equipment that is needed.  Day staff tends to hide information from shift members.
good,"Overall, Dow is a great company to work for.  The wealth of knowledge from vetera employees is exponential.  If you take the time to learn and want to grow your knowledge this is a great place to start."
good,"Nice people; "
good,"great place to work for and to learn various job skills."
good,Loved this job!  The hardest part of this job was dealing with individuals who were not team players.  I loved dealing with my suppliers and coordinating shipments.
good,"I started out part-time at Dow and became full-time 8 years ago. I did various type of jobs. I liked working with the Exchange Accounting Group.  I saw many accountants come and go in this department because this group was part of the rotational process. I enjoyed meeting many different employees. Since I was older and most of these employees were new to Dow and just out of college, I was know as the ""Mother"" of the EST group. I was told many times, I was the ""glue"" of the team. It was very difficult to leave this group. But management had to downsize and I was let go. I loved my job with this company."
good,Dow was an excellent place to work with all co-workers and management working with each other to get the job done in a safe and efficient manner. Safety was always the number 1 priority at Dow. The most enjoyable part of the job was making sure all materials was on site and correct before the project started. The hardest part was getting some of the long lead items on site when needed. With extra work when necessary this was always accomplished.
good,"Estruturada, focada em inovação e muito ampla, possibilidade de atuar em diversos mercados."
good,"Translation/review/approval of SDS Documents in Italian, Croatian, Serbian, Slovak, Czech, Hungarian, Romanian, Slovene language"
good,"•Serve as interface between Commercial Purchasing/Product Supply Managers, internal clients, work process, transactional systems and the suppliers."
good,Working at Dow has changed the way I think and how I work about doing different tasks everyday. The people I work with are helpful and are always willing to listen to concerns you may have. Theres plenty of room for advancement in different carrer oppurtunties within The Dow Chemical Company.
good,"We hit the ground running and do not stop for 12 hours. Being a Batch process, there are many repetitive tasks performed daily. It is becoming increasingly impossible to achieve production goals due to the intense micro-management from the DOW administration. The process and production schedule is being sped up while continuously creating more paperwork/ computer work. Multi-tasking is a must, and as production employees leave and are not replaced, the workload is becoming increasingly more unachievable, impacting morale, resulting in more employees leaving, negatively affecting goals..."
good,"Would rather experience what working for DOW feels like. I did contractual work there, but from some of the staff from DOW the things I heard were amazing."
good,"As a supply chain intern I was given 100% responsibility for the outcome of my projects, which was an important aspect for my career growth and overall development."
good,"Hook up general service railcars and drum from them, maintain drum line and drum from tank farms"
good,Dow was a great company to work for. I was part of a team that treated everyone as family.
good,"You are always learning.  System changes and updates, additional job responsibilities as time goes by, etc."
good,"Very large established company that is still growing.  Lots of room for young professionals to grow.  Expectations are high.  Can be stressful, Leadership is often weak, but compensation is very good."
good,Large company bureaucracy.  Short term vision driven.  Overall positive direction of company leadership.  Hardest part of the job is the constant changing of shifts from early morning to late evenings for no reason other than poor planning.  Work culture is poor and corrosive.
good,Very routine work. A lot of daily meetings. Challenging work. Management can be biased at times. Strict safety culture. Excellent benefits. Competitive pay.
good,Had a good time just need more money and more appreciate i worked contract for dow my company was koten natie they had me doinh hard labor but not enough pay i worked for a year and a half snd no raise so it was time to leave when u see people just comin gettin notice fastet then me
good,"I worked in the company's corporate office in Midland, MI and while it offered a very competitive compensation package, if found that the culture did not allow for independent decision making or new ideas."
good,The company is good to hang around for few years as growth prospects are limited. There is work-life balance and one must be yes-man to succeed in the company and yes must change as management changes.
good,"My time at Dow seems to be similar to the experiences of my friends and peers who I graduated with. The workplace culture is good, but seems to cater to older employees."
good,"Good place to work, but very stressful.  Some strategic choices being made to hamper this good company from becoming a great company.  I worked with great people."
good,It is an alright place to work if you aren't worried about mergers and restructuring every other year. Good place if you are in with the right people.
good,"Dow had done many M&A in recent years and is good at the practice. It's IT department is also good at system integration and data migration effectively. Meanwhile, I did not see many continuous improvement effort, maybe due to resources constraints due to M&A effort."
good,"At work we test chemicals for quality assurance. The work isn't all that strenuous, however there is always something to do. A good place to work with excellent people."
good,"Distribution operator role can be rewarding, but frustrating at times. Opportunity is there for those with initiative and good work ethic.  Hours can be up to 16 a day at times"
good,"good company, strong leadership, nice colleagues. "
good,"You perform rounds, catch samples and analyze them.  The remainder of your shift is devoted to whatever tasks are on the task list.  If there is anytime left over, you can train."
good,"la cultura laboral es apreciable, aunque el salario y el crecimento laboral es lento"
good,Dow is a great place to work they hold their standard of safety to a very high standard and work well with your home life schedule. As long as you apply yourself and never do anything that you are 100% sure about you have unlimited help.
good,Long  hours  great pay  looking for something less  stressful at my age. I have worked for 43 years in mining and chemical plants.  Looking for  something  a  little less time consuming lso.
good,Thoroughly enjoyed my years and Dow and was hoping to retire from there.  Great co-workers and atmosphere.  Allowed flexibility for family time and school.
good,"A lack of advancement is the one major down fall.  You can work hard, follow every training and approach your told and it all comes down to who you know."
good,The list of things I have learned at Dow is still growing.  Running a batch plant and 2 separate constant running plants has opened my eyes to numerous things that I would have never thought of before just working a typical job.  Hardest part of the job is trying to make sense of things based on trying to please everyone all at once
good,"It was a good place to work. Typical day consisted of morning rounds, morning meeting, permit rush, another round, lunch, meeting, another round, alter permits, close permits, final round, go home. Everyone will have their own view of a company depending on timing."
good,De baan op zich geeft veel verscheidenheid aan talen kennis.
good,An excellent growth opportunity given to me at a time when at a crossroads in my life. New opportunity in a new area with a chance to make a difference in the industry.
good,"Dow bought the company I work for out. As soon as that happened, everything literally changed in the course of the following year. Medical insurance cost far more but covered less. pay raises (if any) were very small. Holiday schedule days were cut as well. "
good,"Overall, the TDCC is a good company to work for, but do not plan on advancing in position. The workload continues to increase and extra personnel is never added to alleviate the stressful workload. Good people to work with and understanding managers. But numbers are still very important to the final decision making."
good,Company provides good pay with benefits. Has a long history in the Chemical industry and diversifies very well. Typical day includes meetings about ongoing work as well as jobsite visits to ensure work is being completed safely and accurately.
good,Dow Chemicals is Good Company but i am looking job in sales & Marketing.
good,I would look for another company before applying at Dow. The pay is low compared to other companies and upper management does not care about the people that keep the company running and operating safely.
good,"In tweleve plus years I worked in the area of pharmaceticals, food, electronics and coatings. I had a job title of being a quality control lab technoligst in all the areas I worked. I dealt with several different pieces of lab equipment to reach the end product of a good, safe product for the consumer."
good,"Some days the work load was slow."
good,I learned how to build and validate samples and equipment. I also worked with various chemist from around the world to come up with better testing methods. Hardest part of my job is never knowing what time you will be off.
good,"A typical day is from 7:30-4:00, and that is flexible. I have learned the Dow way of doing things, the management is present but not mircromanaged. The people I work with on a day to day basis are cooperative and friendly. The hardest part is not being able to advance. I really enjoy the flexibility of having the opportunity to do my outside of work activities"
good,"·	Responsible for operations and maintenance of pipeline and station assets, which includes but is not limited to maintenance of valves, pumps and piping."
good,"It is a great place to work, safety is always first. I have learned a alot working with company, including SAP DIBS and GEMTS."
good,I had 22 1/2 wonderful years with Dow / Rohm & Haas. but due to business decisions in June of 2019 by the corporation my Role was eliminated. It was an honor to be a change agent for all that I worked with over those years.
good,Over the years I met a lot of great people and was exposed to so many cool projects.  I was given a great deal of training and experience which has served me well.
good,Large company atmosphere but there is always work to be done. Things would take time to get done though because of how many people needed to approve something. There is always a procedure to follow.
good,It was grunt work as a material handler but if you are in it to make cash then it is worth it. I worked a nice schedule were every month had a week off that I could go on vacation or pick up overtime.
good,"In the beginning the company was there for the people, towards the end the company forgot about its people. It took care of us to help raise a family. They did give us a retirement benefit."
good,"Doe allows a good work life balance. However, the opportunity for tech/tech promotion is limited. The communication of what is going on with the company is typically very limited. Overall Dow is a good place to work for, but I am looking to advance my career."
good,It was a good job at Dow Chemical. All of the people were very nice and for the most part everyone actually wanted to come to work each day at Dow Chemical. There are many times that someone can move up the ladder and change positions and grow if they so choose.
good,"A lot of firing and hiring. Job security is major. You will get fired over permits at ANY time. Also, the testing process is sometimes rushed when they want you to hurry and learn a different area. That can get a bit stressful when you have a lot already on your plate. If you're best buds with any of the workers, they will help. If not, and no one is really rooting for you, you're basically on your own."
good,"was good place to work in my role, management was ok but hands off most time and generic in guidance, people worked with and around were great, lot a lot of places there were some you had to watch your back around. But over all it was a good place to work and learn."
good,Every job has their cliques. This one is no different but 99% of the people are really nice. Easy to get along with and great ergonomics. Just need to pay moire for some of the positions that do more work than given credit for. This is why the turnover rate is so high and people play favorites.
good,The recent merger has left many with job eliminations and it was hard to find another job within the company. The culture also seemed to be changing in some businesses.
good,"You must follow ALL OSHA requirements or get fired.  Collaborative management, stressfukl environment, however on-site medical care and behaviorial health counciling."
good,I learned more at Dow Chemical than any other work function I've ever been involved with.  The core competencies of their industry leaders served as key mentors in most of my acquired skills.
good,"In the last 5 years company relocated labs/ offices twice with little regard to how it affects employees. Great place to work, if each relocation works for you."
good,Good environment and mentoring to grow a young career.  Safety environment and culture is top notch and shows the care for all employees including contractors.
good,"Dow Freeport is an unique place to work. Numerous industrial plants were operated from Dow's internal power grid. Maintaining the power,  was challenge."
good,"Good Job Work/Life Balance,management team, good job culture. Good experience in productive and product. Engineers shows good team work and you will learned from experience."
good,"Great place to work but could be stressful on older people doing the over time. Would have stay longer if there was not all the over time."
good,"Una empresa muy responsable, comprometida en todos los aspectos. Aprendí muchísimo y no había tareas difíciles, sí se requería mucha atención. Lamentablemente, decidieron cerrar la planta."
good,Able to learn and gain experience that is valuable for students in the long term.  Good chance of gaining full time employment after graduation and if not taking a strong reference elsewhere.
good,"THe projects were very interesting and complex.  Usually entailed complex piping systems and materials such as teflon lined piping, reinforced fiberglass piping, exotic metal piping materials such as monel, duplex stainless steel, etc."
good,"A typical day at work, I learned how to multitask well and got to work with all the lab equipment. Work environment was great my seniors were approachable and helpful."
good,Good company to work for. Good benefits and pay. Good workplace culture. Enjoyed the financial aspect of the company. Good people to work with. Pay is good for position. Merger has caused a lot of discord in the company as they spin off into 3 companies. But all in all is a good company to work for.
good,"Dow Chemical celebrates its diverse groups of employees.  In fact, employees are encouraged to learn of other cultures and lunch and learns are put in place to allow for that.  I salute Dow for that."
good,"Strong in safety culture, strong in productivity, strong in operational excellence"
good,"Many positions are with contracting companies, some of which paid good benefits and some do not pay any.  Many positions are also temporary until a project has been completed.  You are lucky if you land a long-term on-going contract position, but many don't last long-term.  I have now had two contracting positions where I've had an end date and have had to find another position.  I would rather seek a full-time permanent position with Dow or else go elsewhere so I'm not always having to find a new position ever other year or so,"
good,I learned a bit about the manufacturing side of R&D lab work. Management is a little 'hands off' in the role I have. the ability to go above and beyond is minimal.
good,"Nice company"
good,"Can be a difficult place to work due to the never-ending changing environment that we work in.  Absolutely no perks at work due to budget cuts.  Management leaves every 1-2 yrs.  People working on projects have to deal with increasing tighter margins, ever increasing metrics and evaluations.  What is good- they will let you grow in what you do, and give you increasing levels of authority if you succeed.  Pay and benefits are pretty fair."
good,"Iam helper insulation 2015 to 2016 for dow chemical gulf streams  iam cut metal e insulation 90' 45' banding 3/4 ,1/2 M/Would  meter size circunference  ,stacking material inventory report  Mso paper work ,shipping ,bill landing material ,loanding - unloanding trailer the material for field or out side field and warehouse paper work ,counting ,stacking,and banding  mat. And team work all time"
good,"Management level positions have great comp and benefits but promotion timeline is very slow given merger and headcutting, no job security for manager-level jobs, 50-60% turnover in management level jobs in my division in past year, unexpected relocation to collegeville costs philadelphia employees an added 2-4 hours of commuting time per day, company locations make it hard for company to recruit and retain top talent, hard to advance and stay in the same geographic area, no urban work locations besides houston (1 hr drive from city center) and collegeville, PA (1-2 hour drive from philadelphia center), young smart people do not want to work for this company."
good,"A typical day at work is just knowing your work, position and abilities."
good,"Great workplace with benefits to match. Being a contractor does have its limitations however, being that job instability will be prevalent. Management is by far the best I've ever worked with, and have gained a lot of invaluable experience working alongside them."
good,Ideal company for those employees desiring to manage its own career advancement while following laid down work processes.
good,"I enjoyed working for Jacobs, made good money and liked my coworkers and the management."
good,great job good culture some where to grow and learn not the best for family life working rotating shifts good benefits for those who have dependents.
good,Competitive pay and benefits.  Lean work force with a heavy workload for all.  Excellent range of responsibility and growth opportunities.
good,Dow pays very well and has great benefits! Cool people that love to cook and eat! Plainly a good time. The lab needs more staffing but other than that its a great place to work.
good,It was nice place to work. People were nice. I could work at my own pace. As long as the job got done. And from time to time odd jobs had to be done. Nothing was really complicated.
good,The company believes in safety and is always number on priority of management. Company has immense amount of information available to increase your expertise.
good,"Working for Dow is challenging and dynamic. I am expected to be self reliant and to able to use my own initiative.  "
good,Over the last 6 years I have learned working for the Dow Chemical Co. is to be safe while at work always take the proper precautions and always wear the proper PPE- Personal Protective Equipment while doing any task. I have learned to leave work the same as you arrived. I work with a great diverse of people and we all get along like a team working rotating shifts 12 hrs days and nights. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting customer satisfaction and doing it safely. Management does a great job of getting us prepared and informing us us changes and also encouraging us.
good,"Simply put, its a great company if you have no family, or a family with grown kids. over all not too bad. good luck with the application/interview process."
good,Days were very busy. I spent much time on the computer utilizing SAP and 3rd party web based programs.  There was much emphasis on safety  and the environment included continual change.change.
good,Dow is a good company to work for that genuinely strives to be a great company to work for.  For me the best part of the job by far are the people I work with / for.  Over the years it feels more like family than just co-workers.
good,Hour were good and the money was great. I enjoyed working with the people I got to work with. Pretty laid back for the most part. An all around interesting place to work.
good,"Good place to work overall.  A bit disorganized.  Management needs to stop the nepotism."
good,"Manage the day to day activities of the permit writers, construction managers, and contractors in the field under the direction of the project manager. Insuring the safety and productivity of the project. Reviewing safety standards and work process' with each of the groups to make the most productive project possible,"
good,I enjoy the professionalism of my career as well as the laid back atmosphere.  I work with a lot of great people and have opportunities to learn and grow on a daily basis.
good,A good place to work if you can keep your job. Good work performance reviews and work ethics is no guarantee of employment. I was acquired through an acquisition. I was never told my work quality or quantity was lacking. Always had good performance reviews but was told no longer a part of the new organization when I turned 52. Dow's business model is to perform a 10% purge every three years or so.
good,Good management. high safety standards. safety awards. occasional free meals. good moral.  shift options.  chance for advancement.
good,Very good company to work for however it's growing so fast I feel many of tools necessary to have complete synergy are not in place.
good,"Inspected and operated equipment such as pumps, reactors, valves, cooling towers, heat exchangers, pods, distillations, scrubber units, and storage product tanks and provided plant wide logistical support with heavy equipment.  Mixed and Prepared Oil Additives for Batch.  Provided support with barge transfers to storage tanks,  fueling diesel generators.  Used SAP software system to upgrade customer profiles and to order and monitor inventory.  Computer skills a plus."
good,"No much daily work pressure."
good,"A typical day at work consists of multiple products from various facilities needing to be analyzed. We serve a few different business and do all their quality analysis. "
good,"I have enjoyed and do enjoy working for Dow. I would prefer to continue working with them, but restructuring is changing that prospect. They were better than most companies with this transition. I would very much like to find work in the same field with a company that is similar in their respect for employees."
good,"I loved working for Dow, however, because of its size, the company can become rather political in nature."
good,Dow is a good compaany to work for and gives each employee the ability to grow in their career.
good,"Dow is a great place to work. I worked on shift, learned a lot from vigorious training and from a turnaround at Dow"
good,A typical day at work can be fun filled with laughs and casual conversation with coworkers
good,"The knowledge base required to perform well in a human resources call center, especially for a global corporation, is vast. The functions are widely varied and expertise in all areas of policy, procedure, and dedicated service to every employee in North America from the factory worker to high levels of management is essential and expected. Every day is different and a typical day always involves a new approach to inquiries or additional information to discern and/or escalate and communicate verbally and written. Serving our client's needs and adapting to change is constant and training never stops. Technology and work culture moves quickly, so learning and updating the tools and resources for skill improvement is necessary. Complacency has no place in that fast-paced and demanding environment. Every team member is important and valued, so the term 'co-worker' dims in comparison to the team effort it takes to be the successful unit we are. The management and centers of expertise within the Human Resources department inform and recognize the work we all do on the front lines as first contact with proficiency and excellence and inclusion. Safety matters, too. The workplace is monitored constantly to proactively address ergonomic issues, workspaces, and health concerns through evaluations, education, programs, and communication. The hardest part of the job is also the most enjoyable--the clients.They challenge my wits and often force me out of any comfort zone I may think I had, but this also helps me serve them better and in turn, inspires growth and professional satisfaction."
good,"A typical day at Dow begins anytime from 6am to 6pm. The hours are flexible so you can have work and life balance. There is limited micromanagement. Overall, the environment presents opportunities for professional development and growth."
good,Company was a very structured environment with procedures for everything.  If I didn't know how to complete a task I went to the procedure to find out.  I learned about doing only my job and nothing more because of Union regulations.  I also learned OSHA and MIOSHA regulations.  The company has a continuous learning program to make the workplace safe and more efficient that every employee is required to participate in.
good,"At Dow, I worked with Hazardous Chemicals,  I learned a lot working at Dow.  I learned how to drive a fork truck, how to run robots, and how to be very cautious around them.  I had awesome co-workers who are still some of my very closest friends.  We had to drum chemicals into 55 gallon drums, sticker them and some time we had to go to another department and help with larger sacks. We also ran a robotic line where we changed from one position to another-totaling 7 different positions. This is where we ran the robots, filled 5 gallon plastic bottles, and checked for leaks.  We also had to unload trailers with the fork truck, and sometimes load them too.  "
good,"Management is disconnected from the work force. We have a tendency to focus on low value work. Core skills training is non-existent, and any viable succession planning doesn't appear to be a real concern."
good,Good overall company regarding salary and benefits. Independence through knowledge and efficiency. Too many liberal policies.
good,"Dow is a fun place to work. This is a company that belives in strong work processes. People are very friendly & enthusiastic about their work. Dow is very serious about its Environmental, Health & Safety programs. Leadership always make each & every employee accountable to their safety performance."
good,"Dow is a fun and exciting place to work. Co-workers are helpful and there is a lot to learn. A typical day includes a lot of meetings and a lot to get done through the day in between meetings. For a young person, it is a good place to start as the opportunities are far and wide."
good,"Dow Chemical grew fast but doesn't seem to have a clear direction from our upper management. In the last 4-6 years, improvement is simply to re-org. When the strategy doesn't seem to work, they re-org and give wall street a lot of spin. Stock has been flat. They buy businesses at the high and sell at the low."
good,I enjoyed the daily challenge of meeting the demands of our industry. The Management was supportive and my coworkers were all very devoted. I got a great deal of satisfaction from a good day's work and the positive attitude of all my coworkers.
good,As the company as grown larger. So has the fun and camaraderie.
good,"Good place for those who prefer a very stable, process driven environment. I learned a great deal about using Microsoft Excel for record-keeping and data management. Management is strict, but fair. Co-workers are hardworking, helpful and pleasant. The hardest part of the job for me was the compartmentalization of job duties. The most enjoyable part was the contact with my customers!"
good,"Dow Chemical is a good place to work, but not great. Dow has great benefits, good salary structure, but when economy is slow, lookout!! Dow will show no mercy or employee loyalty when it comes to cutting jobs. They say they have cut out forced ranking, but it appears to still be happening. If you are the lowest ranked in your group you are history, even if your performance is above the performance level of individuals in similar groups."
good,Seguridad y profesionalidad altamente valorables. Trabajar en Dow ha sido una gran experiencia de crecimiento profesional y personal.
good,"For more growth opportunities in Finance you have to be willing to move to the headquarters in Midland, Michigan.  The most enjoyable part of the job are the people.  There are many knowledgeable people to work with and you will learn a great deal from them."
good,"This is a new Company formed from Dow and Dupont, they are going through management issues and need to grow in that area. There is room for advancement if you want it."
good,"It's a fortune 50 company and is not only huge, but also has many branches and therefor a lot of bureaucracy. As someone who has owned my own business for many years it can be frustrating to see how slowly things must be done. Overall, though, it was a pleasant experience and most people seem happy working there."
good,They pay good and have an alright life work balance. It is mostly swing shift but in all you do get family time. Very safety oriented and a solid steady job with decent pay.
good,"The work can be challenging, requires quick thinking and good troubleshooting skills.  Some tasks are physically demanding, must be able to lift up to 50 lbs. and working in all kinds of weather.  The training is very thorough and provided in a variety of methods from hands-on to online training.  "
good,"As a PA engineer in the engineering department, you worked with the plant to define scope, developed code, reviewed it with the plant , then loaded it"
good,Working at Dow was a great experience for me and my leader saw potential in me and helped push me into a position that was better suited for me. This did mean that I was not promoted within Dow but had to step out to continue my career path. The internal structure for promotion is difficult in some instances due to educational and experience backgrounds. It was out of the ordinary to have significant overtime and the culture in the area I worked was extremely supportive and willing to help with any work that needed to get done.
good,Good work-life balance is achievable depending on your role and function. Inclusion and diversity is taken seriously. Great development opportunities in both technical and commercial fields.
good,"Dow is a very exciting and challenging place to work , they teach and train you, set goals and grade you against them, Great place to work very diverse in their projects, I have been to several states and working on multiple projects in scope from 50mm to 500mm "
good,"Overall a great company to work for, flexible work schedule and work load is manageable. The compensation compared to the competition is middle of the road, but the work life balance is great! The company culture is very positive, and a usual work day is very laid back. They do have a very confusing way of promoting people and do put unqualified people in certain spots. It is seen as a development opportunity but makes them operate ineffectively."
good,"Great company to work for. Very competitive wages, always thinking of the community, and safety is priority. Opportunity to always learn something new. Opportunity to advance in the company."
good,"Seems to be easy going in terms of management, likes to promote within or diversity, maybe not the best for the job.  Overall, everyone seems pleased there."

good,"Dow Chemical is a good place to work. It is not the highest paying place to work, but the group that I work in is flexible. That accounts for a lot to me."
good,"If you are just wanting to get your foot in the door and learn the basic skills and knowledge to be a successful operator, then this is a good company to start your career with. Start out pay is on the lower end, but it gets better over time, and the benefits help make up for it. The classes that you will have to take are great to really get you the knowledge and experience you need. Management here is poor, so you will have to learn to seek help else where if you run into any issues."
good,"The on-boarding was quick"
good,Great place to work. Fast paced professional environment. Easy to advance if you work hard. Hard to get into the company from the outside if you don't know anyone.
good,People were nice and I had the opportunity to learn but the work and location just was not the right fit for me. I am more happy in a more dynamic office and needed to be closer to family.
good,"I worked 22 years for Dow chemical I was a rectifier transformer specialist . I also was a North American plant trouble shooter and traveled with Dow to find issues that could not be solved by the existing tradesmen. My inventive nature earned me many awards for issues that were solved by my logical approach."
good,"We had lots of fun while at work, almost everyone did their share and contributed to the work load.  We had different management changes, some were excellent some were not.  The best part of the job was making new friends and meeting new people everyday.  The hardest part was when we found out our plant was shutting down and had to be demolished.  Overall, the workplace culture was very agreeable and satisfactory."
good,Started as a packager but couldn't progress any further at the time.  Left to continue schooling.  Big enough company that gave you a lot of introduction to new learning experiences.
good,"My day started with reviewing my work load and prioritize my work  for the day.The management team support was good, and I enjoyed my job. I learned some new skills set that I was able to use every day at the work place."
good,"I worked in Customer Service function where you cannot be sure about the work load. "
good,Typically all personnel are busy everyday. The people make the culture; however the leader can make or break the culture.  Work processes at Dow are top notch!
good,People are great. Company treats you well. Good benefits. Mechanical folks work 4-10's which is great. Only draw back for me is traffic in the afternoons.
good,"Dow has great employees who are very supportive of each other. However, I feel management is out of touch and they need more female leaders. Also, I hope you don't need to take time off for chronic diseases. They will let you go."
good,"Dow is a very strict facility due to the chemicals. However, if you are able to work quickly, safely, and spend all shift on your feet, then the job was interesting."
good,"* Performing  day to day activities: utilization of analytical chemistry to test production samples, create reports of any non conformance, housekeeping, Helping co-workers to complete the job on time, entry of data in SAP."
good,"Company tries to care about work/life balance, but they end up making it just one more thing a group of employees has to add to their workload-to sit on a committee to figure out how to achieve it."

good,"Great company to work for. Always one of the industries leaders in ideas and technology. Empowered employees , and safety is priority. Daily routine was to inspect and maintain running conditions in the process of making acrylic acid. The specific site I was at , during the time I was there was a much older facility. At that time management insisted on running our oldest reactors which caused us daily issues. Once that changed and new reactors and equipment was installed , the running conditions become much more manageable and simplified things a bit. The toughest part of that job was the physical aspect of it, turning valves, climbing towers, etc. I enjoy leaving at the end of the day knowing I put in a hard days work, although some of those hard days were due to the old equipment being used and that is no longer the case. Most of the individuals working out there are very knowledgeable about the process and easy to work with. Always helpful and informative when training."
good,"Great place to work but the town the company is based in is small and has very little to do socially, but other than that the benefits are great, the people are friendly and in my experience as long as you preform management will never bother you."
good,"I have been with Dow for 2 years, and have worked with many great people. My job was eliminated and that is the only reason I left. The pay is good, the benefits are decent and the company is great in general."

good,"Dow chemical was a great place to begin my career while learning the ins and outs of working in a chemical plant as a production engineer.

From speaking with other engineers throughout the company your experience will vary widely depending on the plant you work in."
good,"Good experience with excellent safety programs."
good,"Dow is a great place to develop your expertise in multiple areas within a big corporation. Opportunities to expand your breadth of knowledge on the ins and outs of how large maufacturing companies operate. The headquarters is based in Midland, Michigan, which is a great small town experience with a lot of the culture you would find in a big city. If you are looking for a great place to grow a career and raise a family, Dow is a definite top employer!"
good,Work culture is good. Challenging oppurtunities are available. May not get a competitive salary though.
good,"I enjoyed the experience and you definitely learn alot, a typical day consists of about 3 15 min. breaks and a 1 hr lunch break, to get promoted requires alot of experience and time into the job. Between you and your co workers you definitely develop a bond and you get 3 day weekends off. 4 days a week 10 hrs a day, thats probably my fav, part about the job"
good,"gained knowledge having fun, good to work with all experienced people."

good,"Handing out wotk assignments making sure task gets done in a safe and timely manner. Enjoy working with others,"
good,"Good for people who like to work for big corporations. Impersonal from the upper management side and political like any big corporation. Raises based on who sucked up to the boss more and not strictly on merit, as it should be."
good,I completed a summer internship at this company which I found to be one of the most fulfilling research positions that I have held. This internship served as my introduction to biological research in an industry setting. I found the experience to be fulfilling due to both the lab members who served as my mentors and the company's general culture as a whole.
good,"Over all, a great place to work.  If you're a Dow employee, there is adequate vacation, inexpensive health insurance options, and flexibility depending on the role."
good,"The company if very good culture and environment for working mom. I really enjoyed work with many professionals at my last job. And my manager was very hands off and allowed me a lot of professional freedom because I have a strong controllership mindset, work ethic and my job performance was exceptional."
good,Be prepared for work orders and cultural changes. The company is very driven to be the politically correct company even if it requires money that could be better budgeted elsewhere.
good,"Overall a good, reliable and safe place to work.  Recommended for all graduates and entry job levels as this is a good place to learn and job advancements."
good,"Fantastic learning experience. Will give training for expansion of role. However, are slow to give raises. The contractor company which represents the company is not up with the standards of the industry. Make sure you choose the right contract agency when applying for work there."
good,"My internship experience was top-tier in comparison to other internship experienced previously. However, the moments leading to the end of my internship caused concern. My department had no line of communication to me whether I would be awarded an offer or not while the other interns received such luxury. Communication with others has also been minimal since the ending of my term."
good,"An innovative giant in this industry that desires motivated workers.  Excellent  advancement opportunities for degreed individuals, less for non-degreed. Very inclusive and diverse worldwide work force with both domestic and overseas opportunities.  Innovative ideas and excellent work ethics will get you noticed and compensated for your hard work although long hours may be involved."
good,"I got to meet some great people out there. I left the job to pursue my education. The company offers tuition assistance, but when I asked my boss about it, she gave me the run around."

good,"What they (the company) and how they actually act are two different things.Safety first is a priority unless the costs are too high, then the bean counters are involved."

good,Company does focus highly on diversity and inclusion.  They also offer growth opportunities.  Managers and leaders always to seem open for discussion.  A fairly good environment to work in.
good,"I really enjoyed my time with Dow I wish I could've worked for the company longer. Never had any issues with anyone I worked with. It was very precise work, but it was very laid back."
good,"Fantastic collaborative culture. There core values are Safety and Respect and everyone truly lives by those values. If you really want to be engrossed in DOT Pipeline Integrity Regs, this is the place for you."
good,"Currently, there is a lot of organizational change resulting in inefficiencies in most roles.  High turnover is also a challenge for the heritage Dow Corning locations that are adjusting to the Dow Chemical systems.  There is a learning curve that the new organization needs to work through.  That will happen in time.  Dow compensates its employees well, and offers good benefits."
good,"Stability and great work life balance offered in the engineering TES organization. However, this organization is internally viewed as having limited opportunities for career advancement and growth."
good,It's not a bad place to work. People are friendly and they do encourage work life balance. Working from home sometimes is manageable and time is flexible. Management is reasonable and wants you to succeed. The work culture is very relaxed but the work is a lot.
good,Allowed you to take care of any emergency you may have regarding family or personal. Safety first and family second. Never had any issues leaving if needed to for any emergency.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Dow, they pay very well. I was at a satellite office in Philadelphia. Good management for the company and spotted with good middle managers."
good,"Health and safety are definitely a priority.  Some of the safety procedures, however, are a little bit redundant.  Other procedures which may relate to some of the larger units, don't necessarily apply to smaller ones.  But regardless of the unit size, all of these procedures are still in place."
good,"It is  payroll company so there is a partiality between contract employees and direct staffs."
good,Work load is evenly distributed but heavy at times. Accountability is high as well as the expectations. Challenging but rewarding place to work and the people are some of the most highly skilled I have ever worked with.
good,"There is a very strong safety culture even stopping production to fix a safety concern. Very Strong teaching culture as well - very easy to learn and gain knowledge. Pay is weak however, Salary of incoming Employees is increasing and is now greater then exisiting employees who have promotions."
good,"Men are cut throat and HR didn't not have your back under hostile situations.  The pay is great, benefits were amazing but you work 60+ hours a week and it leaves little time for family"
good,"Dow is a large multi site, international company.  Benefits are above average.  Work culture is fair but high paced and demanding.  Company provides a lot of room for professional and personal career growth."
good,"DOW is an amazing company to work for. Great pay even without a degree. Its hard to find a job without a degree that will pay this much and include the job securtity and benefitis like Dow does. My only reason for leaving the company is more of a personal issue. The Dow Chemical plant is located in a small town in Texas called Freeport. I moved my wife ,my daughter and I here from Florida away from all our family and friends. there is no entertainment or value of life here. just work and home on repeat."
good,"Great place to work.  I supported a great global team.  Both my customers and my team were located globally. "

good,Challenging work environment with no down time plenty of responsibility with supportive management.  Good engineering support and communication.  Fast pace projects.
good,"Safe pace to work with big emphasis on safety.  Lots of perks and freebies and benefits. Lower salary vs surrounding refineries, although they compensate with a pleasant Job culture which is emphasized on safety"
good,"Just like any other massive company you can find. Slow to move and progress, but very stable and easy to have a long career. Plenty of opportunities to learn and grow."
good,"Productive company, with opportunity to move forward. workplace culture was normal. Management could've included  some of the workers that actually did the work in their field, participate in some of the meeting, before management made any changes in that particular field. Hardest part in job was communication. Enjoyable part was when we were giving a job for the day, and it was completed and no one interrupted you while your doing your job,"
good,"A place with flexible hours, good benefits, open culture and nice people! As an employee, you have the chance to work with people with R&D experience, manufacturing background, marketing expertise, and so on. Of course, this place is full of smart people and can be very competitive."
good,"Had to do 3 different jobs in rotation.  Had to Run test on product 3 times a shift (12 hours).   Making adjustments as necessary.   Had to take measurements and keep finishing equipment taken care of.   Also making necessary adjustments.    Recycle job consist of taking care of scrap material and raw materials"
good,Productive and learning all types of safety in different environments.You meet a wide variety of people from all over the world.The co-workers are great.
good,"It was a very good place to work and it was very close to my home. Traffic is a big factor and I was able to work flexible hours to work around the traffic. I had a great piping lead that was very understanding, would definitely work for him again,"
good,"Good people, great culture, learned a lot in my role. Not enough training and opportunity for advancement. Way too many corporate distractions, and the rate of hire when a resource leaves is extremely slow, which means others having to pick additional workload that sometimes may not be re-assigned."
good,Good work life balance.. job location is fine but some issues with future growth ... a lot of freedom to work .. people are friendly and helpful
good,"A typical day at my current position starts with checking e-mail and phone mail immediately upon arriving at work.  I need to insure that no issues have arisen recently and also to identify any new issues that will need to receive immediate attention.  As I proceed throughout the day, I work on active projects and new requests that arrive either via phone, e-mail or through our request tracking system."
good,I worked for Dow many times. The Dow people where quit good i didn't mind working for them and would work for them again. I like working for this company.
good,"Learning was surely a part of this kind of a role, technical support, when the basic 1 st level of technical support never was able to solve a issue , those are the once which needed a little support from me, as a centralized tech support member, helping the juniors and guiding them to assists our employees in the USA and provide a solution"
good,Overall it was great to work at Dow. It gave me a chance to raise my family and get their education. The work was also fast paced and I worked with some demanding supervision. I had some really great jobs there.
good,"Great company to work for. You learn a lot and have many opportunities as an intern. They organize seminars, networking events, and many other social events."
good,"Really a nice place to work. Work was scheduled by operations. There weren't any supervision or ""chiefs"" looking over your shoulder. Operators ran the show. When there was a problem it was reported to our Superintendent if operations couldn't handle an issue. Management would intervene if there was a problem that operation couldn't handle. Co workers were pretty good guys. Everyone had a job title and we all worked together."
good,"I would come into my office at dow and do all my inventory management and documentation for the billing of repairs and parts. Then i would begin taking calls for issues with machines being inoperable or damaged or in need of maintenance. I would travel to the block with the problem and assess the issue and if i have the parts on hand i would do the repair then i would document everything , what the damage was, parts used in the repair and repair time. Then i would take another call and so on until the end of the day then do logging of documentation onto dow database for financial records."
good,"Lots of hoops to jump through, but decent pay and good housing setup for students, even though you have to pay them rent. "
good,"Between the phone, email, and office visits, I get daily interuptions for problem solving ideas that allow the employees to continue to progress their work for this billion dollar industry.  I am a Project Manager at Dow Chemical and enjoy touching the lives of my co-workers and project team members, from the quirky and quiet analysist to the outspoken project engineer.  The hardest part of my job is traveling for 3-4 weeks at a time.  The most enjoyable part the job is the rush of having found a workable option that becomes a win-win solution."
good,boring job not very rewarding but great pay and benefits and advancement opportunity.
good,"Loading and offloading rail cars and tank trucks, some sampling, trouble shooting of equipment. Well managed units, good co-workers, lots of room for advancement in company."
good,Excellent work life balance.  Good atmosphere with good co-workers.  Location is something to consider.
good,Good stepping stone to gain professional experience in the laboratory setting.
good,"I do not want to keep working in a chemical plant for my health.  My long term health means more to me than a job that pays money and gives benefits.   The place was full of nice people and there are ways to avoid chemicals, but o not want the thought of getting exposed.  The older I get the more I realize that it is important to enjoy our time and this includes working.  I never cared for the notion of just going to work and dealing with how much it might be dreadful.  Now, I want to do something in a way to enjoy my talent.  I was a great writer in college as a history major, but I just got away from that and distracted by life.  I see how much better life can be when I explore my talents.  Dow Chemical gave me a valuable life lesson, but it is time to move on."
good,"In the department I worked, much was learned about distribution of packages in delivery route, organization of warehouses and safety. My immediate management was excellent to work for and co-workers were hard working, and generally worked toward excellence."
good,"typical day:  check emails to see if my commercial support is needed (Dow Global plant sites).  Review supplier agreements, Term & Conditions, meet with suppliers, negotiate T&C and pricing, work on Strategic Sourcing Projects,   Manange 20+ Agreements in the Electrical and Process Contained Equipment Space.  "
good,"A typical day of work for me is making up paper work, making line ups, trouble shooting equipment, and making sure there is enough silo space for product that is being made."
good,"There is  no typical day for a Customer Service Rep at Dow Chemical.  Pros are that each CSR supports a business under the Dow umrella and supports a handful of customers.  Each CSR can develop relationships with their customers and it isn't ""call center"" customer service.  CSRs get requests all across the board and we work with nearly every department.  Customer service is a good stepping stone when coming in to the company, and customer service is a relatively highly regarded department within Dow."
good,"Great benefits, good pay, good hours,"
good,Best part of the job is the high quality of people with their can do attitude. Change is almost an everyday occurance and the culture is such that they are easily accepted. Large amount of diversity and career backgrounds makes it an interesting and fun place to work.
good,Dit is een bedrijf waar je gewaardeerd word.
good,"Safe, learning place to work.I learned how to interact with people. How to do other things i had not had experience in doing. The group of people i worked with help make enjoyable"

good,Really enjoyed working there but you only advanced if you got a higher education or your boss liked you. Largest issue is the more liked a person is the less likely they are to get into trouble for anything.
good,I enjoy working for Dow. The people are very friendly. The company strives for a work/family balance and are open to flexible work schedules. There are many different deparments within the company so promotions are common. Unfortunately at this time there is a hiring freeze and I am working as a contractor as a temp. The chances of me going permanent is unlikely right now.
good,Everyday is a different day with exciting opportunities.  Fast paced and never dull moment.  Great teamwork is a must! Strong leadership and organizational skills required.
good,"Good experience working as a team lead in this orgaBanization"
good,Dow is a very well established global chemical company that strives to be all inclusive and welcomes a diverse workforce. Most roles have great flexibility to honor a work/life balance.
good,The Dow Chemical Company offers a huge opportunity for someone to grow in their job and be successful.  The range of jobs is vast with opportunity to move to different locations and grow your job skills.
good,My only problem with this firm is that they haven't learned how to manage the first 3 quarters of the year so they don't have to cut employees during the 4th quarter. For a firm who pushes root cause analysis one would think they would learn to manage the year better so they aren't cutting people during the Christmas season or thereabouts.
good,"Not applicable. I do not feel comfortable expanding on this review of the company. Please do not ask me again. Good job, good location, good coworkers"
good,Became a Dow employee via the acquisition of Rohm and Haas   Enjoyable people and opportunities to advance.  Left the company due to a poorly executed employee location centering effort.
good,"This employer has a bad reputation with it's employees because if you are part of the ""Cool Kids Club"" you will go far. It does not matter how much you try and fit in, volunteer your time, work endless hours unless you are accepted into the ""club"" you do not go anywhere."
good,Belle entreprise qui offre des nombreuse opportunités.
good,Dow is a great place to work.  Great environment and safety culture.  Management seems to care about employees.  Safety is stressed every day and production is always second.

good,"Production done at the highest level of documenting and safety.."
good,Was a great opportunity and helped to further boost my resume. Was able to make key connections and be experienced to a large corporation. Very friendly atmosphere.

good,Dow Chemical Louisiana Operations was a great place to work. I worked in Public Affairs for 22 years and it was a great opportunity to expand and develop my professionalism.
good,"Dow emphasizes team success.  Projects are supported by multi-functional teams, which enhances productivity and collaboration.

good,"A typical day of work consists of monitoring the unit and making changes to keep the unit stable and on spec.  An operator/ technician would also clear equipment to be safely worked on by the maintenance group."
good,"I operated a variety of machines that manufactured small and large water filters for home and commercial uses. Every 4 hours, team members rotated to different stations to help ensure no task became so repetitive that they led to injuries. I personally found the tasks boring, but that was my personal opinion."

good,I would say a typical day could be busy in the morning and slow in the afternoon or alternate back and forth.  The busiest time is flu shot season when you can have only that to do all day and the line can be around the bend with people just to get it done and off to lunch or home.

good,"Great Place to work, management has a great span of experience and mentor capabilities. I would suggest working for The Dow Chemical Company."
good,"Top management very good BUT lower management bad. Especially those in charge of the warehouses. (  foremans, supervisors). Dow needs to purge this supervisors out. Other than that the other managers are great. Especially H R in Freeport, Texas."
good,"Good Company to work. Good Benefits, Just takes time to move up and you need your degree to move to an operations Job, overall not a bad Company to work in Freeport,TX."

Attorneys worked independently to prepare legal responses, develop arguments to overcome rejections from the patent office.  Co-workers were generally hard-working and supportive.

good,A productive and fun place to work.  I enjoyed all of the various projects - both chemical and biological.  I enjoyed working with my workmates.
good,Management should show more concern with fuctional aspects. Plant has been over utilized with little upkeep. Many times this reflects poorly upon the everyday working man.
good,"I had over 30 years of satisfying IT career with the company. While positions in Manufacturing and Research continue to be world class, IT roles have been reduced due to waves of outsourcing. IT Management roles; developing strategy and oversight of service providers, are few and well sought-after."

good,Well it is a good place to work. It has a good environment and a company very strong in the safety of its employees.
good,"I worked full time for DOW at the research park in UIUC. Not much to complain about in terms of scheduling. Nothing was too demanding from the project I worked on. However, my team did have to start making project decisions on our own for a couple of weeks, as we weren't specifically told what was to be done. There is pro and cons to this, but without having our hands held, we did feel that we had room to get creative with our project."
good,"Had opportunity to increase my knowledge in several fields."
good,Fast paced energetic place of employment! A typical day is non stop from the morning until the end of the day.  Plenty of challenges to handle in a work day!
good,If your educational back ground was synthetic organic chemistry then you wouldn't necessarily be conducting reactions for the rest of your career.  Dow tended to move employees where they needed them so I eventually ended up working as a material scientist.  This environment was good for young scientists who wanted a taste of different scientific areas and who didn't mind living in different locations.  I learned other skills such as polymer science and material science.
good,"·	Performing routine operation of basic control systems and devices to monitor levels, temperatures, pressures and flow rates and transfer of products."

good,"It really is a family at Dow, your voice is heard and employees are always encouraged to participate and grow within the organization."
good,"As an intern, I felt very welcome to the team. Everyone went out of their way to make sure I go the most out of it and learned as much as possible. My skills in cell culture grew tremendously while there and was even able to help them out in a few experiments. Dress was casual (dress pants & a collared shirt) and you could wear jeans on Friday. Hardest part of the job was trying to stay busy and find tasks to do so."
good,"I have stayed for barely 5 years at Dow before it closed in 2016. Overall, the workload is challenging day by day and I have learned a lot from my colleagues, as well as my manager. It is definitely worth to work there once you get passed in the interview process. It only took me once to interview but took a long time to get hired."
good,"Came in at a time they are struggling somewhat due to outside factors, but agile and quick decisions make it seem to be a competent and confident place to work."
good,Best company I've worked for; highly recommended. Would not leave this company even if my potential offer paid more. Work life balance is their priority
good,It was a pleasure to work at The Dow Chemical Company. I learned arranging travel for 40 plus people was great.  The members of the department were pleasant to work with and always helpful and understanding. Hardest part of job was working out travel details to a few of the obscure locations required for the teams to travel.  Management was very helpful and encouraging
good,Angenehmer Arbeitgeber aber aufgrund von dem Merger mit Dupont wurden viele Aspekte von der täglichen Arbeit vernachlässigt und Arbeitsstellen ins Ausland verlegt.
good,"My days starts with checking out mails. Then work given to me from my Managers about their travel or any event related work. "
good,"We work 12 hour swing shifts. Generally a good place to work. I have learned several different job skills while employed here. Mostly good people, but management has their favorites, and promotions are rarely a surprise."
good,The workplace always has some challenge.  Hardest part of the job was living apart from my family. The most enjoyable was the peer camaraderie.  I learned a lot about the Glycol/Oxide processes.
good,Dow Chemical was a place where I definitely learned a lot. Teamwork was a must and it when working well together it showed. Supervisors were very friendly. Safety was of always number 1 priority. I really enjoyed the block I worked at due to the fact most of my co-workers had been there for several years showing me it in fact was a great place to work.
good,"Very easy physically, Very challenging mentally and emotionally.  Never a boring moment.  The training is good and my coworkers made the learning process fun."
good,Great company to work for just sometimes I feel that they try and lead to where they want you to be.  It would be a little better to have them let you choose your path and if it didn't work out so be it.
good,"A typical day at work is loading or unloading a railcar, drum, tote, iso container, or bag. I've learned almost everything about plants from Dow. The training is top of the line and closely monitored. I know more about valves, pumps, reactors, line ups, and safety all from my training from computer led training and working in the field. There's not a whole lot that is really hard about this job, it's not a very demanding job, just some physical labor and the ability to focus on detail and paying attention. The most enjoyable part of my job are my coworkers."
good,Dow was a very big company. Much different than the place I came from. It was a self taught  atmosphere with guidance. There were 6 people on our team and we met with the manager 2-4 times a month. My plant was in Texas so it made it hard to be hands on. You learned very good communication skills with this job.
good,"El horario era muy flexible."
good,"Azienda sana, business in crescita con conseguente investimenti sugli impianti produttivi"
good,"not comfortable sharing any information about my job or company here for open or private view, if such information is necessary will share with the employer or potential employer"

good,"Worked in Midland for 5-6 years. Had an excellent experience and finished BSc degree while working. Peers were ready to help with questions and very supportive. Midland, Mi is a small town, but Saginaw is relatively clse and detroit only 2-3 hours away."
good,"A typical day at the front desk was answering phone calls, and letting people in scanning or making new badges. Most people were very friendly made it a good workplace environment."
good,"Typically, a day at work for me is filled with testing various products made at the plant. I have learned many new things about the sealant industry including the types of customers we serve, what the products we produce do and how they function in the work environment, and new test methods. The management staff for Dow is very supportive and highly focused on diversity, inclusion, and plant safety. They are also readily available to address any concerns you may have with the company or the job you are performing."
good,"overall dow gives a very good experience to the people with great culture and ethical standards, would recommend anyone joining dow to stick there forever"
good,"Diverse culture. Work schedules were flexible and ability to cross train in other areas. Typical day consisted of inputting work orders, tracking equipment history and completing compliance task."
good,"If you do good work you get rewarded with more work. You can go far in this company with just a Bachalors degree, no need for higher education. As support staff I get flexible hours and control over my day and what I want to do."
good,"Dow was a great company to work for. The hard part was when the mergers came into play. Employees were afraid for their jobs so they started to do things that weren't team orientated,"
good,Enjoyed very day I walked into work. I was able to keep up with new technologies while working at DOW. I found management was approachable and always available to listen. The people at DOW to me made my day enjoyable.
good,"Good job to have, good pay union has built in automatic raises.   Batch plants suck because you work a WHOLE LOT MORE!!! Continuous run plants are better."
good,"Dow was a wonderful place to work. Loads of benefits, friendly people and salary employees were able to fly the corporate jet when they wanted. The issues came into play with the continuous mergers and acquisitions. People would be job scared and become a little cut throat. When there wasn’t word of any mergers the culture was cohesive, friendly and family like. I guess this is not just exclusive to Dow it’s just human nature."
good,Good variety of work. Good pay and benefits. Large investment in new products should provide excellent long term employment for tears to come. EHS is high priority.
good,"Answering emails, processing credit applications,... I enjoy the people that I work with, they are very helpful when issue come up.  I like the trouble shooting with my job.  I like having to search for the answers."
good,I loved working for Dow Chemical and wish they hadn't outsourced my position.  But everything happens for a reason so it is what it is. I didn't have much of a life working as I spent an hour and a half one way getting to work.  However I did get a lot of experience and skills I would not have otherwise.
good,"Excellent benefits and very stable company - lots of red tape. If you want a stable and supportive career with low risk, this is a great company. The company is risk adverse in every decision they make and as such are slow to adapt to the market place."
good,"I have no problem with where I work, except for the hours and the fact that I've been in logistics in the army for 10 years and am about to graduate with my associates in transportation, distribution and warehousing. I NEED to grow with this."
good,"The benefits is why I came to this company. You can pretty much make your own hours and you don't work as hard as other manual labor jobs. Co workers make this job worth while. once you max out, the advancement opportunities are slim."
good,"Batch operations job which included similar to routine daily task, some physically demanding aswell as mentally challenging. Reactor operations required you to understand the amount of runtime and condition of the reactor for overall batch integrity, and safety. learned lab analysis for batch specs checks/ results , shift leadership skills , truck/tanker car load and unloading ...and the danger of cross contamination of chemicals such as oxidizers and reducers etc... Great veteran operators who enjoyed teaching and sharing there knowledge of the plant in order to build a strong shift...screening/ filtering or cleaning up an out of spec batch was one of the most difficult tasks aswell as running a reactor with several runs on it that compromised cooling water an cooling coil / jacket performance . Most enjoyable was the team work used to solve issues"
good,"First thing in the morning I opened outlook, review all emails from my boss and other staff members.

good,I handed out free balloons and had a blast just talking to people and watching the ball game with my family.
good,"I managed the telecommunications for a 1,500 person office complex, and had the opportunity to work with a variety of groups, as this was the first time may of the groups had been housed together. I provided daily supervision to a corporate message center at a time when communications was evolving from more people to more technology.  As a young engineer I was able to both lead that change for the Houston Dow Center, and participate in the corporate telecommunications leadership group, which culminated into a national multi-node satellite network. When the economy slumped in 1980, I was charged with salvaging a group of designers and draftsman though forming an internal security team and releasing the contract security guards.  There was never a moment where there were not similar opportunities."
good,"good company to work for with good pay and great benefits, taught me how to be an operator. the driving distance is the only difficult part."
good,A company that has strong values and impeccable EH&S performance. Great company to work for.

good,"Flexible working hour."
good,Worked there for Union Carbide/Dow Chemical for 25 years. Good place to work in the Petro-Chemical business.
good,"I was a co-op last year for Dow. I would come into work being my first job and all with a sense of self and wanting to come to work. Over trials and triumphs along the road it got rough, but things got easier with the support of my team members."
good,"Being in a distribution lab it is very busy. I work alone however if I need support it is a phone call away. I troubleshoot, communicate, verify product quality, and write any permits that may be needed."
good,"A Dow foi uma experiência fantástica, tive a oportunidade de trabalhar ao lado de grandes profissionais e grandes pessoas. Aprendi a lidar principalmente sob pressão, os resultados precisam ser positivos e quando não for possível, precisamos estar preparados para justifica-los."
good,Amezing experience to work with a company like DOW.
good,"I enjoyed working at the Midland office.  The people were energetic, typically young, possessed strong skills and worked in a collaborative environment.  I recommend that location."
good,"I only worked there as an intern. I love how challenging it was daily, even at the last day of internship! Everyone was friendly. We had a bit of too much meetings, but I learned a lot from all meetings.  It was fantastic watching all engineers discuss their problems and solve together. If they had a site in Rochester, NY, I would apply for a job there right away!"
good,gevaireerd werk omdat het werk verdeeld was in verschillende sectie van laden en lossen van vrachtwagens tot het bedienen van machines en of onderhouds werkzaamheden
good,"Dow is a good company... Very safe.  The pay isn't as good as most companies around, bonuses STINK comparatively. . . and they have way too many leadership roles that seem completely unecessary.  I hate the UNION for the most part, but it does have a few perks I suppose.  Came into work, log on computer, read logbook, MTL, review load/unload schedule and then get the scheduled work done over the time on shift.  My plant was very busy, so that was good... it was very different from typical Distribution jobs where cats just sat around in a warehouse pushing buttons.   We were very much like tank farm operators.  Great experience, but the union and the contracts within really hold people back, and push people away."
good,I was hired at Dow as a machine operator in a factory that produced Styrofoam Insulation board. The facility was small and the people I worked with where great.  There was plenty of opportunity to advance and learn other jobs.  I applied to every job opening and was promoted and at time I did a lateral move just to learn every position.  I eventually was promoted into my last role as Technical Advisor/Training Coordinator.
good,"Acting as a Implementation specialist and technical leadership for HP BTO tools like BSM, BAC, SiteScope, uCMDB, Vugen, BPM, RUM."
good,I would come in check all of my equipment. clean out what needs to be cleaned. before we started our work day. made sure equipment had fuel and hydraulic fluid.

good,"I hired in as an Administrative Assistant and through the employee development program was able to shadow and learn about technical positions that I was interested in performing.  I became an ODMS (Management Systems) Coordinator and Training Coordinator.  I decided to concentrate my efforts around training and learned the ADDIE training development process.  I was given opportunities to work on various training teams to improve site training, select external vendors for training and to leverage our knowledge and skills to all the training coordinators on site.  The days were often extremely busy as I supported personnel in all three Freeport plants and the new APB.  I supported between 250 - 300 people.  The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people and introducing them to their training program."
good,"The merger may be changing the experience of working there,  compensation, and number of jobs available.  Have to wait and see.  From what I have seen on Indeed, they are trying to lower wages, but only time will tell.  Very grateful to have had many good years there.  I wish I could have retired from there as well."
good,"My internship was 6 years ago so I don't remember it too well but it was very informative for a high school internship. The amount of work wasn't too much, and it was quite relaxed."
good,"interned in Midland, MI. boring town but fun place to work "
good,Work load was moderate but very fast paced. Starting or having a family was hard with the long hours and shifts over night. It was very hard to have a social life. I loved working with our operators. It was nice to work alone sometimes.
good,This company is striving to create an inclusive and diverse environment. there is good potential for growth in most of the jobs but not very much growth opportunity as an administrative assistant.
good,Great team and focus on global work process. Valued my time with Dow and enjoyed working wit the professional team there. Good opportunity to travel to various sites and grow.

Dow's integrated, market-driven portfolio delivers a broad range of technology-based products and solutions in high-growth sectors such as packaging, infrastructure, transportation, consumer care, electronics, and agriculture."
good,Dow chemical was a good place to work. Only concern was when there were chemical leaks. Depending on the job you have depends on the amount of walking and standing you will do. Other then that no complaints I enjoyed my time there.
good,Dow's workplace culture is the reason employee's stay at Dow. Dow allows their employee's to determine their own career path and no 2 paths are ever the same.
good,Una empresa en la que puedes crecer laboral y personalmente en todos los sentidos.

good,"Dow will let you work as much as you want. A typical day at work for me would begin with meetings I lead beginning at 0800 and continueing until I went home at 5pm. Because of the nature of the work there were often times I worked after 5pm and through the weekend. I learned a lot about big corporations and how they use their size to take advantage of smaller companies. The management is strictly focused on lowest cost to server, therefore the employees are not as important as reducing costs. The main focus is to outsource everything possible to a lower cost provider. The co-workers are the best. Because everyone is so worried about losing their job to an off-shore company, my co-workers worked day and night in an attempt to keep their jobs. The hardest part of the job was watching people put their life and sole into making their job the best it could be just to find out their job was being eliminated strictly due to cost. The most enjoyable part of my job was clearly the people I worked with, both in side the company and external to the company."

Management was great and made working at Dow fun. In all the years I worked there I only came across one really bad supervisor. She should never be over people because she even admitted to me that she was uncomfortable leading others. My co-workers where ever I have been have all been fantastic!

Upper Management had the final review of the work so you always knew how they thought of your work.

The management were great teachers and most of them very concerned and helpful.  Help to built a pilot plant and a semi- production plant.  It was great to work from the starting  development to a semi-production stage.  The hardest part of the job was trying to find a associate at a higher level as your mentor as this was the only way to advance at Dow.
good,"Awesome place, great benefits and plenty of nice people that help out when needed.  When you have issues that need to be taken care of Dow allows you time off without question."
good,"The soul purpose of being a Utility Operator at Dow, is to keep the 3 burners going at a certain temperature for Alpha and Beta Plants to operate. The different plants use this heat to maintain different temperatures to apply to different chemicals to produce a particular product. My co-workers are beyond reproach. They'll go out of there way to help you succeed in the teams final goal. The hardest part of the job is remembering all the safety concerns off the top of your head. Most enjoyable part of my job was adjusting the temperatures when either plants front end went down,because if you can't adjust the heat, the process shuts down."

good,"On a typical day I do QC work or weigh ups of raw materials. "
good,I've had an awesome time with Dow...but I am looking fo new challenges
good,"Working as a contractor for Dow was one of the better jobs I've had in a long while. I found the people I worked with to be very helpful and appreciative of my contributions. I enjoyed coming to work each day, and the flexibility of allowing me to work around my personal schedule at times. I got to learn new skills from my supervisors and co-workers, who were always very nice and willing to work with some on the bumps in the road I encountered. I think the hardest part was having to leave when my project was complete."
good,Overall I am pleased with my time at Dow. My management team has really invested themselves into our team both personally and professionally to ensure a high level employee satisfaction.

You are required to work longer hours during the month close, but depending upon your manager and team you may get financially compensated for this. The workplace culture is competitive and balanced."
good,"Dow is invested in its employees: internally, classes on personal and profession growth are offered. Dow wants you to do the best you can do and is invested in helping you get there. Management is well trained.  As with any job, some managers are better than others, but my experience has been overall very positive. In my department collaboration is valued, I would not call it cut-throat or competitive.  I love my coworkers and the collaborations they offer. Dow is also continually putting effort into ensuring diversity since diversity and inclusion is a core Dow value. The leadership is not diverse, which is a growth opportunity for Dow."

good,"Despite of loads of work the management policies are keeping it light and does not allow to build pressure on Individual (be it experienced and new to DOW or a fresher)."
good,"A typical day for me is using strategy to source and manage the bid process.  I've learned invaluable skills with tools, such as eSourcing, and also how to negotiate and procure the best price and quality product and services for the company.  My leader gives me the freedom to plan and manage my projects and my day to day activities and I appreciate that.  My co-workers are supportive and a joy to work with.  The most important aspect of my job that is imperative for me going forward is the flexibility.  "
good,"A typical work day varies, for the most part it is relaxed as long as you make your rounds and stay on top of what your process is doing. Co-workers are great, you spend a lot of time together and get to know each other and you become pretty much like family after a period of time. Over the 31 years I was there I have had the opportunity to learn and experience a wide field of the chemical manufacturing industry. The hardest part of the job was working the rotating swing shift, the best part of the job was the people."
good,A typical day at work would be classified as very busy. You learned a lot on how to troubleshoot various pieces of equipment. Management is there at all times to answer any questions you may have. The co-workers are always willing to lend a helping hand when needed. The hardest part about the job is we are severely understaffed. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you are always busy and that helps the day to go by faster.
good,"I worked for Dow for 24 years. During this time I continued to grow and learn constantly with outstanding support and opportunities for overseas assignments, new challenges and was always in a market facing environment. I managed large complex technical organisations around the world with fantastic capabilities and ability to develop new products and applications. I had an extremely good work-life balance and office environment based in Switzerland, or even when based in USA on three separate assignments. Despite really hard work and sometimes long hours I was able to manage my travel and home life perfectly. Dow is a large matrix managed company and probably the most frustrating aspect was the pace of decision making and the approval processes to get things done. Unfortunately too much bureaucracy existed with too many metrics which somewhat slowed the innovation process. However, I felt like a key share holder of the company, and proudly wore the Dow Diamond on my jacket wherever I travelled. I have great respect for this company and all it stands for in it's approach to safety, environmental protection and how it treats it's employees. I learnt so much during my time, it's impossible to list all."
good,"Desenvolvimento, implementação e coordenação do programa de treinamento da fábrica de acordo com as políticas e procedimentos. Suporte a projetos de aprendizagem locais e globais.

good,"- A typical day can be busy but the hours go by very fast"
good,"As previously noted, I worked in the Research Center of The Dow Chemical Company.  My job, mainly, was to type research reports based upon the research being done in the lab which I was stationed.  We also sent a lot of ""communications"" to people all over the world, including Africa.  Often times, Management would hand over some report which needed to get done ""yesterday.""  I would usually get handed this report because I learned to type 120 wpm, including chemical equations with great accuracy.  My co-workers were more than just that.  They were my friends and family.  Together we worked a lot of overtime and became the most productive research admin. assistants in the whole Center.  I also was selected to work exclusively for a Sr. Research Manager due to my office skills.  I loved working at Dow and usually came in early, and worked late, just like my co-workers.  Management was very appreciative!"
good,"This was a great company to work with. I was a contractor through Kelly Engineering and was treated very well at the Plaquemine, LA location for Dow Chemical. The flexible hours are a huge plus! The pay was good and I felt very safe inside the plant. The benefits were not that great through Kelly but they never are for contractors. I hope to one day be a permanent employee at this site."
good,"Typical days at work are Monday to Friday."
good,My direct supervisor had an open door policy was willing to assist in any problems that were going on.

good,"I could always be certain that performance reviews were thorough and that when I had met requirements to advance to each level, I would have support from leadership."
good,"Overall a great place to work. Management listens to the employees, and co-workers are helpful. The typical day consisted of working with people across the campus and coordinating different types of testing for our product.

The best part of the job is working as a team and really accomplishing great things."

good,"A fast paced, busy environment.  Very rewarding.  Diverse culture with the ability to grow and expand your skills under the umbrella of one company.  Proud to have The Dow Chemical Company on my resume."
good,"A project-oriented environment with great resources and talent surrounding my lab.  Primary task was to set up and measure physical properties and unique projects to solve plant problems, size relief valves, shipping and transportation safety, and other custom needs.  Would often be setting up, measuring, designing, awaiting samples to be shipped from client and attending safety reviews all in same day, a multi-tasked environment.  Great promotion environment if you are motivated."

good,"The only thing typical about a day at Dow is that the work never stops and you rarely see the same issue in the same two week period.  I learned how to look at each situation differently and to trust the user but verify.  I learned how to install, connect, configure & make servers operational. I also learned how to troubleshoot network components. The management at Dow was always helpful and encouraging couldn't ask for a better team.  The hardest part of the job was lack of training from IBM, which made the job very difficult.  The parts of the job I enjoyed the most was that I was not micromanaged.  I was able to view my tickets, prioritize them and work with user as needed.  Managing my task and was solely up to me."

good,"It's one of the most comfortable and work-friendly environment with flexible schedule and weekly targets.  I learned the real-time design and working of a multi-billion dollar worth continuous plant.  The management was very amicable and supported me a lot in transitioning from academics to industry.

They taught me the basic fundamentals about Instrumentation. Management was always great from what i saw, i never really interacted with them much. The workplace culture was always safety first and that was a huge impact as to how i work today. the hardest part of the job would have been working while i was still in school but they always gave me the benefit of the doubt. The most enjoyable part of the job was how much respect they would give me even though i was so young at the time.
