rating,review
bad,"If you like working with idiots,hazardous materials and watching the executives get all the rewards then this is the place for you. Good Luck You’re going to need it"
bad,bad place to work no help no anything just threats if you don't obey their orders to get work done faster you won't learn anything if you can't do the job your just fired
bad,"Horrible, horrible supervisors, hr and all management! "
bad,"I feel this is not the company for me. Although, it helped me see how others work ethics and values are different than my own. I believe in showing respect to all even if I agree to disagree. I can't say the same for this company."
bad,"If you admire a Design Drafting Manager with self esteem issues and who micro-manages, then this job is for you! The Design Drafting Department is going through PLM challenges with poor managerial decisions."
bad,The company packed up and moved to Mexico but when they knew they were doing that they fired a lot of people so they wouldn't have to pay severance packages.
bad,"Some people that has been there for 30 years are only making $16.00 an hr. They offer pto time instead. The place is very stressful. Always having to look over your shoulder. HR is out  for management. I was there for 3 years to many. Quit found a better paying job, closer to home. More relaxed atmosphere. Would not recommend UTC to anyone."
bad,"Daily job duties included reading blue prints, setting schedules, ordering parts, invoicing parts and assembling products as client demand dictates. self management."
bad,it was good while it lasted was hoping i could have stayed there until i retired but they had other plans i was good at what id did taking care of wave and fixing what wave missed
bad,"Starting there it was an awesome job, they started to slowly take benefits from us and exchange them for extremely cheap ideas. Then the announcement of the move to Mexico and it steadily went down hill from there!"
bad,I would stay if they didnt move to Mexico. I liked the people I worked with for the short amount of time I was there. It was sad to go. I was crossed trained in all different departments before I left
bad,I did manufacturing association  /quality/ machine operator/ team leader . It was a great place to work with great pay and benefits . We also did a lot for the cummunity and for our co-workwr . We were a family as well as a team until cooperate greed took over and they moved to Mexico taking 3000 American jobs with them
bad,very unstable management could be a lot better too. •Your Review doesn't quite meet our quality guidelines. Please adjust and resubmit it could be better I don't like it
bad,Work / life balance is horrible.  New bosses every 6 months and management knows nothing about how to do your job.  They sure know how to tell you to do it though.  Other co-workers are lazy and are rewarded for that behavior.
bad,I got a project after many struggle. It was through my linked profile. Company work culture is not good. I was always getting the salary late. It was after multiple follow up.
bad,They are moving the plant to Mexico. They do not care about United States jobs only the bottom line. They are moving it while having record profits producing in the United States.
bad,This company has decided to move its operations to Mexico taking 1100 jobs out of Indiana. They lack in ethics in the treatment of their employees.
bad,"Be careful about United Technologies.  There is no work life balance.  There is no comp time even if you work 90 hours in a week"
bad,Company has lots of work and projects. The only and biggest negative of the company is its payroll. salary is delayed for 2 or 3 months. good workplace environment and people
bad,lots of arts and charts all management driven from Conn long days
bad,will never work for a UTC company again. all about ACE and not about work.
bad,Eu sempre me dei bem com todos meus colegas de trabalho nunca eu sempre me triguei com nem um dos meus amigos.
bad,"United Technologies doesn't care about their employees at all. They don't care about employee dedication to the job or people they work with. Bottom line is they only care about how much money that they can put into their and their shareholders pockets. I have worked for them and had people who worked with me that worked for them, and as soon as they found out that UTC bought our company, they quit and went to work for somebody else, and it's easy to see why."
bad,"Poor, inexperienced, micro are three of the best words to describe the management that has become to have a supervisory style where management is not employee friendly and are very poor in responding to employee's needs, concerns and requirements. Not a company I would recommend working for.  This company is focusing on a younger inexperienced work force, dedication and loyalty are no longer valued by this employer."
bad,"Let's put it this way.  If you unexpectedly died, managment would first ask, can we absorb the headcount.  If not, how long will it take to fill?  Nobody is coming to your funeral."
bad,"Otis est une société ultralibérale. Qui considère ses employés comme une variable ajustable."
bad,"Management is extremely cheap and unfair to employees."
bad,"Coworkers in the facility were some of the best people I have had the pleasure to work with. However management is dysfunctional and only concerned with reports, charts and graphs. No interaction with management until an issue would arise. Management has no concept of work performed or what was involved in getting the job done. No communications as to what was happening in regards to new jobs or customers."
bad,"Bad experience within a toxic environment coupled with long hours."
bad,I never make it a point to review my past employers.  My typical work day was typical of the job requirements of the postion that I had interviewed for.
bad,"Quality and Attention to Detail is not important. I would not describe this as a team environment. Production is more important than it's people. People are not respected and made to know that they can be replaced at anytime. Managers lead by fear and intimidation. It doesn't matter what you know or how long you have been doing your job, the manager is always right even when he is not. This company is just looking for another work horse and scape goat if there is a problem or if the manager turns out to be wrong. You will not be valued or appreciated. This place is about games and only cares about showing you who the boss is. Managers have a ""god like"" view of themselves and a project can be ran into the ground and you will have a job as long as you pat your manager on the back and tell him how great he is. Stay away from this place. Not worth your time. Just pass this company up and keep on looking. Not worth the stress or headaches"
bad,"This company is a good old boys club. "
bad,"Process Improvement and employee engagement policies, while preached and encouraged by executive management, are not taken seriously or implemented by Business Units and middle management."
bad,This Company Is on a downhill spiral fast.  I am willing to bet they will be closed in 5 years completely.  At least the branch I worked at.  Just a non team orientanted enviroment.  Who would want to work for a company like that.
bad,"No organization, dysfunctional management . Especially no communication. Management wants to be the only one with information to make themselves feel important."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was leading a team of outstanding and dedicated employees both newbies and long-timers!  The dedication of the mid-level workforce keeps the place going!
bad,"Management is overwhelmed"
bad,Company shut down to relocate to Mexico. No concern for all employees being let go. This was a big issue during Presidential election of 2016. Company did not care about employees livelyhood.
bad,The culture was unhealthy - it was a throw someone under the bus type of environment. Ethical issues that I raised within senior leadership were ignored - I was treated differently by the company as a result of bringing the unethical behavior to light. The management I worked for would publicly belittle me in front of my colleagues and created a very uncomfortable environment that I dreaded returning to every day.
bad,United Technologies Fort Worth office follows Government Compliance rules when it is convenient for them only.  Poor communication for such a small office.   Front office is not run professionally.
bad,"poor work environment.  stressful and no appreciation for others, it is a chore to show up for work endless red tape, plant floor is nicer than the offices"
bad,"A typical work day started at 4:00 a.m. , 6 days a week and sometimes 7. Management were bullies and unapproachable. There was no time for outside life with family and friends. There was no way to work your way up in the company especially if you are a woman."
bad,Great place for people with blind ambition.  Really sickening place to work cause of the a&% kissers.  Not looking forward to ever going to work there.
bad,"I worked for a small subsidiary of this company, "
bad,Management is in meeting all day unaware of employees needs. Employees overworked and then not paying attention to detail. Lost of finger pointing for failed parts and processes.
bad,"Old boy network prevalent with ignorance of effective financial methods - ""penny wise, pound foolish"". Unwillingness to admit management incompetence. Us vs them attitude between management and lower levels causing extremely pensive and stressful atmosphere. Inability to recognize management talent; promote technical experts into management positions without leadership training. No evidence of competent program management or configuration management."
bad,"I was very unhappy there. Had to do everyones job to do yours."
bad,"keeping active"
bad,I did not like working at UTC.  Very isolating environment and little to no on-boarding.  I spent much of the day attending mass meetings via conference lines.
bad,"Management is weak and retaliatory. Your opinion is never valued, and there is no room for career growth. The only way to advance from your position is to leave the company."
bad,This place has the worst HR know in history. Managers bully and attack you and HR will admit they are wrong and then come after you. This was the hands down worst experience of my life. Absolutely no training. You have to cry and scream if you want any sort of training at all. They just announced that instead of an annual pay raise for 2016 they are decreasing the salaries by 2%
bad,"Mad that they thought so little of their employees here in the US. Corporate greed is an awful thing. I liked the job. I had planned on retiring from UTEC. We had great benefits, health insurance at a reasonable cost, dental insurance, 401K, decent wages. I worked with a lot of great people."
bad,"The people and mid level management were great, the shop people were awesome. Once Goodrich Corporation was bought out by UTC, it went to downhill in about 2.5 seconds. You became a number and not a person."
bad,"They are moving to Mexico so I am no going to recommend working here. Up until they told us they were moving to mexico it was a great place to work. Now not so much, they have drug this closing out for over a year."
bad,"Hard working and self motivated individual. Quick learner, ready to make immediate contribution. Team player willing to be part of the long term growth of an organization. Time management and plan ahead to eliminate unforeseen problems. Resolution of  issues and meeting deliverables to aid management in making informed decisions. Clarifying problems by engaging it's key stakeholders by driving to the root cause of the problem, determining the best possible outcome and  it's measureable metrics."
bad,was a good place to work for five years that i was there.when i started the pay for level two was too low compared to level one.i took the job anyway.I was not going to stay very long.I liked what i was doing so i stayed hoping to get level one pay.but after five years they closed the plant and moved to mexico.
bad,"UTC has a great reputation for its operational excellence and technical expertise. The culture however, is about the worst I have ever experienced. It is a fear based culture where only the senior most executives matter . The company stays out of legal trouble because the divisions are independent and dispersed. Although many benefits have been evolved, leadership is old school and all except executives, go along to get along."
bad,The supervisors are of no help at all and there is no support system besides follow your standard work that doesn't have all the answers. And your not allow to ask your co-workers questions even though your new and there is no supervisor to be found. I would advise anyone who is offered a job with UTC (Onity Customer Service) department to be prepared for disappointment.
bad,It's not a good place to work. You ask for more money and they look at you crazy. They really don't care about you. They only care about getting the product out.
bad,"typical day is hustle , I have learned about aircraft, management telling us not to worry about jobs we are not laying off,"
bad,"Program managers are expected to be available 24/7.  I was on medical leave for 30 days, the day I returned a shipment shipped that should not have and I was held responsible for it.  Not the PM's (my boss) that was supposed to be covering for me while I was out.  Nothing happened to her, but I was written up and put on a final warning.  Then I communicated to my client that we would not be able to deliver engineering drawings on the day they requested because that is what i was informed of my Eng Management.  I was let go after that for communication with the client.  Those in positions of leadership are not held accountable for anything but those of us that are the worker bees were held always held accountable."
bad,"The company has many interesting and exciting products that provides a sense of pride for the employees.  Although the company portrays a positive work environment that includes career advancement and continued growth, it is a hollow image.   The company is far from modernization in its technology for its employees, as well as the employee work-life balance.  Overall the people interaction is great and it's what keeps many people afloat.  Many lay-offs have occurred in the past 5 years that has led to more job responsibilities and continues to eliminate any advancement opportunities."
bad,I would like to work for better project leaders.
bad,"Worse place for work management turn in family business,   Bad benefit I don’t recommend nobody to apply for work there I hope they go out of business"
bad,"The initial start was great, but the internal politics was a big problem. I had a key role but there was age bias and an overall sense of the company going under."
bad,"The Salem location is not consistent with other UTC locations, regarding policy, process, and standards.  Management is not forward thinking which forces them to be reactive instead of proactive. Communication is fragmented at best."
bad,"No se cuenta con liderazgo, sino solo jefes los cuales faltan al respeto, te gritan frente a tus companeros y ejercen en el empleado un maltrato psicosocial con la extrema demanda de tareas, cero coaching, y exigencia de tareas multiples fuera de la descripcion de puesto. Exigencia de contestaciones laborales en dias libres, vacaciones, etc."
bad,"This particular UTAS Fairfield site is at the end of its life cycle, little investment is allowed by its Phoenix masters to update and sustain.  Has the most excessive turnover I have encountered in my entire career.  I enjoyed my job, but to watch the surrounding avoidable neglect is painful.  Management is not mean or anything, they just know little about the product line and how to use a viable ERP system to run Engineering, Purchasing, and Operations."
bad,too many restructures of group showing success in quality.  Segregated global business into regional businesses.  Ran a service organization manage local and off site train from registratio through quality reviews
bad,"Depending on which division of UTC you work for (Kidde, Otis, Carrier, etc.) will determine which culture you actually experience.  I work at Kidde, who is pretty old fashioned when it comes to innovation and employee experience.  Expect budget cuts, do more with less, no or very low raises, etc..  It's not a place with perks for low, mid, or non-management."
bad,"Good place if you’re into machining. Management is not that good in my opinion, but you’ll get used to it. I was only an intern there so i can’t give a full review"
bad,"If you're not related to management or best friends, there's no possibility of advancement. Very biased in their hiring and promotions, promoting family and friends over more qualified individuals. They will promote screw ups to management while slandering those who work hard to keep people where they want them, instead of giving people fair chances for advancement."
bad,"UTAS is a place for people who do not have any other responsibilities other than their job. If you are not looking for no work/life balance then this is the place for you. "
bad,"Office located right by the Indianapolis airport. Office is in poor condition, lots of layoffs. Chance to work on interesting projects."
bad,People are pleasant. Constant opportunity to learn. No cafeteria food service. Nice view from the window. Nice and modern office building.
bad,"During the days of Goodrich, things were pretty promising and looked good for the future after winning 6 new commercial aircraft programs for development. During the transition to UTC, things became gray and uncertain for both older and younger employees. Gradually the cuts started and changes within the company moved in. About 80% of manufacturing is now done out of the country which makes it tough for around the clock support from engineering. Management focuses too much on measures and not focusing on getting tasks done. Management is disorganized and scream for any little task to be urgent even though it is not. Hard to get recognition for work even with the many hours and dedication you spend on your assigned duties. Individuals are given too much work and causes stress on employees throughout the day."
bad,"Great co- workers for the most part. 95% of workers on shop floor are extremely unhappy with COMPANY POLITICS AND MANAGEMENT! "
bad,"A division of United Technologies that was in the process of closing it's doors, and they needed help finishing up their projects committed to their manufacturing operations in Mexico"
bad,"lacks management, lacks accountability for the work people do, poor benefits package, must compete for vacation time off, fast pace, work a lot of overtime"
bad,"You are not treated as a person. All you are do this company is a number. All they care about is the oh mighty $$. They expect you to work seven days a week 10-12 hours a day, No life balance what so ever."
bad,My job is currently being sent to Mexico along with Carrier in Indianapolis.  The general working environment is very tense currently.  Morale is not very high given the circumstances.
bad,"They hire good people to make them edit presentations for a living. Not happy with the respect and treatment of women, worse than what I have seen in other places."
bad,"The people I worked with were great to get along with."
bad,"A typical day at work was unorganized, dirty, and frustrating. I learned that i can get the job done in less of a desired environment . Management were bullies, rude and did not work as a team. My co-workers were great. Frustrated with the environment, lack of communication and support. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management that didn't care as well as HR that didn't care. The best part of the job was the co-workers. We all supported each other with the stress and frustration of the company being ran into the ground."
bad,Not open to new ideas. Perfect example of work harder not smarter.
bad,tentei avaliar da maneira mais correta possivel é trabalhar nesta pra mim eu não gostei
bad,"Culture was wicked! Did NOT care about employees! Production of their product was their main concern! Quality was not important to them!"
bad,"A typical day for me at UTC was to show up at 5 to 5:30 and begin with making sure the mechanics had what they needed to perform their job for the day.  Then I would put receive and put away any freight that showed up in my area over night.  Once UPS, FedEx and other trucks arrived I would unbox and verify the part numbers to the PO's.  If there were any problems I would then have to contac the buyers or suppliers to get the PO corrected.  I would then put the freight away by FIFO'ing the parts.  I would fill Kanbans for upcoming units.  If I had a unit to ship that day I would make sure that the parts were packed and ready to ship.  If all went well for the day I could leave at normal closing hours which was 3:30, but most days I would put in 12 to 14 (somtime longer) hours before calling it a day.  This is a job that requires you to be on schedule at all times.  If something got in the way you will have to deal with it and get back on track before you were allowed to go home."
bad,"Worked with Six Sigma, Scrap rates, Mentored employees, Improved Metrics, Trained employees, worked to certify vendors, member of Safety Team, recommended outside training for employees."
bad,"Org seems to concentrate on the wrong issues when problem solving.  To get the P&L in order, they chose layoffs instead of doing the work to solve the problems which were impacting the P&L"
bad,To advance in this company you have to be part of the in crowd. Work hard and people who were hired after you will still be there or advance in front of you.
bad,"You work 10 hours a day 6 days a week, but you are hired to work 4 days a week 10 hours a day.  Any month with 5 weeks you are laid off one week. It is a union job so employee fist fight, curse, carry weapon and threaten each other and keep their jobs.  A very hostel work environment. The factory is clean but very hot."
bad,"Having worked a UTAS in San Diego on (2) occasions it became clear to me that there was NO sense of loyalty among the worker force. All positions were unstable which made the culture very cut throat. The positions were very demanding and the work culture was not the best. With unpaid mandatory furlough days and having almost no PTO for holidays, UTAS pretty much was a sweat shop for those in aerospace. "
bad,"constant changes, never staying on track, lack of processes and procedures. Internal ERP systems is not aligned with business needs. Lack of strategic focus and direction. Unrealistic expectations of employees."
bad,"The work environment was clean, climate controlled and no at all physically demanding.  However, the employees were entitled and there was absolutely no accountability.  The union was political and served only those who needed protecting.  Complacency and lack of strong management was likely a catalyst in the company moving to Mexico."
bad,Constant restructure; HR is all about company; Senior managers do not listen; Low compensation; Too many red tapes; Love the co-workers though; Would not recommend to work there.
bad,"Their systems are very difficult to use and are not user friendly."
bad,Lots of hours and tough work. lots of overtime with very strict responsibilities. No one takes the job seriously so it is very stressful. pay is not worth the job
bad,Company was acquired by UTC.  As expected previous smaller office culture was greatly impacted after assimilating to the larger company's process and procedures.
bad,"I worked a UTC for 3 years after they bought Goodrich.  Company is all about the next quarters numbers and it's not what you know, it's who's butt you kiss to get ahead"
bad,Support a Family of 5. They recently cut Medical expenses. Large cooperate company hard to get things done. Say they will change but don't. They need more of a strong leadership that want to build a business.
bad,They try to keep changing there commission plan and not getting the sole purpose of producing revenue that is to push service sales to get there cash flow going.
bad,"If you did a case study on corporate america this company would be a prime candidate to show all that is bad. Yearly layoffs, merely adequate benefits, and a terrible company culture. On top of that they are penny pinchers and they don't really care about the people or work place morale."
bad,Due to recent unethical treatment of employees I need to find other employment.
bad,"There are many United Technologies Aerospace Systems business units, so it is hard to provide a one-size-fits all review.  I had the unique opportunity to view the company from the inside and the outside with regard to Fire Protection Systems for Aero and Defense programs.  Regardless of the corporate mantra, the local business is very much at the mercy of local management.  Local management makes itself look good to upper management and customers, while low level salaried professionals get left holding the bag.  "
bad,Otis Elevator used to be a great place to work in the 90s. Something has changed there in the last handful of years.  New management did not seem to value long-time employees and their loyalty. My work group left the company in 2017. Management in Florida did not bother to take the time to say a proper goodbye to us after many years working there as tenured employees. When calling HR with a  benefits question after leaving the company ..I still have not received a call back after three weeks. This does not set a good example of the direction the company's values toward employees.
bad,"United Technologies was a good place to work, but is currently undergoing a transfer of manufacturing to Mexico.  Only design and similar support roles/departments will remain.  The current atmosphere is an unrealistic expectation of work effort by all the are involved in the transition of manufacturing. It is possible that this will be a good place to work again sometime in the future.  It is possible that this will be a good company to work for in the future."
bad,"They threw all the workers under the bus. They are moving to Mexico. Made no difference that we make them huge profit, they are greedy and want more. There are people there that have spent their entire work life at Utec. The company doesn't care about any of that. We are just the backbone of the company. Their profits were made on all our sacrifices. We worked tremendous amounts of overtime, took time away from our lives and families, and this is how they repay us.   They need to remember what they say about KARMA!!!"
bad,"It was easy work for low to moderate pay. This company, like many others, values profit more than humane compensation. They are moving this facility out of the country so that they can worry even less about fair compensation."
bad,"a lot of broken policies - ineffective HR and management -"
bad,"Starts a half hour before shift meeting, be on the floor by 15minutes prior start time to get line set up and associates in proper personal protection equipment, log into Kronos( attendance/time clock) place extra people and move accordingly to job/skill for absent associates. make contact with other supervisors to make sure cross communications are open and to have the parts needed to the line in order to make production.  Deal with bad fabrication parts, machine break downs, purchase part shortages.  Deal with associates who don't feel like working."
bad,Poor overall culture with sub-par leadership. Example is cutting the employee school program (paying for part-time school) while people were in the middle of their degree.
bad,"Was ok to work there, many challenges, no defined direction, good people to work with. Communication lacking. Separation of management levels was not there"
bad,"Not a good work environment, very competitive, people move in and out too much, management of duties are unclear and keep moving, work goals are always changing"
bad,"The company is closing and moving to Mexico. United Technologies has great benefits, such as four paid weeks of personal time off, one week of paid sick time, and the company pay for college tuition."
bad,I like working in repair department. Because you get more experiences than others area. Now the only problem is the confined spaces are not there anymore.
bad,The work environment was good with an emphasis on safety procedures and safe guards on equipment. I learned many manufacturing skills and what it takes to succeed. The plant employees are very friendly and helpful. The management however is not very helpful when it comes to advancement opportunities.
bad,"Recently United Technologies has become infamous in the news.  It is planning on sending its last American factory to Mexico.  More on this later; I should describe my time at work first."
bad,Not the best place if you want to introduce new ideas and challenge the status quo. They are in great need of some new blood in the seniors ranks.
bad,First job out of college seemed great until purchased by UTC. Positive culture which can be one of the only benefits took a hit as well a some key compensatory benefits like 8% 401k matching and health plans (pretty ubiquitous at this point though). I'm glad I have a job but overall I think i'd be happy anywhere else.
bad,pay and benefits are not comparable to any other manufacturing company and there is not much room for growth without going back to school
bad,"Worked here for about 5 months, was not feeling it. Managers are made to scare you and make you feel like you can be replaced at any time. Efficiency checks every month are made to “make sure you’re doing the right amount of work”."
bad,Being in the Heating/Ventilating and Air Conditioning company is a fast paced environment.  Customer service is key to maintaining relationships and continued business.  All accounts have critical needs to maintain their required temperatures in the building.  The job required wearing many different hats and have the ability to juggle from one thing to the next to satisfy the needs of our customers.  I managed many projects that in some cases took several weeks to several months to complete. Pleasing every customer was my main focus while maintaining a great working relationship with all those on my team.
bad,"Was a nice place to work until UTC bought out the plant after that UTC policy enforced everywhere even if it hurts production and processes."
bad,"Typical day at work involves lab inspections, project meetings, and experimentation. Learned practical experience in developing ""green"" technology, test stand assembly, understanding failures/repairs through RRCA methodology, project planning/execution. Co-workers are always approachable and willing to help a colleague in need. Multi-tasking is the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is having many avenues in improving health/wellness, employee engagement, and the broad range of challenges from each project."
bad,ITf was my start in the manufacturing that supplied automitive industry
bad,There are too many levels to navigate in order to achieve results.  Since the United Technologies acquisition of Goodrich the management of the organization has declined.
bad,"If you love to travel then this is the job for you! The team are extremely diverse located all over Europe. No physical offices means you work from your home office when you are not travelling. Quarterly meetings and training's are included which is great. The company has amazing learning development plans, either taking up a Bachelors degree / Degree or another course paid for by them. The travel got too much for me at the end, as I was away from London more than I wanted to be."
bad,United Technologies pioneered the use of individual personal computers for large community computer processing projects such as cancer research and internet performance testing.
bad,Worked with the company for 20 years under different names and was a great place to work until United Technologies came in.  I was layed off with no prior discipline issues and told the company was headed in a different direction.
bad,"While I had the opportunity to intern at UTC, I realized how there was a lack of diversity, and also work for interns was quite limited."
bad,Company is shipping jobs overseas. No job security at all unless you are in government work
bad,No comment due to plant closure. Don't have a review at this time.
bad,"People are unfriendly, everything is run by the union in the plants. Leaders lead by fear."
bad,"Overall, working for a large corporation has a lot of drawbacks. Company is not worried about retaining employees and lacks any sense of culture. "
bad,Company moving several production plants to mexico. Would have loved to kept working there as long as possible. Amazing coworkers. Great ability in job advancement.
good,"This was a good job to put on the resume working for a fortune 50 company in the controller's office."
good,"People are there forever and many have never worked anywhere else before. Management only cares about engineering and data, co-workers are ok."
good,"They treated us college kids terrible when we rwere working there. They took ""working like a dog"" to a whole new level. They didn't care about any of our lives - just worked worked worked us."
good,"typical day: walk in, less than 2 minutes someone was at your desk before you can get everything set for the day. As the day goes on leadership is constantly hovering thinking it helps get work done faster. Leadership always likes to ask what the area needs ;to be productive and never gave the assistance needed. Was not paid the full amount that was said was going to receive. You end up doing at least 3 peoples jobs at one time and are asked why half the work was not complete in one day."
good,They only pushed to get things out the door not caring about true quality. Telling people that they had to work long hours and that time off was very much declined.
good,"In a good functioning setting the right arm so-to-speak should know what the left arm is doing.  Strong and consistent flowing communication is needed here.  Accurate information and more up-to-date technology is vital to this company's success. "
good,"Good pay and benefits but working conditions are horrible. No flexibility in daily work schedules, like a retail environment. Management is tyeranical, if you speak out you are chastised or terminated."
good,"Formerly Goodrich. Purchased by UTC a little over 5 years ago. Work place still in transition phase. Slowly learning and adopting UTC policies. Instead of taking opportunity to implement processes in way that would be helpful to organization, processes are implemented with brute force with little common sense."
good,"working here was no great deal"
good,"UTC is a great company if you are passionate about Aerospace and Engineering. If you can find a good group, then work/life balance is sure to be a pro at this company, as you are given laptops and have the ability to work from home if your supervisor allows it. Much of the company is still male dominated and some groups still show favoritism toward their ""boys clubs."" It is very frustrating to work for a company who's culture is still stuck in the past. Some managers promote working from home, while others are completely against it. Many departments are extremely disorganized and lack structure and upper management support. When it comes to management, it seems that only friends get promoted or those who are not well-suited for management positions. UTC is also very behind the times when it comes to technology and needs to play catch-up if they want to remain competitive."
good,I have nothing to add to this section. I would suggest you make sure you know what the role is before taking on the job. Was not the right culture for me.
good,"UTC is a great company, with many talented people, great products, and global reach. Still struggling with a culture that does not value the individuals contribution to overall success.  Very political environment."
good,"Office Management and well disciplined atmosphere."
good,"IT functions are prohibitive.  Very big company mentality.  Not much emphasis on employee cultivation.  Travel restriction issue for most Westford employees.  "
good,"Very dated facility in Indianapolis.  Very dated culture, but starting to get better at increasing flexibility and and vacation benefits.  Management is not in it to advance others.  They form cliques and you if are not a part of the clique, you may as well give up on advancing past a certain level."
good,"Company very secretive of what programs are leaving or coming in "
good,"it is a wonderful place to be on paper. Unfortunately, due to management people leave. They do not hire managers based on whether or not they are qualified, but rather based on hole filling to appease the corporate heads and get a ""at ta boy"" I recently had a manger that could not figure out part numbers and he in fact would tell me the wrong ones, It was a mess. Workplace culture is ""okay"" in some departments. unfortunately, there are some folks that are complacent and its job security for them. They will not train new people to save their jobs. Hardest part of the job is communication. If you choose second shift or third shift you might as well not exist to anyone important there. I enjoyed the benefits. That's about all I can say about that."
good,Hourly people are under paid.  And management do not reward their people accordingly.  Merit raises submitted 6 months ago still hasn’t  been approved or processed.
good,"Old company that does not like to change, the most important is profits, so people need to have 3 positions at the same time"
good,"The culture at UTC is to work more hours, nights and weekends included. They keep winning new business and are not willing to hire accordingly. This drives a poor work/life balance and low employee morale."
good,"UTC really is a wildcard for an employee. the company culture starts with your department, and it feels like your local manager has full control over your activities. Some managers are strict and some are lenient. The bottom line is you make you manager happy and you will be fine. However once a situation is elevated and other managers/HR are involved, you are judged by the book and punished as harshly as possible. If you do get employed by UTC avoid being in the cross hairs of any HR personnel. They are often not kept in the same building as you work in and you'll likely have no personal relationship with your HR manager as you would your manager. There are situations where this management is flexible on one-ting while HR has a zero-tolerance policy. So if you ever have any run-ins with HR, be warned it will often be worse than your managers insist."
good,Horrible Executive Leadership team; incompetent management; horrible culture; nepotism; always in fear of loosing job. The only benefit to all of this is that I've had to learn more than I ever thought about the full Supply Chain value stream.
good,"Work , Always change of management , its difficult to work , lots of politics , it was difficult to do day to day job . no future for promotion or higher position  .once they contracted out to Xerox it was more difficult to work , Xerox policy is to work there way no way , they don't care for employees or work ethics."
good,"It started out as a fun challenging job with an inclusive culture but due to constant change in leadership, the culture has eroded and many broken process go unaddressed."
good,"Loved my job functions and would have stayed if it wasn't for the fact that I was consistently the last person out of the office every evening and had no time to myself, while my managers had plenty of work/;ife balance.  Management is the main problem with this company.  I describe UTC as a snake pit."
good,"Much more travel than their requirements for the position listed. And, having to pay for own travel up front and with frequency of travel you never catch up with reimbursements until you leave position."
good,"This place is a good place to gain some experience. However, once you learn new things and become proficient, they drag their feet on moving you up into new positions, but still expect you to do the job tasks of the position above, for less pay."
good,"Great co-workers, horribly management.  Expect a ton from the hard workers and nothing from the not so hard working, but pay is equal.  Benefits have been slowly eroded away.  Pay isn't based on what you do, but more on how long you've been there."
good,"Over all had a good experience there, a lot of fun co-workers, learned a lot about engines and how they work, some of management was ok, some challenging work days."
good,I never got the sense that quality was the most important thing. It always seemed pleasing management meant more than putting out a quality product. The bottom line was stressed more than anything else.
good,"When we were selling product, there were several challenging projects to work on that made each day a satisfying experience.  Today, this company has extensive business issues with no viable product offerings and no new products on the horizon.   The original workplace culture placed a large emphasis on empowering the employee, but that culture has deteriorated significantly since being acquired by UTC."
good,The job was a good job until they started doing layoffs. I worked there about 2 months and they layed off my whole class. There was no working to get move up in the company. It was a union.
good,"The job was always something different.  With all the different applications and department, there was something new to learn every day.  Learning any environment is always a challenge.  The flow of work tickets was either very slow or so busy that I was just keeping up with the flow."
good,"2 years exp of data entry operator in p&g group, as a pqc"
good,I liked what I was doing. But the Supervisor did not treat people fairly. I enjoyed working with the people there that wasn't among the Supervisor and the group leaders
good,"A typical day at work is not structured. What I learn at UTC is everyone in your group is not supported of your success. Management is only concerned about the bottom line, but the works are not given the right amount of support and back up they need to advance within the company."
good,"I would recommend others to work at UTC."
good,"The Program Manager must provide direction/support for all activities required to maintain customer satisfaction managing the day to day activities of the program while supporting and coordinating efforts with engineering, finance, contracts, program office and major suppliers with direct interface to the customer. As the point contact for customer communications, the Program Manager must have good written/verbal communication skills and the ability to manage multiple tasks and resolve complex problems to ensure deliverables are met on time/within budget to customer needs."
good,"I worked at the Leadership Center of UTC in Farmington, CT. The offices are very nice. It is, however, a very competitive environment. I worked there as a temp. Despite my substantial skills and contributions I was not given much respect or recognition. The manager I had was in over his head and was not very friendly. They didn't pay much attention to you unless they needed something. The culture there is big corporate and is stressful."
good,"UTC is a global manufacturer, meaning that they are truly a logistics company like Honeywell, Phillips, and the others in their industry. As such, be wary of ""new"" ventures the organization is involved in - they tend to shift quickly and numerous folks are purged annually.  Competency wise, it is a good firm.  Execution wise, be very careful"
good,"UTC is a gigantic corporation.  Being so large, there would appear to be ample opportunity for career advancement within and outside of its various business units.  However, there appears to be favoritism at work, especially when considering UTC has grown as large as it has by buying other smaller corporations.  Depending on where you started in the business, your career might be limited if you were a part of one of those acquired business units (see Goodrich)."
good,Median compensation. Great continuing education benefits. Very resistant to change and the management does not necessarily foster career development. Very annoying culture that does not encourage independent thought.
good,"When under pressure, Management cannot handle deadlines or keep work flow consistent.  Poor leadership from previous company cannot handle work load."
good,Generally a typical work day consisted of ten hours. Fast paced work most of the time. The company decided to move operations to Mexico and that was the end of my tenure there.
good,Work is rewarding and many of the people are dedicated to their jobs.  A good experience but wouldn't want to work there as a permanent career because the business is so ingrained in the NASA community and is cyclic based on NASA's budget.  Management is trying to diversify into other areas and works hard to keep everyone they can employed.
good,Part of 60 person lay-off that no one saw coming. Always told we have all this work and we are always behind yet somehow 150 engine sets get put on hold and we’re out of a job.
good,"Large Corporation with frequent management turnover due to unachievable goals, Frequent misdirection. Heavy handed corporate structure, Unachievable goal setting - frequent changes in bonus structure that eliminated bonuses at certain levels,"
good,"Monotonous and uncreative work... A culture of competition.  "
good,"Some great people to work with employed there. Climate controlled, good training within the work place. Team driven work force, very educated work force, college classes were reimbursed to you with passing grades, that was very nice."
good,"Overly complex management structure with numerous levels at multiple geographic locations."
good,UTC has a rotating door policy on hiring when help is needed and quick to layoff. They make use of low cost contract help that requires a lot of oversite. They do not reward experience.
good,"Very stressfull work enviroment. Work hours was way to many. No home life."
good,"Although there are 1200 employees, it is hard to move up. I just finished my master's degree and most of my classmates talked about possible promotions within their company. Unfortunately, people that move up either have no degree or have been working on it for over 5 years."
good,Not applicable.  Culture isn't the best but can be overcome.  Needs work to make it a better place to work.  Hopefully things improve with the new leadership.
good,"I have been working at UTEC for 2 years now.  I really enjoy where I work and the people I work with.  My only concern is that I have been working with them as a contractor for two years and been promised to be considered for being hired on.  When I ask my manager what my chances of being hired on are, I am told that they are not able to hire, but have the desire to hire me in the future.  It is frustrating because I enjoy what I do and am told that I have been doing it very well, but the company will not show any confidence in me by hiring me to the team as a full member and offering me the pay and benefits of an engineer they normally employ."
good,"World class corporation with exceptionally talented, dedicated people and global opportunities. Unrelenting commitment to ethics. Diverse and inclusive environment."
good,"it is okay and can be a good learning experience, it is a all in what one desires in an employer and what they are looking for as far as experience to grow."
good,"Strong corporate culture, proud of legacy and innovation history. Managed with shareholders in mind, as many entities within the group are joint ventures."
good,the factory is closing and moving to mexico. management would not be honest with employees.. was a good enviorment as far as it was air conditioned and nicely heated
good,"Great people to work with and a great place to start working around here."
good,Use to be a great place to work until health insurance was changed to a catastrophic only policy and profit sharing was taken away. Morale is very low now.
good,"At one time, UTC was a company that encouraged employees to grow opportunities and become more versatile and valuable to the company.  Over the last few years, the company has taken the focus off employee growth and  training. It is a decent place for young people to get a start, but it is not a company to stay with for the long term. Get some experience and get out."
good,"Shifting from a people based culture to a bottom-line at any cost culture."
good,Close knit type of family environment. However if you are not in the circle...Job security might not be so promising. Plenty of cross training is available at this company.
good,I provided the production floor with everything they might need. It took me less than 2 years to learn how to do everything out on the production floor.
good,"Integration and Test of the DB-110 Tactical Reconnaissance System  can be personally rewarding.  I have tested Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) at component level and the proceeded to integrate these components into a reconnaissance pod.  The final product is sent to customers, both foreign military sales and direct contract sales, overseas.  "
good,"The company has started to slide towards a ratio of more project engineers than analysis/design/development engineers when starting new programs which results in overstretched engineers and cost overruns due to highly paid project people."
good,"Support structural analsyis and testing of hardware from Space Shuttle Main Engine and RS68 (Delta IV) rocket engine programs.  The people were very talented.  The work environment was very stressfull, Rocketdyne never really ""jelled"" with UTC, and UTC eventrually sold off the division to Gencor."
good,"- Typical aerospace company that no job security is assured.  "
good,After Goodrich was purchased by United Technologies there where layoffs and multiple reorganizations which made daily life stressful.
good,A competitive environment where the expectations are high. You go into work knowing there will be challenges to overcome and good people to help you along the way.
good,na época a empresa tinha muito a creser e faltava muito pra isso.mas no geral foi uma ótima empresa.
good,No day is ever the same. This is a results oriented organization with management drive and focus on hitting a number. Co-workers are friendly and enjoyable to be around. Customer service is essential to your success.
good,"It was fairly mundane working there. Colleagues generally seemed to gradually lose their sense of passion and innovation."
good,A typical day at work was long and could be sometimes boring. I've to always be quick on your toes and opened to new experiences. The hardest part of the job is repetitively doing the same job every single day.
good,Paid well but company culture is very conservative and there are many steps involved in approving anything. Talent pool is above average and Sr. management knows what they are doing.
good,Contractors were not appreciated. Treated as less than full time employees while management used them for their own gain but did not recognize there contribtions.
good,"UTC with its diverse businesses is a great company to begin your engineering career.  You are exposed to a broad range of technologies and work on products that have a real impact in the marketplace.  As with every large company, it was highly bureaucratic and you had limited autonomy in decision making.  Also career progression was slow and hit or miss for many."
good,"Secure but slow work pace and development."
good,Would have been a better place to work if it had better Management and Supervision. I really liked the people I worked with. Learned different jobs. Some Supervisors were helpful if you needed it and the there were others that didn't care about the employees of for them at all. I just went in and done my job the way I was trained. I did like the job I was on.
good,"management has made iffy decisions recently that make me question the corporations viability."
good,"UTC was a solid company. I learned a lot in my seven years there. But there was no room for advancement. UTC was my first job lobbying and I learned how to master those skills. I enjoyed lobbying for all their Aerospace divisions including Sikorsky, Pratt and Whitney, and Hamilton. UTC has a robust Political Action Committee (PAC) where I learned a lot about PACs. UTC paid lower salaries compared to other Defense contrators."
good,"A typical day at work towards the end of my time there usually resulted in us being sent home early due to lack of work and being over staffed. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with upper managements mistakes when it came to scheduling us to work. We would have next to nothing during the week and would be sent home, but would have to work the weekend. If you were sent home early during the week you would not receive overtime pay since you didn't hit 40 hours during the week."
good,"Clean work environment, work was not difficult, many hours of overtime required. Facility moved to Mexico end of 2017. I retired. Entry level work, trained for each position, ability to bid on other positions. Stress level was high at the end, due to losing jobs to Mexico."
good,"good place to work if you wanna be moving all the time, but not always doing something productive. some days spent watching others do all the work, others are spent programming product. needed more consistant work to be done."
good,"UTC, provides a lean manufacturing environment well ahead of others.  The improvement opportunities are challenged daily to ensure improved performance."
good,There are pros and cons at every job but this company is moving so there are several more cons at the present time compared to pros.  I have worked here for 11 years so I have seen several changes over the years.
good,"Most employees are extremely unhappy with the culture, but stay due to financial obligations. Management does not keep employees informed on changes in the organization."
good,"The company suffers from severe nepotism and unfortunately hires supervisors who do not really understand the aspects of their area of responsibility. Apparently quality procedures are not mandatory but merely a suggestion to some. Management is overly obsessed with charts and graphs that do not reflect actual workflow. The mindset is severely ""pro production"" and supervision will try to find ways to side step quality processes to meet master schedule."
good,United Technologies Corporation (Carrier) is a world class company that specializes in production of Heating and Air Conditioner for Bryant/Carrier. The benefits and pay are nice for the quality of manual labor however the company offers no room to grow.
good,"Since Goodrich Corp was bought by UTC and merged with Hamilton-Sunstrand, there has been an endless march of little changes that continue to make the job more difficult without benefit to the employee or company."
good,"My experience at UTC was both good and bad. The good was that the company communicated with us and engaged us in the business happenings with monthly meetings. The benefits and pay were fair. They were beginning to focus on work/life balance within the accounting and finance organizations. "
good,"The parent company, United Technologies Corporation, is a huge conglomerate. There are many layers of management, and decision makers are far and remote from the local site. The business is very bottom line driven, which makes the company culture seems very impersonal."
good,"I was part of a group that came in to do some extra brake testing."
good,"Working Hard but happy,be patience and friendly especially to saudi people.most of all be prayerful."
good,Highly educated employees.
good,A typical day at work we work hard when we have to... I learned how to run the band saw for metal... Management I really don't know what to explain I didn't work in around the office I worked in the welders shop.. my co-workers are a good group of guys I would like to work around them anytime.. My hardest part of my job was carrying the metal every day it was hard on my feet and back at the end of the shift.. Not enjoyable
good,perform any quality functions needed
good,Sikorsky was old school manufacturing with poor managament
good,"Atmosphère coopérative, les missions sont intéressantes."
good,"Work is like a roller coaster. Some days it is so busy, that you have no idea how you will get all your work done. On the other days, you may be staring at your computer screen for the entire shift because there is no work to be done... more of the latter."
good,"Strong safety practices"
good,United Tech was a good place to work. Work/life was unbalanced but job tasks/duties were very manageable or light duty work. Compensation was very good for the type of work being done.
good,Good people.  Team oriented.  Not a typical day at work because everyday was different.  Good Leadership.  Learned a lot of the business through training and practical work.
good,Company is financially strong to share profits with employee but does not. Growth opportunities are not clearly defined. Investment into Supply Chain ERP is extremely over looked.
good,"Under-staffing has increased workloads and allowed a higher propensity for misses.  A lot of bureaucracy and burdensome internal processes make it difficult  to maintain flexibility and agility while reacting to rapid changes or mistakes, and difficult to incubate new programs and new technology.  Often a hyper fast pace, with glacial movement."
good,"A lot of pulling in several directions at the same time.  A great deal of managerial ""escalation"" and a general lack of resources (people) to perform all tasks.  Could never set a priority -everything had to be done at once.  Difficult to complete to complete something as other escalations that divided attention kept popping up all the time by out of state management."
good,"A typical work day there was doing my daily checks on equipment. Doing any repairs needed. then doing pms, scheduling pm when necessary. ordering parts for pms or repairs. designing and ordering parts and material for projects"
good,"UTC has it's moments, but on the whole the management perspective is very siloed and vertical. Cross-collaboration is not something any of the business units in UTC want to pursue."
good,Permite el desarrollo de los empleados en la creación de procesos y dentro de un ambiente multicultural.
good,"Good people, difficult corporate circumstances. Good supervisors and colleagues with opportunities to learn and experience many different facets of the company."
good,"Exciting environment in heart of DC, taking trips to house and senate buildings to understand business involvement in government and understanding the respective roles."
good,"Amazing and fun group of people to work with. Everyone works hard and is supportive of each other.  On site management is, overall, very good.  Corporate culture has the facility grossly understaffed.  Senior Management needs to add people across all the support functions (engineering, programs, quality, procurement, etc.) People work crazy hours to keep up with work load."
good,My supervisor did not take into consideration I had to go back to school. Other managers in my team were understanding and willing to work with me. Felt a bit thrown into the wolves for an overall experience.
good,Was a good place to work very clean and had air conditioning good people nice place to work clean environment and the jobs were very easy and laid back
good,Your typical aerospace firm dominated by white conservative men. The work was not engaging or fast paced. I didn't see much room for growth and at the end of the day you don't feel like your work contributes much
good,Gran empresa con buenos planes de desarrollo de  sus empleados. Lamentablemente cerro operaciones en la ciudad
good,"Nice place to work for most of my 20 years there. I learned how to solder, run insertion equipment and test equipment. People were friendly and fun to work with our insurance was good. Schooling program was excellent. If they had not relocated to Mexico I would have stayed until retirement."
good,"This plant has closed and is moving to Canada.  Was a good place to work with talented people, but they have chosen to shut the plant down and move out of our country,"
good,It was a easy work and good pay. I did not have circuit board assembly skills before working here. The company is moving to Mexico later in 2018. Were some stressfull shifts here and there but was an Okay place.
good,It was fun working for UTC i really enjoy it . Recommend working here if you are looking for a long term career .  Lots of politics and favoritism.   Would like to work for this company again.
good,"The job was great.  There were lots of learning opportunities.  However, there was not always a lot of help with projects.  Management put a lot of stress on employees"
good,"I was an intern for several summers. I was given interesting but not necessarily challenging projects, but learned many hands-on important skills that I built upon later in my career."
good,I enjoyed working with my fellow work mates. The environment was helpful and collaborative. the company benefit plan was good and served my family needs.
good,Finance Infrastructure needed updating in the division that i worked in which caused our team to work above average days and weekends but the company as a whole is great.
good,"No clear direction on what your projects are, Worked as an intern and the expectation is really high.Good pay for intern and you only work Monday to Friday"
good,"fast paced enviroment, required to multi task jobs, not much training for jobs, learn as you go ..really on the job training, place seemed unorganized for a late factory.   produce many circuit boards high volume."
good,This is a general engineering facility that has much to offer from a variety of engineering disciplines. There is a typical environment that one would find in most locations.
good,A good place to work and start out. It was stressfulm at time. At times wokers always complaining about stuff someone else is doing.........................
good,"I thought the company was a decent place to work (while it was under Goodrich), but after UTC took over, it got bad.  After one year, they were laying off people left and right!"
good,"United Technologies is a good company, but this is a forced review because Indeed requires one hundred and fifty characters to be typed before I can move past this page."
good,it was a good place to work but you do know they are closing and going to mexico so this review is mute.  I liked being a material specialist at my time there
good,"Manage licenses, investigations and internal audits. Lead customs assessment, ISA and CTPAT programs for 20 sites. Supervise a team of 6 trade compliance specialists."
good,"While working at this job there were several times where I was told that I was working on a specific component or part and it was stated that I had messed it up somehow.  Even though, I was on a completely different part all together, they still wanted to let me go.  Later on they let the person whom was actually doing the actual messing the parts up go and tried to call me back.  I somehow on purpose got disconnected from them due to the fact I am not going to lie about what I do.  Some people do, I just don't."
good,It was a job.  Alright place to work .  Management was good.  Used the skills I have to be a asset to the corporation.  A typical day at work went by very fast.
good,Most of my co work are fun to work with. management could be better. the hardest part working would be how the management handled things
good,Good Company. Benefits aren't that great. Management is finally making a difference in the company.  Headed in a good direction.
good,"A typical day at work is extremely long. But, the learning experience has been good but it's extremely fast pace. The hardest part of the job is how the long hours."
good,"Lots of turnover, good people, work offloaded. UTC has an excellent employee scholar program. I would recommend this company as a starting point in an early professional's career."
good,"The company has great school benefits, uncertainty about the future. Everyone is overworked, no clear direction to the future"
good,"once upon was a great place to work, but the shifting of work locations and working with people worried about their job everyday was draining even if you liked what you did and liked your co-workers."
good,"The company was purchased a few years ago and is working through a growth from a component manufacturer to a large subsystem provided. The policy development will take some time, and while the policies are developed new roles will be created which will provide opportunities to current or new employees (and even when the opportunities are filled by a current employee, this will create an opening from the current employee's role)."
good,It is slow paced easy work just wasnt for me.Overall not a bad place to work just hoping find a new career. The hardest part of the job was dealing with all of the people whinning all time because they didnt want to do there job
good,Generally a good place to work. Sometimes too much politics.
good,"Please see the review submitted for UTAS.  Once UTC purchased Goodrich, the atmosphere changed. Goodrich was a big company but UTC is much bigger and diversified. Time and again this year we were reminded that we were not meeting our numbers as expected in our division. UTAS ISR is mostly defense and some contract manufacture of surveillance equipment. "
good,"A typical work day consists of building and producing all sized coils for Carrier and Bryant air conditioner/heater units,Completing and entering quality records, and scrap reports in an orderly and timely matter,Performing assignments at standard speed to smoothen the workflow of production process, and Maintaining a clean and efficient production floor."
good,"It was very tedious and time consuming, detailed high level testing."
good,"A global manufacturing aerospace company where my responsibilites as a buyer II are extensive. "
good,Nice process for the project execution with friendly environment
good,Good company to work for.  Company is now impementing Achieving Competitive Excellence (ACE).
good,They closed the plant and moved to Mexico. It was not a fun place to work the last few years.
good,"Variety of duties, project management, global travel arrangements, expense and financial reporting.  The hardest part of the position was dealing with the constant corporate restructuring changes. "
good,I worked for a subsidiary of UTC. The small company was very dysfunctional.
good,Wide range of Aerospace product to repair and troubleshoot
good,"We were major players in the video security business and have worked with a great set of minds from team members all across the globe. Unfortunately, as a global company, there were little directions from the leaders to help the business grow in terms of technology advancements and innovations."
good,"I've been working for UT for 5 years. I like the company so far. My supervisors are very nice. However, I feel my value is not properly paid - although my supervisor tried to get me promoted, the company structure is a bit rigid."
good,Short time working there. Stressful job for computer programming engineers in machining. Poor management. Needs to update facility setting and atmosphere.
good,UTC used to value their employees and still claim they are their most valuable asset but I don't feel that is true any more. Stock holders are the major concern of management not the employees.
good,It's a chilled place to work. Some days are busy and some days are not. It's a very diverse group of people working here that's what i enjoy most about working here. Can be a bit disorganized but that can be work on if everyone works really well as a team
good,"Responsible for development, management and capture of opportunities for Hoist & Winch (H&W), and other Products and Services such as Mission Data Recorders and Health and Usage Management Systems (HUMS) for worldwide military, defense and commercial helicopters and fix-wing original equipment (OEM) and aftermarket"
good,The place is good overall but a lot of uncertainty on the future of the company due to working under limited contracts for a product that is still being developed.
good,"The work/life balance and career advancement opportunities are the best aspects of this company. However, the company is more concerned with cutting costs than actually innovating. While cost is important, it always seem to come at the expense of not investing in new technologies. This drives many of the more talented employees out the door."
good,United Technologies was a great company with a emphasis on the ETR.  They supported tax technology and process improvements.  Consultants were used effectively to support tax planning strategies.
good,Average work environment for the aerospace industry. Employees and leaders are average in the workplace. Great job to have when the industry is in need.
good,"The typical day at work could range from having a major project/dive to address, or to simply scraping tape off of the floor. The issue that I personally had with the Machine Shop was that the major project I was given was hitting a lot of roadblocks and I was told to wait for the supervisors input. When I met with him, my boss was included on the meeting, it was all about why I didn't seem to be making progress and my boss didn't let my supervisor know about the continued roadblocks, ie: budget and physical constraints, so it looked as if I was not completing my work. They also aren't very kind when it comes to treating their machine shop operators."
good,"Working in operations quality I experience a fast pace environment, learn as you go, atmosphere. There is a good variety of people with different backgrounds and mindsets. I notice a lot of horizontal movement throughout the company, which allows people to try different things and see what best suits them."
good,"The pay is good, the medical benefits are not great for a world-wide organization. The company is stable and a Monday-Friday job with overtime opportunities."
good,"The company has well established process, one who likes routine way of job with no new challenges will have a great time."
good,"I Soldered airplane senors. The typical day at work was mostly sitting at a work bench working as an assembly line."
good,Overall highly qualified staff and programs.  Teamwork is relied upon highly. High level of corporate oversight. Well developed management programs and risk reduction engagement.
good,"Each day presents new challenges along with the ""normal"" responsibilities of the job. Those challenges allows me to work with all departments of the company at every levels of responsibility including senior management, supervisor, engineering and mainly the employees on the floor. When we, employees and EH&S successfully implement a program or practice that eliminates a serious safety risk is when I experience the greatest job satisfaction.   And we share the success as a team. The greatest asset this facility has are the people who are willing to work as a team to accomplish a goal whether in developing a new product or eliminating a hazard, and there are many who help to make this a successful company."
good,"1. Challenges and strategies to overcome  "
good,Thrive on the challenges of CMM programing. Cannot get enough of programing and training!
good,"A good company to 'check the box' for experience, but stay long enough, and your skills will atrophy in a conservative, risk averse culture of managers in lieu of leaders."
good,"The benefits were better but keep being paired down. The revolving door of Management tends to be focused on climbing the ladder more than developing internal talent. HR values outside talent more than internal and is highly resistant to promotions and raises. It's not a terrible place to work if you're willing to hustle and kiss some butt, but if you expect anyone to hold your hand or value your technical ability, good luck."
good,"UTC was alright. Morning shift was great. Got off work no later than 4:00 pm. Most jobs are sit down jobs, great benefits. Management typically show there appreciate with a dinner so that was a plus."
good,"Management is great now, but we had a corrupt manager three years ago who made some poor decisions, and now the entire group is suffering the consequences.  We have the lowest approval rating for management in the entire business unit at 30%, and I'm afraid we are not viable as a commercial entity, because there's no way the product of our labor justifies our salaries.  However, I still live for the challenge of keeping a cool head under the pressure of seemingly impossible odds, with that occasional success story that makes it all worthwhile, which is what will keep me going until my last day.  I think UTC is a great company, I'm just in the wrong place at the wrong time."
good,I'm not intersted in giving a detailed review since I already work there at the moment. If you have a question you are welcomed to contact me directly.

good,"Good company for intern or recent graduate, a lot of potential for career advancement. Manufacturing and assembly with modern lean initiatives."
good,"Good learning from Project management point of view."
good,"Change management restructuring going on, which make it difficult to do one's job without constant changes and very high turnover."
good,"My years at Rohr / Goodrich were fruitful and personally satisfying. The company had a family atmosphere and the work was rewarding both to the company and to the employees. When Goodrich was purchased by United Technologies in 2013, the atmosphere changed. Now it is apparent that the company is too large to be managed as before and that employees have become just numbers on a spreadsheet instead of valuable individuals comprising a family."
good,"Was the ""go to girl"" worked for everyone in any department as needed."
good,Excellent experience in developing a vast set of advanced skill sets that will be invaluable in future roles.
good,"UTAS Aerospace is a very challenging and rewarding company. They pay for most of your education and any training towards advancement. I continue to learn and grow daily from the Supply Chain Team. There seems to be a change in management annually. This is uncomfortable for most employees. I did not have a problem with the change, but looked at it as an opportunity to grow. The best part of working for UTAS Aerospace was the flexibility in the work schedule. They understand working hard and raising a family go hand in hand."
good,"Decent work life balance, very good compensation / benefits for executives.  Constantly undergoing organizational change.  Expectation that every lawyer can perform any legal function."
good,"Benefits are fantastic compared to other companies, in any field. There was even an education option that paid for advancement in any degree, whether it applied to your field or not."

good,A typical day of light will be family nice slow pace then the pace was fast and team workers very nice management will come and check to make sure that your life is running right also how many air conditioner components came down and how many you got done within the hour.
good,I have been lucky to have had great managers thought my career.I have worked at three different sites which all had their challenges. UTC is a very dynamic company that constantly changes it's vision and product focus.
good,"if you want to waste a lot of time on stuff that isn't value add, come to UTC.  Currently working on getting a $280 Agile Tool approved with a 7 person email trail..."
good,"Carrier was a great place to work, at least for the first 15 years. Then over the last 5 years the bottom fell out of the market, I guess, and they made the decision to move our operations to Mexico."
good,A typical day at unit is working first shift workng on press 8&42. Me and one other person besides the relief operater. The hardest part of my job was quality control. The most enjoyable part was insurance and overtime on the weekend.
good,I love the people and the relationships. The company offers great opportunities for their employees. They give you a lot to learn and they definitely help you evolve as an employee.
good,"The company remains in transition since its acquisition in 2012, but there are continuing efforts to integrate and build consistency in practice and policy. Turnover is higher than average due to acquisition so managing change and keeping focus can be a challenge."
good,UTAS coroporate officers were dispersed amongst the Goodrich long time employees so that they could garner aerospace experience from the current Goodrich employees. I feel that this tactic was very devious.
good,Opportunity to learn on job high since you will likely fill for others who leave the company. Pay can be good if you fight for a better wage. Job security can be tenuous since a number of manufacturing sites have gone overseas. Benefits very good.
good,"Good Company and work environment with good people. They having very good team for civil and MEP work."
good,"Responsibilities included:"
good,I learned about stamping dies and injection molds. grateful to work with this company.
good,Great company but lost in the shuffle. Union shop stifled getting things done correctly or efficiently. A lot of people just wanted to complete their final years.
good,UTC is a good company to work for however the little companies under the umbrella are questionable work practices. Work life balances didn't matter. Pay for the amount of work required is not practical.
good,"Too much processes just for the sake of it."
good,"Typical day at work begins with understanding what each line is running on the production schedule, getting the materials necessary to pack out the product as it comes down to the end of the line. Moving those packed out materials from production status to finished goods."
good,"Maintained bills of materials by inputting change notices."
good,"The job tasks are not too difficult, for most there.  However,  lack of management, true innovation, and clear vision, the work culture is sluggish and brutish."
good,I was very happy at my job.  My co-workers were wonderful.  Some days can be stressful.   The management was constantly changing due to take overs.  I learned a lot from some very competent people.
good,"Every thing is micro managed with no room for advancement. We help customers who are trapped in elevators, or when an elevator is not working correctly, we take the information and we dispatch the mechanic"
good,UTC was a good place to work with alot of opportunities.  I loved the atmosphere and daily challenges.  I was able to further my knowledge as a machinist by learning daily.
good,"Yo estaba bien en la empresa, no estaba trabajando de programación, que es lo mío y por eso decidi marcharme, porque me ofrecieron trabajo de programador"
good,"Management was constantly changing, management made workplace culture change. Upper management did do its best to correct a lot of issues, I would have tried to stay if job security was offered."
good,"United Technologies is a busy workplace. Something I really love about the company. No idle, unproductive time is wasted waiting for the day to end. My ability to work under pressure and my skills in multitasking are massively honed."
good,"This is a good company, but they don't invest in human capital or what it takes to get the job done. They need to invest more in advancement and revolving managers, instead of moving around the same old managers to have the same old results."
good,"Work long hours, weekends and holidays if the business is struggling, you might not get to take vacation."
good,"Even though advancing in the company has always been a goal of mine, the opportunity has never been there. The company does offer great benefits, such as 100% tuition reimbursement. But only to their authorized institutions. I could have the opportunity for a promotion, but only if I move to the corporate location. It seems there is always a catch."
good,I can't give a good review. I mostly worked in a different building than most of my co-workers. But the time I did spend with them was a very professional experience.
good,"Company is alright to work for, for what i want to do advancement is tough."
good,A typical day at work included receiving list of duties from Managing Paralegal and carrying out what was set forth.  The hardest part of the job was checking through numerous binders for specific information.  The most enjoyable part of the job was organizing U.S. and international annual board meetings.
good,"Normal, aprendo muito na UTC a gerencia e esperada os colegas são maravilhosos com exeção de alguns o dificil e o convivio com a inveja."
good,Huge Corporation with tremendous opportunities. Working at this company could be better if layoffs were not always in the air.
good,Fun place to work at and also learn from. Very helpful people that genuinely care about one another. Great benefits and also a ton of fun events and all that.
good,"UTC is a technology leader with significant capabilities in distinct sectors such as aerospace, HVAC and home automation. The company has world-class people but is very conservative , in part because of their government and military businesses."
good,"A large corporate setting with many opportunities as the culture consistantly changes as the business structure changes. Nice place to work, good company"
good,I would probably still be at utec if it hadn't closed. It was a good job for so many years but ready for a life change. I was a touch up and repair soldered parts I was assembled a packer I pretty much did every job I wanted to do there.
good,"for the most part the company was fun to work for. sometime ""political"" priorities interfere with continuous improvement. to be seen, which approach wins the day."
good,Very corporate. But a company with integrity and a strong desire to follow the rules. Rather hierarchical in nature when it comes to executive levels.
good,The pay was great but was not worth working there.  Being on call all the time wasn't a problem until I was the only one who would take calls in the middle of the night and I was working from the time I woke up until I went to bed.  No life with family.
good,"Internationale teams arbeiten in den bereichen produktion, supply-chain und management  effizient an dem jeweiligen projekt. die methode basiert auf 3 grundpfeilern: unternehmensethik, eh&s und ACE."
good,Working at AutomatedLogic was an excellent learning experience that allowed me to gain a lot of exposure to the controls and HVAC field. I was given a lot of responsibilities and jobs to handle. The management needs work with there leadership skills.
good,This corporation was a great place to learn.  The leadership has decades of experience are were great mentors to learn from.  Especially in the areas of continuous improvement.
good,Health and bonus benefits have reduced and deductibles have increased to over 7k per year. Its a safe place to work with layers for advancement if wanted. Over time is readily available if wanted.
good,"Even though my plant is closing in 2019, UTC as a whole is a great company to work for. Pay for my area is not competitive and promotions are hard if you do not work directly with the hiring manager. Benefits are decent, could improve on the medical end, dental is great and vision is good too."
good,I was pretty happy there. They put me through training and I worked under some good people. Only left because I did not get a pay raise that they promised.
good,The Company CEO gave me the opportunity to star a join venture between United Technologies and Furukawa Electric Company. Our Customers were all the Automotive Japanese Companies that needs to manufactured the High Volume Automotive sold at the United States of America market.
good,company with multiple resources and benefits that allow a lot of professional growth within this company in both the commercial and aerospace industry
good,"Easy going place, but can be fast paced at times. The people are really easy going. A lot of room to grow and advance, and even has the opportunity to move laterally to a new department. There are programs that help teach about different departments and you can use it advance your career or simply to quench your thirst for knowledge."
good,"Fun place to work, the culture is great,it is all about the competition, always do better. working with people from all around the world brings a new persepctive to the work being done"
good,"Its been wonderful to be a part of the company . I can list the pros as"

good,A day at United Technologies Corporation is stressful due to many reasons such as management issues and understaffed which yield a lot of stress and less productive.
good,I repair circuit boards that fail the genrad tester. I have learned how to solder. Management is supportive. The hardest part is location of parts on circuit board. Most enjoyable part of my job is when the board I repaired passed the genrad test.
good,It is a great work environment.  Coworkers are there to help each other reach deadlines and succeed. Managers are generally understanding of the work-life balance.
good,"stressful, fast paced, very demanding, depending on the department, you can either be challenged beyond your ability or you can be tasked appropriately."
good,There were steady full time hours with the possibility of overtime. Safety was a high concern with this company so this assured that employees would be least likely get injured with proper safety measures.
good,pleasant work environment i enjoyed the my coworkers it was fast pace i enjoyed working and learning the different jobs the hardest part was the wear and tear on your hands with the protective gloves on your hands the supervisors were always helpful human resource was always helpful overall my experience has been good
good,UTC had great pay and very good benefits. Management and organization was in constant re-org after re-org over which was stressful.
good,"Work was 8 hours a day without any overtime potential."
good,ABQ location is closing down due to the ineptitude of upper management. Job was fun and challenging. very satisfying work.

good,"its a routine job, some days are super busy.Co-workers are great, a lot of changes being made that are upsetting long time employees,scares me a bit"
good,My current position is captive to the Carrier corporation.  I am looking for a challenge without the constraints of being an internal supplier.
good,My position at UTC was constantly changing with the ebbs and flows of the business.  I supported many business partners and worked directly with the CFO to support the company.  I was selected to attend the corporations Leadership Forum and have enjoyed mentoring interns and new college graduates.  I enjoy working both individually and as a team and look forward to expanding my experience while providing value to a new company.
good,"Liked my mangers and co workers."
good,Es una buena empresa que aplica sus normas y valores fundamentales al pie de la letra.
good,"UTAS has helped me gain customer service experience through out the years."
good,"This company is driven by investor profit and tends to over react when goals are not met or exceeded.  The people that actually do the work, the factory techs, engineering and maintenance staff are great people.  There is a team spirit among them that keeps moral high in an environment of high pressure and many hours of overtime. They do have a great education program and will pay for the majority of schooling costs.  The people are the best part of the job.  The hardest part of the job is trying to make improvements and reduce costs with little capital support from the corporate managers."
good,My typical workday involves having meetings with the various programs that I support. Meeting with vendors to discuss power supplies  and other equipment specifications needed for new test stands. Be on call to provide hardware and software related support to programs testing on the test stands
good,Inspect aerospace parts using ultrasonic and penetrant methods for quality and integrity. Learned the 5s and lean principles to eliminate waste and work more productively. Co-worker are good and they are the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest is the not knowing of the future of the plant.
good,I worked from 8am to 4:30pm Monday thru Friday.  I answered phone calls and processed mail and sent faxes daily.  I learned how to get along with many different personalites and  how to be professional in greeting callers and visitiors to the company.  Management and my co-workers were professional and great to work with daily.  I had no problems in completing my daily responsibilities. I enjoyed my my job at UTA as everyday was different due to dealing with different visitors and callers.
good,Fun safe and productive company. No work had to leave. Wish the economy was better for this field

good,Learned many manufacturing related skills such as brazing and welding. Learned how to build and foster relationships with suppliers and other outsource companies. Learned to build and be a good team member.
good,United offers lots opportunities to offer for the young folks. Typically a day at work in marketing entails meeting with a lot of different people getting to explore new opportunities with different businesses and learning how different people think.  What I've learned about working here is that it's not always easy getting new clientele to listen to your business plan and it does take a lot of patience and persuasion to expand the marketing department.
good,This Company is very busy. There is a lot of teamwork within the organization.  Organizing your time is important  because you will have to Multitask on a daily bases.
good,"UTC in general is a great company to work for, great pay and benefits.  There are a few down sides, lack of communication and no management support. I would recommend UTC."
good,"I was a remote consultant there for only a few months. Onboarding was a mess. Let go when ""budget cuts"" made--no chance for hiring. I get the feeling that once you are an employee, you're good, but actually getting in is tough for contractors (as in contract to hire, which I was told was a strong possibility. Nope.)  Good company otherwise."
good,"No ones asks any questions so long as you get your job done. Most of lower management is pretty relaxed, those things seem to tense up as you work your way up the corporate ladder (of which there are many, many rungs)."
good,"Complex environment provides a great opportunity to grow skills. However, limited opportunities to advance within company, preference for outside hires (tax group)."
good,"Good co workers to work as a team, lots of overtime whether you want it or not. Good benefits. Management changed 4 times in 15 years. I enjoyed being able to stand or sit most of the day."

good,It was faced paced. I operated radial and axial machine. U put components on a circuit board. The company cared about their employees. Great atmosphere to work in.
good,"productive and learning place to work. I would have stayed if I was hired permanently. It seemed as thought a revolving door was installed for the Quality Manager position. It was difficult to adapt to the different Management styles. I learned a lot form the aviation company. I enjoyed working with all of the customers ie Boeing, Geo, and other aircraft manufacturers."
good,"this has been a great place to work for 14 years but as of the last two years the management has been in decline and it makes work a lot more stressful and we seem to never have parts,"
good,I do not wish to answer this question. I am an intern there and would feel more confident in supplying a response given that I had worked there as a full time employee for longer.
good,"United Tech was a good place to work. Most jobs were easily learned. Management personal were friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was working 19 days on and 2 off. The most enjoyable part was it was air conditioned, they played music over intercom and most people were friendly."
good,Management cares more about getting production out the  door rather than someone getting bullied by a co worker everyday.. Management does not stand up for employees...
good,"Creating and updating engineering websites."
good,"UTC definitely needs to catch up with the times in terms of benefits to employees. The cafeteria is expensive and team morale is extremely low. That said, the job does pay well."

good,"UTC is a conglomerate and the culture varies between the different companies it owns.  But in general, the culture is less progressive than say, a tech company and roles are traditional and clearly defined.  Because of the ""traditional"" business model, internal progression is rather slow, but the work itself can be rewarding and a long and balanced career can be achieved."
good,"Good Company with a lot of skill within the workforce, inappropriate job security."
good,"Interesting experience. Looks great on a resume. A bit boring due to mismanagement, but they are busy folk."
good,"-People are fun to deal with on personal level, middle managements are not really fun to deal with"
good,"Despite UTC being a fairly large technology company, the corporate atmosphere is engaging and interpersonal almost every work day."
good,"Great place to work.. if you like hard work. the pay isn't the best until you put some years into it. Management can be a pain to deal with since they always seem to know whats best. The ""good ol boy"" system still exists here, you can do well if you are in good with management. I worked my way up from being a temp to becoming a supervisor by hard work and doing the opposite. Left to take a contracting job overseas, but I would come back if they rehired old employees."
good,"Make sure aera is stocked up.To work in a clean work place,management is management.My co workers are fun to be around.Making the quota when the machines break down."
good,Enjoyed working in an industry that manufactures products to protect and save lives.
good,"Typical day comprises of dealership visits, cash collection and comprising daily sales analysis reports"
good,"Good place to work.. Very large company. Liked location and hours flexibility. Approachable management. Some groups are more challenging than others, but overall good."
good,"UTC is a good company, very respected brand. Additionally, the compensation I received during my internship was more than fair. All of that said, I definitely felt this company could use some younger leadership. They are reluctant to change and stuck in some ""old ways."""
good,Great entry level job but didn't have room to advance because working in communications is competitive here. I was able to advance quicker leaving the company
good,"Managers reassigned people to new roles without any consulting. In all my years working at United Technologies Corporation, I never received a performance review."
good,"i liked it there and had opportunities but losts of turmoil as it was splitting up into separate companies."
good,"United Technologies gave me an opportunity to grow as a profesional. UTC also gave the chance for get a BS in Quality Systems, which has helped me a lot in my post UTC career. The work environment was very  professional and my team mates were very supportive. I really missed working there."
good,Was a good place to work . I was able to raise my children alone working here. Climate controlled facility and very clean. I'd still be there had they not relocated overseas.
good,"Everyone I worked with was great, but I was only there for a month.  I was hired for some expected work that never came in.  I would like to work there again . . . but longer than a month."
good,Having to do researches and presentations all the time. In most cases the CEO is on business trip yet you still need to do your work. It's really hard to make any advancement.
good,"I have worked for UTC for over 3 years now and it has allowed me to create my own path and grow with the company as if it were my own, I started as the Business Manager for APAC region for a small part of the business and have now taking up a Regional Sales Manager role in a larger part of the business."
good,"Advance opportunities are dependent on which site you work at.  each location within the entire company focuses on different business activities such as aerospace and defense, commercial and residential building products and sales and support."
good,Entreprise avec culture orientée performance & résultats avec un niveau d'investissement important. L'entreprise permet d'évoluer & d'apprendre énormément.
good,"Most of the employees who work in UTC China need to have the night meetings several times per week."
good,"A typical day at Carrier was to me what working in the field was to slaves. The only difference is unlike the slaves we got paid every week and were not hit in the back with whips. Its very rare that you found people in upper management who cared or even took the time to listen to your concerns. Its a good thing that they have a Union because they will fight for you in Unjust situation. Well that depends on who you know as well. Its a Great Company for the people at the top. But the production workers are over worked, underpaid & depending on you Seniority you are lucky if you don't get laid off.  "
good,"clean, easy work, good factory, well paid, nice place to work, steady work, cheerful employees, good hours, supplied smocks and tools and training, good benefits"
good,UTC is very hierarchical but does have plenty of opportunities. A very traditional working experience.  I was allowed flexible working hours around a core of 9-3 which allowed me to come in early and leave early once I had completed my 8 hours.  The culture is slightly behind the times and is not a cool place to work but they have products that are at the forefront of the industry which meant I spent every day learning something new.
good,"In the 3 sites I worked at under United Technologies (legacy Goodrich Aerospace), I was extremely happy will 2 of the 3.  My last stop ended up having some very tough impact due to previous managements issues, which resulted in lots of layoffs and an eventual announcement of plant closure.  Overall the the direction of the company as a whole, and the first 2 sites I worked at were extremely positive!"
good,"I was a temporary employee brought on to assist the contract administration team during the rollout of a new computer system. In addition to learning the job responsibilities, I also learned the new  system required to perform the job. I enjoyed the troubleshooting aspects of the job as I assisted in identifying workflow impediments in the new system and recommended process improvements. The hardest part of the job was the challenge of learning the many unique details of individual customer contracts to ensure the customer order requests were compliant with the terms. The people were professional and as cordial as possible in a highly-competitive and fast-paced atmosphere."
good,"Coming right out of school, I learned design and then later structural analysis.  "
good,Great place to work. Large facility with many employees that were friendly and helpful. Learning all the jobs and processes took a long time and they allowed you to expand your education with free tuition and books.
good,"It was a good place to work until the relocation of the company last year. Now it is just stressful on everyone. The move is getting closer and it is rough, people are beginning to realize that."
good,"UTC is a great company that most people don't know about.  They have very talented people, are data driven, and well run, but that said, they are risk averse and operate in an ""old school"" way."
good,"Good work conditions, Clean, Comfortable environmentally controlled Friendly Modern machines Work environment very friendly Relaxed"
good,"A typical day would start with a weekly program standup meeting, where I would call out upcoming program deliverables and status, I would then respond to and send out reminder emails for inputs on data items. Afternoons would be spend compiling inputs for data items and making updates. It would also include acquiring necessary signatures to process updates and preparing documents for final delivery via electronic submittal pathways."
good,It has a broad range of products from commercial products to military applications. Not outstanding benefits and salaries. Also lots of bureaucracy. But this may be just my biased assessment as this company is my first job.
good,Good place to work and good pay and benefits. work a lot of overtime. management ok but did not communicate with employees as much as they should. I really enjoyed the job and learned a lot.
good,I met amazing people who have been a tremendous part of the space program. Eternally grateful for their sharing their experiences. Getting the opportunity to work on multiple space program projects was a great honor.
good,"Good company to work for. We produced high quality parts at this facility, not sure why it closed. When the team needed to produce, we rallied together to get the product out."
good,"We strongly believe in the word 'Team' at UTC.  Most days involve me doing more than what is written in my job specification, but the gratitude shown for working over and above makes it worthwhile. "
good,This is a good company to work for with steady work and great employees to work with.  Like any company it has its ups and downs  but overall I would give it a positive rating for sure.
good,"Makes good engine nacelles."
good,"it was a fast paced job with sometimes extremely long hours. but despite the hours it was super easy, clean and manageable. Biggest issue was that until you had some time in you were bottom of the totem pole and mandated for lots and lots of overtime along with shift bumps if needed."
good,"Communicated with staff, customers."
good,UTC is a great organization.  The people and management have talent.  They have potential to advance in the security and iot technology world
good,independently worked in the company. salary time to time pay. management very good. Senior persons also move very good.
good,"6:30~3:00"
good,"Safety, Culture, Diversity and Willingness to perform under strong production to complete supply output. Constantly having monthly meetings to help employees to keep informed of where the company is headed. Hardest part of the job was working in the heat. Co-works worked as a team. The most enjoyable part of working here were the department outings."
good,"el dia en la empresa pasa algo relajado, no se trabaja bajo presion."
good,"During the move to SC from Nogales, the GM and Vice GM were completely out of their league.  Just prior to being released, they cut some people (scapegoats) for their utter failure to establish a project plan or establish accountability.  "
good,"Very professionally ran establishment. Each department had it's own personality and skill level. I worked in the highest skill level so I experienced more interaction with engineers and upper management over why they would do things the way they did. 80% of the time it was straight up business doing the calling. The other 20% of bad prints, cancelling programs, treating workers bad, etc, that just happened sometimes. Great company."
good,"trabalho  na  rotina de fabricação de tubulações industrial, aprimorei  meus conhecimentos em leituras de isométrico a gerencia deixou  um pouco a desejar na parte de qualificação e promoções para seus colaboradores, tive  um ótimo  conviveu com meus colegas de trabalho e mestres."

good,Diverse. I've enjoyed the tactical and strategic activities over the last couple of years.
good,"was a pleasant environment, peers were all very respectful and courteous. This past year and a half was quite challenging but the deadlines were met and the work was done. As a whole we were all a team after the same goal. Through the challenges, I will miss working there. There is a lot of great people and talent there."
good,"Your work is always tied to major business objectives and as such, you get the satisfaction of seeing your work come to fruition. There is also tremendous flexibility with work and life."
good,Enjoyed my time at UTC. Great environment. Enjoyed the team I worked with and the experience I gained. I hate that i have to move on but looking forward to the new experience.
good,I enjoyed working at United Technologies and would probably still be employed there if not for being on lay-off. The supervisors really cared about the people and co-workers were great.
good,"I probably learned more in my time with UTC than with all other jobs combined.  Test Engineering and Design Teams were always available and ready to help make things better, easier and more efficient for the Production Team."
good,"Good place to work.  Good managers. Great co-workers.  Great products. Good place to work.  Great products.  "
good,"Good company to work for"
good,"I’m a contractor so I can’t say much until if and when they decide to hire me. But I’m having a very good experience there. Honestly, no complaints.  It’s a great place to work."
good,"Very ""Old School"" culture with lots of bureaucracy. Not many millennials working at the company which is good and bad - allows for easy career advancement with retirements but not likely to have chance to work with millennial coworkers. Great benefits and opportunities for growth."
good,"Need better communication between management and hourly employees. EHS Training should also be delivered by the staff, supervisors and production coordinators."
good,"A good place to work overall. I did not like the cubicle desk job environment. There was good work life balance, however work began at 8 instead of 9."
good,Many many programs in play to help identify gaps to improve the customer experience.  Challenging environment with a huge potential for big business.  UTC is trying to best capture sales while balancing profits.  Not easy because the programs change very often but exciting.
good,typical day starts at 630 and some mornings you will have a team meeting letting the managers where you are as in making your monthly goal for the most part work culture is OK the hardest part of the job is when they start making changes to your product line when u know it wont work and they wont listen and still do it. the most enjoyable part of my was the people i worked with it was such a great group of people
good,"Great people I worked with. Pay id good. Upper management can be a challenge at times. Mostly ego problems. The employees carry this place, not management."
good,"I started here right out of high school, the people were great to work with. the foreman didn't mind helping the money was good. I started out on the bottom and work my way up to a machinist. the job left and move to Mexico."
good,Relaxed atmosphere but the union protects to many underperformers while employees who work hard are not rewarded.  The jobs are easy and culture is strong but since becoming a larger company keeps finding ways to cut back on pay or other benefits
good,Good pace to the work. The Bamberg plant was not aerospace related but was required to meet AS requirements. Management gave me latitude to do my job. Training available for your area and ACE.
good,"Always looking forward to come to work everyday and mostly complete all daily tasks on time."
good,"United Technologies has an outdated culture. However, they are looking to hire new talent. However overall great company with opportunity for advancement."
good,In my 4 years at UTC I feel that I have gained so much experience that I will be able to carry with me and feel confident in when job searching for my next opportunity.
good,Good company in aerospace industry. Interesting technology and all of the benefits of a large company.  They are also quick to layoff as economic situation changes
good,"It was a good place to work, 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. I have learned a lot from this place, had some good work experience. When the old supervisor change position, new supervisor came in, he was micromanaging everyone. There was really nothing hard about this job, I really liked it there but sometimes the micromanaging was too much to handle."
good,"UTAS, is changing from running like an Engineering Company to a Business. This is unfortunate, but the positive for now is that Engineering is still a priority and getting the quality right, the first time. However there have been large layoffs and cost cutting"
good,"Successful businesses improve the human condition. We maintain the highest ethical, environmental and safety standards everywhere, and we encourage and celebrate our employees' active roles in their communities."
good,"Very good place to work. Plenty of upward mobility, and it is a brand that has appeal to both entry level and seasoned professionals. The benefits are great and the work life balance is ever present."
good,"They had current equipment."
good,"I held several positions from design, checking, configuration management supervisor, supplier & customer Quality Assurance Engineer, Systems Integration Lead and Supply Chain Manager.  Typical day would be addressing Customer and Supplier quality issues and monitoring performance; writing reports, visiting suppliers or customers, performing audits, leading Lean Events, training employees, hiring people, working with shop floor personnel and engineering groups, phone conferences."
good,"I really enjoyed working at UTC.  Sad that this facility will be closing in Albuquerque, NM.  I enjoyed my job there."
good,Great company with wonderful benefits.  Provides many of career opportunities for young adults.  Does not offer the advancements I was looking for at the time in my life.
good,There are plenty of options to move around the company and the UTC corporation.  Continued education (lectures/classes offered each month plus they will pay for a degree at each level) and work life balance are stressed though the company is running lean so we are not able to take advantage of this so much.  The company is way to money/shareholder focused for my tastes.  I prefer a more engineering focused environment.
good,Excellent work place but difficult nights schedule with family time in consideration. Perfect place for people who love change and rotating schedule. The previous 10 years have been great!
good,Working for United Technologies was never a dull job. Fellow colleagues were always friendly to one and other and this helped me project a positive attitude to working. The vast range of jobs always kept my brain working and I was generally on my feet for the vast majority of the day.
good,"Work involved going to a meeting in the morning and running down a list of every product they make in the shop.  The rest of the day involved continuously getting statuses on the production progress, communicating statuses to team members, and developing strategic plans for recovery.  Management was evil.  Co-workers were friendly.  Hardest part of the job was managing demands from all of the team members.  Most enjoyable part of the job was that the co-workers were very friendly and helpful."
good,"There are a lot of work and activities going on, leadership is very focused and everyone works to meet customer's requirement."
good,Engineering driven company with many opportunities to work internationally.
good,"Enjoy working as part of the team. "
good,United Technologies has a fantastic intern program that fosters professional development
good,"Simply put, great place to work. Compensation is below comparable companies. Very generous tuition compensation program."
good,"When I arrived at work I never knew if I would be inspecting,supervising,training,or covering an absent employees position.There was 227 employees on the line that I was assigned to and I was required as a utility to be able to fill any position without assistance from another employee."
good,Kidde Fire Fighting and Kidde Fire Trainers has the backing of United Technologies but is allowed to run like an entrepreneurial company with individual P&L responsibilities. During my tenure I have been fortunate to work with a dedicated staff and work on strategic goals for both organizations.
good,Very interesting place to work with a wide variety of projects and innovations.  Flexible work hours.  Opportunity for advancement.  The best and brightest people from around the world.
good,UTC kept buying companies to supplement each other but never got the computer systems hooked together.  i.e. right and left hands didn't know what they were doing.
good,The company is well organized with a diversity of businesses. They have excellent controls and are concerned with doing things the right way. I would recommend working here to anyone.
good,"UTC was a nice place to work....long hours, hard work but freedom to complete tasks is essential to good quality of life."
good,UTC offers a good work-life balance.  Health insurance isn't the best but in line with other Aerospace companies.  Work is very interesting and can be a fun challenge at times.
good,"Co-workers great, local branch management was good. No Sick-time till after 6 months and not always easy to balance family life with work for first 90 days. But, get through the first 90 days and it is a good, stable job. Training is very thorough and is a very relaxed environment."
good,"Great pace t work if you are loking for :"
good,"UTC was a great place to work for a direct position, but as a contractor there was a two year maximum. I was my own boss and i was allowed to do it all."
good,The jobs are challenging and plentiful. You work mostly year long po's or multiple shorter term po's. This allows you to touch upon many fields within the company. Advancement is slow as well as the pay raises but is a good environment to work in.
good,Job is decent for being right out of college.  The people there are nice.  The company hires in a lot of contractors and keeps you a contractor.  Company also seems to invest in Mexico more then in the US.
good,"I was kept very busy at united technologies but the company provides good traditional benefits such as fully paid tuition (including fees books and paid time to study), health insurance, occasional free lunches and generally supportive culture."
good,It is a great company to work with if you are looking for work life balance. A reputed brand name across countries it operates. I had amazing 2 years of experience.
good,"Good job - great education benefits, generous vacation time.  Stress is very high - short staffed and expectations that everything will still get done."
good,"Great benefits and compensation, good work life balance. Great location in  Florida. The team building and team atmosphere is lacking. Very less interactions with other teams and they tend to work in silos."
good,good company. great people there to help. the only thing I did not like is that high paid veterans who are too old to perform job tasks are still working there keeping their jobs. While us new hard workers will get laid off even if we don't make as much money as the veterans do.
good,Technologically advanced company and management is little bit poor. BUt overall it is good place to work and learn technology since it is a fortune 45 company. I would say overall it is good one.
good,"great place to work when the market was doing well in real estate, free coffee, great staff, small staff, meeting people was a plus, techno savy staff,"
good,the day to day challenges are unknown so the stress level becomes high at times.  Keep in mind that this is aerospace and in this industry compliance is HUGE.
good,Typical day at work consist of performing audits and giving reports to management on any findings of defects. The culture is diverse and I enjoy working.
good,"A typical work day is 8-5 "
good,"Very busy whole day, Have learnt a lot from my fellow mates, Management is great very co-operative. Workplace culture is good but very busy mainly because its an service dept. Hardest part of the job is JOB itself no time to think or talk about anything else. I enjoy speaking to people best part is i get chance to speak to different people from different countries."
good,I have learned a lot about Excel and PowerPoint as we work extensively on both of them. Though some processes need overhauling.
good,"Otis is an industry leader focused on providing a safe work environment for their field mechanics and reducing product liability by selling solutions to customers and being selective in which elevators they allow into their portfolio.  "
good,"United Technologies is truly the best company at which I have been employed.  They understand the concept of work/life balance and reward their employees handsomely.  "
good,"Innovative environment , Transparent Communication. Learned the nuances of team management , P&L , communication and finally love thy job."
good,"A good startup company, see a huge leap in next ten years. Extremely helpful environment and definitely help sharpening my Management Skills"
good,"I began to work at BF Goodrich (who became Goodrich, who became United Technologies) as the stock clerk. I learned how to multitask quickly and how to efficiently handle customer requirements. It was very fast paced and time flew by. In 1999 I was then advanced to the material coordinator where I learned about planning/buying. The largest challenge was with keeping the appropriate stocks of stock in house while lowering on hand inventory levels. In 2002 I was promoted to the Operations Support Supervisor. It was the most challenging position I have ever held which only encouraged me to work harder. Learning how create a strong team and be able to counsel people can be a daunting task but also very satisfying. After 17 years I was stilling learning new things and found it exciting. I loved my job. In 2014 the company made the decision to close the Dallas shop."
good,"learned standard work and process improvement. ACE.  great co-workers, hard working.  hardest part of the job: lack of support from other departments"

good,co-workers were great
good,UT provides a lot of excellent products and services. UT employees are tru professionals.
good,Good company to work for.Had 3 shifts at times.Liked working 2nd shift.Great company for the community.
good,"A typical day at work included meeting with attorney, managing new and existing contracts along with various reports. I learned how to manage complex projects. Management- I had a great department manager. Co-workers were fun and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job - understanding employees in Latin America. Most enjoyable part of the job - the various company events."
good,Excellent experience. Company treats employee with respect. Good work and life balance. Plenty of opportunities to move around and up.
good,"Responsible for 20+ hourly employees with time, attendance and safety in the work place. Another responsibility is completing and delivering parts for internal and external customers. Work with support groups to reduce lead time, improve on lean manufacturing and part quality."
good,Getting to work with exciting technology in support of our troops is the coolest part of my job.  The work makes a difference.  The team is very supportive and there is a very supportive environment for engineers and managers alike.

good,"Great benefits, global presence, leader in aerospace technology, continuously evolving suite of products, on the forefront of next generation aerospace requirements."
good,I worked with UTAS for 5 years and my experience was mostly positive. After the merger there was the usual restructuring and eventually involuntary layoffs.
good,"I like to work in UTC democratic and respective environment"
good,"UTC was a great place to work.  I was challenged and empowered.  I felt as though I was contributing to important objectives.  The products and technology is exciting and interesting.  You'll work hard here but in the end it's worth it."
good,Very welcoming atmosphere and one of the best offices I've been to. Very balanced work life balance. Hiring team communicated and worked well together.
good,"Great work enviorment,  great pay, fast paced but relaxed. I enjoyed working there and would return if the oppurtunity presented itself. Nothing more to say"
good,"Your workday will change from one day to the other which is a good thing , learn on how to work on basic hvac unit , plumbing , ground work    working with different people , set up room for special events , driving from one location to another location to do work , if you like to learn and work by yourself it's a good place you need to be wanting to learn everyday"
good,Enjoyed working for United Technologies and was looking forward to being apart of the organization until the project was unexpectedly placed on hold indefinitely.
good,"the company is very good makes tasks very enjoyable. it is also very easy to make friends as most of the people are usually just joined, therefore, looking for the same experience"
good,"Worked in UTC Hyd."
good,"UTC paid for my Masters Degree, 100%.  "
good,"A fantastic culture for continuous improvement.  Great people philosophy.  Engaged work force.  I learned many accepts of manufacturing from, metal and composition lay-up, bonding processes, machining and assembly processes."
good,"Great growth and learning opportunities. "
good,"Typical day: work with Suppliers to expedite parts short in manufacturing."
good,"Days are well structured and hours can be flexible.  There is a lot of opportunity for anyone with drive and strong work ethic."
good,"The employees are not that close, it is mostly a commuter environment and an older demographic. The company could be run better, many projects are forgtten about."
good,"Hiring process was quick and efficient. Not many behavioral questions asked, they mostly want to know about you and your experience, since you're only starting out. Be prepared to tell about yourself, work experience"
good,"I loved working here and would not have left if not for poor leads and low pay. Compensation was poor but has been said to have improved, if this is true and they are more competitive I would go back in a heartbeat. The company's best assets are the people, you can learn a lot here."
good,"Good environment, they are relocating to Mexico in 2019 so unless you need work temporarily I wouldn't apply. It is production but quality over quantity."
good,A typical day at work consisted of using a company program to run some tests. It was very easy to go to anyone working there if I ever had any questions. Everyone was super welcoming. Sometimes I had too much time on my hand
good,"This is a great company to work for, I enjoy the people I work with and have the utmost respect for them. The culture at the company is good, and they stress having a work/life balance."
good,". I like the work and environment"
good,"As Lead Applications Architect, directed 25 Developers, 6 Analysts and 4 DBAs in the design, build, test and deployment of over seventy (70) HR, Payroll and Benefits self-service applications for its global workforce of 220,000 employees in 16 different languages."
good,"The day went by quickly"
good,For a global company you have a sense of a family environment. Very engaging and collaborative work space. Also they provide tuition reimbursement after your first 12 months of working here.
good,UTC is fun and exciting . Very busy and fast pace . The people are great . The locations is in the middle of the city. The hardest part of my job is when we do not deliver on time to  a customer.
good,If you are willing to work hard you will be rewarded for that work. Management knows that their team is what makes them good and they always encourage their teams.
good,"Great place to work. Great people. Good benefits. 10hr. shifts, 12 hr. weekend shifts. World wide company. I would recommend working for UTC and UTAS."
good,The Aerospace field was new to me and the products are interesting. The work does delve into some cutting edge then takes quite some time to come to fruition through all of the Airline and FAA types of certification deliverables.
good,UTC is a great place start your career right out of school. The employee scholar program at UTC is best in class. Helps you to get an advanced degree while you work at UTC. The diverse businesses at UTC also gives you an opportunity to explore different industries while working for the same company.
good,A very challenging environment with technical requirements and business requirements.  It is a place with high scrutiny and accountability  A very difficult place to join at 58
good,"Roughly 9 hour workdays standard. Excellent Co-op program. Very interesting work in some departments, great learning resource. Great benefits for full time employees."
good,"My time at UTAS was great, although management was being churned frequently which was distracting. I was able to achieve a good work life balance but if there was something urgent there were no exceptions to get it done."
good,"Working here has been a great learning experience. It is great to work with everyone and we all help each other when needed. Developers, Managers are great and help as need when needed."
good,"United Technologies is a good place to work overall.  Salaries are competitive and the people are great.  Depending on your goals, there may be limited advancement opportunities, however."
good,very laid back great place to work just management is lacking. have been here for 14 years but the pay doesn't meet other places pay. always looking to improve and do more.
good,"At this location, the entire team was superb. We started early, worked smart and efficiently, and the compensation was very good. I really enjoyed working every day with the team that was assembled there. Managment at that location was below par. His management style was counterproductive to the morale and productivity."
good,It was a big company with a lot of security. I learned how to build harness boards here as well as how to build larger harnesses.I learned how to build a harness that was at least 6 feet long. salary was good for the times and raises were fair and the people in general were nice and able to get along with. Didnt see too much of management. There was no hard part of the job. And building a harness for military applications was fun too.
good,"Good place to work, Newer technologies but slow adaptation of it."
good,Work culture is very good here. Team is very knowledgeable and  ready to help other team members. Get opportunity to learn on various third party integrate into JDwdwards
good,While I was working as a design engineer the people were very easy going and friendly. There was a lot of stress due to deadlines and goals to be meet but it was a really good experience
good,"Strong corporation to start a career with due to its historical stability,  broad portfolio and technical expertise which supports employee continuous education."
good,the company has good benefits if you take advantage of them. i have friends there that are doing really well. they went from $15/hour to 25/hour in just a few years. i left just to focus on school.
good,Continuous Improvement and Process Driven company who brings out the best in their employees. I thoroughly have enjoyed my time with UTC. I feel I'm prepared to lead any project.
good,I had many responsibilities and I enjoyed being apart of the Safety team and doing employee safety meeting and supporting the office staff with accounts payable
good,Overall UTAS is a good place to work.  The people working at the company are great.  The work is interesting an fun.  I learned a ton about reconnaissance.  The most frustrating part of working at Westford UTAS plant is the configuration management and doc control. They control PDF's instead of source files.  The control of the source files ends up falling on engineering.  Sometimes you cant find the source file you are looking for since it resides on someone's hard drive.
good,Its a good place to work if you don't mind working over 40 hours a week. The benefits are no good. Especially the health benefits. They did away with the pension plan.
good,It is a good company that provides you with education and the tools necesary to do your job fine and the necesary support to grow up
good,"Typical day at work was worked in special projects, enhanced the process for material allocations and learned about their systems."
good,"United Technologies, or as it was known when I worked there, Hamilton-Sundstrand, makes parts for the aviation industry. A typical day at work consisted primarily of meetings, presentations, and computer and telephone tasks. The management was hands-on and competent. My co-workers were friendly and inviting. I learned a great deal about Outlook, public speaking, and customer service. The hardest part of the job was ensuring effective communication between departments. The most enjoyable part of the job was customer service."
good,Great place to work.  Everyone is very friendly and helpful.  I was offered many opportunities to do work outside of my role and take on extra projects.
good,"Great assignment, move around to help many different departments and plants. Trained many people in the different areas and plants"
good,UTC Aerospace is a great place to work.  The business unit in which I worked was very high pace. Management recognizes when you do  a great job and the people I worked with were highly skilled professionals.
good,"I like my manager and co-workers."
good,"Esta compañia me dio la oportunidad de conocer las herramientas de calidad, lo mejor de la compañia son sus colaboradores."
good,"In certain areas I was required to run two machines at once, along with trouble shooting any problems that would arise during the day. I have learned that production changes at any given moment, especially if you run out of material for that product. The hardest part of this job was working nineteen days straight before having a day off. This puts a strain on your family as you don't get to spend much time with them. This meant you would only have one weekend off per month. All the goals and milestones that we have reached together as a ""team."" One of my favorite goals was and still counting our factory has worked over 15 million hours without a loss of time due to injury in the workplace."
good,In order to work for this company you must really be good with the computer and talking to people. The hardest part of the job was the early morning conference calls and meetings. You kind of have to gage your 40 hrs to fit what you have to do.
good,I enjoy the working environment and have a good relationship with most of my co-workers.  They offer  tuition reimbursement for any type of degree.
good,I have enjoyed working in utc. The reason for my leaving I want to move in California.It is very huge support in production site.
good,"UTC has well over 200,000 employees and is truly a global corporation."
good,"Indeed, a productive culture. Teams of world leaders in supply chain."
good,A lot of fun.  Helicopters are fantastic and you are part of the process.  Good People.  Great Engineers.
good,Uts is a well rounded place. you will learn how to do a little of everyone job. You will work inside as well as in the field. you will always need your sneakers and gloves at your desk. You never know when you have to get dirty. Great place to work if you want to learn about AV and IT systems. I learned a great deal :)
good,"Very busy and new experience for me, working with engineers."
good,"great secure company to work for. if you are looking for some excitement in your life, UTC may be a little slow but overall a great company to work for."
good,could be very stressful you had to work together to make sure you get things done I was on a pace line so you have to watch for missing parts from the person before you could be very challenging.
good,"Recommend working here."
good,"Lean MNaufacturing"
good,Every day @ work is sometimes the same very busy
good,Design tester racks and test head for the use in production of fire and security products.
good,"Awesome company fast pace and demanding. Great peers hardworking crew, Carrier a major player in the HVAC community continues to grow and expand."
good,workdays consisted of 12 hour shifts. the supervisors were always there to give breaks since the assembly line was a rotary line and it never stopped moving. fellow co-workers would help you if you got behind a little. the hardest part of my job there was working in the heat in the summer as there was no air conditioning. what I most liked about the job was that you weren't sitting all the time and we were able to talk to each other as we all assembled different parts on the line.
good,"A typicical day is full of technical challenges and opportunities. What one learns is this facility is a legacy Goodrich Aerostructures plant with emphasis on the Kaizen philosophies of lean, 5-S and process capability. Management is mostly comprised of legacy Goodrich with a great emphasis on the Goodrich People Philosophy in that people are the greatest assets to the company. Co-workers are extremely cooperative. The hardest part of the job is working within the transition into the recent United Technology Corporation. UTC is a huge corporation with opportunities, but has a some what different philosopy than the legacy Goodrich philosophy."
good,"Forming line operator and Hi LO driver, and shipping ,and receiving clerk To keep lines stocked with material, remove trash hoppers and empty, to load , and unload incoming , and outgoing semi trucks, make out bills of ladings"
good,UTTC is one of the old company based in Dubai... UTTC is the best organization for all employees who all are really eager to learn.. I had a very good experience and improved alot to develope my career.
good,They have a great program to further your education. It is a easy place to work and is very clean. The main complain that I had was you never knew if you had to work the weekend until Wed. so you could not make any plans. Overall it is a good company to work for.
good,"Their work is not hard, but not stable either. A lot of layoffs there."
good,"The work environment at United Technologies is very friendly and personable.  Even in the case of critical deadlines and deliverables, the atmosphere is very conducive amiable personal interaction."
good,"The workplace is very relaxed and the other employees are very friendly and helpful. Hours are very flexible, some work 7-3, others work 9-5. Overall a very enjoyable place to work."
good,"Overall, i had a great experience here.  I was surrounded with good people who were team members.  Towards the end after the most recent merger, it was obvious that management was making changes that not all of us agreed with and it got tough to work there without any ability to feel secure or appreciated."
good,"Great place to work.  Cross-training was encouraged and ability to change shift or position relating to personal life was pretty easy.  Opportunity for"
good,"In the mornings they are several meetings from 8 am to about 10 or 11 am. After that the day is fast pace with multiple internal deliverables that needs to be done on time, or there would be delays in anon-going project. Some days you're also expected to stay late, however UTC has flex hours in case of emergencies."
good,"If you like supply chain., logistics, and CRM, this is for you! As with any position, there will be stresses, but here it was minimal. I would recommend others to apply."
good,"The people are exceptional and have high integrity to produce aerospace component for commercial and military customers."
good,As an intern at UTC Aerospace Systems I was not exposed to the full culture at the company but for the short time I was there it was rather enjoyable.
good,The workplace is more of a community and all the employees are close and help each other. The benefits are great and there are a lot of opportunities for growth.
good,as an intern they don't give much work. the intern role wasn't as good as a full time employee role. I would suggest trying the OLP program at UTC if you are a student looking into excelling fast pace.
good,"I truly enjoyed working for the various business units within UTC.  They offered competitive salaries; excellent benefits (although premiums felt a bit high); an awesome tuition reimbursement program, and had an amazing culture."
good,"Still an excellent place to work, It was better under Goodrich management but it's still a good place. The pay is good, the facilities need upgrading. The company is staffed with lots of very experienced manufacturing and design personnel, which is a rare find. They actually make things here as opposed to outsourcing everything."
good,"A typical day for me is to come in, check which machinery or equipment have maintenance checks due. I perform those as a first priority given there are no technical difficulties with the machines on the production lines. When a machine goes down and isn't running that is my first priority is troubleshooting and repair. I order and submit requests for any spare parts that are needed for approval. I also complete side projects assigned to me such as researching equipment models to develop operator PM's or adjusting work spaces to make room for new equipment, etc. The hardest part of my day would be the amount of work that can drop on me all at once. It is only myself and one other technician that covers the shift so if either of us is out and multiple issues come up at once, we can become overwhelmed fairly quickly. For me, the most enjoyable part would have to be all of the nice coworkers and people I have met. Also, I feel accomplished when I repair electronics and get them up and running smoothly."
good,"Empresa boa de ser trabalha ..."
good,UTC is an excellent company to work for. The work is challenging and the work environment is top notch. I reccomend this company to anyone seeking a challenge and good working environment.
good,"I find the company very cooperative and gives all the employees the space and environment needed."
good,"Well equipped facilities that carry out aircraft component maintenance on heat exchanger, control valve, and etc. Maintenance job carried out always IAW CMM. Friendly co-workers and great environment for graduates to experience and learn everything you could see there depending on time flexibility. A few undesirable part when the job needs to deal with chemicals for curing as it is tedious but enjoyable not realizing time flies till you miss your own lunch time."

good,"There were few ""typical"" days at UTC Aerospace on my last project management assignment.  Some days were spent entirely in teleconferences or meetings, whereas other days could be spent on-site training others, collaborating on policies and procedures with colleagues at divisional and corporate levels, or on crunching Excel spreadsheets or data maps.  The common element was much interactive and collaborative engagement with others, which is what I thrive on.   The hardest part of the job -- which is true of many jobs at many different companies -- is not merely keeping focus on all the deadlines and completing a wide array of activities and priorities, so that they can be completed in a timely manner, but in seeking and obtaining the management consensus to ensure clear communications on which priorities MUST be first."

good,"This global Fortune 500 provided me a number of incredible opportunities during my career."
good,"As an exceptionally large company that needs to support immense overhead, UTC has an extremely high quality and rigorous financial.management structure. The talent is high because the HR management is extremely well run. Starting at the very top of the company, those functional areas drive this business forward and the rest of the management delivers as necessary to hit the targets that are clearly being established before a new year starts."
good,The people are very friendly. Always try to celebrate personal events together. Sometimes management doesn't understand the things to do but as engineer this is expected.

good,"I had an exceptional career with United Technologies.  I traveled and had experiences only one could dream of.  I was laid off in December of 2008.  I understand  being a Financial Analyst why they laid off 7,500 salaried employees.  Many had 25+ years.  They could hire younger people pay them have the wage I was making and save the company a considerable amount of money.  It's been a challenge finding suitable employment in this field.  Unfortunately, I understand this happens with many individuals after working at UTC."
good,"Required to learn independently and constantly work with team members and the other man in mind when performing tasks."
good,"UTC is a fast pace demanding company that does take pride in their  products.  Monthly revenues are to be met to secure quarter goals.  Decent amout of red tape and politics but, this is expected of a large coorporate company."

Enjoyed being on the ground floor involved in the relocation of an existing product line to another state and getting it up and running with a divergent group of new employees."
good,"I worked at this facility prior to UTC owning it, it went through many changes started out as Gulton Data Systems, Goodrich acquired it then UTC. Management was constantly changing which I feel did not help the business at all. The business has had no failures for 45 years in space, which I attribute to the actual workers not the management. The environment could be be very stressful but we all worked well under pressure.The most enjoyable part were my coworkers..."
