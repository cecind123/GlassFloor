rating,review
bad,work inside stockroom to kit put away pack out cycle count then also work and shipping receiving with heavy work load. too much work for one person .
bad,Learned a lot but worked for a short time. I got laid off due to cuts. I did not liked the working Atmosphere.
bad,"People leave so often, it will make your head spin. No culture, poor management, uninspired products. Don't make this mistake. There after often inspired people who come, and stay, only to become zombies of the PerkinElmer miserable culture."
bad,"aucune considération"
bad,"The management did not do anything to make improvements that were very hard on employees and very inefficient. Needless to say, there is a very high employee turnover rate."
bad,If you can BS and don't wan't to work this is the place for you.  The favorites get away with murder while the power brokers just idle their time away.  If you belong to the right country club you will go far.
bad,"My first manager was great but then it was all downhill from there. Either they gave no direction or where micro-managing so tight you felt like a kid that couldn't tie your own shoes. Bullying is supported and anytime you wanted to advance for training or promotion, you were told you weren't ready, even though objective evidence showed otherwise. My co-workers were good, smart and easy to get along with at first, but then later on, the bullying was supported and I hated going into work each day. It was downright abusive."
bad,"Pro:  potential for learning"
bad,"If you love a stagnant work-site, do the minimum of what is asked, and only want to work your 8 to 5, this is the place for you!  They are more concerned of how you look on paper, then actual performance and production.  Money/Profit runs everything, not customer satisfaction or appreciation.  Purchasing lots of companies to look better to the share holders."
bad,"The organization does not place a high premium on it's staff, and shows very little loyalty to employess."
bad,"Worked way too much overtime.  Knowledge not shared with anybody. Saw people fired for refusing to work overtime when demanded.   People put in charge who should never be. Some quit when they found out certain people were promoted. Almost all my co workers were let go,  "
bad,"eerst werk beloven vervolgens  het werk uitbesteden aan een ander bedrijf . dit was einde werk voor mij."
bad,"There is not enough room for growth in this company."
bad,"To install, demonstrate and do operational & installation qualifications of the analytical instruments at the client site. Major work was to troubleshoot the hardware and software issues of already installed systems. Providing training on the instrument usage with the customer product was the main challenge involved."
bad,"They have no clear path or temporary employees to become full time."
bad,"corporate culture "
bad,Management did not advance in department no communication between management and employees low moral site wide software outdated alot of finger pointing with management when something goes wrong no human resources available at site level
bad,"Always people leaving, bringing in temps and don’t train. They put people in positions with no idea how to do what they were hired for. HR just attacks people on the floor , and the buildings are management heavy."
bad,"No growth or growing employees "
bad,"People keep largely to themselves, there is no culture to speak of, poor management. Everyone works at their desks. On-boarding was very poor, was on my own hunting down answers for everything."
bad,"I am not happy there, when the co was Caliper Life Sciences I was very happy, my work day is very hard I have learned to run some machines in cleanroom the management is not good they pick there fav!! my co-workers are nice and friendly, the hardest part of the job is the machines break down alot so there are some days you feel like you have not done much."
bad,"Leadership and HR are both extremely lacking"
bad,Not a very professional company. Systems and processes are not in place. I did not have the profile matching my experience and skill set. Most of operations are sill done manually.
bad,"Actualmente laboro en el departamento de ventas, cuento con cartera de clientes desde hace 10 años, me encanta lo que hago, me siento satisfecha de lo que he logrado, durante un día común de trabajo es iniciar leyendo y respondiendo correos, después procedo a hacerme un café bien cargado para seguir con mis labores, disponiendome a cotizar e ingresar ordenes de compra, así como también dar la atención al cliente, ya sea llamandoles para informar de su entregas, hasta la finalización de dicho estatus."
bad,The company is great and has many opportunities. The technical support group is focused on primarily supporting company technologies. I did not enjoy how the group was managed. There was significant levels of management for a small group which made it difficult to change and adapt. The managers would promote and retain based on personal criteria as opposed to who was qualified. As  a result you would have technical support composed of PhD level scientists and high school graduates who were not necessarily qualified to support complex scientific products. I  would recommend working with with this company if you can work in a different group.
bad,"Good with meetings and reviews"
bad,"lack of communication....lack of distinct direction, lack of training for new managers, so a lot of managers do not really understand what they are managing"
bad,"Very high attrition, event the heads of HR could not take it... they went through 3 heads of HR in the past year, VP of sales left last June, VP of product development in October, VP R&D in December, another 20-30 people at various levels. The informatics leadership got rid of all the Asians from the management last year. Many inappropriate comments. Place is like the Russian aristocracy... Czarina and Rasputin... nasty swatzy politics...and Check out the linkedin profiles of management...Qualifications of top management: zero years technical experience (software or analytics), zero years domain (life science) experience and would have expected at least management training, none of them have it. "
bad,This company provides a good initiation to the work place for entry level and new graduates.  Excellent opportunity for co-ops and interns.  Immersion is more difficult for seasoned professionals.
good,Good co-workers helpful and loyal.
good,"OK company to work for , just not honest and straight forward ."
good,"Mangement has changed many times, at the expense of R&D, new product introductions.  This causes lower market share, lower compensation and lower employee morale."
good,"Informatics Services is run like a consulting company (Like Deloitte or Accenture). So, it's all about billing hours and your work hours are heavily scrutinized (Timesheets are very excruciating and mandatory in my group). Since it is like a consulting shop, there is no concept of collaboration among employees and it's all about how fast a new employee is billable. There is huge variability in the amount of work from one week to the next and depends on how many projects you have, which depends on your skill/experience level in PKI Informatics products. You could be working on international projects and this leads to odd working hours sometimes. "
good,"As a contractor, I thought I would be there for 18 months, hired for a project to reduce customer order fulfillment from 18 to 2 days, for all the different areas of the P&E business, with one of the main areas being global distribution planning, US, EU, Asia, for the VERY short time, I was there (3 months), I thought we had made good progress in terms of material availability, and on time time delivery, at least that is what my manager told the team, I was working with. He gave me very little training, if any, and was always behind in his responsibilities as a manager, and I performed well, at least that what I was told. I had access to work from home, which he did not like.There were two situations, one weather conditions in CT, and I was not feeling well one of those days. I worked from home and told him after the fact and completed all necessary work on those days. I showed up at the job the following week, next thing I know my employment ended, without any previous discussion or understanding of what the problem was. I still do not understand what happened.... I was told by my agency it was ""lack of work""."
good,"Fair Job & Company"
good,"No room for advancements.  Managers are constantly trying to micromanage your job.  You get reprimanded for the most mundane things while others do much, much worse things and get no type of reprimandations.  If you aren't apart of the ""good ole boys"" club, then you will be fired.  If you can kiss butt a lot and suck up, then you will do fine."
good,"I enjoyed my time at PerkinElmer, although management and human resources had their own agendas, which made it very difficult for our operations groups to focus on QA"
good,Poor management and challenging work life balance. The people are great to work with and are knowledgeable but lack of standardization in processes which makes learning/training more difficult for new hires.
good,"Cost cutting environment makes work life difficult. "
good,"Large multinational company, and still growing. Many organizational changes afoot, and many challenging learning opportunities arise. However, management does not present a united front and are blatant in displays of favoritism and bias."
good,"When I started with the company the culture was great, now however an employee suffers because of lacking advancement potential due to the revolving door called HR.  Non promoted internal advancement due to the lack of steady HR recruitment who knew the business."
good,Been good but culture is changing from Customer and Employee focus to Share Holder focus. Quality has suffered as company is changing focus to highest rev generating markets
good,"Great people to work with however there is a big disconnect from the executive suite. Yearly reorganizations hurt the morale of the company. "
good,"I was part of a small company that was gobbled up by PE."
good,"Empresa que fornece belas ferramentas ,mas é muito difícil crescer e se tornar alguém importante."
good,"Typical salary and benefits"
good,"I started the OneSource program which I now regret, there wasn't support to back it and I was left to figure out how to make it work and be profitable.  Too much emphasis on pharmaceuticals and large contracts while ignoring smaller labs."
good,"Not a great platform to learn, "
good,"Excessivas viagens para atendimento no Brasil todo sendo que minha contratação era para o estado de São Paulo. "
good,"The hours are reasonable, the coworkers are polite, responsible, and friendly. The work is manageable and relatively low-stress, occasionally tight deadlines cause some pressure but it's not terrible. The pay is about 20% below what you'd expect for your experience, whether you're a recent graduate or a post-doctoral degree. Expect to stay in an entry level position with an entry level title for at least 6 years or longer regardless of job performance or annual reviews. Good vacation time allowance and ability to take time when you want, but no distinct sick time. Fairly relaxed hours, come in before 9AM, leave 8.5 hours later, your choice of when that is."
good,nothing really to review worked there for 26 years and then they decided to pull the rug out from underneath us and send all of the work to Singapore.
good,"A typical day at PerkinElmer would start at 9 a.m. and end at 5 a.m.  Everyday I would create spread sheets that would go to customer service managers, shop foremen, and customer.  I learned how to go online to retrieve purchase orders then proceed to enter them and file the necessary paperwork when everything was completed."
good,Working culture is good. Management needs to be more efficient & employee concentric.My job profile requires very frequent travelling across India and that is becoming a huge problem on personal font. Personal life is getting badly affected.
good,"Understanding management."
good,Decent company with great personnel but limited advancement.  Middle management takes on lots of responsibilities with very little recognition.  No money for promoting.  Minimal raises.
good,"My typical day at Perkin Elmer is fast paced workplace, as soon as i come in I read emails and faxes of information requested from the previous day to process claims and approve denials. information that I dont receive, I have to follow up with health insurance companies so we can meet our deadline."
good,"Early started. Good flow rate, accessioning it can take only a few hours. I learned different procedures to handle serum and dry blood spots. Most of the time you report or work under close supervision. You are part of a group of no more than ten co-workers and can become attach. Must follow operational instructions closely and must not fail."
good,"The company values paying employees what they are worth, but overall there is poor workplace culture and very low morale after a lot of layoffs."
good,"Today it may be good to work at perkin, but my time it had dirty work culture due to couple of people . Otherwise products are excellent and has good name in the market today."
good,"Dedicated employees. Decent work/life balance. No true HR representation on site. Friendly environment. "
good,"I would still enjoying to work there if our whole empower team was't laid off with no reason given. Good benefits, ocasional team lunches and dinners."
good,punch in answer e-mails locate missing inventory and handle shipment errors either wrong quantity or wrong parts shipped orders shipped to wrong customers make sure the correct parts are in stock.  I do like finding large dollar items and correcting stock
good,good company to work for regarding company environment. very collaborative atmosphere advanced equipment which makes working enjoyable on top of a competitive salary.
good,管理存在问题，致使员工流动性大，不能使员工集中精力做事，而是被许多繁杂琐事困扰。产品竞争力有限，价格在同等竞争对手中偏高。
good,"Company is no longer around and has not been for years so writing this is really serving no purpose.  "
good,"Besides the fact that I was lucky enough to work with great people, I also learned about Six Sigma Lean principles. That led me to pursue training to better myself."
good,"I enjoyed working with some very good engineers and technicians."
good,a typical work day would go pretty smooth for a store clerk. It consist of inspecting certain products for shipping. Answering phone calls from customers.
good,"PerkinElmer is a company with a variety of Product Line."
good,"Management is fine, great work life balance, colleagues are friendly, a place with lots of challenges but also very rewarding as the end."
good,Great Place to work. Good Benefits. Co- workers were easy to get along with and helpful when needed more information to complete the job. Management was responsive when having an issue.
good,"Creo que como ha pasado mas de 25 años, no sería muy consecuente con mis opiniones"
good,"The company has existed over 75 years and is well established.  Most employees have worked at the Medical Imaging facility for most of their careers. The environment is fast paced to produce product and ship on-time.  Even though work stress can be high at times, the company treats you well."
good,Decent company. Pays fairly well. Bonuses are great. Very little in the way of raises. Merit increases do not exist. Poor communication between upper management and everyone else.
good,"Good people to work with. In this position, I received my first taste of SAP. Transactions within an SAP environment was the hardest thing."
good,Ocena w stosunku do pracownika jest pozytywna ale stanowisko prace nie jest interesujace.
good,Unfortunately the company was sold and many people were laid off.  Good working environment.
good,"I am getting laid off.  I do not have much more to say about this company.  When it was a smaller company, it was awesome. Very flexibility and many areas to cross-train without permission."
good,"Informações dinâmicas, rotina estável."
good,"• Typically work from 8:30 am - 5:00 with little overtime"
good,*Work closely with CM's on electrical and mechanical non-conformances
good,Numerous changes occurring over the past 2 yrs
good,It's the management team which need to be improved.
good,"A typical work day would include working with blood samples, collaborating with coworkers and state lab workers and discussing lab results."
good,"I would still enjoying to work there if our whole team was't laid off with no reason given. Good benefits, not too many meetings, occasional team lunches or dinners."
good,Great place to work. Upper management is driving the company out of business. All about margin improvement instead of investing in new technology to keep the company on top.
good,"My time here was very short-lived since they hired me through a contract. I was supposed to be temp to hire and there was so much talk about how they needed people so my chances of being hired on were very high,  I was only there for about three months before I got laid off with no notice at all.  I left work and then got a call a few minutes later.  I actually really enjoyed the job that I was doing with them and would still be working there.  I was told that it was due to budget cuts from the customer that we were working with and that there were no other opportunities in my area for me to get hired on directly through PKI.  Very unfortunate because I was left stuck, but what could I do being under contract with them. I enjoyed the relaxed environment and the fact that we weren't micromanaged.  If they had permanent positions available I would work for them again.  I'm not sure about growth opportunities.  From what I saw and heard you kind of have to push and take your own initiative if you want to find other job opportunities within the company."
good,"Lack of clearly defined roles & responsibilities leads to confusion, extra work, and wasted time. Everything at PerkinElmer is more challenging than it needs to be."
good,"For a first job this is the place to work. Great benefits, time off, some flexibility with hours. The work is fast paced and mistakes are not taken lightly. However, the management is TERRIBLE and nothing has been done to fix the problem. In fact, it just keeps getting worse. A lot of pettiness, favoritism and back stabbing. The ones that do the least amount of work get promoted and special treatment. If you are a hard worker you will never leave your position. I would recommend to work for some experience then leave."
good,Everyday receive complaints from customers regarding RMA repairs and past due orders. Most of the work is all manual and not enough resources to get the job done.
good,"Expediting Numerous RMA Orders. Pulling orders, kitting parts, and packing for shipping. Transferring to other Departments to help with pulling orders. A good team of Co-Workers. The management was also on the floor working as a team player."
good,"I had a lot of fun working here. Our department was great and the co-workers were a lot of fun. The pay, for the Boston area, was very low. Two years after I left, my pay had gone up over 50%! If you can get past the meager paycheck, it is a fun place to work."
good,Sales calls in the field with appropriate follow up and documentation.
good,Great company to work for. Good practices in regards to safety and PPE in a clean room environment. Personnel and management are great and professional.
good,"Trabalhar na empresa PerkinElmer, foi fundamental para meu desenvolvimento profissional. Aprendi muito, confiaram na minha capacidade e potencial, isso permitiu que cada dia tivesse, mas vontade para contribuir com a organização. Porém estou em buscas de novos desafios."
good,"I was started my career with north gate technologies as a PEOPLE SOFT DATABASE ADMINISTRATOR in the year of 2010."
good,"I jumped into this job at full throttle. I received employee of the quarter after just 3 months of working there. I started off in manufacturing, moved into System Integration and did all of their custom machining.  Raises are 1-3% and that is not much when you make less than 50k per year.  Seems very difficult to climb the ladder from the bottom. "
good,"A typical day at work would entail getting ready for the morning  reviews in the shop where each product line was being produced. We would work out together how to catch up if behind the daily production rate. In several cases it would be lack of material, rejects, matters outside of the production team. that is why all functional team members attended so they knew what their priorities were to help the production line catch up to it's daily output."
good,"Used to be great.Has changed after new management took over. Strange things are happening, people are friendly but sad recently, there is nothing hard to learn as long as You want to."
good,"Excellent for breaking into the industry, but functions largely as a trap to keep unmotivated employees as lifers"
good,"PE constantly acquires companies and as a result, has layoff's every quarter. So....in effect, everyone is subject to layoff every quarter. Management also set unreasonable goals for sales people, while also providing no RND, no application scientists and zero marketing."
good,"Good company to work for, management and employees very helpful. But do a lot of temp hiring instead of permanent job offer."
good,"Everything to do with Mass Spectrometers is technically challenging. I enjoyed every minute of my time there."
good,Mainly a excellent company to work for. They provide a lot of support for service engineers to get machines working in a timely manner.
good,Its a decent enough place to work and has talented and helpful working culture at peer level. Good level of task ownership by most workers. Work overload can be an issue.
good,"it was an ok place to work, was micromanaged by the higher-ups constantly.  8 hour work days with a very early start time was a plus.  Managers were just worried about meeting numbers not quality"
good,"I basically left because the pay was too low, and there was no room for advancement."
good,You get s lot done during the day but it is not very sociable company. Everyone keeps to themselves including the managers. The biggest benefit is it is a relaxed environment. The negative is career advancement.
good,Had a great time working there. We built semiconductors for silicone wafers. got my first experience there learning mechanical inspection and blueprint reading.
good,"The actual work as a company brings me great pride and I truly love what I do.  Most of my background has been in Research, however PerkinElmer Genetics has given me the privilege to learn more about  the fast paste routine of a Clinical laboratory. The hardest part of the job is the new management and the relocation that will be happening within a few months."
good,PerkinElmer has a long history of Innovation with many passionate people around the world who care about their customers.
good,"I'm usually the first one to arrive in our group.  Prior to my arrival I do a quick assessment of things I need to do when I get there.  This may include setting up the laboratory for upcoming experiments, printing/e-mailing any applicable materials to co-workers and customers, and/or analyzing previous data I've obtained through research projects.  I've been with the company for 5 years and have had the same manager since day 1.  I have a lot of respect for him because he is more of a mentor than boss to me.  He has an open door policy that allows me to visit with him and talk about anything (work, life, etc.).  The hardest part of the job is trying to fit everything in an 8 hour work day.  Because of my many responsibilities it can be difficult at times to manage the deliverables I'm asked to complete.  The most enjoyable part of the job is my ability to work on several projects that may or may not be related to one another."
good,The relationship here is a little bit complecated. Working pace is not that fast.
good,"Respeito com os colegas de trabalho, clima descontraido."
good,"A company with good managment ,good working enviroment with quality workers and supervisors.The hardest part of the job was our goal each quarter but the easy part was everyone pull together to make it most ofthe time."
good,"I enjoy all the people, what I have learned, from instrumentation and/ or by co-workers."
good,Used SAP to monitor and input all collections and credit transactions
good,enjoy my work- advanced capabilities in the market place to become an industry leader in DI and compliance. Global travel routinely to assist customers navigate compliance issues.
good,"Better products than competitors but smaller footprint."
good,Since the management change we are expected to do more every day and expected to work OT to get the task done.  Some weeks I could not work OT and would get questioned why things weren't done.  I feel like more support was needed.
good,"There was no such thing as a typical day in my position, one of the many things i enjoyed about working at PerkinElmer.  Persons should be self motivated and outgoing to be successful!"
good,"Há equilíbrio entre trabalho/vida pessoal, dependendo do cargo. Salário e benefícios são bons, de acordo com o mercado. Não há estabilidade e promoção de cargo, dependendo da posição. A gerência é relativamente presente, devido a política da empresa. A cultura empresarial é como a de todas multinacionais, com valorização do trabalho mediante resultados."
good,"Liked going to work everyday. Hated the commute on 15 and 8.Worked through a temp service. As a temp, I had no benefits but I didn't care. Lunch area is the best anyone could expect."
good,"Over all good place to learn the work , but we have to learn on our own . flexible timings to go to office but mostly we have to strech and also we have to work from home  daily depending on the work . Lot of work so couldnt balance personal life and professional life"
good,"PerkinElmer consistently puts customers first, and hires quality people.  The culture overall is good, and many of us enjoy working there.  I would recommend it to anyone.."
good,"Trained assemblers, coordinated work flow, and supervised production team responsible                for electronic and mechanical assembly of Surface Analysis Systems. Performed vacuum                assembly of precision optics in a clean room environment. Met detailed specifications,                    using blueprints and engineering documentation. Worked closely with engineers,                            technicians, and management."
good,"I worked there as a temp, therefore I had no benefits whatsoever, the people were great, total team players and professional."
good,I learned the intensity of customer service and operation work flow in depth which allowed me to grab various challenging roles during my tenure.
good,"I enjoyed very much selling in vivo imaging devices for PerkinElmer."
good,Management seems to take a long time to make any decisions.  Tons of rumors about parts of the company being bought out or reorganized.  Great people for co-workers.
good,"Foi uma boa empresa, no entanto não havia plano de carreira pois eu era terceirizado."
good,"I enjoyed the work I did at Perkin Elmer."
good,"Employees are hard working, collaborative, and know what needs to be done to get the job done.  However upper management has cut staffing to the point that it is difficult to get the jobs done adequately, leaving the lower level managers and employees trying their best to do their jobs."
good,"Non 24/7 production."
good,A typical day here is learning new things/strategies from your peers. Attending to customer needs promptly. Tackling new challenges to enhance customer satisfaction and Productivity.
good,"The training usually starts around 9.30 am in the morning, weekends are off. I did my work on blood sampling and karyotyping. It was a great learning experience and the environment was nostalgic though at times very hectic and we will have to work for hours and hours to produce results. I enjoyed it cause it was of my interest."
good,"I always enjoyed the supervisors I worked for as they challenged me to perform well in my position.  The job provided an opportunity to eventually work from home, which has proven rewarding. It became difficult to meet assigned targets as the capability to accomplish that was frittered away, until my position was thus eliminated. The people I had opportunity to work with were the best part of the job, establishing many friendships who remain great contacts. The compensation package was quite rewarding."
good,"I had a good run at PerkinElmer. The cultures between the divisions are widely divergent, but the Bio-discovery/Life Sciences & Technology division had an entrepeneurial, almost-startup kind of culture. Note: the corporate-supported employee band."
good,"I was working as an HR generalist in the italian organization, but dealing with the spanish organization also."
good,"They gave classes on CPR, blue prints and various information. "
good,"- multinazionale statunitense in tutto e per tutto"
good,PerkinElmer is a great company to work for.  Very forward thinking and focused on understanding the market to being best products and practices to bear.
good,"Provides ample opportunity to explore my past experiences for new business, balance work and family , supportive management and provides professional environment."
good,It's been a pleasure and a terrific learning experience for me working for PerkinElmer.
good,"Technically challenging day to day delivering high quality robotics."
good,Good Work/Life Balance and fair market value in terms of salary.  Big shifts in the culture. Learned a lot 8yrs with the company. The management team is currently going to a great deal of transition so it leaves little guidance to those who report to them.  I would definitely recommend colleagues to apply at Perkin Elmer if there is a job that fits for them
good,"Vendas e assessoria para produtos e equipamentos científicos e de biotecnologia, para laboratórios de pesquisas e indústrias (farmacêuticas, químicas, alimentícias etc.), e coordenação/supervisão da equipe de vendas (3 distribuidores) do estado de São Paulo."
good,Site is now closed and operations have moved to Boston. The Montreal site was a great company to work for with an excellent team.
good,"Viagens Internacionais"
good,"I like PerkinElmer (PKI) which is currently going through a structural realignment, but they are facing typical large-company corporate problems such as historical siloing, compartmentalization, etc. These issues are being addressed though with the size of the company and breadth of products lines will probably never be completely solved. This is typical of a large organization though."
good,"A typical work day would start with planning in the CRM and travel across the assigned geography, we do not feel the pressure of work unless we complete the set targets for the business. The office space was truly overwhelming and the ethics in the work place was adorable. The regular trips on non business days added more flavor to the work experience in the organisation."
good,"Perkin Elmer creates great Analytical instruments which are used in research labs. It caters to the IITs, Universities & commercial players for their big range of instruments."
good,"I have been a OneSource Employee for many years.  Yes, as many have said companies change things, over time but that is life.  Life at Perkin Elmer is what you make it.  If you want to be a great engineer, then be it, and you will never have an issue with your customer or leadership team.  If you, choose to be a less then stellar employee then this is not the place for you.  You work for the best, always do the best thing for your customers and company, and you are set for life. Self made people, who have values are what make us a company, that I am proud to work for.  Work hard, and smart and enjoy life at PE"
good,"It was different every day. Design and assembly were different and you never knew what you were doing that day.  Made it a very dynamic place to work, very active."
good,a middle size company with many M&A. Therefore the organization structure change every year. Diagnostics is a good department while environmental department's business performance lag behind.
good,"Sólida e grande em seu mercado de atuação, grandes possibilidades de aprendizado"
good,"Awesome company."
good,"1. Good Place to work"
good,Buenas capacitaciones de mis compañeros del area y supervisores y especialista que me apoyaron para poder realizar con mayor eficiencia los servicios
good,"Largely about the numbers, be prepared to drown in a sea of reporting and metrics. Plenty of politics and red tape to get anything out of the ordinary accomplished. Overall, a great resume builder."
good,Perkinelmer was an amazing place to work.  Everyday you learned something new and pushed yourself to do better due to great management teams.
good,"It is a good company for learning."
good,"Good mentoring program for interns; "
good,"Fast paced job, goal oriented. Great place to learn somewhat tough place to grow"
good,A very well organized and run tax group. very knowledgable.
good,"I enjoyed having the ability to be creative and finding alternative solutions, always had great coworkers, many friends to this day"
good,quick pace
good,The atmosphere was amazing. Many days there were large group lunches where everyone gets to know each other better. As a co-op and temporary employee I was able to learn a lot about the company and their different departments.
good,Our team is most productive team. Most of team members are talented and fun to work with. Unfortunately it is changing now. The top management of the company made several bad decisions in a row.
good,Its a good place to start your career with. People are helpful and you can learn a lot. Management is bit dull. Overall benefits and good compensation will keep you intact.
good,"I was the primary investigator for all thermal aspects of the primary mirror on the NASA Hubble Space Telescope: thermal analysis and design, thermal in-space temperature control system, thermal insulation design, thermal sensor system.  This involved analysis, design, ground testing, deployment into space, testing in space, and eventual in-space deployment and operational use."
good,Good working ambience one can find in here. Go getters are to work here. One can have a good platform to prove thier skills and will be encouraged in achievement of over all business as well as personal feats.
good,"Atuei durante 1 ano como estagiária no setor administrativo do departamento de assistência técnica onde aprendi a lidar com contratos, agendamento para viagens técnicas, abertura de fechamento de processos entre outros."
good,"learnt customer handling . "
good,Great environment to work on analytical instrumentation.  Chance to work directly with scientists.  Fascinating work.
good,Good Company to work for but things have changed in the past 5 years.  Field work with full benefits.  All field positions are worked from home based office.
good,I was part of a merger/acquisition and loved my team and the environment. Learned many different parts of the business.
good,Focused on radiation detection and liquid handling instrumentation. Established great Customer Service relationships with various Biotech Companies in Southern California.
good,"1) Staff was courteous, very professional, always open to employee's concerns."
good,"Boa empresa"
good,Liked all the engineers and process tech's that I delt with on a daily basis. Great team work from an understanding of what company goals were.

good,Large to Giant biotech company that sells scientific equipment. Generally management is decent with a few bad apples. Little room for growth depending on division you are in and generally speaking the constant management level reorganizations are enough to keep you without a career path.
good,"No company morale at all. The company makes no attempt to unify their employees or the companies that they buy. Management is a very weak link. They have a high turnover and do not seem to care. They wreak havoc in people's lives with their quarterly layoff's, which are, from a business perspective EXTREMELY short sighted. They do not care about the effects of the layoff's on their customers either."
