bad,The general labor is not hard work so for that I will not fully complain about the pay rate but to compensate your employees and management working in a climate controlled wearhouse with NO A/c and only 15 min breaks. Not to mention the take u through what’s consistent of 3 days work of orientation process before you even clock in on tour first day to begin making money. And then when you do start working they ALL PF A SUDDEN don’t have any hours for everybody an staff is limited due to the project due so they pick an choose who to give the house and money to rather than be fair. HORRIBLE COMPANY.. HORIBLE JOB.HORIBLE PAY..THE SIGNS ARE HERE PEOPLE DO NOT IGNORE THEM‼️
bad,Dazed and confused Seven ploys understood how to work so I probably didn’t the training was based upon the management the management trained OK there’s a line leaders helped a lot I will try my best to do what I could to help everybody and anybody but you did have some of the people there that didn’t want to do much other than collect a paycheck and if you’re interested in working this job you got to be patient understanding and have a good attitude
bad,"Rude to Packers, they show Favoritism towards certain employees, inappropriate behavior, bad communication will put someone at fault for any and eveything."
bad,My assignment was ended due to attendence because I was at the hospital and with doctor's note and everything my assignment was ended. But the work pace is awesome but still very stressful
bad,"Favoritism, profiling people, lack of opportunity if you are not friend of a lead or a supervisor you can not become a regular employee with the company and you can get fired for no reason that is working for Mattel..."
bad,Me encanto trabajar ai esta muy bn algo carrilludo pero bn
bad,"you are required to work hard inside a truck for a small pay,"
bad,je n'ai pas aimé cette mission car c'est un travail en usine et pas de contact avec les personnes
bad,"Upon arriving, I was told to scan my badge to clock in so I did as such. We huddled up in a circle to go over the guidelines but not once was we told what exactly we would be doing. After the meet we was told to hand in our badges, yet still unclear for what purpose. Though, later found out that if we were to scan our badge ourselves it would not go through, On the second day, we was told that we needed to get our badge back to clock out for breaks. During that time I had gotten sick being around so much dust. I had notified my representative at the staffing agency of what was going on and she wasn't aware of what the company was doing. She assured me that someone would talk to me about it, but no one ever did even when I asked."
bad,"Excellent company and family atmosphere.  The pace was fast and exciting, and performance expectations are high, but the reward of achievement is immeasurable.  Enjoyed my time with the company along with the experience and knowledge gained to help further my career."
bad,"Mattel isn't a good place to work. The only good thing is the discount at the toy store....but really, you can go down the Target clearance isle and get things cheaper! The onsite cafe is expensive and gross. The people are all suck ups and brown-nosers because this place is based on who you know, not what you know. I jumped ship pretty fast as I am better than this place and wouldn't trade my happiness for anything. Turns out, Mattel puts together it's own survey to achieve the Best Places to Work lists in Fortune 100.....it's all fabricated. Just Say No to Mattel"
bad,"Working at Mattel does have it's perks; However, to make it here, you have to keep up with the Jones'! Relationships are important. It really doesn't matter what your talents are or how up to par your work is....it's who you know and kiss up to. The older people in higher positions never seems to go anywhere or change with the times. So even if they tell you that they want cutting edge or to think outside of the box.....they aren't really asking for any of that. You are really there to make sure your supervisor/boss looks good and that's it."
bad,"This company is tolerating lazy people and being lazy is the canadian way of life. Don't work for this company because you'll just be a number whether you're in the office or just a plain laborer. They don't care and management don't have the foresight and the fortitude to know what's happening as long as they get their paycheck only. The lead hand's job is a big joke, too as his job description includes youtubing and laughing all day and management is happy about it."
bad,"Come in get your work order, count you product, get your line set up before the employees come in.  Once employees come in you start you line up until completion.  As a line Leader yours constantly walking and talking with the employees to make sure that they know how to put the displays together also ask the employees who are putting the toys on the display how many toys go on the display."
bad,"Working a seasonal position at the San Bernardino Mattel Toy Store is somewhat pleasant. There are no benefits and no sick pay, but the customers are always great and the atmosphere of the store is very relaxed."
bad,"Very much a sales first every other department is setup to support sales kind of attitude. This resulted in inefficiencies across the company, every department should have its own objectives even though it challenges objectives of sales at the end of the day these differences ensure corporate objectives are met."
bad,"Led seasoned sales team to measure daily Key Performance Indicators, plan future selling cycle and develop long term plans for budgeting, sales projections and P&L management."
bad,"How can a company survive on old school management, politics and technology? Today's ever evolving world requires companies to keep up with the times. Mattel keeps old, out of touch management in place. They just recently got in touch with social media...and really they just do social media for a couple of their brands. Their benefits are good, but are in place for the sole purpose of keeping their employees happy in such an unhappy environment. People are stressed out, not happy, it's hard to move up and, I agree with an earlier review, that it's really who you know, not what you know. For me, I come to work because I need to pay my bills. But I'm constantly stressed out and unhappy.....wonder why I'm spending time reviewing on Indeed(dot)com?! Looking for my next opportunity."
bad,"Full 8 hours day finish are work on time. management will help out as much as they can.People around you to help finish on time shipments.Some time not enough time in the day have to work O.T. but O.T. is ok. Outside activities, like cancer walk softball games."
bad,"Organization is in need of experienced Senior Leadership to successfully guide the transformation.  "
bad,If you are the type of employee who would like to be part of a team that welcomes innovation and pushes the envelope....then Mattel is not the place for you. If you are seeking a manager who tells you to think outside the box and then helps you run with it....then Mattel is not for you. If you are looking for a position that gives you the opportunity for growth and opportunity....then Mattel definitely isn't the place for you.
bad,"The day I got hired at Mattel, I was over the moon excited. I went thru their new hire orientation, got taken out by my new team and got started. Week one was amazing. I went to meetings, learned about the company, shopped at the toys store, etc. But happy, exciting, over the moon turned on me quickly! Suddenly, my boss went bipolar on me. I'm sure she was threatened by me as my work ran circles around her. She is one of those higher management employees at Mattel that fear change so they do nothing new and do their best to keep things in their scope of knowledge. This is not good for a toy company who should really emerge with the times. I'd do anything to get that over the moon feeling back....but just not at Mattel. I have since moved on as I just couldn't take the abuse from my boss. I'm in a better place now. Prospective employee beware!"
bad,"It sounds like fun and games to work for a toy company, but please know this place is infested with politics, drama and old fuddy-duddies (yes I used that word) in high places, who aren't going anywhere. The HR department is the worst, with horrific micromanagers. This is a fear-based company. A lot of employees vent to each other and have very stressful days. Also, their job descriptions are not at all what you will be doing. Beware. Seriously, your first day....even your first week will be great. But then the other shoe will drop. This review is based on my current job working at the El Segundo Office"
bad,"Been two very bad years for the company and hundreds of layoffs in the process.  Tough environment right now.  The culture is extremely risk averse and conservative and for my position - real lack of transparency which is key to leadership.  Nothing personal, just very difficult times right now.  Company not really going after real and fresh innovation."
bad,When I first started working at Mattel the excitement of working for the world's best toy company sounded so cool! Well that excitement wore off pretty fast! This place is filled with top level executives who have been there for a long time. There is no possibility for change and finding ways to do things differently because they just want what they are used to. The approval process for ANYTHING takes forever to the point where things become old by the time they are approved. I'd think twice before coming to work for Mattel.
bad,I would still be there if the company had not eliminated my whole department throughout the country. Overall a OK company to work for. Good Benefits and good co workers.
bad,"Good atmosphere and nice job culture, supervisor was good human being. It was great pleasure working with him and looking forward to work with them once again"
bad,The toy industry seems to be in it's final days. Too much competition from electronics that the business cannot keep on top of changing. It's a slow death
bad,"um trabalho q sei fazer e faço com gosto, respeitar os espaços de outra marcar trabalhar e fazer diferença no meio espaço sem q ninguém tire o meu direito. direção normal, tbem colegas de trabalho sempre respeitei todos, mais difícil montar sozinha uma vitrine sem ter a outra ajuda a agradável quando no final do dia fiz um excelente trabalho com uma ótima exposição, fechar com chave de ouro."
bad,"At first the job was great, then I realized discrimination abounds if you are the least bit conservative. The management hypocrisy was unbearable, and the politically correct environment was stomach turning. The product isn't what it used to be and the pay was dismal. Favoritism was rampant. Better look elsewhere if you want to keep your sanity."
bad,"Mattel has been a place of phenomenal growth and development.  Working on some of the most iconic brands in the world gives managers a unique opportunity to make a positive impact on people's lives.  Working on the global brand team, I have had the opportunity to lead teams to build product lines that have global appeal and scale and the challenge of partnering with marketing teams around the world to create messaging that resonates on a local level.  With a heavy focus on new product development and strategy, no day is ever the same.  In addition, working in a category where the consumer who purchases the product is not the end consumer, provides a unique opportunity to sharpen your marketing skills by using different marketing strategieis and tactics for different audiences."
bad,It was a factory that was a ok place to work until they closed the factory..
bad,They don't want to hire full time employees so they could skip on benefits. But they also give you a hard time when you send in your invoice for work that's been done. Contract states 60-day net pay. It's going on months and multiple calls to the third party company that sends the money to me.  A lot of pointing fingers.  Very disappointed.
bad,"Most people are friendly."
bad,"This company  provides very little advancement for its employees.  Though they promise half-day Fridays, most departments end up working through Friday evening and through the weekend."
bad,"As a warehouse walker, I didn't really get to talk to too many people. I had lots of time to think to myself. The first few days of work felt very surreal but I got used to it overtime and enjoyed being able to think to myself and think of new ideas."
bad,"Company has been going through massive transition and reorganizations over the past five years and has not recovered from years of poor upper management. Unfortunately for this iconic brand, upper management has for years, and continues, to be more focused on their own bonuses and perks than the products, company or any of the employees below VP level. Very old school, 1980s corporate culture ... you almost expect to see hundreds of fax machines and no computers! "
bad,No hay organización ni apoyo por parte de superiores para hacer tu trabajo los encargados de jugueteria se quejan de la forma de hacer las cosas de los superiores  y tienen toda la razon
bad,"Mattel was not my favourite workplace. There was a hardcore culture of spending hours on powerpoints to present to each other which is not the best use of time, in my opinion. There were also very old legacy systems that made everything 10x harder than it needed to be."
bad,"normal un dia de trabajo "
bad,"On the phone all day - sitting or standing, your choice.  Some irate customers but most are wonderful.  Sometimes breaks your heart to hear stories of hardship and inability to buy for less fortunate children.  Training for the job is great.  Scheduling is quite flexible and it is usually possible to find coverage for needed days off.  Some variety when asked to fill in writing e-mails, handling returns, editing mailing lists, etc but usually only the ""regular"" employees get to do those more interesting tasks.  Can be terrifically frustrating when rare ""permanent"" positions open due to tremendous response, much competition, and frustration on the part of ""seasonal"" employees who put in many years' of part-time, lower paid work, only to be passed over by seemingly young, untrained, inexperienced new employees.  Is a place where anything you say will come around to ""bite"" you.  Nothing can by trusted to be kept confidential.  Everything is heard, from what you say on the phone to what you share with co-workers on bathroom breaks.  Benefit is discount on American Girl dolls and Fisher Price toys."
bad,Good opportunity but many product recalls when I was part of the organization. Many management changes
bad,"Horrible. Over 10 IT tickets. And that was just to turn the computer on. Slow... behind the curve. Mattel isn't ready for ""production."" Pays artist late."
bad,"Was a great place to work, but with all the layoffs and so many great employees retiring the culture has changed for the worst.   I wish I was old enough to retire."
bad,"The best part of the job it the great people the work there. Supervisors and lower. But as far as upper management, there arent too much good to say about them."
bad,"Good people when you find them, Too dependent on outsourcing overseas. Stay away from IT Supply Chain. It is a moving target  with no clear direction."
bad,"Mattel was ranked one of the top 100 places to work by Forbes magazine, but it has slipped out of that ranking, and continues to go downhill, its unfortunate. so many talented people have left or been laid off, due to politics or lack of creativity. It became toxic, and the morale continues to go down."
bad,".......I wish someone would have told me just how much this company is behind the times and how much politics there are here. It's a very old school place with old school policies. You can't be on non-company email at work and everything else is deeply monitored. The benefits are good, but they are only in place to keep people there...whether they suffer or not. Another reviewer below said it best in that the higher-ups are definitely old and set in their ways. Mattel could use some fresh executives and a re-fresh of up-to-date policies and practices. If I knew then, what I know now...not sure I'd be working here."
bad,"There's such a thing as too politically correct. People lie really well here. They don't tell you half of what you need to know, everything is just inferred. If you aren't really sharp and very politically savvy I wouldn't work here."
bad,"Really nice people working at Mattel, unfortunately, the leadership team is quite bad and their so called strategies are not helping the company to turnaround"
bad,Don't let you reach incentive by make unrealistic goals so that you cant make the percentage and get a raise. Also even tho you get 3 breaks it doeant add up to an hours worth.
bad,"dia comun,.. llegar y  empesar  ensambral  juguetes... "
bad,The pay was beyond great. Hours were extreme mandatory OT warehouses work conditions extremely hot during summer and extremely cold during winter. Sloppy management team.
bad,"Security Dept. was not a good department to work in when I was there. That may have changed since then. Overall, I would recommend someone to work there because they may fit better than I did."
bad,"Customer service - call center. Pay is lower than industry standards. Customers are difficult and demanding. Calls come in at machine--gun rate with no time in between calls. Call center is open from 6am to midnight so you may be scheduled different shifts every week. If work is slow - you will be sent home (without pay!) which happened frequently.No compensation for the time you spend getting ready and driving to work, just not pay that day at all."
bad,"Mattel is a good company to work for based on compensation and benefit package.  Management style is very old fashion, and self-centered.   Lack of people development."
bad,Hard labor was okay but overall it was a bad experience. Most workers did not speak English so it was difficult to communicate and also most workers were very rude.
bad,"Good work life balance, with half day fridays. Good family culture, but could tell from a few weeks in why the company is not doing well. Doesnt seem to be much strong career progression."
bad,They promised promotions but never followed through.  Poor management team. I enjoyed the employees I worked with.  I enjoyed the clients I got to see and worked with.  I excelled at my job but there wasn't much room for growth.
bad,Good Work Life balance and benefits but career and culture aspect needs improvement. I won't recommend this place for long term. Short term it is fine.
bad,"Company continues to work on a turnaround and while there are some positive signs (e.g. new CEO, new CBO from prominent organizations) there is still much to be done internally to make Mattel a great company.  "
bad,"Good work life balance. "
bad,"good place to work, hard, long hours , good reward and pay...I like did  not like work conditions"
bad,Not enough work to keep busy during the early months of the year. There needs to be more hours enough to make a good paycheck
bad,"Spent most of my time in the receiving department. Finding and auditing the lost parts and raw materials was the most enjoyable and the hardest on most days. You learned what materials were molded parts, which parts were received from vendors or other facilities. Keeping track of 2500+ individual items in a 1.6 million square foot facility and 80+ storage trailers is a challenge."
bad,The offices of the center for design are extremely sterile and bland not to mention cramped which left me with a bad taste in my mouth.
good,Start your career here to learn how company politics work.  It's a large company where you are exposed to multiple departments from marketing to sales to finance.
good,"As a seasonal employee in the call center, you must be willing to give up the ability to request time off, be okay  with a strict point system for sick days (we only get the liberty to be sick during 2 scheduled shifts in a 2.5 month period), like to get yelled at by people who let themselves get angry over toys, know when you're going to work a week in advance tops which makes it near impossible to schedule any kinds of appointments, accept compensation that is below industry standards, and not have your availability or working hour preferences taken into account when you're scheduled. Seriously I don't even know why they asked. If I could do it over again, I would have looked elsewhere for employment. And often I feel like I'm scamming old ladies into buying more than they need with the mandatory ""soft sells"" we have to make with no commission. Usually there's no time between calls whatsoever to even take a sip of water but best believe if they've over scheduled that you can be sent home with no warning and no compensation."
good,"Uma boa empresa para se trabalhar, aprende-se muitas coisas em relação a vendas, comunicação visual, negociações de pontos extras e contato direto com vendedores responsáveis pelas redes."
good,"Mattel is a high level IP Toy Company,  They have a vision to get the toy industry to be in the movie industry.  They seem to have a lot of changes going on right now."
good,"The list of what needs to be done is really long. In essence, a highly structured machine needs to buy them (eg P&G) or a merger of minds (eg Lego and Mattel via a smart PE firm) and gut the poor leadership, processes, fix technology and fix the energy behind the employees and company. There are tons of jewels in this place and great margin and talent, but it’s depleting fast due to selfish, small minded leadership. You can look at performance over the past ten years and get the gist, look at who remains in leadership and there’s your answer. "
good,I worked at Mattel because I was unemployed at the time and it was also very close to home.  I loved working there but there is no advancement in an employment perspective.  I would have loved to have gotten a permanent position but they have chosen to move their headquarters and leave Wilmot so I will not be able to move with them.
good,Mattel is an amazing company to work for but management needs to focus on their employees motivation level. Lack of trust among employees. Micro managing my subordinates.
good,"Fast paced environment, must be flexible to change as the company has reorgs every 6 months and layoffs every year. Biggest perk about the company is that every Friday is half day work day."
good,Mattel benefit package is amazing.  The job was repetitive and no possibility for promotion.  Loved my coworkers we were like a family.  You never knew from one week to the next the hours you would be working and very rarely two days off in a row and never weekends off
good,Constant lay offs and reorgs.  There is no job security there and Mattel is behind the times
good,"Pessoas altamente comprometidas focando no desenvolvimento da empresa, que tem crescido substancialmente. Cultura organizacional e valores são constantemente revistos."
good,"Girl creative management does not value more senior (older creative employees, with a wealth of experience and proven, consistent talent). If you are not moving up, they will eventually want you to move on and out. If you do not, often they make the work environment very unbearable and undesirable so you will leave on your own accord possibly by slowly making you go mad. "
good,"el ambiente era bueno, se tornaba una buena cultura laboral."
good,Smart people are held back by mediocre leadership.  Mattel has great brands and no appetite (or money) to drive them.  I don't see long term success for the company.
good,I got my internship at Mattel. It was fun and I got my first job here after my internship ended. It offers paid internship and sometime you can get free food for attending some of the meeting during your internship.
good,"Ethical issues arose for workers compensation of an high end retail brand.  Company hired employees for tax relief purposes within the city of Chicago, however, employees were often given only one day a week to work.  Income was supplemented by unemployment benefits often.  In addition, women with children were asked to work shifts that  were harmful to their work/life balance sometimes.  Mothers were asked to work closing shifts often not leaving the store until 9:30 -10pm,  then being asked to return to work the following day by 8am.  This cause mental anguish when i was unable to see/ spend time with my child who lived with me because he was put to bed before I got home and then I had to leave before he went to school on many days.  It was hard to assist other women with their children when I felt my own child was being neglected."
good,"Mattel used to be a great company to work for, being able to attract the right creative talents and right management. Unfortunately in the last five years, because of many reasons, some caused by the changes in children's play patterns, but also because of some management errors and philosophy, more suited to commodities industries then the entertainment industry where the company belongs."
good,Buena empresa pero carece de desarrollo para sus empleados
good,"Loved the work, loved most of the people, but management is fear based and focused on self-preseravtion which makes anyone who speaks up a threat."
good,Working first shift for 6 am to 2:30 pm. Its fast pace work environment. Co-workers are friendly and honest. Most management need a better lesson on manage skills to workers.
good,"No valoran tu trabajo, no les importa la calidad de vida de los trabajadores con tal de que el trabajo este hecho, son muy pocas manos para todo el trabajo que se necesita. Algunas de la promociones todavía se hacen mediante preferencias y no por la calidad de trabajo."
good,"Senior management team is made of a group of friends that have no idea how to run the toy business. Unfortunately, I see how this is going to change in the near future."
good,"Mattel used to be considered one of the best companies to work for in the US. Not any more. In the years I worked there the comapny was on a steady decline, losing its focus and unable to keep up with an ever-changing industry. Now they are lost and are not able to find their way back. They are no longer competitive."
good,"Company is very much run top-down -- executives live isolated in their 15th floor suites, never interacting with regular workers & thus have no ""finger on the pulse"" of what is really going on in the company & industry."
good,"Mattel was like a city in itself, the campus was awesome with multi cafeterias with award winning chefs. Daycare, Dry cleaning, employee Toy store and state of the art Gym for example. Stability and poor leadership was the only negatives, Mattel has 1-2 major layoffs yearly. The running joke was after 10 years when will my number come up."
good,"Het is leuk werken bij Mattel, er werken mensen van heel veel verschillende nationaliteiten en dat maakt het interessant."
good,I really enjoy my work because by teaching student i can learn more about IT subjects. Flexible time. really enjoy where working as tutor
good,"I would come in very early and sit in the breakroom and have some free coffee with the inbound crew. I used a clamp lift and learned too use in differnet ways.And the whole crew worked as a team and always feed each other, just like one big family!"
good,To manage a new team with diffrent culture and specific work traditions.
good,"El ambiente laboral respecto a los compañeros de trabajo es buena, infortunadamente no tienen promoción para aquellas personas que estudiamos y queremos ser promovidas."
good,"The work was easy, but when there was no work there was a lot of standing around. We worked with different teams every day, some coworkers was willing to work and some weren't which made it difficult for the ones on that team"
good,"I did liked mattel a lot, i felt Happy on the environment and support shown by HR and partners from the different areas, I had a difficult time adjusting to the over meeting culture and the exceeded processes and procedures and documentation that some areas like mine had, lots of documents and formats to deliver and basically they repeat some of the same info on different formats, besides that, they are constantly looking for savings and  executing structural simplification which I was target of at only 10 Months after starting to work with them and my feedback was always good."
good,"La agencia es buena, lo unico malo fue en promotor a cargo del grupo que entramos por temporada,no era responsable y nos dejaba todo el cargo y responsabilidad a nosotros.."
good,work life is balance with personal life as week days are off also working hours is sufficient and not hectic. People around are supporting to some extent and maintain personal relationship irrespective of their work culture around.
good,"Pros"
good,"Strong brands like Hot Wheels and Barbie, but company continues to struggle due to lack of innovation and foresight. Very mature sales team, coupled with a very inexperienced marketing team led to disconnect and hindered growth. Very stressful job with tons of meetings and little change,"
good,"- There is a lot of problem occurred. Some problem required 3 partied to get involve in solving problem. Especially in such intense cultural organisation like this. Wise and clear presenting, in-deep knowledge and people skill are important."
good,"Overall Mattel is a great place to work. Staff is very talented. Products are fun to work on. There are challenges because of the size of the company. Can move too slowly because of processes that are in place. There are too many layers of approvals. Great ideas may not get through or end product may not be as good as it could have been because of approvals and cost constraints."
good,"Mantenimiento correctivo y preventivo de la maquinaria de producción,análisis y diagnostico de fallas de las maquinas"
good,Fast paced work environment. Data Entry From begining to end of the day. There are so many toys thats its really overwhelming. co-workers were great and they were great to work with. Raffles were the funest .
good,era divertido porque tenia contacto con las personas y saber que puedes servirles es bueno
good,"Pros: Nice work/life balance.  I could come and go as long as the work got done.  Mostly wonderful people."
good,por lo general tranquilo cada quien sabe que hacer capacitacion continua
good,"Mattel provides very friendly environment and fun people to work with. However, the decision making is too slow, and the company needs to react to market faster."
good,"In the design department the emphasis in the last few years has shifted from making great product to making any product, but getting it out on time and meeting costs. Many very productive designers have been laid off recently breeding insecurity and a ""just keep your head down and do your job"" mentality instead of an inspired attitude of making the best toy possible. Thus less chances are taken, costs rise, and product becomes just ordinary,  leading to Mattel's current decline. Top management, none of whom have much toy background, do not understand this, and do not understand how best to manage creative staff. It's run by quants and business school people and not by toy people."
good,Fast paced enjoyable task making toys were fantastic. Hours and breaks were spaced hoof.meeting new co workers were a plus there store dis points were reasonable too. I really enjoyed working for them
good,"Job had no training but overall co workers are nice and its a very nice place to work. Unorganized at times and management was rude sometimes, need to improve on hiring more professional management."
good,"turnover is high and a lack of processes mean that when people leave so does the process.The new CEO is great and the leadership is in place to make changes, but with a tremendous amount of cost cutting coming and the morale is extremely low and people are burnt out."
good,"I enjoyed and respected the people that I worked with on a daily basis. I liked the fact that it was close to my home."
good,"My typical day at work would be clocking in, reading what sections are assigned to me, then moving at an extremely rapid pace to restock missing items and also to pull larger items from the back for cash wrap clerks. I also at times have to play the sales person, even though there are assigned sales people. So, at times it feels like I'm doing everything at once while a few at times sham knowing that I'm going to cover behind them. Other than that, it's a lovely place to work as far as a part time job. Hearing the excitement of the customers somehow make me a bit happy."
good,Mattel has great potential but is currently in a transitional period. Everyone should be on the same page but they are not. Mattel has been slacking on the training as well but they are regaining their footing
good,"mostrar mercancia y venderla"
good,"Day at work: Production Support + development."
good,"- Designed and drafted layout of equipment and materials"
good,"So far really good management and everyone talks to each other, amazing co workers and you get to jump around the department so you’re not always doing the same thing every time"
good,Mattel was a great company but over the past 4 years has found itself to be rudderless. with more re-orgs than I can count. I hope they can find their feet and get back to being a place that people want to work for again.
good,"Management takes no responsibility for anything . Newest Manager had no regard for the company. Business was so slow , I was barely make 300 every 2 weeks . Not organized scheduling."
good,A good team spirit is what I really appreciated at Mattel in order to make everyone task to be easy . The management is also well done and they respect the employees.
good,"A typical day at work- very fast paced."
good,The company closed the NYC office and provided not much support or plan for 200 + employees. Lots of paid time off but culture is poor at best. Poor Leadership
good,I was there only for a short period of time.  I was in Ny and not in the HQ.  Half day Fridays were nice..............................................
good,Can be a great place to work but some management are very hard to work with. The brands are amazing but it is difficult to work with some people meaning the happiness of employees is sometimes limited
good,"Mattel is financially struggling, its a tough environment to work in. everyone is on edge waiting for the next round of layoffs. tensions are high and management is very ""old school"" in the ""ivory tower"""
good,If you like working in a fast pace environment then this is a good job. Unfortunately there is no room to grow and if you're not buddy buddy with the site supervisor then you will be stuck in the same spot with the worst days off.
good,"Empresa com boa cultura, mas alguns gestores não sabem lidar com a maioras das situações."
good,The culture has changed significantly since I began working here; coinciding with the popularity of mobile devices. The company is essentially playing catch-up to make itself relevant again.
good,"There is no half friday in India. Even on week days it doesn't close before 8.00pm. you are expected to be in office by 8.00 am. Your are clocking more than 70 hrs."
good,"Great place to work . Its a good place to learn lot of new technologies. "
good,"Work is a regular 8 hour daily shift. Director level management team does not provide advancement opportunities. Workplace culture needs a little work as a whole company. The hardest part is not being able to practice my skills, and learn new ones. There is no career path available."
good,"Mattel has always been a tough place to work and it has always had that reputation.  BUT people wanted to work there for the amount of experience you got and what it would look like on a resume.  "
good,"I was not impressed.  You work hard churning work and if you are the lucky few, you might be fast tracked to a senior role through their rotation program."
good,"The greatest place to work in terms of whom you work with - the producers and Vice Presidents are all sweet, caring and amazing people.  The company itself is unstable."
good,Falta organizacion con los supervisires que conoscan más la marca para poder sacarnos de dudas
good,"Days can be pretty boring but I believe it is due to the profession more than the company- i work in HR."
good,"its a typical day "
good,"great benefits and work/life balance..."
good,The personnel were professional and were easy to work with. The company ensured enough work hours through out the week.
good,"Very fun working environment, great people, for the most part.  Management changes every 3-6 months, sets new direction, then changes again."

good,Gotta love kids and also revolving rules that change everyday

good,Support Global Procurement & Financial product ans services
good,i like working here because one week we get over time and the other week we got 4 days off
good,A typical day at Mattel would be for me to mold and operate machinery. I also learned to cut the wheels for the powerwheels correctly to make it easy. Management was fair and dependable. My co-workers were a group of hardworders that formed together as a team to get the job done.The hardest part of the job was when the mold freezes up and you have to go back and unfreeze the molds The most enjoyable part of the job was learning different trait and skills.
good,No ha y discriminacion de personas al contratar...
good,"Work will be life depending on the time of year, be prepared. This company was a startup so keep that in mind but as with all startups, it had many difficulties along the way. They did have a knack for training you to do one thing and then turning their heads and expecting that you do whatever is needed to get the job done though."
good,"Great people to work with, excellent place to learn brand management. "
good,"Although this company is facing some challenging times, it is still a great company to work for.  The employees are very passionate about the brand and are proud of what the company stands for. Empowering Girls!"
good,unloading a full trailer my hand and stacking on the uniform style. the pattern will change when then size of the box changes. the trailer would be blazing hot and warehouse was not fully temp. controlled
good,Good place to work with majority of friendly people. The pay and benefits were good. I did enjoy working four 10 hour days and having three days off. Overtime was all voluntary.
good,"Very fun job, however, the position has more administrative duties, at times,  than writing. Creative work that is fulfilling and great to work so closely with other creatives on a team."
good,A remuneração da empresa é excelente apesar do clima não ser positivo.
good,"Great exposure into a global vertical enterprise."
good,"I love kids and seeing them happy, all customers are usually happy coming into our store."
good,"Hay una cultura de trabajo ( horario) muy bueno, hay jefes que te enseñan de raiz los problemas y como poder solucionarlos."
good,For nearly nine years I worked with the greatest group of people I could ever ask to work with.  I will miss seeing them on a daily basis. Half day Fridays are a great perk to have.
good,"It was a great place to work. Had many opportunities to advance. Very demanding but rewarding. Meetings were very intense, with many GM turnovers. Would likely still be there, had they not closed the facility and moved to another country."
good,"All around a solid place to work, could use more communication between work tasks and management though."
good,"Mattel has one of the largest Oracle R12 EBS implementations in the globe. I work in a global team which has presence in Europa, Latin America and APAC region. The team members are truly awesome and I love working in this company."
good,"Incredibly large, corporate, US Toy manufacturer. "
good,when you would work alone a lot of people would try to start something with you and I would just ignore them. in shipping and labeling it was a very great experience I would enjoy doing it again
good,"This was a great job where I learned a lot from being involved with many fabulous projects. I was the only one in my position to manage both the US design team and Hong Kong development partners, which made me have long hours. The compensation and benefits were great and I could take long vacations to rejuvenate. Definitely a bonus!"
good,This job allowed me to learn time management and how to work with customers and other people in the work place.
good,"algo que me gusto es la tienda del empleado, buen ambiente laboral"
good,"Didn't know how it good it wa until I left. While it was tense with the layoffs and/or restructures happening almost yearly, it was a fun place to work and there are many good people in the company."
good,"Each day is a different adventure consisting of brainstorming, development, team meetings, and presentations.  Full of intelligent, passionate, and creative people that love to make toys."
good,learned how to load and unload semi trucks of toys for Mattel Warehouse. Learned how to pick and pack orders for shipment to various stores. Great job for forklift drivers
good,"Labor de venta y acomode de mercancía, obtención de espacios y exhibiciones adicionales a las del planograma."
good,On A Typical day we would build boxes some times i would use the fork lift to pull boxes from one location to another location i would also put boxes on pallets and move the pallets from one location to another one
good,"Coworkers are great, but the culture is not very fun or sound.  It's not a very creative environment.  Managers stifle creativity and limit the growth of their underlings by acting oppressively, writing rebuking emails, manipulating communications (leaving people out of the email loops), not sharing information, and not giving opportunities to expand or advance their career, to protect their own position."
good,"Mattel. Falta gente para sus campañas, falta coordinacion y preocupación"
good,Overall great experience working there and would give A+ rating and recommend anybody work there if not for the toxic environment created by poor management. Oftentimes there were promises of wage increases and role advancement but those promises never came to fruition.
good,"Some nice perks, but it's a very controlling environment where everyone is watching what everyone else is doing.  They have layoffs almost every quarter and that's hard to handle after a few years.  Starts to make you twitchy."
good,"El personal era confiable y responsable; y eso mismo se esperaba de mí, los jefes se abrían a la comunicación con los empleados y les brindaban apoyo, el sistema de trabajo es simple, prácticamente te todo se manejaba con Excel, por lo mismo, habría que eficientar la cuestión de inventarios con una herramienta más sofisticada como RTCIS por ejemplo, se proponía tiempo extra y tiempo por tiempo, por lo que no llegábamos a generar el tiempo extra deseado por nosotros, ya que cuando no había suficiente trabajo, nos dejaban salir temprano, pero se nos descontaba el tiempo cuando llegaba a haber tiempo extra, no contábamos con servicio de comedor ni transporte, pero si algún empleado debía salir después de las 22:00 hrs, y antes de las 05:00 hrs del día siguiente se le pagaba el taxi hasta su domicilio."
good,"As long as you don't mind the wrong people making all the decisions, but love your job it's a great place. The design people are fantastic and the design center is a really fun, creative place to work."
good,"En general, la tienda Mattel tenía un ambiente laboral demandante y se debía a la temporada decembrina sin embargo, los horarios que manejaba con su personal eran de más de 12hrs y era tiempo que no se pagaba pues éramos contratados por agencia con un salario superior al mínimo, por ello las horas extras no se pagaban. "
good,"American Girl is an excellent place to work for a seasonal job.  You get paid to take their training courses.  The salary is very fair considering its location.  You can relax in casual dress.  Every supervisor I've had has been extremely nice and very knowledgeable.  You are definitely treated as a member of the year-round team.  My coworkers have been among the nicest people with whom I've ever worked. You even receive a free box of toys during the holiday season, as well as a holiday lunch.  "
good,"As times have become tough at Mattel, management has flailed and simply pushed more work down upon a shrinking workforce. Laser focus and ""spending time on things that matter"" are constantly talked about, but then when asks come down relentlessly from above, Directors, VPs and SVPs exhibit no backbone to actually push back and make the necessary cultural change. Meanwhile developing the incumbent workforce and promoting from within have taken a back seat to simply hiring from outside. This has led to a constant revolving door that leaves bigger and bigger messes behind for the fewer and fewer long-termers to clean up."
good,"Equipe divertida e eficiente o que tornava o ambiente bastante agradável para se trabalhar. Salarios e beneficios dentro da media de mercado. Como ponto negativo, posso citar o clima competitivo entre as equipes."
good,Great benefits. Great pay. The management is too concerned with bottom dollar. No worries about customer service or quality.
good,oportunidades en material para realizar la negosacion de espacio
good,"You will be standing 100% of the time unless you’re on break, talking with the coworkers will make work fun and time go by pretty fast. You also get a discount of toys at the store next to the warehouse."
good,The equipment is up to date and is checked on a weekly schedule to insure our safety. Equipment is always available to use. Easy learning instructions makes it fast and easy to find product. Very spacious isle and easy to pull material for assembly lines.
good,I enjoyed my working experience at Mattel.  It is a great company to work for!
good,I liked this job but it could be stressful at times. It could be a fun place to work sometimes. Other than my plant going to mexico I liked it.
good,The hours fluctuate so much during the year that it’s difficult to hold a second job during the months where it would be needed. Hours are close to full time in the fourth quarter approaching Christmas but then drop to half the hours in January
good,"Very corporate and bureaucratic and people work in silos. It can take a long time to get things accomplished and approved. "
good,"I enjoyed working here even tho it was temporary. Visit multiple stores, stock products, set up displays, assisted customers. Pay was decent,  could been higher considering using own gas and mileage."
good,"Overall, this is a great to work for, and a majority of the people are really nice and about teamwork. Really great benefits - outside of salary and healthcare - with lots of onsite amenities and volunteering is encouraged. Tough culture from some members of management,"
good,"My overall review for Mattel is positive because the attract bright and talented individuals to the Company.  I enjoyed my time at Mattel, until I was laid-off in 2009, due to Company Mis-management.  Turn-over is a problem, especially with the longer tenured employees, due to their higher salaries & benefits."
good,Busy but fulfilling. Lots of mentors to learn from plenty of creative people to share ideas with.  Flexible hours and benefits are great. Half day Fridays can't be beat!
good,Applying my wide experiences in customer service in the sales floor that the customers are enjoying stores products are in good price and  we the workers informs them of good deals.
good,If you like toys this is the place for you. Fun culture and great coworkers. Don't expect any advancement or to be paid well. Onsite cafeteria is a plus.
good,"Cuenta con la infraestructura suficiente y el personal justo, abren convocatoria solo por temporada pero manejan tiempo real, extra y disfrutado, lo q no permite acumular el tiempo extra deseable para el empleado, salarios bajos y horarios irregulares"
good,Mattel provides a friendly and fun working environment. This can be evidenced from the workplace culture and facilities available within the company's ground.
good,its good working at the toy factory but its also very tiring but the is simple but you have to stand up long hours but its okay since they pay me every end of the week i get less tax that way
good,I really enjoyed my days at Mattel. Very fun environment and enjoyable people to work around. I learned at lot from Mattel and will take those skills I learned in my next position.
good,"Working as a Back Office Staff in commercial department at Mattel Play!town boosts my self confidence wherein I am not only dealing with my office mates and Merchandising team but also I assist and interact with customers/guest. I learn to do multiple things within my working hours. From arranging goods in the stockroom, Assisting guest in the admission area, responding to customer's query in the retail shop and filing/ making reports for the merchandising team."
good,Good people - upper management is suffocating the thoughts and imagination. Hard to advance in my field. Management has a problem taking the credit for direct reports.
good,"Great people and good learning experience.  I managed Barbie for over 14 years and then managed Disney Brands.  I travelled to Mattel's Plants in Malaysia, China, and Indonesia to make both aesthetic and production calls in the Plants."
good,"Fun, family friendly seasonal job. Enjoy working for Mattel during the holiday season.mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm"
good,"A typical day at work is very boring.  You take a customers call and you answer the question about the same procedure or product.  The only time when it is challenging is when the customer is upset and escalating the conversation.  I have learned however, to be professional is many different ways, also to be a leader and not a follower. Thanks to my coworkers, who are a delight most days to work with, I have been with Mattel for over 15 years. The hardest part of my job is transitioning into another position.  On a daily basis you have to watch what you say and to whom you say it too even if you are frustrated or you will be talked to by a supervisor.  It is very difficult to voice an opinion without getting into trouble."
good,I liked the job and the people I worked with as well. I worked as line lead in repackaging for a while. Then transferred to warehouse on clamptruck moving product in & out of warehouse. over the next few months I ended up dinging 3 poles witch unfortunately thst was a no no and was let go.
good,Enjoyed the challanges of supporting an ever changing production schedule while maintaining a lean inventory. Scheduled material delivery and shipment from an offsite warehouse. 
good,"As a six season veteran I watched a lot of changes at the company. "
good,"Most of the people at Mattel are fun-loving and I have enjoyed my job. Like any place, there will be a few that get under your skin, but it is the toy industry, lighten up! Management does a good job addressing your concerns and working with you in case of a life-changing event."
good,"Por ser uma empresa situada em sao paulo ficava na supervisao de uma agencia de fortaleza, mas se tivesse alguma duvida eles entravam em contato comigo, a parte mais dificil era quando chegava mercadoria em todas as lojas ao mesmo tempo que tinha que me virar em tres para dar conta do trabalho ,mas se por um acaso passasse do meu horario eles deixavam eu descontar em um dia mais folgado mas sempre tendo que avisa-los antecipadamente. Eles se preocupavam se o funcionario esta bem de saude."
good,Very Good Exposure overall
good,"Mattel is a fast-paced but fun place to work, with a lot of great people."
good,"Mattel has a nice work culture, a great place to work with."
good,Great place to work in terms of work-life balance despite the uncompetitive salary. Only problem is management cares only about themselves and career progression is only possible for those who get along with the management.
good,"just the same thing everyday,the nice part of this job was that I would get discounts on there products. management was ok not to bad. the job was easy."
good,Mattel used to be used to be an ideal place to work however it has fallen upon hard times and is being restructured. It's currently not a secure place.
good,You get to play with toys half the day.  Test out the new power wheels. Watch the adults and children play with the Demos you set up. Also help the parents finding the right age appropriate toys.
good,"Empresa muito boa em relação aos benefícios, grande mundialmente."
good,"The company and management are very good. I have learnt a lot, to be able to tolerate people from different cultural backgrounds. There is so much pressure to achieve the set goals and it is always fulfilling to be able to achieve them and move on to the next set target."
good,"Equipa muito simpatica e acessivel."
good,Mattel has gone through many changes over the years.  Times are tough and environment is currently at a low.  Management is competent and there are plans for a turn around.  Problem is that is not until 2017.
good,"Responsible for managing the Sample/Shipping area, including sample production, request fulfillment, customer claims and responding to Sales, Marketing, Engineering and Research and Development needs."

good,"El trabajo era fuera de la empresa, ya que, se llevaba a cabo en tiendas externas por lo que no puedo describir mucho de la empresa, pero un buen trabajo"
good,si lavorava  su un nastro e si costruiva la casa delle bmabole il lato positivo e che eri a conttatto con le tue colleghe il negativo e che dovevi stargli dietro
good,This was a great internship to do because it allows you to expand your professionalism and teaches you different office tasks that could be useful for future careers. The environment is just as a corporate building environment would be but also fun and some personable people.
good,"globalde yoneticiler calisana ozen gosteriyor, turkiye ofistekilerde durum daha siradan"
good,Just feel the direction of the company at this point is going in the wrong direction and that cuts are imminent and while its a great place to be at the opportunity for advancement is limited by who you know.
good,"I learned new editing and graphics software that has allowed me to advance in my profession. Also, the work was challenging, but rewarding and the projects I worked on have enhanced my video production reel."

good,Great company to work for. Great part time hours. Good management time. Everybody work together.Dealing with unhappy children every once and awhile. n/a
good,"- great fun bringing toys to children around southeast asia"
good,"lo que mas aprecio de Mattelsa es que medio la oportunidad de darme experiencia laboral, y tratarme como si estuviera en familia. "
good,"Creative, fast pasted, challenging. Working meetings, lots of skus and structure. Strong methodologies and talented work force. Meetings and work keep all on track."
good,"mattel has a good social environment . management also show good responsible to the worker. the worker always changing idea and skill to newbies so that, the continuous skill to all mattel worker"
good,"The company is very friendly and that makes it a fun place to work. My department is not that great, a lot of micro-management takes place and I've witnessed a great deal of special treatment instead of doing the right thing."
good,"A typical day at Mattel involves strategizing a plan of attack for designing some of the coolest toy brands on planet earth.  The marketing team sets the brand strategies, then it's up to us, the packaging team to figure out how to best execute the look and feel of the brand through the exploration of styles and trends."
good,"Great retail store, extremely busy during holiday rush. Unfortunately the store shut down."

good,"a maquilar, surtido de mercancia, recibir y a enbarcar mercancia, inventariar, hacer maniobra en los contenedores"
good,Great work life balance but is currently going through some financial crises which has meant constant lays offs and downsizing. Hoping their financial situation is corrected soon as they are a fun and fair employer that compensates well.
good,"Worked with great colleagues - smart, driven, and energetic. Very results driven, but not too stressful. However, once revenue goals were missed, environment grew stressful due to impending layoffs."
good,Fun and vibrant place to work. Plenty of perks as well as great work life balance. The people who work at Mattel have so much creative talent. Half day fridays are the great part about working at Mattel.
good,work wasn't too hard. most time the store was empty it was only packed during the season witch was christmas. co workers were easy to work with. clean work place as well
good,"Working at the toy store had a lot of ups and downs. The ability to talk to children and parents about the latest toys, have access to them, and play with them yourself made for an exciting atmosphere. The small size of the toy store also made it more manageable to clean. Additionally, the employee discount was excellent. My favorite part of the job was being able to walk through the corporate building and see historic toys on the shelves. Mattel has excelled at creating a fun workplace by opening toys and allowing people to play with them while on lunch break. The cafeteria is spacious, the staff is pleasant, and the food is tremendous. But, these pros have nothing to do with the toy store itself. The toy store suffers from a lack of proper communication between the higher ups down to the managers and staff. The managers worked extremely hard to ensure that the expectations were properly explained and that staff stayed on task but they are not infallible. The hard work of the managers definitely saved a lot of stress. There were often times where a store policy would change from day-to-day, but the lack of communication meant that not all of the staff were told about the changes until a mistake was made. It came to the point that fellow staff had to notify each other of the newest policies so that mistakes wouldn't occur. Additionally, there was no dedicated break room. The HR nightmare that was the former break room was flooded during the first weeks of my employment and a replacement was never provided. Meaning that employees crowded the office until they were kicked out"
good,"Very fast-paced environment and stressful at times, but also fun. Great experience working with very talented, creative individuals. Depending on the group, great opportunity to advance professionally."
good,This is the best seasonal job I have worked. I learned so much about merchandising. I worked with many stores in my area giving me the opportunity to learn many different techniques. I loved toy fair and demo days getting to let customers learn about the products. I would still work here if I could.
good,"You will receive feedback regularly and the teams will push you to improve. If you are just looking for a paycheck, this is not the place for you. There is not a ton of turnover but you can certainly make a name for yourself and if you are willing to relocate, your opportunity for advancement is much greater."
good,"Monday-Friday "
good,"es muy bueno el ambiente laboral, y les imteresa mucho el estado de cada uno de sus empleados."
good,Mattel is a great place to work if you have a family.  They're very understanding and supportive.  The people who work there are great!  I've had a good experience.
good,"aprendí a manejar clientes mis compañeros fueron colaboradores, la parte mas difícil era el horario vender el producto ya que era líder en el mercado."
good,"Outstanding work/life balance, culture encourages interaction with employee's families, onsite day care available."
good,Mattel is a great company to work for the issue that came about in my 11 years of employment there was little room to move up within the company.
good,Good management who values employee development.
good,"I learned that Mattel is a company that supports ideas, solutions, and creativity. I work as a security guard with Mattel and my job is boring and NON-challenging mind wise for me. I do not let that discourage me and smile and do an exceptional job every day. I provide safety of personnel and property. Overall Mattel is great, the co-workers and management all the way to the top CEO are friendly, supportive, and want growth with and of themselves in their work."
good,Mattel is a great company to work for. They offer benefits that are desired by most people. Their concern as a company for people makes it a joy to work for.

good,Great company and culture with great benefits. A nice mix of seasoned and brand new employees. A bit old school in design thinking in terms of doing truly new or creative thing. But its a great place to learn and grow.
good,typical day at work would be packing toys all day and building boxes and restocking items the hardest was trying to keep the work area clean but I enjoyed seeing all the new shipments come in
good,"Worked while going to school on teh midnight shift.  Loved working there, just had a hard time doing both.  WOuld love to work there again, but its no longer available in my area."
good,I started at Mattel with my internship in the marketing department as Marketing assistant for barbie group for EMEA.
good,Gostei muito de esercer minha função nessa empresa pois nao encontrei dificuldades apenas ganhei mais experiencia e saudades de la.
good,"Só cumprir com a palavra, onde o q disser, deve ser cumprido"
good,This job is cool but you got to have a good attitude bout getting the task done ..its a fun work place dealing with all the new toys ..they sometimes have a cater truck comes and feed the employees for free for all the hard work they or we have put in..
good,"Loved working for Mattel, but long term could be an issue with living in LA and with how poor the company has done financially in recent years. If they can get back on track, they will be an amazing company to work for yet again."
good,"In my exsperience this company has been amazing. Really responsive, fair and friendly. The job has been fun. Very hard work but rewarding. Can work from home fitting around my schedule. Fair pay. Only issue I had was recent when I asked about my freelance position and I had no replies from the new team which meant I was shut out of more work opportunity. ( if the new team would stop ignoring me then I would have gladly given this a 5*). The job isn't a secure wage in terms of freelance as it only comes when the company needs you sadly."
good,It has a great sense of people always having a smile and happy to see everyone. It does get hard at the end of the day but it is great when you have company while getting the trolleys.
good,I like working at Mattel. Its a fun place to work at. Everybody gets along and makes the time you are here more enjoyable. Hardest park of the job is during peak season long hours.
good,Great company and culture. However the toy industry is not what it used to be.  Mattel needs to change to the new wave business to get back to the glory days.
good,"I loved the job, sincerely I did, but there were some problems with management that really got in the way. Multiple people during my time there had to leave because of the management style that was in place, but no one seemed to be willing to change. I would bring up team member concerns, and they were often ignored. That was the only issue we seemed to have as a collective."
good,"Great management, good work environment, excellent opportunity for advancement good training and policies for work, we were provided with tools and documents to perform the job efficiently."
good,"Very fun job, good money, but very hard to make job permanent. Seasonal employment is about the only time Mattel hires so if you wanted to make this permanent i would advise looking for another job."
good,"8-10 hour shifts"
good,"Being a merchandiser for Mattel is great. The hours are flexible and I'm able to work while my children are in school and pick them up.   The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people, working with the management and seeing all the new items that come through."
good,"Mattel was a great company; they were innovative, contemporary, aligned and were growing. Always an opportunity to advance and you were rewarded for your efforts."
good,a top company to work for; great leadership and top talent attracted; hard work pays off; must perform but it is rewarded; very fast paced environment.
good,"I start my day by opening my calendar so that i know when i have meetings and how will manage my workload best. I start the day with my 1:1's (with distributors, retailers, etc) and focus on offcie work from lunch onwards. The hardest part of my job is managing 3rd parties that are in various countries around the world (UAE, Israel, etc) as there are cultural differences in terms of work methodology that need to be overcome. The most pleasant part of my day is working closely with my colleagues as we have high team spirit andexpertise, which makes most meetings productive and fun at the same time."
good,This place is not enough money. And I feel that the company treats us different vs the people that is in the corporate office. Also they do not pay us enough money for the work we do.
good,"Uma empresa agradável, com uma gestão jovem e justa, uma cultura onde a preocupação com os funcionários é um dos objetivos principais."
good,"Fue un placer formar parte de esta empresa."

good,I enjoyed working at Mattel. I started off on the weekends and eventually became full time. We would always have fun events at the job site.

good,"Company is going through revenue issues so there is a high turnover of management.   "
good,"Fast paced, energetic, and extremely busy.  Management is extremely busy which does not allow for clear direction or feedback, which makes the job difficult.  Co-workers are extremely friendly."

good,"A empresa Mattel e grande por si so, porem acho que eles exigia de mais do funcionário e não davam uma prospecção melhor para seus empregados. mais efim acredito que toda empresa tem seus pros e contras e Mattel não foge desse padrão comercial de empresas."
good,It's a great company to work for. It has great benefits. There's a lot of great people. It's a fast paced warehouse and you get lost of training
good,"Llegar presentarte con la encargada del departamento y pedirle las prioridades del dia, llevarlas a cabo si hay cambios de precio señalizarlos con las nuevas banderas o etiquetas surtir muebles cariados, reacomodar si es requerido, montar exhibiciones como cabeceras, totem, muebles de carga. exhibir la publicidad si es que falta en piso de ventas limpiar. y por ultimo pedir la supervicion del encargado del departamento para ajustar loqueposiblemente le haga falta a la tienda o a la mercancia y concluir con tu dia de trabajo."

Always helpful and quick to join in your troubles to get the job done. My co-workers were all dedicated and sharp when it came to product and customer service. The hardest part and most enjoyable part was pleasing the customers and large charity holders.

good,I like the variety of work and never knowing what task I am asked to take on next.
good,"Environnement international et multiculturel"

good,The warehouse position at Mattel provided suitable work conditions for work that was strenuous by nature. The co-workers were friendly and cooperative.
good,"Wonderful place to work, hard not to crack a smile when discussing toys. Management was terrible when I was there, (2000-2004) but I hear that it has changed in the present day. There are many perks, including on-site day care, on-site gym, healthy cafeteria, credit union, nice neighborhood close to freeways, and half day Fridays all year. They tend to use a lot of freelancers instead of employees to keep costs down, so getting a paid job here with benefits is difficult to get and you are extremely lucky if you get one!"

good,"Ambiente informal, mercado divertido y relajado, quizá pequeño."
good,Me gusta mucho mi trabajo pero hay mucha preferencia con los empledos. Es triste por que todos somos iguales y trabajamos por que lo nesecitamos.😪

good,You learn how to be a team player and work along side with many other people to get the job done.The hardest part of the job for me was the hours because I went to school also full time.
good,"Fue una experiencia muy divertida en la cual aprendí muchísimas cosas como trabajar en equipo, a estar al pendiente de los juguetes que no faltara ninguno, realmente fue un empleo en el cual aprendí mucho. La parte mas difícil puede ser el trabajar muchas horas de pie. Me gusto mucho el trato que me dio cada una de las personas de la empresa."
good,"fast passed using different machines order picking navigating the warehouse safely not damaging product."
good,"Anything that was returned to Walmart's in the area was brought to a warehouse an sorted into damaged and resaleable. Matel sorted there own returns so they could also determine safety issues with their product. My job was mostly reading return slips, putting batteries in toys, testing all thier functions, documenting any problems or concerns, and sorting the good from the bad."
good,Its was a great job it was unorganized but it was still a great job i would label the toys and pack them pack inside the box and tape them up and would wrap toys in plastic bags

good,"Foi a primeira empresa que trabalhei, nao tinha experiencias na area de vendas. Foi onde aprendi tudo que sei sobre vendas . Aprendi a vender , comunicar ,trabalhar em equipe. A parte que gostei foi em poder instruir os clientes sobre cada informação dos brinquedos. A parte ruim foi em nao poder ficar na empresa, por conta de carga horaria ."
good,"Working at Mattel gave me many opportunities to work on premiere toy brands. Working on Hot Wheels and Barbie, and being able to impact their online marketing was truly rewarding. I learned how to work in a corporate environment and create innovative digital strategies for our brands as well as oversee the execution. I work on a daily basis with multiple internal stakeholders as well as external vendors to ensure our brand values, identity and vision is seamless across all of our platforms. My coworkers are young, fun and energetic and we all have a team mentality and collaborate really well together. The hardest part of the job was trying to make our brands culturally relevant and increase our social currency when working in such a strict corporate model. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to impact the way that people view the brands in the digital front."
good,"Ir para loja destinada, Ver quais produtos estão faltando na Pratilheiras e em seguida pegar os produtos em faltas no deposito colocar preço e organizar nas pratilheiras."

good,A Líder da equipe é uma pessoa super gente boa e ajudava no que era preciso em relação ao trabalho. Os colegas de trabalho também são pessoas incríveis. A parte mais agradável era abastecer os os brinquedos e manter tudo lindo. E aprendi muito em pouco tempo porque parece ser simples só abastecer os produtos nas gôndolas mais na realidade tudo tem sua forma de abastecer seu layout.
good,Great working environment and great since of team work. Definitely learned every aspect of print production and how to output files for highest print quality. Work with assets for different licensed products. It can be a little labor intensive when we have to lam and mount on different substrates.
good,"Una de las mejores empresas para trabajar. Localmente el clima laboral era muy bueno, el staff, compañeros de trabajo y el rubro juguetes lo hacía mas divertido."
good,"There's always a since of accomplishment when working for Mattel Corp. You get good hours, stock shelves and makes displays of your own creation. And once your work is done and your product has been pushed, it give you the feel of confidence that you need to go on to the next day."
good,The toy industry is a fun place to be... however as jobs moved over-seas... not as much fun...

good,I enjoyed dealing with people of different cultures and positions within the company. I learned that you can work and have fun at doing what you like best.

good,"I worked casually at mattel, only a handful of hours per year, so I cant really say much here."

good,"trabajo genial"
good,"Friendly environment"
good,A typical day at Mattel for me I would input information into a computer to control a machinery  to create the perfect cut of a sample display toy box.
good,"My typical day always began early."
good,This was a truly great job.  The manager I worked for was exceptional and this was a fun assignment.  The only down side was that it was a seasonal position so it did not last.
good,"scheduling packaging products"
good,"Worked with a BIG co. I enjoyed working at Mattel, great culture. It was like getting your Master in Packaging Design and international communication. Worked with China for printing and production and Photographers creating fabulously fun photo shoots. Hiring talent and sketching layouts to creating mock up packages for toy fair or vendor shows."
good,"aprendi a manejar personas jefes, compañeros, producto, publicidad, a ponerme retos y lograrlos con la ayuda de los compañeros"
good,"Purtroppo nel giugno del 2008 l'Amministratore andò via e gli americani non vollero rimpiazzarlo, poi a ottobre ci fu questa benedetta crisi e purtroppo ci furono dei tagli"
good,I enjoyed my entire 4 years at Mattel.  I worked out of the Fisher-Price office in East Aurora. There were a lot of long termers  there and all of them were strong and confident employees.  They were always willing to help and it was probably the most satisfying work experience I ever had.  There was quite a bit of outsourcing when I was there but I understood the reason as it was explained quite clearly.  It did lead to some disruption but all in all the remaining teams adapted well.
good,This company has various positions something for everyone. They promote from with in. Managers are caring and provide everyone with the tools and support you need to do your job.
good,Seasonal employment only. Employees treated very nicely. Would be nice if they had opportunities that were more than just seasonal. Management is very nice. Overall a very nice place to work
good,I loved working for Mattel.  The hardest part of the job was climbing ladders to the top of the stockroom and pulling down large boxes but that really only happens during the holidays.
good,Easy going yet productive job with opportunity to advance with proper motivation. Would recommend to anyone. Amazing supervisors and managers everyone is very helpful
good,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Mattel. The hardest part of this job has been consoling my team and our customers about the store's closing. The most enjoyable aspect to being a Mattel company has been the freedom this unique retail environment provided. There were no plano-grams, we were free to merchandise using common sense and creativity. The work life balance was unlike anything I had ever experienced in retail before. The hours of operation allowed for family time and the benefits were outstanding. Being the only Manager on duty during customer facing hours every day really taught me how  to ""captain my own ship"". My time spent at Mattel has been extremely rewarding."
good,"To be a billion dollar company, it feels like working for a 'mom and pop' organization. Management in Retail Service is so incredibly humane, family-focused and positive. Corporate America could take a lesson from Barbie and Ken!! The pay is generous compared to similar positions, and even as a part-timer there is a 401K. Only downsides are limited hours and the 'big push' comes at Christmas when everybody would rather NOT be working. Also, if you are looking to advance, not really any realistic opportunity. Pretty physical, but otherwise enjoyable work. Excellent communication within the department. I am proud to tell people I work for Mattel."
good,Pretty easy and fun place to work at with all the toys around. Annual picnic is fun since you get free food and just get to see al the fun games and cars they have placed outside for employees. Some days can be slow with not much to do but then come the holiday specials and the place gets packed.
good,If you like traveling for work this is for you. Great hours and very flexible. Good team and great management as well. They always checked on you and if you needed help they went to you.
good,"Awesome for creative people, bad for those looking for job security.  Lots of holidays, lots of fun activities, day care, gym, laundry shop, free evaluation toys"
good,"I worked seasonal and the key is team work and great training. I wish I was still there but moved away from them.  "
good,"-Great culture"
good,"Días de trabajo intensos con mucha carga laboral, pero siempre se disfruta."
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo, apoyo entre algunos compañeros del equipó, aprendí a compartir mas con mis compañeros, y demas integrantes de grupo, que entraban en temporadas de  apoyo , lo que consideré un poco difícil realizar el montaje de un anexo de juguete-ria en un día y medio, me gusto mucho el ambiente de trabajo realizar excibiciones,conocer lo nuevo que llega por cada temporada"
good,"The greatest CIO ever.  Best place for IT professionals to work for  those who deliver and are aligned.  IT Leadership team works daily against great pressure and limitations and exceed daily.  "

good,"Uma equipe ótima de trabalhar, supervisor e chefe super gente fina,uma pena que o serviço era temporário,mais amei ter essa oportunidade de trabalhar com a mattel..."
good,Mattel is an amazing place to wok. Management  really makes it and enjoyable experience. Store open at 10am and closes at 6pm you're normally out by 630pm. The holidays and the customers make the days fly by.. Charity program is the best!!
good,en lo que a mi respecta es una empresa con mucha ética y organización
good,"I had a great career at Mattel as a doll designer. I quit my job to stay at home with my children, but that is probably the only reason I would have left. I loved what I did."
good,Mattel is a great place to learn new skills and advance in your career. You work hard but are paid well. The creative work and the resources you have to create products is amazing! Plus the skilled people at Mattel are great to work with and learn from. If you want to know the toy industry then work at Mattel!
good,"Compartilhei dias de muita agitação e trabalho, partilhando de muito conhecimento pessoal e profissional. Empresa com gestores jovens com muitos planos desafiadores. O mais agradável era flexibilidade de horário e interação com a equipe para o desenvolvimento dos projetos."
good,me parece que es muy solidaria y muy facil de promocionar sin problema
good,The environment and culture at Mattel is high level.  The company offered employees challenges to conquer for growth and provides excellent benefits for a well-balanced life.
good,"I had an amazing time at Mattel.  My supervisor and my employee activities, such as my membership in the company-sponsored Mattel Toastmasters club, helped me to grow tremendously as a professional.  During my single mother years especially I always felt supported in putting my family first. "
good,"Literally the best time of my life was working for Mattel. I was quickly picked up as the premier vehicle designer for entertainment brands and internal intellectual property development. I had a great time in the 5 years I worked on the Hot Wheels brand. My team was responsible for creating the hit animated series 'Battle Force 5'. We were nominated for an Emmy award and took home the Gemini Award for 'Best Animated Series' in 2011. I can't say enough about the amazing people and great connections you can make through working at Mattel. I learned a great deal about working with licensors, inventing toy mechanisms, patenting ideas, sketching, rendering, designing play patterns and most of all HAVING FUN AT WORK! I would highly recommend working at Mattel either very early or very late in your career, based on the corporate structure and culture Mattel prides itself in developing."
good,"I gained advanced Excel skills, recruitment skills and project management.  My co-workers were great to work with and each role seemed to merge in well with other roles in terms of staff involvement."
good,In merchandising everyday could be different! It is the excitement of knowing the work is not boring. What you do for one is completely different from the other. First and most important is to be organized. Have all data and reports ready prior to actual store visit. Since we have information that needs to be pass along to both management and employees . Must sign in and greet store personnel and direct myself to the person incharge and discuss my work plan for the day. I also need to ask if there is no special tasks that they would like done as long as it relates to Mattel. Check Planograms have all my equipment on hand and my tools. Especially when its a visit in which displays need to be set or if I have displays which need maintenance. Once all my top Priorties are done if time allows I check if addition inventory is able to fill home locations or Make any addition displays. Once I finish I do My schedule survey for my corresponding account and submit. I discuss with dept. supervisor what I did and sign out. When I get home I sit and log on and submit all my reports for the stores I worked and syn and do My e-time. Finally I review My email and check My work schedule for the following day or call.
good,"Llegar a la linea a iniciar a ensamblar jugetes, era divertido todos eramos un equipo nos apoyabamos unos a otros aprendi todo lo mas indispensable ahi desde armar una caja asta estar en una maquina , atornillar etcc...la parte mas dificil fue renunciar x otro trabajo lo cual no funciono, y pues del trabajo me gusto todo ambiente , el trato de los jefes directos, salario comedor no tengo quejas."

good,"High peaks and low peaks therefore very fair in salary.  Fun environment and job was not too difficult but demanding at times. During low peaks had a great work/family balance. Fridays you only worked half days and that made it easier for the long commute.  "
good,Really enjoyed my time with mattel.very easy people to get along with an they cared about there employee..like that we were able to get overtime an work week ends
good,"Realmente disfrute mi experiencia laboral en Mattel, me gusta mucho el producto y aprendí sobre reglamentos técnicos y sistemas de gestión de calidad."
good,My review of Mattel honestly can't give much of a review i was young and just an intern it was alright seemed better if you had a creative job otherwise kind of boring office enviroment. why are you forcing me to do this anyway goodbye

good,"Duty lasts from 9am to 6pm"
good,"Fun place to work"

When I first started I was blown away by the constant changing scenery. Giant hot wheel cars, Disney displays, and movie props lined the halls. It was a very fun environment and I immediately was asked what I was interested in doing. They really focus in on your potential as a professional in your field or being a manager in your field. It was a very proactive environment. They also let me expand my knowledge depending on what I was interested in. I learned a lot from the graphic designers I worked with because I wanted to know both sides of the packaging department."

Free coffee, tea, hot cocoa, etc. was available, as well as Starbucks for purchase in the cafeteria.  A great varied lunch service was provided in the cafeteria with emphasis on healthy eating.  I started as an administrative assistant but over time learned and grew to the point where I was able to assist in the purchase of a new, more functional database for the corporate real estate department!  Management takes a real interest in the development of talent within the corporation.  I always worked well with my co-workers and team work is a serious part of the culture there.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up!  We were so busy and multi-tasking all the time, but the challenges met were worthwhile.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that it is a toy maker!  It was fun to work there and occasionally glimpse new toys in prototype, and the company picnics were a blast!"
