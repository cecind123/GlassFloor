rating,review
bad,The most  of the work done offshore.  Giving unnecessary  pressure to  onshore workers by  limited guideline and short deadlines.  Always face management budget pressure. Bilingual  language speaking company.
bad,Worst company I have ever worked for. Really nothing good to say except some of the products actually work. Management has no clue how to manage or how to market the products. Having experience here means nothing unless you are a VP.
bad,You will not feel secured in this organization even if you have invested 10-15 years in this organization. This company is a great example of a company which is listed on NASDAQ though it is a CMMI level 0.5 company. Poor processes and management
bad,"In terms of growth, I see very less opportunities and the work life balance is not good as well as a contractor. I would strongly encourage people to have a managerial feedback system over there. So that employee can have better place to work."
bad,The hours were flexible I worked three 12 hour days. The former SVP was fantastic but some of the other Department Managers were punishing and unsupportive.
bad,"low pay, duties constantly changing. everyone hated it there but it was the highest paying job at 8.75 an hour. call centers take your soul away and never give it back"
bad,"Never worked for this company; its predecessor was Qualfon's oversight of Lifelock account. "
bad,"It's sad because when I first started at Symantec I loved it there. I mean to the point of ""I really get to do this for a living?""  "
bad,"Came on board when the company when it was known as VERITAS, an excellent entity with flawless support and service, then came Symantec and oh boy did everything go down hill. If you are applying for the Global HUB position in Lake Mary FL. The associate manager who is still there, has to be the WORST manager to have ever walked this earth. Micro manage, no raises, terrible training, you will get yelled at in front of everyone, and HR will not support you, no matter how bad things get. BEWARE!!!! Only reason I lasted so long was tuition reimbursement and a 3rd shift that allowed me to get away from management for years, l shut my mouth until it was time to leave, then I let them have it..jejeje..felt good too."
bad,"Very busy everyday, there is no lean time.  Since I started in 2018  I have not been able to go on vacation. They abused my kindness and hardwork."
bad,"Don't expect a commitment from Symantec to you as an employee or a customer... unless you're making them money.  Be prepared to see more restructuring and your job go overseas.  Then, the shareholders and CEO can have a 2nd yacht :)"
bad,"This is one of those places where all anyone cares about is Process and has completely lost sight of the fact that processes are meant to  get things done."
bad,Nothing much to write about. bad experience here
bad,Terrible in just about every way. No offices. Terrible equipment. Third rate management that is not committed. Employees including the most senior management view it as a way station. Benefits are not bad. Compensation is market or slightly below.
bad,"Management plays favorites, lacks strategic thinking, manages in a very old school style and focuses on petty items.  Turnover of leaders is frequent."
bad,"Après de nombreuses années de loyauté et de dur labeur "
bad,"I would not recommend it.  They will take what they can from you, not compensate you for it, and leave you by the side of the road.  If you wish to pound your head against a wall, please join up."
bad,"Human Resources has gone through several changes in the last year and current leadership is not in trust worthy. "
bad,"Symantec is a typical large company, management doesn't have a clue what they are doing, RIFs (Reduction in Force) or layoffs seem to come around every few years when the sales numbers aren't met, outsourcing to third party vendors in India is the new norm. If you get hired on your pay and benefits aren't bad but enjoy them because the only way you will ever get a raise is if you leave the company and come back in a new position!, Supervisors and direct managers try and make changes but upper management stops that cold, the last CEO before this one tried to make changes for the lowest workers and tried to insource departments but was fired because of it. I have always said, Symantec hires great employees and then craps on them, my co-workers were some of the best people I have worked with but nobody is very happy in their jobs, I would say that 75% of them would leave the company if there were equivalent jobs available in the local area. With the split to Veritas the job situation is up in the air, everyone knows that Veritas will be sold after the split is finalized but no one knows if the Springfield site will be kept open. Unless your desperate for a job in this area I would NOT recommend working here"
bad,Poor company to work for with no work life balance.  Management is inexperienced and flip flops so there is no steady direction.
bad,"Tasks are clear, but then operation stops you from doing any of them by telling you that we have to follow a policy they can't show you are tell you where to find it.  So you go back to your manager and they get disappointed you couldn't do the task.  Finally, managers get involved and operations drones decide it is ok to do it now that you have wasted 10 days to get the job done."
bad,I liked my role but at first it seems management style is not micro management but as time went they did micro manage everything. I like my co-workers.
bad,1. An average day consists of inbound customer support calls helping clients and new customer for LifeLock.
bad,"We were the true global leader in enterprise security software, with great people and a great culture. However, everything went south when the company was sold off several months ago. Severe job cuts, severely reduced perks and no more culture (unless minimalist and flat can be called a company culture, too). The remaining jobs went from fab to ones that one would not wish upon one's worst enemy, resulting in the aforementioned great people leaving in droves."
bad,"Managers usually have been promoted to the position because good and competent people left. "
bad,Sad shadow of it's former self - new management was all about who was from Blue Coat (as they all were) and who was not.  This very cloistered view lead to bad decisions but ensured their bonus payout was met.  Company stuck in old tech and approaches.
bad,"The culture and close-knit work environment was destroyed by greed and the outsourcing of the SOC."
bad,"Bad Management and HR policies"
bad,"I have been with Symantec for a while, starting in the John Thompson era. In the beginning the company and the culture were fantastic. Over the years, the company has degraded to nothing more than a cash funnel for an inept board of directors."
bad,"It's been 2 years; yet the stock is flat and the Blue Coat leadership team is STILL there.  "
bad,"Symantec seems to focus so much on the top line of the balance sheet that the products that it turns out seem to deteriorate over time.  That coupled with cost-cutting, support is strapped for resources, passing along poor service to the customer."
bad,"I worked at Lifelock for over 3 years and when I first started they had everything going for them. They treated employees like they were really special and even though they were experiencing high growth they attempted to maintain high employee satisfaction. "
bad,Office Politics and unprofessional coworkers. Lacks direction. CEO keeps changing. Managers are non technical. Good people leaving every now and then.
bad,Symantec is good company but my manager had a lot of issues. They did not have much of a business case to establish their consulting arm. Could have worked well if properly organized.
bad,"I have worked at Symantec for 8 months and really enjoyed it, I hoped to get on with the company full time, however that is not the case. Every job I applied to the process would be incredibly slow (sometimes 6 months before I heard a ""No"") and most times I felt I wasn't even considered for any position. Overall I applied to this company 42 times and only recieved 1 interview, of which I was never deemed the honor of a response, This is possibly the only company that would not respond after an interview, I would not apply to this company, or expect any type of response unless you really know someone well there."
bad,"Symantec was once upon a time a great place to work. Now the salary is good. They do not care about employees. No job security. There is a leadership change every year or two, and every time there is a change in leadership, they decide to lay off many of the most experienced staff. First your manager will be fired and hence you are always the the edge of loosing your job."
bad,Had to pick up the reins and get on and implement a more client focused strategy to regain confidence among UK resellers and distributors.
bad,Work Life balance is good but from last few years company is going through rough time as higher management is not stable and middle management is busy saving themselves.
bad,"If you like changes and minimal work-life balance then this is the place for you:  Management, Strategy and Focus are constantly changing."
bad,"A fairly young company considering it's an IT security organization."
bad,"My BU was transferred from another company, and we were never properly integrated into the company.  That has advantages and disadvantages.  "
bad,"extremely poor and lost remote  management,  promises which never delivered.  Products designed to failed so clients would end up using professional service with fees."
bad,It was a job that provided income but not much for career advancement. They do not value education and past experience. It can be an opportunity for growth if you fit into the good ole boy category. You have a lot of managers that have been with the company a long time that keep smart energetic people from rising into management and leadership areas.
bad,"Symantec used to be a great place to work. Then it went through a reboot a few years ago and lost its identity. So to fix it, it bought itself a management layer. Well, it bought Bluecoat and BC replaced all SYMC leaders with their own people, especially on the internet security side. Now all former SYMC leaders like myself are working elsewhere."
bad,"Pessoas mau humoradas e egoistas. Nao se cumprimentam. Aprendi a chegar ao escritorio, escolher uma baia e ali passar o resto do dia."
bad,"Very stressful, no collaboration, no management... I would not have recommended Symantec when I worked there. Perhaps it has changed but at my time it was very challenging."
bad,"Fast Paced day"
bad,"There were 3 CEOs in a 5 year period when i was there"
bad,"It is a political battleground. Continuous management change has left insecurity, loss of talent resulting company saddled with aging products."
bad,"Symantec currently rates very low job security wise. The Symantec -Veritas split and acquisition of Blue Coat have made things volatile and chaotic"
bad,"If you are not working for the latest company that they have acquired, watch your back.  Your job is headed to the cheapest place they can outsource it to."
bad,"i worked there after i left school it was a great job there would be around 8 people on each team we had to make computer softwar well m make the product up on a round table 2 of us sitting at the table making the product up it was great fun i loved that job one pack the product coming down the line shrinkwarap it then pack into a box then pack the pallet "
bad,It is a lot of work but it never seems like you are making progress.
bad,"The company is going through a lot of changes right now.  New CFO, CAO and CEO.  It is difficult to understand the direction that management is taking the Company."
bad,"Fast pace but repetitive role. You need to constantly check que Qs and also perform a number of other tasks at the same time."
bad,"I was a victim of a Symantec acquisition. They swooped in, bought our products, then proceeded to ruin them because they didn't know what to do with them or how to market them."
bad,I don't think my experience at Symantec is representative of what the company looks like today.  In my year in the organization there were a number of c-level changes which directly impacted my team's objectives and initiatives.
bad,"it was a typical call center job. low pay for high stress. management can make or break your experience here. you may stay because job culture is not bad but be warned the customers calling are not sweet little old ladies that lost their wallets, some of these clients are extremely angry and hostile. you will have your life threatened by these clients on a daily basis. if youve got thick skin, this may be the job for you."
bad,The company is now out of business.  There is nothing much else to write. It was fun while it lasted. The underlying technology was the basis for Carnivore.
bad,They just lay people off randomly. Doesnt matter if you are necessary or talented you will be laid off. If you are not laid off you will be expected to take on the responsibilities of those who were laid off and you will not be paid more.
bad,"Okay to start however there is no job stability."
bad,"If all you are looking for is a good salary, they pay well. Otherwise, this is not a company that inspires employees."
bad,"With the recent acquisition by Symantec, everyone who had knowledge and expertise was let go and replaced with very underqualified individuals or had their jobs outsourced to the Philippines or India. With their current projection to deliver identity/device based services to English speaking countries first leads to tons of unknowns. If Symantec/Lifelock keeps losing money like they have recently,  no hesitation will be taken into letting people go."
bad,"It started off as a great place to work but because they wanted to downsize, management decided to move the company out of state and just became a place that was no longer fun to work and it was just work as much as you can and no time to enjoy your work environment."
bad,"The Pro's: Great peer to peer relationships "
bad,"The place was a huge warehouse, with very, very little natural light showing throughout the building. Management  was not really managing and things were not running smoothly. Very disorganised."
bad,"HBS should do case study on this company. Amazing product, great talent, sky is the limit for grown and still company failed and breaking apart because of poor leadership and management."
bad,It was ok at first and then the company started going down hill. Leadership doesn't really care about employees. A lot of people have been let go and it is pretty concerning.
bad,"Symantec used to be a great to work for great bennies and leading edge software. Bad management and being beholden to stock holders to the point that they would can huge groups of people to make the the ""numbers"" look good. Moving support from Springfield where over 1000 techs did their job well and had vast amounts of knowledge and experience to Utah was a mistake. The techs there got less than 3 month of on the phone experience for products that typically take a year learn well has had a huge effect. This was terrible management and the worst part is they don't care."
bad,"Being in a business support role one is expected to take on the workload of others that get laid off. No career dialogue and advancement, management treats it as just a job for you"
bad,I enjoyed working at Symantec and did not intend to leave. Dealing with our customers was a rewarding but sometime frustrating experience. I would recmond them to someone looking for a job.
bad,Lots of internal problems.  Lack of proper leadership and communication from the Sr. Mgt team.  As with any large company there are better departments than others.
bad,"the most enjoyable part of the job"
bad,"Working for Symantec was always a precarious day to day affair where you would be praised one day and could be on the street the next. The 80/20 rule applies to the staff and colleagues.  Twenty percent great people and 80% climbers that have little commitment to anything but making themselves look better than the competition. "
bad,"Analyzing and troubleshooting/debugging the issue with the product. Automation, test planning, the hardest part of job is estimation for unknowns and most enjoyable part is to troubleshoot and debug and automate."
bad,"Symantec is a diverse company with market leading products. However, the culture is not innovative or trusting, which makes for a stagnant career or a constant fear of layoffs."
bad,Company has had leadership shake ups and growing pains from recent M&A.  Employees never know if they're going to be laid off or if their positions are safe.
bad,"In the 7 years that I had worked their, we had 4 CEO's.  Each had a different mission.  Layoffs were constant, never knew when your number was up.  Didn't matter if you were the top performer or not.  "
bad,Big software company where employees had little passion or enthusiasm.  Good products and savvy management which was trying but unsuccessful in creating a more positive and fun culture.  Its been a few years so perhaps its gotten better.
bad,"Lots of smart people, But management (from CEO down) is focused so much on cutting costs that good products are difficult to develop and teams end up overworked."
bad,"Symantec was a good company to work for up to about eight to ten years ago. For the last several years the company has been stale and unable to innovate and essentially survives off a few old cash cows."
bad,Highly paying organization with good work/ life balance. Leadership is having strategy challenges which is impacting the overall business.
bad,"Even with new executive leadership and management changes, Symantec continues to become more siloed, less efficient and less trusting. Company does have great salaries, benefits and job security."
bad,"A very good company, Good work culture, work-life balance. The biggest CON is they don't know what next. The company has been spiraling down for quite some time."
bad,"You can learn a lot at Symantec and enhance your tech stack repertoire. There are a lot of very bright people to learn from. "
bad,I honestly dont remember that much. But my boss was not a good match with me and she was laid off after a while. It was not a good match for me either .
bad,"I enjoyed the work as it was challenging and I learned a lot during my four years with Symantec. I also find the work schedule to be long, needing to support applications 24x7; making it difficult on work life balance. If you are single and are starting out, this is a great place for you. If you have a family, it will be difficult to manage."
bad,"Still continues to be one of the biggest names in the security but not sure of the future."
bad,"Managed QA and development resources for complex Compliance product. Unfortunately a new CEO came in and cut 1,000+ managers."
bad,It's an ok workplace but it depends on the department you work in.  Some departments you work the jobs of 5 different departments and only get paid to do one which is less than departments that get paid more to work one job.
bad,"This was culturally a great place to work with many motivated and creative team members. However, the constant layoffs and lack of vision from the upper management for my division made individual success difficult."
bad,They fire there employee very soon. Apart from that there is huge politics plays inside the management. Now there is no good team lead available. Negetive marking
bad,It was good to begin in security with a huge brand name like Symantec.
bad,"Get to love your email and 14 Hrs days! work hard play hard. Very focused on $$ performance, each year jobs are shed on the QT. Package is good."
bad,"Top 2 Focus Areas are – "
good,"There was alot of information to remember to assist the members.  Even thopugh we had the information on a separate computer in front of the customer service member, it was a challenge to find the information."
good,Starting the day and I couldn't wait for the end of the day. My team was depressed and moral was very low. The best part for working with this company was the vacation.
good,"job was a good job. environment was friendly. Upper management didn't have a clue how to run the company which made for very poor decisions made on our behalf. "
good,"Young leadership was in place based on personality not on competency.  Get the job done, without considering the process or other components that are important from a compliance or defendability standpoint."
good,"Symantec was always laying off due to the ever changing business environment. In the 3 years I was employed there, I witnessed 4 layoffs and essentially was affected."
good,This place is a great place to start your career if you are a paralegal or office assistant.
good,"Very rigid management style and very biased toward employee promotion based on religion, looks, etc.  They do not care if a team member is lagging behind or if someone is taking advantage until you report to HR.  Once report, HR is phenomenal!!!"
good,"There is always uncertainty about job since I joined, lot of internal politics which is just helping people who knows taking credit of other's work smartly. Company is taken over and now there are major layoffs"
good,"Working at Symantec had many challenges , including both management and employee turnover . Job security was low and outsourcing and layoffs high. Eventually leading to the closure of the Springfield location"
good,"there are rules for what proper dress code is, so when a manager doesn't tell an agent to go change because there is t shirt supporting smoking on it and we are a drug and ahocoal free company... And when managemnent is letting the ""resources"" getting away with doing nothing and not actually helping other when needed its crazy"
good,"I worked at Symantec for 6 years and though the individual people are amazing, the culture leaves much to be desired. The work/life balance is non-existent and the management structure changes so often it's impossible for teams to function effectively."
good,"Although many employees have been there awhile and it used to be a great place to work, thrive, develop and contribute, sadly it is not fulfilling anymore. Too many big changes too quickly (CEOs, executives, re-orgs, focus) make it almost impossible to focus and get things started and finished."
good,"*I have a checklist for the daily tasks that I made up myself. Other unforeseeable tasks that pop up throughout the day are added to it. Before I call it a day, I double check the list to make sure that everything is done. "
good,"The company is down sizing.  They plan to RIF more than 2000 positions, so this is not a good time to join."
good,Board of directors struggles to find proper management and put it in place.  High turn over of senior management keeps the company in a state of turmoil
good,"•	Worked in different domains in my 16 years of career, yet I feel, I am new to the technology."
good,"With the split into two companies, there is confusion and lack of direction.  A typical work day is stressful and difficult to balance."
good,"A lot of change within executive leadership team and overall company strategy. Many executives have left the company, they are now on their 3rd CEO in 3 years. Company is splitting into two organizations and lots of good talent lost and uncertainty of future. "
good,"Many tasks are duplicated amongst different FP&A functional teams and there are many opportunities to implement process improvements. The systems add inefficiencies to our day-to-day reporting and make it difficult to ensure we are providing accurate information to our business partners. Recognition and promotion within the organization is not a standard practice, it is preferred to hire external candidates instead of rewarding those who are deserving of promotions. Total compensation is not up to par compared to industry standards and bonuses are only available for Sr. Managers and above."
good,"• Provided customer support via telephone, chat support, and email correspondence."
good,This position involved a lot of computer work and coordination among global partners.
good,Smart hard working people.
good,Gerência não reconhecia o esforço do funcionário e até mesmo do trabalho.
good,"This is a good place to work if you're not looking for any advancement. I became an employee as the result of an acquisition. Acquired company employees tend to get lost in the fray, and are deemed ""specialists"". They have a history of wiping out specialist groups at the beginning of each fiscal year."
good,"Large company, but easy to get lost in the mix. Great place to"
good,boa experiencia contudo cultura fraca e pouca transparencia
good,"The changes in Symantec were always something to get excited about until Executive Management did not follow through, which was the norm.  We changed so much so frequently that it impaired the ability to execute programs."
good,"The company is not doing very well"
good,"Not a hard company to work at, but also company that doesn't have a bright future.  Management was mediocre and company was large enough to have plenty of office politics that plagued the company's prospect.  The job does pay well enough to cover the bills."
good,"A great mix of assignments across a number of different solution spaces (PC, hosted and services).  Decision making is largely opaque where you spend more time wondering whether you would have a job in a month, rather than how to deliver on this month's assignments.  What your experience was, depending 75% on your manager."
good,"Culture of productivity! what?! you didn't perform 110% better than last quarter?! For shame. I will say there are opportunities to learn, but management can be limiting."
good,"Company has been in a continuous organizational change mode. Priorities are ever changing, with very little insight from leadership. They do not promote from within."
good,"Company issue was the inability of the company to fully and successfully implement the acquisition of Veritas. This led to difficulty in branding the company, its vision and execution. There were too many responsibilities in selling the whole portfolio."
good,It is a great workplace to be for anyone who wishes to pursue cyber security. They have very niche products and a leader in their own class. You would love it when you get the hang of the work
good,"With all of the changes over the past few years, I feel we have lost leadership.  I think overtime the company will get back on track but for now the company lacks leadership."
good,"Excellent Organization"
good,"I was a employee at Symantec Corp for over 11 years in the enterprise support division.  During my career I did troubleshooting for a wide range of enterprise security products including Data Loss Prevention.  The products were challenging to learn, but training was not always sufficient.  Internal processes and tools could have been improved and did not allow me to provide the best customer experience possible. "
good,J'ai intégré SOCITECH en 2010. Je côtoyais les seniors en vue d'apprendre. Durant 6 mois j'ai bénéficié des conseils et des expériences des seniors. Cela m'a permis de me forger une personnalité.
good,"Good work/life balance and flexibility"
good,"Symantec has pushed me beyond what I thought i was capable of doing.  I learned more techologies faster than any other company.  If learning is your goal, Symantec is the company for you to learn and push yourself."
good,Benefits are good that the company provides but in terms of advancement unless you are located in the Corporate HQ its not going to happen. The good thing about working in a fortune 500 is that yo learn to understand how slow things move because of all the processes. I would like to see the company focus more on internal employees and managers encourage their direct reports to work together in sharing information and collaborate so the knowledge can be spread across the teams in each department group which would lighten the load on each team members.
good,"The sales team is highly driven by numbers. Everyone is trying to achieve targets by hook or crook, zero integrity. Too many acquisitions leading to changes in management and teams."
good,"No comments. The company was going through changes in leadership, so I am not wanting to review at this time. It is not fair to Symantec to rate the company. I am sure it's different now."
good,"The first few years were great, then with CEO changes the company shifted focus to the short term gains. High rift rate because of this."
good,"QA dept was divided into by topics to test.  They were judged on the  ""bugs""they discovered.  Most imortant - they were judged by the severity of the bug rather than the number of bugs.  This was a driving factor that encouraged the teams to look deeper and provide quality feedback to the engineering teams."
good,"Symantec's culture was once something that drove high employee retention and satisfaction. Over the last 8 years, the company has had 5 different CEOs and leadership teams. With each change, the culture has diminished. The most recent leadership change has brought on a more rapid deterioration of what's left."
good,"At Symantec, your experience depends very much on who you know.  But there has been som much change that the right people to know are ever shifting.  The company is pretty average in terms of compensation and benefits.  The CEO is good, but all of the VPs are extremely territorial and seem to be adversarial.  The company is bloated with people who do not add value.  But the company is positioned to do some very cool things in the market, and has a lot of potential for the future."
good,While employed here I had a tough time being able to respect management staff as they where very snobby and felt above lower level employees. They felt they could talk to employees any way they wanted. Horrible environment to work in .
good,"Assist Executive Management with creation and driving revenue opportunities for a $400m yearly P&L by managing the overall business partnership, development, execution, cross-functional coordination, and GTM of the Symantec business for our GSI/Managed Channel Partners."
good,I held several positions with the company and learned quite a bit about cyber security.  I liked the work in all of the capacities.  My co-workers were great teams to be on.
good,"Working at Symantec was an overall great experience! I obtained skills I had not had, prior to working there. The culture is great! Very friendly people! The hardest part of the job was the lack of communication on the ever changing compensation. I really enjoyed the people and the new skills I obtained while there. I loved the job challenges and learned a lot about myself, including how well I am able to adapt in an ever changing work environment!"
good,"Prior to Bluecoat takeover, was not sales driven; very formal and process driven."
good,"- Good place to work for 4 yrs. "
good,"A typical day at work. Really good group to work with, good work/life balance, option to work from home once a week. Everyone is helpful and attentive."
good,There's a lot to learn and a lot to do. There are opportunities but you have to work hard for them in order to thrive. Employees aren't the  #1 priority for this company and it shows.
good,There was a lot of insecurity due to the acquisition by Symantec. Not a good culture and very rough on the integration between both work teams.
good,Symantec is a flexible workplace that allows for alternate working shifts.  They allow you to balance your work life with your home and family life.
good,"good team work"
good,"no comment, normal day of work and work at home ability. good benifits"
good,"Day to day activity to maintain existing database systems."
good,"It was a really nice job, getting to work when I wanted, and all they cared about is that I did my work.  My co-workers were all really awesome.  I can't really say the same about the management.  After a few months of working there, they cut hours that we were able to schedule.  Then they cut a bunch of my co-workers from the team.  Then a further cut in hours that we could schedule.  Finally they just stopped paying us.  I quit after I didn't receive one months in pay checks."
good,A fair place to work from a technology perspective. Made many acquisitions over the years that were not properly integrated in a timely fashion. Created naming confusion over product families and further diminished the ability to make Symantec a brand of its own over the years. Struggling today to find its new identity.
good,THe company needs to invest for the future rather than milk the cash cow products indefinitely. It also needs to learn how to incubate new products or take an alternative approach to entering new businesses - by acquiring going concerns and building around them.
good,possibilita' di crescita in EMEA
good,Symantec was a good place to run numerous projects and work with many knowledgeable capable team members.  I worked on a new platform that was exciting and helped influence the growth of the platform.
good,Company management preferred acquiring technology products instead of building or innovating in house.   Worked on four different acquired products with innovation being integrating features instead of adding new products.
good,Management needs more structure but other then that great place to work! The benefits are great and the unlimited time off ( not really). The training for technical support needs a lot of work.
good,Changing priorities and work life balance is tough. Finance team is undergoing transition in which roles are being moved to lower cost locations. Salary is competitive
good,"Symantec has some amazing security technology to work on."
good,"Management needs improvements."
good,"Symantec was my first foray into Information Technology, back in 2011, and it was a leap of faith that I do not regret! The company had a 5000+ strong sales force and we were put through an intense training at Mountainview in California. I met some amazing folks and still speak with some of them to this day. For this position, we were given a structured territory and expected to address all existing/upcoming renewals as well as taking inquiries from partners and their clients through the channel. We had regularly-scheduled one-on-ones with our manager in order to track our progress and were provided with suggestions on how to improve which was very helpful and appreciated. I learned how to independently pull conversations together using my technical pre-sales resources, who were quite busy with their enterprise-level deals, but were alsway willing to lend a helping hand so that we could provide accurate and timely answers to our small and medium business clients. I really enjoyed the bi-weekly sales meetings with the larger team (SMB, mid market and ENT) which usually started off with our country manager bringing the energy to the room and getting us all excited for the following couple of weeks. Q & A allowed us to ask him directly what might be on the agenda in terms of changes or product development, and I found that portion to be very revealing and of great value. What I found quite difficult to accept was the limitations on my smaller team in capping of the opportunities we could address ourselves, as anything over a certain threshold in revenue would have to be passed"
good,"People here at all management levels were for the most part friendly and helpful."
good,"Big Yellow box of support for numerous products.  Learn a ton, had some fun, enjoyed the work but was plagued by an incredibly poor manager.  Onward to the next job."
good,"Micro-managed, top leadership constantly changing, impatient and directionless. Without good top down leadership middle managers are left trying to justify their department constantly in the face of shrinking budgets."
good,"My time at Symantec is very analogous to the Tech company Peter worked for in the movie, ""Office Space.""  People show up, do their job and then leave. It's pretty vanilla, and there's nothing wrong with that."
good,"I will admit that I like my new manager more than some I have reported to here, I'm learning that I don't like being a little fish in a big ocean. I like being in the pond, better opportunity to bond and have a more manageable circle. Work life balance depends on your team and work load. I do enjoy my team, but always find in my role I am bored."
good,Enjoyed working with a lot of great people. Believe Symantec is on the right course  with the acquisition of Blue Coat. A lot of former Blue Coat management now in place at Symantec.
good,"One day everything is great , the next day your subtly being managed out - under the guise of 'everyone should know how to do everyone else's job'  - and then you get a call with the managerspeak 'I want to share with you some important company news... ' "
good,A fast paced environment with plenty of twists and turns along the path. Good work environment and solid people to work with. The technology is making progress with moving to the cloud.
good,"Too much bureaucracy; constant re-organization placing you in a position to start over, drop projects, add new ones, rebuild relationship with new manager.  Ongoing reduction in force adds more responsibility to you which leads to unhealthy work/life balance.  Too many layers."
good,Company having good culture.Good fascility with good team coordination.I have learned lot while working with Symantec.Learn team work with OAF component
good,"I was employed at Symantec Corporation for almost 5 years.  During that time the management team revolved and changed often.  Lay-off''s became a huge issue and jobs were outsourced to India. "
good,"It's a great organization however, due to its acquisitions and mergers the company tends to change its management strategies which may affect the possibly affect its strategies for the Shared Services."
good,A great opportunity to provide solutions for large enterprise customers using a variety of solutions. Roles are typically very independent so you have to set your own direction
good,Symantec is a typical large corporation that has some really good people but doesn't really show that they care about their employees
good,long hours but comp is pay.  A management team trying hard to remove the revolving door of in and out quickly - likely to settle down in 2016.
good,"I enjoyed the company. I had mostly good directing managers that I worked for and a GREAT working environment. I miss the friendships of my friends and the managers there. I am, and would consider maybe going back to work there."
good,"Management culture is unstable at best."
good,Symantec is a good company which offers powerful security software. Very good trainings are offered for new employees before they start working.
good,"Learned a lot regarding how archiving worked, enjoyed working with the team I worked with.  Co-workers were very hard working and worked as a team.  The most frustrating pat of the job was when an issue with the client was beyond our control and would take several days to be resolved."
good,"Good sharing knowledge with collegues."
good,"I was part of an acquisition. Integration was long, slow and incomplete. Work environment and general benefits were good."
good,"The day has a perfect balance of work and life. Work includes combinations of investigations, audits, analysis etc."
good,"Job is not what I signed up for. Many of my co-workers are wonderful to work for but like other companies, manager is hit and miss. There are some very great managers here but, also some real duds."
good,There is a lot to learn but over all work/life balance is lacking since there is always a pressure to work long hours and work doesn't get appreciated all the times.
good,Processing Domestic and International orders and working with the Sales group to expedite orders in a timely manner.
good,Overall good place to gain knowledge. nice place to get exposure to corporate life.
good,While working you can balance your family and work.
good,"Culture, colleagues, flexibility is all good but the benefits could be a little better."
good,"I had learned a lot for the time I spent at Symantec Canada. "
good,"Good work/life balance, but bad culture. Management doesn't have vision on directions, but colleagues are really nice. Not a good place for young guys."
good,"Symantec likes to hire managers.  There are alot of managers and they need more people that actually do the work, not more decision makers.  Workplace culture not great, it is very hard to get things accomplished.    Processes are not great. often worked way more then 40 hours a week.     Poor work life balance."
good,"The team I worked with was excellent.  We worked with team members in Pune India.  The volume of work was high, mistakes were unacceptable, it was very challenging.  The people were in the Tempe office were excellent to work with."
good,Symantec has been good to me over the years but its not the place it once was. There have been multiple changes in leadership and with each change it seems there is a different focus and direction.
good,"Back Line Engineers have more than 10 years of specialized training and knowledge of the product they support."
good,Symantec is a Company good for freshers to learn more and it provides all the best resources to grow. It keeps their employees in comfort and convenience. Lot of flexibility is available and it is a good place for beginners.
good,"Lots of good people and intent.   Executive leadership struggling.  Three different CEOs in 4 years I was there.  Everyone had different strategy and style.    Lots of change on top of change.  Most of it not lasting change. Current CEO came from acquisition of small tech company.   Struggling to lead a large, public company.   Very poor communicator.   I had a great boss."
good,This place offers Great benefits and the Culture of the workplace is light and fun but the Job Security and the Management is lackluster. The turnover rate for both is high.
good,"The people are awesome, the work is challenging.. the management is very confused about where technology is going and how to address it for the future of Symantec.. making it a very confusing place to work.. many people just couldn't take it and resigned.."
good,"After a series of bad software releases, the board members became unhappy and fired the CEO. Then they wanted to outsource all support to India and proceeded to layoff all support personnel in Eugene."
good,Symantec is in transition.  It's hard to say what the culture will ultimately be like after the transition is completed.  It's been a constant change culture over the last 3 years and doesn't seem to be slowing down anytime soon.
good,My experience there was average. I didn't really interact with many. I spent most of my time in my own office. As an assistant my experience there was really not rewarding at all
good,"The work was interesting, there is plenty of opportunity to drive improvement to cost and process. Pay was good, considering the area. Benefits very good. Given the recent changes, it looks like Oregon is no longer going to be a reliable site for this company."
good,"Depending on which department / group your in can either be a delight or a nightmare to work at Symantec as there are a lot of silo's and group against group alliances. Excellent benefits, for the most part great people, but little job security unless your willing to constantly change job roles."
good,The organization is on its last legs. There is alot of innovative competition that has saturated the market and started to steal market share. Google has also bullied the company into selling profitable parts of the business.
good,"I had a few incredible managers and worked with incredible people but the hours were long and there was allot of job stress. "
good,Company in transition - going through lot of changes. Frequent changes at the leadership level. Continuous changes to the company direction - acquisitions and divestitures
good,The first day of my was little typical. I have learned my soft and corporate working skills in my travel. I can well manage my schedules and deadlines in the project. I had a very affable and comfortable work culture. Meetings on project are most hardest and enjoyable part of job at the same time.
good,"Very good salary benefits"
good,Great hours where you helped customers as you continued to improve your skills. Working as a team helped each day to complete some tasks. Very comfortable work environment allow in to be seated or standing
good,"Symantec's benefits and compensation are competitive.  However, since the departure of  Enrique Salem Symantec has been trying to figure out ""what it does"".  As part of this process the company has been focusing on decrease costs with has included multiple re-orgs and reductions in force.  It will be interesting to see how the company does over the next year to three years with the integration of recent acquisitions."
good,There were too many changes happening at CEO level and every change had a massive impact down the chain of command. There was no HR department in Shannon in the later years to support staff throughout the changes.
good,"receiving inbound calls from clients ordering computer software, "
good,"it's a good place to work with great people, the technology needs a serious upgrade. Talented team but the mangers seem to be lost in direction at times."
good,Organizational expectation-perception feedback loops vertically and horizontally could have been improved over the last 10 years when Symantec had Veritas products were under Symantec umbrella.
good,Locations all over the country and world based on product teams you work for.  Too many products and teams to be focused on any of them and the products sometimes suffered because of it.
good,Very technical oriented company. Although work life balance in the company is quite good. For any fresher its a good company to make a new start and create career.
good,"A typical day at work was challenging yet reading. I provided support via phone, chat and email. The work culture was not interactive friendly. We were encouraged to focus on work and not talk to each other face to face. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with favoritism. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to work with many good folks."
good,We would set goals for sales and getting to know our customers. Other activities would also make the workplace fun. Just helping people solve their problems was challenging but rewarding.
good,"Good Culture"
good,Acquisitions made it hard to get things done due to the systems but great people and products.  The customers are loyal and true partners.
good,Very average company. Don't work here anymore because of management and director. Company did split into 2.
good,"Not much to say . . ."
good,"Smart and talented group of people, everyone works hard to make a difference."
good,"Everything was going very well until the management keep making changes to hope to make things better, but all turn to worst. Lot's of people leaving after the change in the management. The company start from well management to no management,."
good,"I worked here part time and learnt alot about the IT Industry."
good,"The work environment is pleasant, the workload is acceptable, not much overtime is needed.  There are frequent management team turn over in the recent years."
good,"I have worked for Symantec for over 4 years now. I have seen their board members go through CEO after CEO. The one CEO who was an advocate for culture and employees having more opportunity for growth, etc was axed.. Co-workers are always a pleasure and direct management seem to genuinely want to make it a great place to work. Serious problems with direction and upper management recycling the same ideas and behaviors. Lower wage due to location and a lack of investment back into the company in the proper directions. All in all not a bad place to work. Mostly because of the people and job/work life balance that can be attained."
good,Symantec is good company to work.In the last 3-4 years it lost the focus on product development and is focused on short term goals basically to make money by senior management.
good,"Difficult to impossible to get anything significant done with too much changes in management."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was helping my customers succeed."
good,"I was with Forrester for almost 8 years.  This is a perfect place to start for young graduates who want to pursue or think about pursuing a construction career."
good,Symantec offers a good work life balance. Typical day starts at 9.00 am and goes till 5.00 am. No flexible in Finance department. Management is not concerned about the lower level. Finance is disorganized and lot of turn over in recent times.
good,It was a good working environment with good guidance from mentor.
good,"I worked for several years answering telephone and online technical support questions."
good,Good people to work and a great learning experience. Bad management decided me to quit the job and move to australia
good,"This was by far the best job I have ever had. Fair management, great benefits."
good,"It really depends what you are on but in general Symantec is a place you will enjoy if you don't aim to do great things, need time to pick up your kids from school and work from home."
good,"The job requires a big learning curve, but all the people on the floor were quite helpful as new hires integrated into the team.  When I was there the management was changing, for the better, though it was toward the end of my time there.  The hardest part of the job was definitely the learning curve as well as constant requirements change which made it more difficult as one tried to understand the principal.  The most enjoyable part was definitely the helpful coworkers."
good,"- Meeting customers and business partners on regular basis to understand their pain points and craft out a solution that able to ease their pain as well as make their business competitive in the market."
good,"People are very nice, helpful and hardworking. Culture is just so awesome."
good,Really enjoyed working with the people at Symantec.  It is going through lots of changes and is quite hierarchical so difficult to get things accomplished.
good,Lifelock was a great company that believed in treating the customer right. It became just another call center focusing on statistics over customer experiences.
good,"Symantec provided me with 17 years of employment, wish it could continue but they are removing Utah as a hub."
good,"Good place to work."
good,Learned to make yourself learn about how to do everything by yourself. The most enjoyable part is the free snacks and big screen Television set provided although you cannot see what you actually want to watch :P !
good,Employee interaction is fostered through company all-hands and activities.
good,Symantec is going to a big change to become a growth company again.
good,I loved working for Symantec. I felt appreciated for my work. Teams were happy. There was room to grow in the company.
good,Pending a better and more thorough review. I enjoyed the people I worked with and will wriet a more thorough review shortly.
good,"Joining Verisign presented me with an exciting challenge in building a brand new marketing organization for a company going through significant change. Starting from a team of six, I built a multifaceted, comprehensive marketing organization that was responsible for all PR, branding, digital marketing, MarCom services, analyst relations, event management, EBC development, and crisis planning."
good,"I enjoyed my time working here; however, I always felt that there was too much middle management. Made it difficult to get things done."
good,Symantec previously Veritas has a lot of great products and technologies to work with. Management is not clear what direction company needs to take. Salaries are below industry standard for the domain
good,- Learnt about IT work
good,"International company with constant changes, restructures.  Overall a great place to work for future opportunities.  Provides opportunities for advancement."
good,I used to love my job and was happy to go to work every day. I will not work for them anymore.  It used to be a great company but new ownership has taken that away.
good,"Great company, undergoing lots of changes currently. Culture is changing. More big box company now.  i was able to grow my career and move to different org. Opportunity is there."
good,"Every day I answered system calls, checked for backup failures and corrected them. He monitored the entire backup environment and made shift passes with daily reports working in conjunction with other teams."
good,"The upper management doesn't seem to have a clue how the day to day business is actually carried out.  They make decisions based solely on the bottom line instead of looking at how these decisions will play out 'real world.'"
good,"Symantec is good company to work with. Over the years I have learnt some new technologies. "
good,"Had great camaraderie with coworkers and people reporting to me.  We pushed each other to try the impossible, to ask the ""what if..."" questions, to expand our knowledge."
good,salary and other benefits are good.Can maintain good work life balance but job security is low. No career growth. Not much training in diverse areas
good,"Great experience w/ my job and the people I've worked with and immediate management. This was a temp job and contract ended. Many jobs sent to India unfortunately. There is room for advancement.Overall, a good work atmosphere."
good,"As i have joined as a Fresher in this company I worked hard in this company initially but i came to know that there is no growth for me "
good,"Por estar passando por reestruturação, muitos processos ainda não estão definidos, o que causa muita confusão. Para agravar, uma vertente dos executivos não passa as diretrizes muito claramente, "
good,"Das Gehalt und der Arbeitsaufwand ist in Ordnung, jedoch sind manche Entscheidungen vom Management nicht  logisch"
good,"Good company in terms of benefits , but lacks ability to provide job security."
good,"I enjoyed my time working for the company and making new friends."
good,"Symantec Order To Cash team is the major operation team for partner order management."
good,"A typical day would be a busy day and I enjoy it. There is always some thing new to learn managerial and/or technical. We had a small team on site and most of the team was remote but we had multiple teams meeting everyday which kept us on same page. To bring different team members, technical and non-technical, on same page is challenging but I found it fun too. I enjoy doing what I do and I love doing it."
good,"Good culture"
good,Sad to have such terrible work envirinment in a great company
good,"I loved working at Symantec. The work-life balance was great, as I had flexibility coming into work and doing my job with ease. They have happy hour Thursdays in a game room with all the amenities."
good,"Overall a good company to work for and explore."
good,There are many good talents.  They are fun to work with and willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done.  These people create a friendly culture and work environment.
good,"I fought two plus years for this position and did very well there.  The pay, benefits, and training were great.  There is no job security because they are always reorganizing. The Broadcom acquisition will ruin the organization, 2000 let go before and 3000 more head count to follow"
good,Definitely 9-5. Friendly people. Cyber security is a very challenging field so a lot to learn. Folks seem open to trying new things but nothing ever seems to change.
good,"Initially Symantec was a great place to work, it changed when it merged with Veritas and I took a voluntary lay off. There was too much competition for each role since most positions after the merger had double occupancy!"
good,Good to work in  Symantec as a Sre. with good culture and technical knowledge. Hr will be available all the time. nice sports encouragement in the company
good,"I really liked the people that I worked with on a day to day basis. Advancement was difficult unless you were ""in"" with the right group that had worked together prior."
good,between the Veritas/Symantec split there was a decline in morale and job security was extremely uncertain. catering to investors brought along many job losses and the constant feeling of being on the chopping block
good,Symantec has been going through many changes and the culture has changed but is still a fair place to work.The benefits packages are competitive and good. The management seems to be able to catch up to the ever changing landscape pretty quickly.
good,"Management by the latest fad meant that you could not feel secure, otherwise it is a fun place to work with good pay and benefits. Sadly there is a sense of a company being on the down side of its growth cycle."
good,"Management is always eyeing to cut jobs and dont care about your group doing a good job or getting customers. "
good,Company culture is great but pay is mediocre. Management is not strategically aligned - a lot of changes in management at top level which is not great for mid to senior level
good,Chilled out work culture with good work / life balance.Compensation is not great though.Not highly recommended for career enhancement.
good,"Worked with Symantec as third party employee assigned to india's largest bank, where I could work initially as a security operations center. I could learn how to configure SIEM, integration, rule creation, enhancement, fine tuning of product etc."
good,"Good company to work for.  Fast paced, self motivated work place.  Opportunities to better yourself.  I learned so much in the 11+ years I was there.  Started out on the sales side of the house and then ended up in compliance.  Was only in compliance for a little more than a year, really enjoyed it and was looking forward to learning more about compliance."
good,"A typical day at works consists of reaching out to Customer's via email or phone to advise on upcoming renewals.   Sending out Install Base Reports and quotes.  Upselling and Cross Selling when Customer is receptive to upgrades.  Working with Customer, Tech Support, Finance to ensure the order is delivered smooth and on time.  Working with Management on customer sat issues and approvals.  Holding account review calls with Customer's to check on their usage and upcoming needs.  Meeting with Management for forecasting and deal reviews.  Weekly team meetings and training on new products.  Updating notes and keeping track of sales cycle."
good,"Pros:-"
good,"great working for such an amazing company, supportive management, opportunities for career advancement, flexible with work/life balance."
good,"Ein Unternehmen in den man sehr viele verschiedene Software Plattformen nutzt um Ergebnisse und  Resultate zu erhalten."
good,I had an absolute privilege to work with a wonderful team where i had learnt a lot about my job and the industry. It is a great company with lot of scope for information security and software graduates.
good,"Loved working here. Symantec provides a great work environment, I would say almost as good as Google's. I had a great manager. The culture is very appreciative and rewarding."
good,"- Great work flexibility, perfect for working mom. I can come and leave according to what works for my family but I log in at night when needed"
good,"Good work-life balance"
good,It's a great company and have awesome products. unfortunately too many CEO's changed in last 5 years which kind of impacted the workplace culture. I enjoyed everything at Symantec.
good,"Good environment and company. Work life balance : Excellent"
good,"Worked as a contract employee for 6 months."
good,"The management at Symantec is undergoing a lot of changes, resulting in instability for workers. There are constant layoffs right now, so each quarter you are not sure if you will still have a job."
good,"Most Commented"
good,"Good place to work , company has gone through so much org change though it can be tough to have clear missions for teams. Products need to be slimmed down and GTM needs to be looked at for competitive success"
good,"Overall decent company. Pay and benefits are a notch below standard in my opinion. Undergoing a great deal of change, but with good assets in the market."
good,"Enjoyed my time here!"
good,"Symantec is a pretty good company and the job culture has room for improvement. Good, secure job though not always exciting."
good,"Symantec in the past 3 years have been going through a lot of changes. The focus shifted lately to be very USA centric, making a lot of good peoples jobs redundant within remote locations."
good,"Great Co-workers"
good,"A typical day for me primarily involved managing the executives' calendars of meetings and appointments, keeping them on schedule, collaborating with other executive assistants, making travel arrangements and keeping up with email for myself and my executives.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working so closely with the other admins in order to maximize the efficiency of the C-Suite."
good,"Team strutturato, coeso e partecipativo a tutte le attività di business, attenzione alla qualità della vita, richiesta di risultati, fiducia nel personale."
good,"The consumer side knows how to push consumer product that is relatively meaningless but important to consumer's lives. Kind of like selling toothpaste - got teeth - need toothpaste, got computer - need antivirus. But for software and technological innovation - it simply does not have the culture to facilitate new and innovative tech.  It could, but it needs to focus its manpower on selling its antivirus solution above the other one that does the exact same thing for the same price and the free one that comes with Windows.."
good,"When I first started working at Symantec the atmosphere was fun, exciting and fulfilling.  "
good,"I worked for Sales Tech Support and it was easy working with my team , but definitely there was a huge gap between the sales reps use of tools and what it should have been. Most of our time would be use training sales reps than actually developing new and more efficient tools."
good,"The job was very demanding. There were a lot of computer program issues. However, there was on-site and highly accessible assistance. It was quite stressful, especially at quarter and year end. The position I held involved the purchase of another company and assisting in integrating customer collections information from one system to another and attempting to maintain good customer care with the customers involved."
good,"Good place to work, good perks and plenty of training available, but they tend to cut people a lot with almost continuous Reductions in Force as new companies are purchased/merged with."
good,"Very good company to grow technically. Lot of opportunities are given for the employees like free part time education sponsorship, meal coupon, etc. But ladder growth is very difficult especially for female employees."
good,"Symantec needs more diversity a in the work place. It is an excellent place to develop just your professional skills, but if you are looking for a company to grow with over the years, Symantec is not the place. It has absolutely no work culture what so ever."
good,"Great place to meet people, customers and wage benefits. Also, lots of room for advancement or move into another areas or work. I had fun and enjoyed learning to work with outside Global Teams."
good,"Overall good company, good work environment, relaxed, good compensation but no job guarantee. You don't know when they don't need you and your name is on the list of people to be laid off."
good,"Symantec is good with employees facilities but no Job security at Symantec."
good,"The company is good to work, but the job is not secured here, management and salary structure are higher compared to other companies which make it difficult to get an expected job in the market."
good,Flexible timings
good,The job is not bad the management and advancement opportunity are .As far as call centers are concerned its not bad if they offered bonuses for sales this would get a better review
good,"I worked very hard. I heard this is a slave camp, but that was my choice to work hard. most people did. that is morally the right thing to do, when you have a job. I rate job security/advancement very low, as I was laid off, rather than promoted, especially hurtful after 4 long years (of slavery). work/life balance very low too, because there was never talk about personal lives. company parties was as far as that went, and that is more a team building exercise than our true personal lives. wish we could support each other more! yes I believe a more casual environment is a better one. people need to thrive, not just survive. compensation was OK, I was happy, but want more raises. don't we all. culture/values is also poor. they had their core values, of course, but I don't relate well to them. what is brand? I had trouble with that. how about we just work hard and create a good product! thats what excites me. I prefer culture/values to address/acknowledge our personal lives, rather than corporate mumbo jumbo. maybe I am too casual, too personal, but I feel my company would be better in that regard. management is OK score, I had some competent managers and coworkers, which lifts morale, but they did lack in the sense of they all, all my managers, should have, could have, mentored me more than they did. I feel I should have been instructed more, led in the right direction at least. overall not too bad, I was glad to learn the things that I did. casual Fridays was nice. but I still got burned out. I needed MON off, for a whlie, 3 day weekend helped me recover. vacation time was OK,"
good,"good place. it was fun, good people. anymore than that, we can discuss in person."
good,I was impressed with company and the job Culture. The company was going through a downsizing and I was Laid off. Not very happy to leave.
good,"Formerly a good place to work, but the culture has changed with recent acquisitions that the company is still working through.  Enjoyed most of my tenure at company."
good,The team was amazing and very talented.  The applications are good and the management put a lot of in improving the technical stack. Resource allocation for projects are not very thought out. Flexibility and work life balance depends on your manager. Unlimited time off was implemented however was not practical due to amount of work
good,"Free coffee, tea and hot chocolate, and sodas are only $0.25. This company has a huge presence in India and Bulgaria and has a hard time keeping a CEO (5 in 9 years)."
good,"Not Interested in writing a review, as the manager was very narrow minded and biased in building his crew from his previous company and promoting them."
good,"Good place to work, really driven but my growth wasnt a priority to them. I learned that growth is important and you should put in just as much effort as you expect to get out. Management was a bit hectic, the expectations are quite high but they are inexperienced and not open to change. The hardest part of the job is being ontop of your A-Game 24/7 and if you slack just a little bit the repercussions are terrible. Most enjoyable part of the job are the people and the select managers who actually do want to see you grow."
good,Well Symantec is going through a company spit right now so it would not be far to give my standard review. But the company is getting better.
good,"I enjoyed and loved my work.  I was challenged, impovered, and delivered superior results."
good,"Directed internal controls over financial (ICFR) program for 2006 and 2007 year-ends, including 2006 restatement"
good,Teamed with Product Managers on new product launches from start to finish of releasing new software. • Created a process for identifying and managing the release of MAIs (Manufacturing Assembly Instructions)
good,"- No development work"
good,"Overall, it is a good place to work. Benefits are good, Hours are good. I learned that no particular specific occupation has any kind of assured continuity or longevity. New CEOs come and go with frequency, and each new one brings about new aims and focus points. Jobs come and go. Most work groups are established with ceilings, and little opportunity for advancement. Only transfers to other work groups offer any change in assignment."
good,I am currently employed at Symantec.  They have acquired Blue Coat and most recently Life Lock.   I enjoy the people and time at Symantec.    Their is an onsite cafeteria serving gourmet/healthy food.
good,"Great place to work. I have changed three groups, two years in the first, four years in the second and six years in the third. I've learnt a lot , grown a lot and completed a part time Master's at USC sponsored by Symantec. The first group coded in Java, the second and third in C++ with some C#. Great support thru tough times. However advancement seems impossible in terms of promotions etc. Sometimes it seems like there are politics though I can't put my finger on what. The tone of management can be different at different hours. The group I work in has something like two managers, two technical leads and a bunch of engineers who are all stepping on each other's toes. Sometimes for the same issues the reaction is different depending on the person."
good,"Working on very challenging and responsible job and very friendly colleagues and a nice environment to work with."
good,"Great place to work for, if your OK with the same work day in and day out. Management has an Agenda that is not shared with the team leading to odd results."
good,"good people, "
good,"Currently going through big changes under Steve Bennett's leadership.  It will take some time to see the results of these changes, but I think most folks are feeling positive about the future of the company."
good,"great collaborative styles"
good,"Lots of opportunities to learn if you are motivated.  Great benefits, and great people.  Not sure how the Broadcom deal will affect future experience."
good,"Give us your opinion about:"
good,"Symantec is one of the world's leading cyber security companies, helping organizations, governments and people secure their most important data wherever it lives. I was happy to join a company with a great mission statement and product line. Benefits were very important to me, and Symantec's are generous. It was also important to me that medical benefits began Day 1. Symantec understands that having insurance removes a weight from their employees' minds. Symantec is headquartered in Mountain View CA (Silicon Valley) but with their acquisition of LifeLock in 2017, they began to staff in Tempe AZ with its lower cost of living."
good,"While an average day will definitely not be 9 to 5, you will be surrounded by intelligent, insightful and helpful colleagues and the work will challenge you so you won't be bored enabling personal improvement and skills development. There is high expectation from Management pushing you to work hard, smart and be successful. Strong corporate culture, friendly and supportive. Long hours may not be for the faint hearted but this will be offset by satisfaction of successfully achieving your goals."

good,"I worked for Blue Coat and then was acquired by the giant Symantec which has definately been an uneven transition.   There is great technology in use and you learn a great deal of it, which is the best part about it.   They are flexible and for the most part supportive but with the transistions it feels like they are constantly looking to trim the force which makes for poor morale."

It is my personal goal to ensure every customer is treated the way I like to be treated ensuring they have the best experience possible.
good,"Symantec Enterprise was just purchased by Broadcom so the entire culture is changing.  While the culture within Symantec was strong, it also very much depended on the BU you were in."
good,"The company has good work environment, but upper management team seems to be in hurdle all the time. Normally an engineer would need to all kinds of works: front end, backend, testing, etc."

good,"Symantec has generally been a good company and a good place to work."
good,"Product development for managed services"
good,"Symantec was a decent place to work. It was very heavy on process and inertia - thoroughly corporate. You'll make a decent paycheck, work decent hours, and get great benefits."
good,I really enjoyed working on standard service requests for Symantec account. The HP team was excellent and I felt like I contributed to the success of the account management and performance.
good,"Now that the Symantec/Veritas experiment is over, it will be interesting to see if the stand alone Veritas can return to former greatness.  Will need to adapt better to the cloud."

good,"Learned to develop good coding and debugging skills. This was my first job and I am glad I made my start with Symantec. They don't treat interns as ""interns"", they do consider their thought process and their coding work for production."
good,"I have learn a lot during about IT and especially IT security during the last 5 years. From small/medium businesses, to business critical and Symantec Partners needs and expectations."
good,"As a start up company, the best description was sipping from a fire hose. I was involved in many aspects of the business beyond just operations and customer service. I collaborated with other departments such as Marketing, IT, Legal etc to build the business. I had a strong focus on building a world class culture which was very successful. We had an 80% retention rate and high employee engagement survey. "
good,"Worked as Network security Administrator;"
good,Symantec has a very nice work culture and it takes care of their employees .
good,Great Company but struggling to keep/find it's identity in the ever changing world of IT. Management disconnected from customers in GEOs. Lost in a fight with so many competitors over so many products in the portfolio. Steps on a dollar to save a dime.
good,"Working with customers in the US and other countries was interesting.  I helped customers to resolve issues in the tape drives and attached storage drives.  "
good,Symantec is a strong company and one of the top in overall software development.  Symantec had grown fast inorganically for several years and is trying to re-establish an identify as a leader in securing the world's information.  As a result several acquisitions that it had made no longer fit with the new problems they intend to solve which has put several employees and business groups at risk.  The new CEO is working to instill a new vision for the company which is still a work in progress.  Recently they've lost a lot of top level management which begs to question if they were really bought in with the new CEO.  Ultimately Symantec is consolidating into more strategic locations with a lot of work appearing to move off-shore from an Engineering perspective.  They provide strong benefits and competitive pay.
good,Overall a good place to work. Problem is only with the current outsourcing which hits the Job stability.
good,"The best point about Symantec I liked is Quality work, Here I got to see complete product Life cycle. "
good,"A typical day : Headcount and OPEX forecast/budget, meeting with Budget owners, approve ad review requisitions, resolve issues, report to Corporate and BU's."
good,"I was brought to Symantec to create the procurement ""bridge"" to the IT organization. It required me to create relationships where they previously did not exist, and diplomatically implement policy conformance. Subsequent to this, a group was created and staffed specifically for IT. I managed that group. "
good,"I've been at Symantec for 10 years, looking to for something new"
good,"Over the past 6 years, Symantec (now NortonLifeLock) has undergone significant changes.  Top management changes, frequent acquisitions, several divestitures, system changes and integrations and general change in direction have been numerous.  These changes have been challenging but rewarding at the same time.  I have been at NortonLifeLock now for 12  years and have survived over 20 reductions in force."
good,"Work Environment is quite Good at Symantec."
good,Good place to work with work life balance. Lot of flexibility with only requirement of delivering the result. No micro management and very supportive teams
good,"Training and introducing clients to new products and showing the clients how to optimize the products."
good,"It does not matter at what time we to go work as long as we deliver the work we had agreed for."
good,I have worked for Symantec for almost 9 years and they have been good to me. A lot of downsizing in the last 5 years tho that did not affect me till just recently as I am being laid off.
good,"Great people, great solutions, good company culture"
good,I worked at Symantec for 1 year out of college.  I enjoyed the culture and the opportunity to learn from very intelligent people.  I would recommend Symantec.
good,"Se trabajan largas horas, pero te cuidan bien. Hay muchas oportunidades pero es verdad que hay mucho cambia en la linea ejecutiva."
good,"I have worked at Symantec years ago and witnessed the split that originated 2 entities, Symantec and Veritas. Symantec was a good company to work , strong culture, and good compensation and benefits but as of right now I heard lots of changes impacted the employee experience."
good,"Good place for full stack engineers. We have to grab the opportunity to do the work. Nice location, Limited opportunity for Test Engineers. Automation Engineering is limited"
good,Good company. great benefits and all. Big name tag. You can learn a lot of new technologies and all. Good place to grow. But the work life will affect your personal life. It's a quite hectic
good,"Symantec is a great company to work for. The company seems to be focused on shareholders at the moment and not the employees, unfortunately. They do offer a lot of nice benefits, but the lack of stability makes it difficult to be a relaxing workplace."
good,"Symantec was my first professional job outside of college. That being said, obviously this was an entry level position. I was a contractor within the company working on a three month by three month contract. There was little training, little help, little of everything. Came away with a bad taste in my mouth for corporate finance. I wish my first experience in the field was better."
good,"Good company.  Great people.  Excellent work life balance.  Fast paced, always something to do.  Culture is good.  People there are friendly and plenty of collaboration"
good,Company in transition - going through lot of changes. Frequent changes at the leadership level. Continuous changes to the company direction - acquisitions and divestitures
good,"It was an awesome period I spent in Symantec, workplace culture is really good. I learned a lot and management is really good.  Taking chat and resolving customers issue was really fun part of my job."
good,"Overall good place to work. But recent acquisitions  and changes, job security is a bit concern specially for IT. Independent work culture and freedom of work."
good,I have been working at Symantec full-time(6 months). leader in cyber security and good working culture. Great leaders and highly qualified and experienced people. if interested in career of cyber security then it would be your best choice to join. Average facilities to employees and not much additional benefits.
good,It`s a well secured workplace with mice people working there. I learned a lot about the company. They have a nice canteen with delicous food.
good,"Has a good portfolio of products, but due to the massive number of them, it's causing lots of gridlocks. The culture of the product and engineering group is pretty well established."
good,"You plan for development of a product, spend almost 4-5 months on design, development and reviews, and suddenly development of product stops for management decisions. Decisions on product development strategy and product development itself changes, as management changes on higher level, which is almost once in 3-4 months.Salary benefits are good. Work life balance is good."
good,Working on a team to implement latest technology for Continuous Integration & Delivery.  Company interested in using latest tech avalibable.
good,It a good company to work for. The split between symantec and veritas is a very postive thing for both companies. They have many different positions and it's a mix of people from all over the world
good,"Fast paced, professional high tech environment!"
good,Symantec has been a good place to work.  I was happy to be a part of such a hard working team of co workers and offer Symantec customers my friendly customer oriented expertise.
good,"Team management, team work, customer satisfaction."
good,"Management is very easy to approach with the employees' challenges and issues"
good,"This is a great company to work with. I have been having a great learning experience on managing teams, scheduling tasks and so many other things."
good,"hormis un Management léger, le travail chez Symantec est agréable avec une dynamique régulière mais assez stressante"
good,"Good company... offer great work life balance if you work as per plan.."
good,"No day is the same, always something new to learn, something new to do, great people to work with  Being a global position and a global company, there is always the chance to meet someone on the other side of the planet, love it."
good,"I would recommend anyone to work for Symantec."
good,"Symantec overall has been a good place to work.  Mostly good people and a supportive culture focused on winning business.  In the last two years, there has been a huge turnover at the executive level along with layoffs at the manager and individual contributor level.  Two CEOs were booted out by the board and departure of most of the senior VPs.  THis has obviously slowed the introduction of new products and created uncertainty about the future."
good,"Minimal Supervision"
good,Good Company with a solid reputation although they are going through a lot of transitions.
good,"Managing the Fortune 500 customers was a good experience."
good,"Good environment, advancement opportunities from within hiring."
good,Equilibre entre le development de la strategie et son execution
good,Symantec has great work-life balance but slow on promotions in general. 
good,"it has a good work/life balance, the team manage respect the empolyee's suggestion and desicion. But the company leader is not focusing on how to lead the company on the right way."
good,Symantec is a good place to start your career. It has good benefits and the work culture is pretty good. A lot of different type of people work here from my walks of life and backgrounds.
good,"I was a remote employee, absolutely loved my team. My manager was in Dublin and I was in Utah. We worked well together, great people.  Symantec really knew what work/life balance meant."
good,A contract position which gave great learning opportunities and flexibility.  The culture is professional and friendly.  A diverse workplace which offers growth and advancement.
good,"The culture depends 100% on what department you work in. There have been many changes in leadership lately which has not been for the best. Overall though, they have rock solid solutions, and their solutions aren't real difficult to sell. Pay raises are slow if at all. You may go several years without one. Know that going in."
good,"Symantec India provides great salary perks to be very honest."
good,"My experience ant Symantec was very memorable.  Served as Customer Authentication Services (CAS) Auditor for a major Certificate Authority.  Worked to protect Symantec’s brands by auditing SSL certificates for compliance with SOX, SAS70, and Web Trust auditing standards."
good,"There has been a lot of turnover on senior leadership which makes a lot of challenges around legacy systems and new vision.  The pay and benefits are great (pay is comparable but the benefits are very good)."
good,"Management is very helpful, on the floor with all the agents."
good,"I always felt like the people on my team were open to new ideas, very accepting of strengths and contributions, the willingness to share what we learned as the journey continued."
good,"Empresa Boa, com treinamento para ferramenta e boas condiçoes"
good,"Open ended times to start end and have the opportunity to work remotely, if available. Was a great place to have a position. Great pay, great resources."
good,"The remote office in Texas was not large or have as many perks as working in the HQ.  The hardest part of the job was the product we supported was extremely complex and took years to learn on a granular level.  That was one of the best things as well, every hour was an opportunity to learn.  Network, programming, code, systems, processes, databases, cloud your only limits were set by each individual's desire to learn.  Great group of people and teams."
good,"The most enjoyable experiences with Symantec is the exciting projects and people who work on them. Professional technical training isn't abundant but if you can balance the fast paced project progression, heavy workload and have the ability to learn on the fly you'll enjoy working within Symantec. I did!"
good,"Once upon a time Symantec was a fantastic place to work."
good,"Out of all of the jobs I have had, this job offers the best benefits for the most fare prices.  I am happy with those benefits and my pay.  I would like more job security as the company tens to offshore most positions - up to 60% plus of the company, which makes your position up in the air at some level due to the cost of employment here in the US via offshore."
good,"Too many changes over the years. New leadership is taking the company in the right direction, but culture is suffering. Work life balance is good, most people are good..."
good,"So much good can be said, but also the process of small teams and not getting to incorporate good process improvements to what you have done and just focus on adding a new items can make a product less good over time."
good,At typical day is fast paced. There are lots of special projects to get involved with. Overall my experience has been good. Job security is questionable with frequent layoffs. I feel that I receive support from management.
good,"Their offices are a great place to work, and they are accommodating to those working remotely as well. Very fair compensation with great benefits. They do stay on top of training as well."
good,"Company fostered work life balance and employee advancement by providing benefits related to trainings, tuition reimbursements, paid time off and extra floating holidays."
good,"Symantec is a great place to work. It has been challenging due to the recent acquisitions but overall a good learning environment."
good,"The company has had many changes, and it is trying to re-invent itself for the cloud. Any employee needs to position themselves wisely to survive the changes."
good,"I loved working for them but upper management had to change report structures every 6 months to a year and their were always layoffs afterward.  Enjoyed the working with Sales staff and Consultants to sell projects, implement them and meet client expectations."
good,Symantec has a very healthy work environment with no micro management. Company provides good administration and transport facilities to the employees. It was a very learning experience for me over the past 1 and half year.
good,"While my experience at Symantec was overall positive, some of the management will throw you to the wolves to produce good numbers while ignoring your skills.  Workers are viewed--beyond what is acceptable--as expendable.  Training is minimal.  No effort is made to mine your talents."
good,"Symantec has good work place, flexible working hours and work from home facility. Good talented people, good lab infrastructure."
good,I enjoyed my time at SYMC but unfortunately they are pretty unstable right now.  Too many corporate changes and constant rotation of senior leadership makes it difficult to feel comfortable.
good,"Application Development For assigned project"
good,"Symantec is a one of the worlds leading security companies, it is a very dynamic environment that is always ever changing. It is currently in the midst of change as it just split the company into two with the Veritas divestiture."
good,"The work culture and flexibility and independence to the employees make envrionment very empployee friendly."
good,Really enjoyed my job. Great people to work with. work/life balance was great. I learned a lot about computers and how they work.  Networks and how they work.  Different OS's .
good,It's been long since I worked there (nearly four years ago). The atmosphere there are very good. Everyone plays an important role in the sales team. Sometimes we would have an Skype meeting after mid-night.
good,"Collaborative work environment and good culture to work in."
good,Team was very commitment to achieving the results set for the country / local office. The company was getting bigger and our local office was growing at all teams.
good,"I truly enjoyed my 12 years at Symantec and was disappointed  to see it end with the division into two companies being Veritas and Symantec. This split and downsizing of departments is what caused my team to be dissolved."
good,"Typical day would involve checking on customer ticket status. "
good,"Sales Manager - Business Developer"
good,"Symantec has been a good place to work for the last 9 years. The one complaint I have is they constantly change their CEO's  (I have seen 4) which always results in layoffs, outsourcing ect. Symantec recently hired an new CEO who sold half of the business (Veritas) which will indeed cause more of the same."
good,"The company is a great place to collaborate with some very smart people and create solutions to address serious world problems. Day to day, there are issues with strategic thinking at the top but the teams manage to do amazing work. Resources are a bit constrained and hiring freezes are more common than not. Work/life balance can be excellent but it really depends on work location and your manager."
good,"Really a good multicultural environment, an interesting job, and a large possibility given to have with endusers, resellers or distributors large negotiations discussions."
good,"My co-workers are wonderful.  The environment is very friendly.  The  company has seen the CEO change three times in three years.  It has been a little disturbing. Now the company is splitting into two public companies.  The morale is little down and a little nervous."
good,"Pros: Great Benefits"
good,My entire team in Symantec was very talented and humble. Though the team was relatively new as compared to other teams in Symantec but still everybody was clear about the work they were supposed to do.
good,"Symantec is a great place to work , highly organized as a company , but the products are going downhill. Outside of that everything is really great, the management, the teams , the sales org."
good,"I worked for Veritas when it was acquired by Symantec.  Loved my time with Veritas, not so much with Symantec.  We lost our focus and vision when the acquisition happened.  We tried to combine to compnaies with very different cultures."
good,"Did a contract, nice management and good team. learned new technologies."
good,"Collaborative work culture"
good,"There was fair training there, but great support from co-workers. Several organizational, and management changes while there. Was often hard to determine the companies direction, but the new leadership has things improving. Great staff, and people working at SYMC which made it a good company to work for."
good,"ho imparato il problem solving, la gestione dello stress, il lavoro in team e le tecniche di vendita"
good,I would come into my cubicle or office and work on my current assignment. Sometimes I had multiple assignments and had to multitask
good,Nice product based company with good salary benefits but makes you go in comfort zone.
good,Symantec is a very good place to work.  There is workplace balance and training is provided to effectively provide support for your area of expertise.
good,I enjoy assisting guests and co-workers to meet a range of business needs.
good,I managed a team of great people. Upper management was communicative and supportive--I'd recommend Symantec as a place to work.
good,* no comments at this time *
good,"I've loved working at Symantec, it's been a great learning experience and there's never a dull moment. One thing that Symantec has been known for lately is layoffs. They have layoffs almost every quarter. The morale around here was always somber because you never knew when you were on the chopping block. But I work with great people here, it's always busy and there's always a wide range of things you can do, you won't be stuck doing the same things over and over."
good,"* Different nationalities and culture "
good,"I have enjoyed most of my time at Symantec. I believe in our mission of protecting people from cyber threats at all levels. Some of the smartest people I've ever met work here. "
good,"Organization carries a rich culture"
good,"opportunity to learn, good leadership and communication, work-life balance and transparent."
good,"A big company has it's good side, regarding resources both material and human, but politics can also play a big part in day-to-day operations and decisions that ""come from above""."
good,"Lot to learn from technologies , teams and management. "
good,"Symantec was a good company to work for however, there was always a reduction in force so there was not much job security.  I enjoyed working with the Distributors and our Pune Team.  Quarter Ends used to be the hardest part of the job but over time it has become much easier.  I really liked my manager and the people I worked with."
good,"Loved the business model and loyalty of channel partners"
good,"Great company, excellent benefits, constantly changing."
good,"Symantec purchased Veritas Software around 2000. They never really understood how to leverage it in their security portfolio. However, we were a big part of their income, so they had to pay attention to it. This led to the big separation in 2015 where it was bought by Carlyle group. "
good,"Worked here for 4/5 years."
good,"Pros:"
good,"The hardest part of working for Symantec is that it requires long hours depending on the department you are in.  Traveling 25-60% of the time might be hard to you especially when you have young children.  Overall, the environment is great and they build team spirit!!!"
good,The lack of security the job would continue and jobs being sent overseas.  Having management not be honest about the sale of buildings and positions being reduced.
good,"The main and actually only downside is that there have been constant layoffs for the last 3+ years and they are expected to continue for another 2 years (or more) as the Company ""right-sizes"". The majority of the eliminated positions in the US are moved to India. "
good,"Good Work life balance,"
good,"There were a lots of changes in strategy, senior leaders which resulted in poor execution. However, the company seems to be heading in the right direction...."
good,"Symantec is a very progressive company and is currently going through a large transformation and cultural shift, overall a very good place to work and grow."
good,"- Good to be part of this organization."
good,Worked at Symantec for 5 years and in the last 3 years there has been more RIFs than I have ever experienced. New CEO making great strides to fix issues.
good,Great team culture and builds on everyone's strengths to contribute from. You also have the ability to work or contribute on other team's projects if you want to. The hours of work were flexible as well.
good,"Learn wide range of technologies "
good,The work culture differs in major cases from that of the East Coast culture. It is more laid back and focused on to harness ways to increase the productivity among the employees by creating a lively and fun work environment.
good,"Good learning experience "
good,Good work life balance. Good perks and benefits. Less Job security and little bit of your career growth depends on management and not on your actual performance.
good,I have learned a lot about how to search the right info on internet. The workplace is fun and friendly. You always feel you are the one of the remarkable team members.
good,"Designing and developing mappings to achieve the desired functionality."
good,"Symantec was well run while I worked there. Leadership was one of the absolute strong points. There wasn't quite the same commitment to work-life balance, and bonuses and pay were average. The employee engagement was great and comradery was exceptional."
good,Symantec is a great employer for the Eugene/Springfield area. There are many opportunities for advancement and working with diverse people around the world.
good,"Good Company, undergoing transformation. Good times ahead with new acquisitions and investment partners joining in."
good,The company was great to work for.  They were extremely flexible with work from home options. They took great care of their employees.
good,"Network devices Monitoring, Maintaining and Troubleshooting. Communicating with internal and external customers etc."
good,"Was good synergy, but not enough time to prove in sales. Environment like startup but facilities of big enterprise."
good,"While Symantec is not a Google, Facebook, or LinkedIn in terms of offering perks and stock, it's comp and benefits packages are pretty competitive -- more so (comp) for technical employees. The people who work there are great but the culture is in a major transition, so a few growing pains there. It used to be highly flexible with work-from-home, which is changing dramatically."
good,"Lately a lot of changes that affect the market (Disti, Partner and End User). "
good,"Developers have independence to innovate and support from management"
good,"Recent changes in company make future uncertain as well as job security. While local management is supportive, upper decision ramifications are felt on lower tiers."
good,"Good company filled with great people, driven and passionate about culture and success. Direct management was second to none. upper executives were out of touch with the employees and the need to nurture an employee focused culture to retain amazing talent and foster long-term success.

PGP had gone out and purchased a CA (Certificate Authority), thus needed a sales force to start selling certificates for use in authentication, document signing or encryption. We were successful in the 3 months we had to get the ball rolling, then PGP was bought by Symantec, and we were then integrated with the VeriSign team within, selling a combination of VeriSign's offerings, under the Symantec logo/brand. I remained in MA, in a small setting with just one other inside sales rep (from PGP Trust Center), and an engineer to assist us with online product demos, conference calls with prospects, etc. I really enjoyed the position, my coworkers and the overall experience. In Oct 2011, we were notified of a planned change to centralize our team to OR. We were given the choice to move to OR and continue working at Symantec, or accept a severance package and be let go.

Considering this, it should come as no surprise that a study found socializing to be rated the highest out of all fun-related activities throughout employees of all ages and generations.

good,"Like many other students in this class as well as my teammates, I go into this internship not knowing a lot of things that my work would require.  School has taught me a great deal about computer science and engineering principles, but the specific knowledge needed for this internship is different from what I needed for a school project or a homework assignment.  The good news is that I did have the appropriate skill set to start off of and the ability to learn.  I remembered that the beginning of my internship was a bit slow, because the first task I had to do was going over documentation and debriefing of various products’ architecture, our teams’ development environments and the future endeavors of our company.  Being put on the innovation team requires extra familiarity with these details, as they would help me to decide how our products may evolve on top of such foundations.  My teammates also have the same tasks during their beginnings; I think we all agree that putting our heads into understanding the current state of things was the best solution.  So that was what we have done, participating in all the knowledge transfer sessions and hoping to catch up to speed as soon as possible with the rest of the engineers.  Yet problems arise when we fail to understand technical concepts and procedures on our first tries because of our lack of experience.  I had little to no idea what a blockchain is on the first project.  My method of getting progress in understanding was to imitate what others have done while plowing through the documentation online.  Since it was an open-source"
good,"Everyday was different, and there was always something new to do and learn. I truly felt valued as an employee and that my managers where invested in my success. There was consistent communication on what we needed to do to improve our work, and what we where doing well."

good,"I spent eight years at Symantec. I led over eleven acquisitions from companies all over the world. I spent the majority of my time working with the executive team on strategic directions of each acquisition, ensuring programs and metrics were in place to gain value for the investments the company was making. I spent sometime as the Chief of Staff to the CEO, I was able to see how a large company was run. From customer meetings, to sitting in the boardroom, it was a highly valuable experience being able to see what it takes to run a large company. The hardest part of my job was laying people off. I found it difficult to see good people lose their jobs due to redundancies from an acquisition. The most enjoyable part of my job was problem solving and putting out fires and I loved my team."

good,"Boa empresa e bons profissionais."
good,"I worked from home, so I can't comment on the office life, but what I found most exciting about working at VERITAS (later bought by Symantec) was that the company was willing to pay someone's salary solely for contributing to the open-source projects such as the Linux kernel.

good,"Symantec is a great company to work for because of the people.  The majority of the time I worked there we had an office that was involved in many of the corporate initiatives around volunteerism, philanthropy and community outreach and our leadership team was very supportive of all these efforts.  I would have to say these activities and this environment would be what I would consider to be the most enjoyable part of the job, along with the ability to travel and participate in the Worldwide Sales Conferences, Leadership Training and Technical Symposiums each year.  The hardest part of the job was the first year I was involved in the newly formed Global Sales Enablement organizations because rules of engagement had not been established between the global team and the local enablement teams leading to confusion in roles, responsibilities and best practices.  Overall, my colleagues and the majority of the leadership I interacted with at Symantec was great.
