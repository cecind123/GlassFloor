rating,review
good,"Amazing people at all levels of management.  Provided great opportunities to integrate into the company and very flexible and open culture to try new things.  Managers get lot of respect and independence to manage their own teams.  Mentoring and coaching is available and encouraged, and senior management and executive staff is very accessible."
bad,"Backstabbing happens regular. Salary is low for what is expected. Lean teams and too much work. Burn out is expected for all staff. "
bad,The company does not care at all about the success of its sales people. Opportunities for professional growth are limited. Accounts and territories are consistently reduced and or taken by fellow employees who are supposed to be 'team members'. The organization is setup in such a way that sales people often feel more competition from their fellow co-workers than from actual competitors. If you are looking for a role in sale I recommend looking elsewhere.
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of ,starting working as soon as you get to your desk.  Then work continuously until the end of your shift. Workplace culture is laid back and very clickish. Hardest part of the job was working for supervisor/management that didn't appreciate my hard work, dedication, and did not respect personal boundaries. The most enjoyable part of the job was the little perks and rewards earned."
bad,"Management should be ashamed of themselves. They are abusive and do not care about you at all. You are a number to them and the job is hard on its own without having to deal with them talk at you, cut your pay, make it harder to keep a job, and enable (and encourage) people to have drinking problems, eating disorders, gambling problems, drug problems, etc. Never work here unless you have no choice."
bad,You won’t make money and even if you’re successful they will cap your earnings. They have a cult-like culture and the partner-funded teams are often unqualified to do their jobs.
bad,"CDW is claiming to be in fortune 500 companies but their management and work culture is worst like a third world country. I worked in warehouse 3 technical lab where the work wasn't technical at all. During my daily work day I was unboxing and boxing laptops and PCs with some automatic imaging by connecting VLAN cable. It was kind of labor job while standing on my feet for 8 hours. "
bad,"They have a high employee Turnover for several reasons.  Do your research, and talk to people working there.  Wouldn't go back even if they paid me twice as much!"
bad,"I was a salesman at CDW for roughly a year.  It was absolutely TERRIBLE!  Management does nothing but stress you out every second about making your numbers.  It is a high stress, low paying gig.  "
bad,"Terribly dirty, dusty and stinky place. Low skills and intelligence level employees. Poorest management ever. Career opportunities for chosen ones only. The orders for government, schools and hospitals are taken care of by people with no skills and zero knowledge."
bad,Literally looking through phone books for clients. Sales to Medium/Large clients with over 100 end users.  This was very difficult to find clients when there were already 30 people prospecting on my team for the same area.
bad,Work as a temp and I've been there 3yrs with no hope of being taken on board. Was told that the company can't afford to hire right now. What a load of garbage?  They work you hard.
bad,"CDW is a great place to get experience but they'll quickly take advantage of you and make you work 12-14 hour days. They hire temps to permanent positions, but rarely do they make them permanent. I'll say there's 50%-60% temps working there, they usually say there is a 3 month probation period and promise to hire you permanently. They don't, they just do layoffs so they don't have to hire you permanently and go on to hire other temps. The local management is very deceitful, they seem like nice people but don't be fooled, every few weeks they'll give you free lunches for all the hard work and hours you put in, but then they'll do layoffs, they won't even tell you, they just have the temp agency call you and informed you that your services aren't needed anymore. No explanation, just goodbye that's it your done! I understand there's deadlines to make but when you put in a lot of effort, hours and care you don't layoff those people. The work wasn't that hard, installing HDDs, RAM, expansion cards, imaging systems, and installing OS to the systems. They demand a high volume, which means there's no room for mistakes and training. I didn't have any issues with any of the co workers or management it's just the way they do business."
bad,"borderline poverty pay, get in/get experience & get out!!!"
bad,"Sales is all there is, and they will do anything for a sale. They 'merged' with my (decent) company, then changed everything about it that they claimed they admired and wanted."
bad,"Not a great place if you're trying to build your career. Management is always MIA, there is a lot of favoritism, work is never appreciated, and people are constantly micro managed."
bad,"Input never taken as for ways to improve company, cashflow, revenue. decisions always overruled by upper management (they don't know much about industry or current business trends in the industry"
bad,The work its self was not the issue. The management made working there miserable. I have no issue taking responsibility for my work but I should not be responsible for someone else's mistake.
good,"Amazing people at all levels of management.  Provided great opportunities to integrate into the company and very flexible and open culture to try new things.  Managers get lot of respect and independence to manage their own teams.  Mentoring and coaching is available and encouraged, and senior management and executive staff is very accessible."
bad,You can always meet nice people but the overall culture is generally one of aggressive and self serving sales and an under nourished back office. it is every department for itself and make sure you are within the right clique.
bad,"You are a replaceable robot and just another number. Achieve 200% of your monthly sales goal, why didn't you do 250%? Company is only focused on the negatives. It is a ""banging your head into a wall contest"" and they will chase you out if you are not part of the click."
bad,Good environment . Helpful people.  The supervision is poor . Not enough of OSHA training. Organization was also poor . Alot of people complain .
bad,"Worked for CDW for 2 years and in that time seen over half the office come and go. Very high turnover rate. They cut your pay after two years and the commission rate is not competitive. You are better off working for a vendor directly. The office environment is miserable and management dictates rather than leads. There is absolutely no room for growth, despite what they tell you the only options are account management positions. There are positions within the account manager role but they offer no paid promotion, you will only receive a fancy title and a work from home day. Be warned this is not a career. If you are desperate for work and don't mind a lower end salary this might be a good starting off point."
bad,"Horrible management, Directors think they are more important than they are, lots of harassment happens here with little done about it."
bad,"As a contractor, I will not disclose any specifics to the negative experience  while working there.  Colleagues and team members were very supportive."
bad,"Managers lack training and exhibit poor leadership skils. Compensation is on the lower end compared to competitors.There is no growth mindset, staff receive no training and there is no formal PMP process."
bad,I was lied to by recruiters on what my position would be & what I would be doing. Told me I would be just installing software on computers. First day.. just pick & pack things. Non stop walking for miles all day long. Lifting heavy & cutting up your hands constantly. This work is for robots. Be careful of this slave work.
bad,"not diverse "
bad,"disappointed because they do not practice at all what they preach in the CDW Way - if they did, the company would be amazing................................"
bad,CDW was a great place to work for. I started in 2000 it was a wonderful place. But for about the past five years it has changed and they treat the office people awful. There is management in departments that have no background in that area. While I would suggest that they are trying to improve that they would look at management teams and better match them up.
bad,racist company . Workplace culture sucks. Not a friendly people environment I cannot think but hope that their culture changes. Doesnt pay well to anyone.
bad,"The pay is good and will lure you in, but say goodbye to friends and family  "
bad,"Political, bad pay, Management is in it for themselves. Big Corporate red tape for everything. Lots of rules. Tons of training that is not good! Its a good place to start if you dont have a degree or experience. Anyone with experience or a degree should not go to CDW."
bad,"Overall, the culture of the company is great, but living in northern Virginia on a $30,000 base salary is difficult. It's pretty much a waiting game to get a profitable account."
bad,"The company's lack of concern for their employees, and the focus only towards their overall bottom line is the driving motivation for leadership."
bad,"Managing existing portfolio of customers, checking emails for new order inquiries, calling customers for need analysis, cusomizing the solutions based on the needs and requirments of customers, filling the orders and make arrangements for all the shipments"
bad,Company only cares about your talk time and touches. Sales seems to be secondary. Managers are constantly complaining about your talk time. The vendor specialists they have there are completely useless and CDW CONSISTENTLY overpromises and underdelivers. Stay clear of this place!
good,"Amazing people at all levels of management.  Provided great opportunities to integrate into the company and very flexible and open culture to try new things.  Managers get lot of respect and independence to manage their own teams.  Mentoring and coaching is available and encouraged, and senior management and executive staff is very accessible."
bad,"I worked on a contractor basis. The training was severely lacking, the managers were micro-managers, and I was let go in the end because I was late a few times and didn't realize that they required you to be there a min 5 mins before and after your shift. If I had known that from the beginning, that never would've been a problem. They would rather get rid of someone who wants to learn and do better than coach the employee and give them the instruction and information that they need to move on and be better."
bad,"Typical work day is 9+ hours, depending on the group you work for. Certain teams work far fewer hours and receive the same pay. Very clique-ish environment. If you are in Sales, there is a great training program, however no other group gets that level of training focus. Training for other teams is all OJT and the management expects you to just know all policies and procedure even if you came from the outside. Management and lifetime employees are not forthcoming with information to help you learn or do your job. Expect a lot of browbeating and micromanagement form you manager as is appears to be the management model used most frequently. "
bad,"Management was the reason I left. I have never had such a bad manager in my life. 30-60 calls a day which is very reasonable, find new business, etc.  I would not recommend."
bad,"	Provide information technology solutions for medium to large businesses."
bad,"On the serface the company seems amazing, but once you get into the job it's basically who ever is friends with the management get a fighting chance at keeping their job."
bad,"Typical days at CDW are chaotic to say the least. You never really know what is going to happen from day to day, and only so much of that can be attributed to the IT industry. "
bad,Started this job with all the right intentions. After about year there was an incident of someone micro managing the work and would sit on calls and take them over and report all negative feedback and was ultimately let go. This place needs to be gutted out and new management is a must!
bad,Great place for computer experience that's for sure. But as soon as they feel like your no good for the company they drop you. They hire on tons of Temps but only hire you on after you've worked their for years. And if your a temp and have a family emergency theirs a good chance you'll loose your job.
bad,"PROS: As a seasoned sales representative, i was shocked to find out i would be part of a family of over 100 sales employees. After a few weeks i realized that it made sense. Not everyone can sell and it's more about quality workers who can make them the most money. I was told from current employees that CDI is a commission based company that is in there highest peak.Unfortunately sometimes things do not work out. In my case, a learning experience."
bad,"Forget raising a family in your personal life at home. You'll spend more time at work than with your kids and spouse. Coworkers are friendly, well only those who are temps since you see different faces every 2-3 months. I see a few comments that managements are great people, but through my expectation you're being deceived. They make you feel welcome at first then the true nature exposes when your nothing but a tool working hard for them to reach their quota. Have I forgot to mention ""favoritism."" If you plan to work here, expect high demand of work. I am talking thousands and thousands of huge orders. Very repetitive, the challenge wares off when you realize déjà vu."
bad,"I think that this is not a bad company to work for if you're not working on the Service Desk. All other departments treats you like an adult. However, at the Service Desk you get micro managed heavily. Not to mention the people you work with. Each team looks out for itself and within the teams, team members try to outshine other team members. So much for team work. Avoid working at the Service Desk."
bad,Terrible compensation 30k salary which is practically unlivable after taxes. Commission is a joke you got to sell a ton of software or solutions. Selling hardware will generally yield a small commission check. After 3 years you get promoted in title and the pay structure changes to whats called the matrix most don't survive this after not getting paid for 2 to 3 months. You rarely meet anybody in sales working there thats between 3 and 6 years most people quit by that time. Their prey of choice is college grads occasionally somebody without a degree. Politics run the company whether you call it nepotism or the good ol' boys club. Most internal jobs will go to favorites so good luck advancing. Women are treated far better than men and there's double standards for phone metrics. You will burn out fast or you will be a favorite there's really no in-between. If you need a job I'd apply but put your degree to use and go make some money someplace else.
bad,"The company chews you up and spits you out as fast as possible. If you make your sales goal for the first year, they will be higher the following. Pretty common in a sales gig, but in the world of IT companies don't constantly buy new computers or software. Meaning that if you happen to sell well in one year you will make no commission again on that account for another 3 - 5 years."
bad,"CDW was a great place to start a career and learn the ropes of not just IT and sales, but many aspects of modern industry, However it's a culture of complacency and if you are looking for a more rewarding contribution to your career other than just being a robot for a paycheck, it's not a permanent career."
bad,"CDW does not know how to build a culture suited to services, especially subscription services.   CDW lacks a cohesive services strategy and executive leadership to build a sustainable and scalable services business model.  "
bad,"Stretches at the beginning of the shift to prevent injuries on the job that could occur due to standing for 12.5% of the work day.  Lunches are 30 minutes meaning you have to inhale your food, never getting to taste it.  Sore feet is the norm and becoming a full time employee is a joke."
bad,"I have been with CDW for over 15 years. One of my biggest complaints is that they talk about ""involving stakeholders"" in decisions that management makes. However, the ONLY decision we were involved in was the choosing of the color of our work shirts. Providing us with pastries every Tuesday is appreciated, but, is a poor method to appease us with all that CDW lacks. I could go on. I guess one needs to truly experience the culture and environment to fully grasp what I am saying."
bad,"I suffered a medical incident and when I came back to work, they followed the letter of the requested accommodations but not the spirit. A few weeks after I had been back, it became clear they were no longer invested in my success. My manager refused a request to travel for training without any explanation, so I took PTO and went to training on my own dime. A few days after I returned, I was fired."
good,"Amazing people at all levels of management.  Provided great opportunities to integrate into the company and very flexible and open culture to try new things.  Managers get lot of respect and independence to manage their own teams.  Mentoring and coaching is available and encouraged, and senior management and executive staff is very accessible."
bad,"Management has no desire to manage."
bad,"I did learn a lot of new things since i was new in the construction industry . My coworkers were mostly helpful, some very looking for ways to get me into some trouble ."
bad,I worked for CDW for over 2 years as a Corporate Account Manager. Basically I found that most of your teammates are great people but management likes to ruin these relationships by stirring the pot and creating problems and trying to turn everyone against each other.
bad,Wasn't the job for me didn't like the atmosphere and the work was to repetative and easy also i didn't like the management of the warehouse and the intense security on site
bad,"management doesn't listen to us much. they ""know better"" than you. not all was bad. they have a nice cafeteria. they spend a lot of time and money on social connections rather than using that money to make your job more pleasing."
bad,Achieving required billable hours for project managers / engineers are expected even over vacations so PMs / engineers really get no vacations.  As a new PM you will need to manage 20+ projects to achieve your billable hours. I enjoy the engineers and other PMs but the overall culture is not good.
bad,"Work life balance - 2/5"
bad,"Terrible salary, equally terribly management. Avoid if you can. They will change the compensation plan on you multiple times during the year if it ever ends up being that you're making more money than they are okay with."
bad,"Poor team management, negative work culture. Purely numbers based and no real regard for individual workers. Each day is very numbers and service based."
bad,"The people you work with day too day are good reliable and helpful, however the management if they don't like your face then no matter the work you produce they will not develop you correctly."
bad,"coworkers. Pay was lower than median pay, no real advancement unless you wanted to work 80 hours a week and benefits were expensive. But coworkers were great!"
bad,Sales Grind. If you like to pound the phones 10hrs daily and don't ever value or long for personal or face to face selling its great but the field is my passion.
bad,"The sales teams are always pushed to sell more each year."
bad,"If you're young and looking for experience and an entry level job, this is the place for you. If you have a lot of experience then you may want to keep looking because management is almost parental."
bad,They tell you that you have the possibility to make a lot of money if you put in the time. Realistically it is very different than what they tell you. If you have experience look for a different company
bad,Great culture tough very low pay job with VERY HIGH turnover. Bad management and low opportunities to grow and prosper. Not competitive at all with the market base salary wise.
bad,"Very little opportunity for advancement. They've been #1 in the industry for the last 2 years with approximately $300 million in revenue - that makes it especially hard to stomach the ridiculously low salaries they offer. Turnover is amazingly high. If you need a job - take it, but don't expect to climb the ladder unless you can wait 5 years for minimum for a promotion (not exaggerating)."
bad,"If you're not in sales or senior management, the pay here is beyond low.  Everyone is dissatisfied with their pay and thinks they deserve more, but this is actually about 60-70% of market/industry salary.  Benefits are standard/good.  Work life is pretty good."
good,"Amazing people at all levels of management.  Provided great opportunities to integrate into the company and very flexible and open culture to try new things.  Managers get lot of respect and independence to manage their own teams.  Mentoring and coaching is available and encouraged, and senior management and executive staff is very accessible."
bad,"Please be aware that everyone is expendable. If you can accept the Corporate ""red Tape"" and the fact that Management does not care about their employees any more, then it's a great place to work for. They do have excellent benefits, But you will be stressed out and overworked within six months time."
bad,"Pretty much working in a call center. 60-75 calls per day and very low base salary. The job is fine to get experience right out of college, but most people will leave in less than 2 years."
bad,"If you can be successful at inside sales at CDW , many doors will be opened. The real beauty of working there is that you acquire some of the best sales skills and product knowledge . You then take your talents to another company that will compensate you fairly. "
bad,"Mislead about salary, bad work life balance- Beholden to ""partners"" and not your customers. Caused ulcers and almost my relationship due to lack of money, travel time and overall stress. A guy even killed himself at that office- Take that for what it is."
bad,Repetitive and continuous limited breaks and impossible tasks at times.No push to cross train and learn new material. I was sent by an agency and was treated extremely poor because of that misconception.
bad,"Very narcissistic and felt very untrusted."
bad,Company was great when first started.  Then cuts happened when didn't make projections.  Good employees were let go to make numbers.  Benefits were cut drastically.  Healthcare offerings became a joke.  Bad raises. You name it.
bad,"This is a typical sales environment; monthly, quarterly and yearly revenue and profit goals to attain. A normal work day starts with checking email, sales router, and following up on previous days task. Remainder of the day consist of conference calls, cold calling, creating quotes, and speaking with vendors. A majority of coworkers are recent college graduates; their first real job. The hardest part of the job - internal meetings. The most enjoyable part of the job is winning sizable, profitable deal."
bad,"The management are quite honest when they tell you it's hard work, but there is the potential to make a lot of money. Even though the title of ""Account Manager"" sounds good, it's really just a glorified call centre job."
bad,I made good money at this company.  The benefits where great but when it came to me needing FMLA when I lost my son I was threatened with no support and no time off.
bad,"CDW is a good place for young college grads to start their careers. It is not the best option for senior employees,they don't pay well and it its difficult to move up within the company"
bad,"The more the company scaled the more unorganized my department became. For a tech company, they truly lacked the sense of automating parts of work that we faced every day. People who were there for 20 years were fleeing the department. They also couldn't hold onto new talent for more than a couple months."
bad,CDWG is a good company to learn but the hours are long and the training isn't always ideal. It is a good first job but they have high turnover
bad,"it was alright, it was boring. I did not learn much, it was very diversed, I liked the fact that we did exercises before our shift, please leave me alone"
bad,"This is a great place to start your career and get some sales experience.  Most of the Dallas accounts are up in Chicago at the home base that people make a lot of money off but there are still a few ""diamonds in the rough"" so to speak.  Lots of happy hours and what not to keep you going but most people don't make it more than 2 years here."
bad,"CDWG division of CDW. Corporate CDW is a good company."
bad,CDW prides itself with very little marketing because they hire a young kid out of college to cold call all day long for next to no money.  Every time you call someone they have no idea who CDW is.
bad,CDW is a very difficult place to make money for most entry level employees. The opportunity to advance does not present itself before two years.......
bad,"Limited opportunities for advancement. Political. Need to be in the right circles to move up"
good,"Amazing people at all levels of management.  Provided great opportunities to integrate into the company and very flexible and open culture to try new things.  Managers get lot of respect and independence to manage their own teams.  Mentoring and coaching is available and encouraged, and senior management and executive staff is very accessible."
bad,"CDW is a great place to get your foot in the door in the IT industry. They will give you all the tools that you need to further your career, but with another company that ends up recruiting you. They have very strict call metrics and demand a lot out of their employees in a world where email and social networking has taken over the ""cold-calling"" world. "
bad,"In the early days, this was very family-oriented and people loved it. These days it's turned into a corporation. If you've got a good manager you've fine, otherwise it's every man for himself."
bad,Great place to learn initial sales technics and builid your sales rapport and communication skills
good,"Daily system checks"
good,CDW was my first office job and I came in excited to work hard. This all changed when I got a new manager about a year in. He clearly picked favorites and helped boost their careers while belittling and preventing other coworkers from succeeding or advancing in the work place. If you use a sick Day you get an occurrence even though you have the allotted time and will soon be written up for it. The sales teams are primarily male and as a woman you will constantly be sexually harassed and punished for your gender. I don’t know how this place has gotten such a great reputation because the last three years have been a huge struggle to even get compensated enough to live off of despite dealing with the extreme stress.
good,"-expectations are 80 calls minimum; cold calls to new potential clients"
good,Good company if you are fresh out of school.  If you are advanced in your career they do a lot of micro managing.  You will be one of about 4000 employees so the only way to advance is to kiss major behind
good,Set up to fail. Management has favorites. No option for advancement.
good,"The only thing that matters to CDW is sales.  SALES SALES SALES.  It doesn't matter if they customer is satisfied, only that the sale is made.  It doesn't matter if we sell them a solution that isn't in the best interest of the customer, only that the sale is made.  It doesn't matter if you've been working an account, or found a new account that wasn't being worked, as management will take it away and give it to one of their ""stars"", who quite frankly don't need more easy money.  Glad to be out of that snake pit."
good,"Client meetings, calls, and follow ups. Learned a tremendous amount about IT. CDW very calculated so decisions were made and acted upon in a very slow manner. Underpaid per experience level and industry standards."
good,"If you truly enjoy inside sales, and you are good at it, CDW is a good company to work for.  Long hours, and minuscule base pay are what you can expect.  Expect to make 100+ COLD calls per day, and expect to put in 12 hours to do so."
good,"Smartsource is CDW's preferred contract agency.  Being a contractor to Smartsource can present you to numerous enjoyable clients but, Smartsource (CDW) tend to be at the low-end of the pay scale."
good,"Great company to get your feet wet in tech.  There's so much technology that's ever changing.  The constant change of hard and software made things a little difficult to follow but that's why you need to find your niche in the particular technology that you understand, like, and is also profitable to you."
good,"CDW really is a great place to work at - there are so many different roles available.. Channel account manager, partner, sales, IT, etc... There are a ton of benefits, too.. depending on your role you get freebies (clothes (patagonia, columbia, nike, etc.), food, electronics, etc.). Only issue is the pay - you are compensated less than most anywhere else for the same job (but you get a ton of benefits!)"
good,"If you get into this place as an actual direct hire, you get great things! However, if you get in as a contractor, get ready for constant uncertainty about keeping your job. You never know if you are going to get hired on, or if you will just be a contractor for your entire duration of being here. But don't worry, they barely ever fire anyone."
good,"Great company to work for in terms of IT products, got an American style of doing things here in Canada, CDW is either you got it or not but I love the trips and co workers"
good,"CDW-G. Public Sector side of this company has very low incentive at this time. Customers are not open minded to change their current partnerships which as an Account Manager, requires additional investments into the long term relationship building part of the business. CDW does not compensate for this and it leaves the Account Manager in an extremely stressful position to perform. "
good,"America made, not British, service was terrible working with international clients, needed a total overhaul of management in the Peterborough branch. "
good,"I learned selling and more about IT products but ultimately was set up for failure with accounts pulls and team splits. I was in a class that caught the short end of the stick. Also more times that not, most of the account managers with higher books tend to be favorites."
good,"Amazing people at all levels of management.  Provided great opportunities to integrate into the company and very flexible and open culture to try new things.  Managers get lot of respect and independence to manage their own teams.  Mentoring and coaching is available and encouraged, and senior management and executive staff is very accessible."
good,"As long as you toe the line of what upper management expects from you then you will be fine, possibly even promoted but otherwise watch your back. You are expendable."
good,"CDW is a decent company to work for. However, this is prodiminally a sales company, NOT an IT company. There are zero salary increases or bonuses for anyone who is not working in sales. "
good,"CDW turned into an old boys club after going public and it was all about the numbers and not the people or culture.  The pretty pictures on the wall are that all it is, pretty pictures."
good,"CDW is a very stressful environment to work for. I was unhappy most days and couldn't deal with the micro managing brought down by everyone above you."
good,"CDW is the number 1 Reseller in Canada. The company is fast paced and competitive. Work Life balance is still at its infant stages as work from home technology is still improving. Some managers are completely deflective of job responsibilities, yet persist due to higher management connections."
good,Very flat organization as they are a reseller.FP&A team is like 10 positions or so when i was there. Very challenging to move around the company. Good suburban location.
good,"- No room for growth "
good,"During the training process you will be fed a bunch of ****.  Every current Salesperson you will speak to will constantly talk to you as if you were joining a pyramid scheme."
good,"Management does not replace workers when they leave. Or it takes months and months to replace even an entry level employee. A couple of my coworkers were relieved, I got alot of extra work, and management refused to compensate. I respected my work-time and was highly productive and respected by my peers. If I were expected to take on so much extra, I would require compensation. Upon their refusal, I decided 100% to leave."
good,Inconsistent practices for coworkers depending on what role they have.  Programs are designed for one type of coworker. Inconsistent management of resources. Advancement is inconsistent.
good,"They do not know how to keep workers working there. They over work, and don’t pay too much attention to the contractors. They fire and hire people weekly, there’s so much going on with them. The management does not care about what you have going on in life, they will fire you for any reason."
good,Decent company and culture but know that they are fully aware CDW compensates lower than in similar companies. If you join the company just know that raises and advancement take time and may not meet your expectations.
good,"it was good to work there fun flex hours love the people no advancement no challenge, same thing over and over and over and over no chance to get hired or promoted"
good,"If you are coming right out of college. CDW is a good place to start. It will get you ready for the workplace."
good,"Very low base salary and difficult to compensate with commission. The good accounts are already all taken, takes at least 2 years to build long lasting relationships."
good,Overall they are a great organization but you have to keep in mind if you choose a production or sales based role you're going to be challenged at a high level and that may not be for everyone but as far as opportunity in other areas they the field is wide open and a great place to be so pick your role wisely and make as many friends as you can and have fun along the way.
good,There was no room for growth. There was a lot of turnover and little to no training. Any complaints about other departments were completely dismissed and project management was blamed for most mistakes.
good,"Amazing people at all levels of management.  Provided great opportunities to integrate into the company and very flexible and open culture to try new things.  Managers get lot of respect and independence to manage their own teams.  Mentoring and coaching is available and encouraged, and senior management and executive staff is very accessible."
good,"Great resources and products, Sales are held with high sales expectations, but the pay is average.  Great work culture if you are not in sales.  Project management roles are usually stuck in a an office 8 plus hours a day."
good,"In this work you are configuring computers, servers and mobile devices. It is a good place to start your IT career if you have no IT background. Most boring part of the job is tagging units, because at the begging you will do a lot of them."
good,"Most of all, I was lied to when it came to the job description I was given. days seemed very drawn out and long. bent over a table most the day doing tedious configurations on Chromebooks.Management was friendly, but a little to worrisome. if you showed any sign of not liking the job, they would bother you to make sure you're fine, even if you were just stretching."
good,More understanding for employees. Having more sympathy for personal issues. Try to have the culture built from bottom up rather top bottom.
good,"This company has a great culture for 20 somethings. The main issue is with growth, there is no room for it."
good,"The Upper management (supervisor and above) are very supportive of temps and CDW employees and have a great and mature personality. Easy going and easy to work with, very friendly and are able to meet your needs.I always feel relived when they come and check in. As for the Lower management (Team leads and below) they do not know what they are doing. Its a shame that most of the time you have to report to a set up ""leaders"" that 1. have no sense on how to do their job right. 2. will blame you for a mistake they have made. 3. giving no regard to respect and will make it publicly known that they are scolding you. "
good,"lots of phone calls, talk time, cold calls, and reviewing these daily with management"
good,"This is a job. Extreme hours, little notice. Coworkers seem to keep to themselves. Overall decent place to solidify experience."
good,"great potential. Sink or Swim place, but thrived under pressure"
good,"With “leadership” from inside sales when this role was first introduced, the field account execs had to carefully navigate and coordinate those inside reps.  No doubt things are better now....but I felt a distinct value vacuum when trying to sell pro services.  Hope it’s better now, they are a great company for sure."
good,Go to work be on time do your work stay to yourself respect others keep your conversation at a bare minimum follow all of the rules and go home and allow your quality of work and your assertiveness speak for itself and all in all CYB that's abbreviation is for cover your backside meaning complete your job duties. Then go home .
good,"a typical day at work included making calls out to customers"
good,"I gived my 100% to make sure everything that has to by shipping and loaded by end of the day."
good,"Work would start on time. Typical day began by double checking the route for each truck for the day. I would have the loads for the trucks organized the day before in reverse order in order to keep the load of the truck organized. Once the trucks were loaded and on the road, I would proceed to check for returns or damaged labels. Once all tasks in the warehouse were completed I would organize and shift through paperwork and business receipts in order to prepare for taxes. The owner was a nice man but he did request personal tasks to be done such as taking him to the dentist or picking up his dry cleaning. These tasks were usually given so I could have hours on my paycheck. It wasn't easy to build hours at this job since there were only two of us in the warehouse at a time and most of the work could be completed by one person. I enjoyed the freedom of being able to busy myself when there was nothing else to do by cleaning and organizing different parts of the warehouse."
good,Job has some nice perks. Visited often by partners who have swag and other available gifts. Training is thorough. Good job if you are interested in sales
good,The base salary is very low. It is great job out of college and great start into the IT sales field. Cold calling is a must. Your customers in the book of business is hand down accounts the tenured reps do not want. Minimum of two hours of phone time and over a hundred calls a day.
good,"They play favorites, are afraid of capable employees, they say that they support growth but they themselves do not have any room for these so-called grown specialists."
good,"Only way to make cash is if you are in your seat, and stay after hours.  It was a tough job, but a lesson as to how to work in the sales /customer service world."
good,"To be successful, you need to work long hours and get lucky. I was able to successful, but i have seen many leave since due to low pay, benefits, and overall un-needed stress they put on the account managers."
good,"Amazing people at all levels of management.  Provided great opportunities to integrate into the company and very flexible and open culture to try new things.  Managers get lot of respect and independence to manage their own teams.  Mentoring and coaching is available and encouraged, and senior management and executive staff is very accessible."
good,"CDW was great for balancing work and life, but fell short from management expectations and noted ""good boys club"". If navigated thoroughly, advancement is possible. One must come in ready to fit what image they are going for, or will be judged as a number more than a person."
good,"Worked Mon-Friday 730am until 5-6PM, I learned most computer selling and hardware skills here.  The hardest part of the job is the management.  It was a total boys club."
good,Pay could improve. Although I am hustling to make every dollar some months are more like a roller  coaster than security. However it is sales thats to be expected.
good,They  focus on your sales and how many phone calls you make and how long your phone time is. Very Micro Managed. Favorites get the good accounts when people leave or are let go.
good,It's a fast growing company but you will get burned out. Management seldom listens to the complaints of their employees they focus on what can be delivered.
good,"Fun place to work, but only 25% of people make REAL money if:"
good,"If you work your butt off for 2 years and get placed into a profitable region/vector, you will succeed at CDW. It is a continuous grind that may pay off in the long run. Very high turnover rate."
good,"I guess I am just wondering why you are concerned with CDW?"
good,"Good entry level, but poor advancement opportunities. Depending on what segment and who becomes your manager will make this more enjoyable. More is always demanded and added to the day, but no additional assistance is provided."
good,"My manager is great guy and really understandable , the work is a little stressful but friendly coworkers , for me it is time consuming while I am seeking to develop my carrier in different field."
good,"Culture was good, but a lot has changed. With recent changes company isn't the same. Benefits and perks were amazing, but actual job was extremely stressful."
good,"CDW-G is a great starting place for a career in sales. The training is top notch. The sales people are great as colleagues and everyone is willing to help out. However, the pay structure is awful and unreliable."
good,"CDW is a great resume builder straight out of college. However, once you're off your parents insurance and paying your own bills and such, it's nearly impossible to make a living wage. Base salary is low and most markets are fairly saturated. In sales, you make your own money, 100%. But it's difficult to maintain when metrics are constantly being changed or ""realigned."""
good,Make sure you know what you are getting into. The company is going through changes and the information that is online is not an accurate representation of what the reality is.
good,typical day begins prior to 8:00 AM with either travel to customer site or preparation for customer call with constant managerial oversight in a work culture that is unrelenting.  The most difficult part of the job was guessing what management would ask next with little or no recognition for results produced.  The most enjoyable part of the job was producing good outcomes for customers with colleagues that are respected
good,"You will work with lots of different brands of PCs,laptop,servers etc."
good,CDW is a very corporate entity. Employees are required to make a minimum amount of daily cold calls. Little help was given and it was a sicknor swim mentality. Once a book of business was established compensation was decent.
good,"great working relationship with team "
good,"I was hired into a technical role and was provided with virtually no training/onboarding and was expected to figure out how to do everything on the fly.  System is set up well for employees that move up from entry level account manager, but not if brought directly into a support role."
good,"They provide excellent training, but unfortunately you're extremely micromanaged. You will learn a lot about the IT industry as well. There are some successful individuals, but they are far and few in between."
good,"Amazing people at all levels of management.  Provided great opportunities to integrate into the company and very flexible and open culture to try new things.  Managers get lot of respect and independence to manage their own teams.  Mentoring and coaching is available and encouraged, and senior management and executive staff is very accessible."
good,"fun place to work, young organization, the company knows how to celebrate and have a good time. There isn't enough management, its a flat organization. Hard to determine career path."
good,This is a great Fortune 500 company to launch a sales-driven career!
good,"Outbound sales. Managed accounts within diverse industries, selling individual components and value added solutions. Hosted Red Carpet CEO/IT Manager meetings to close enterprise level sales. Worked with engineers to specify product qualification and solution accuracy. Successfully established relationships with new accounts in a multi-regional territory."
good,"Built links between communities and local government and other statutory bodies. Regularly work with community groups and Statutory bodies to address inequality, Empower the communities Encourage and empower targeted communities perceived to be culturally, economically or geographically disadvantaged."
good,"so i would turn up, go canteen beat a few people on the pool table, then when its five to nine i would clock in and get the required tools to start my days work, weather that be replening items on the ppt or picking them on the shop floor. hard part was long picks where you really have to remmebr whrre you are"
good,"Very big on celebrating coworkers, emphasis on celebrating coworker accomplishments.  Provide opportunities for coworkers to celebrate each other and also to acknowledge on the company level."
good,"Good growth opportunity and constant training. "
good,"Not my fave place to work. I met some wonderful people, however. I would advise other designers to understand that the management does not understand the value of UX so you will spend the majority of your time trying to sell the value of your job."
good,"Depends on what area you are in. Can be very limited in terms of career advancement, but overall a good place to work. As with any business there is a lot of changes continuously happening."
good,"The intern program is one of the best out there. However, the day-to-day work among interns in similar fields varies drastically. Dependent on the manager an intern can be allowed to run free or watched under a microscope."
good,Great place to start a career.  CDW puts a lot into developing their employees skills and training. If your starting your career this is the company for you.
good,CDW is a great place to start your sales career. They provide technical as well as sales training. It is well respected in the industry and run efficiently and with integrity. There are many career avenues for young people to explore especially in the Illinois locations.
good,The company is very accommodating and good to work for.  They are very fast-paced.  The people are very nice and professional.  Their HR department is very competent.
good,Nothing bad to say ok company to work for great training for associates and leaders. I would recommend this company for people with high levels of self motivation.
good,Good learning experience . learned on the fly  very good technicians got the job done. pay was low and no progres for promotions. Management changed things too foten
good,"Amazing people at all levels of management.  Provided great opportunities to integrate into the company and very flexible and open culture to try new things.  Managers get lot of respect and independence to manage their own teams.  Mentoring and coaching is available and encouraged, and senior management and executive staff is very accessible."
good,"Good place to start to work, If you re willing to learn new things you got it. Shift depend on the department but most likely daily time. Every quarter you get free lunch"
good,"Great experience at CDW, gave me the opportunity to learn and grow and adapt in my field of work, only downside is after two years I was hoping to be promoted or go up a position but unfortunately did not get the positions I applied for."
good,Company is very goal oriented and mindful of employees. A lot of privileges and benefits to doing the job according to management. The only real down fall is the lack of imagination and innovation. Performance is strictly measured by numeric tangibles rather than a dedication to craft and customer experience. Leaders beware followers wanted.
good,"For me it just wasn't the right fit of where I wanted my career to go. I believe the Management is there for the right reasons and they truly want to see their employees succeed. However, the work was mundane and I didn't like my entire salary being based almost always on commission."
good,"A typical day at work is full of customer and partner meetings. My job is to lead any technical related purchase request from infancy to fruition. Most of the time I am sitting at my computer working on projects or talking to customers on the phone or in person. The hardest part of the job is staying on top of all the solutions I propose, but there is a ton of help from management and partners to keep me on task."
good,"Great culture, Great company, Lots to Learn. a lot of politics.. good old boys club. low compensation.  great benefits. free lunches and happy hours.."
good,The job is not hard but you are a glorified assembly line worker in a factory. If you are starting in IT and need experience its a good place to start. otherwise would not recommend.
good,"Not bad, good work environment. Enjoyed my time there. Um got the job through a temp agency and worked for them little over a year. work was easy, simple tasks as far as pulling items for different orders. Hardest part would be standing for long periods for the first few days but you adjust with time."
good,CDW provides the opportunity to make a lot of money but you have to be financially stable to take a non livable salary for 3 years. No career advancement unless you want to be a manager your entire career.
good,I should not have to review any past positions just to use indeed. If I had known this was a requirement I would have chosen a different forum..........
good,"CDW was an okay place to work. Very competitive, felt as though I was somewhat targeted but I still did my job. Pay was good, reason why I stayed so long. As far as the coworkers, they weren't the nicest or realest but it was tolerable as long as I kept my mind on my job."
good,"Good entry level job into the IT industry"
good,"CDW is a fantastic place to learn about the information technology industry and the sales process. However, there is no room for growth unless you plan on moving to another position within CDW or another company altogether. To be successful in the Account Manager role, you must be highly motivated by money and willing to work longer hours than normal."
good,While I enjoy working here there are a lot of things wrong with the business structure.  There are just too many managers and they all feel entitled based on their position in the company.  There are a lot of great people who work there so the few ones that are not so great tend to go unnoticed.  It might be that once you become management you are in the club and it doesn't matter how terrible you might be at being a manager.  Either way there is a lot of good and some bad to deal with.  Just hope the bad doesn't affect you but often times if it does it will go unnoticed.
good,The company does not provide competitive salary or benefits. They make you work very hard and odd hours for very little pay. This is not a place to build a career.
good,CDW is a good place to work if your looking for a great start to grow with a great company but at the time i was there the pay was not what i needed at the time.
good,"Growing technology company with top down approach to setting goals that align with management. Focus on exceeding yearly goals."
good,"Most of the people hired here are straight out of college and just want to get their feet wet. They start you out with a very low salary and hope that you are hungry enough to work your way up. Once you are established you can make very good money, but there's not much room for growth.  It's a very stressful and demanding and management has a tendency to micromanage which adds to the issue.  If you can survive the daily grind you can do very well for yourself, but truthfully most people burn out after a couple of years."
good,"Low pay, great perks. Great job for coming out of college and comes with many perks such as sporting events and happy hours. You can be successful depending on your territory"
good,I was told at the start the contract would be 3 weeks with the potential of being extended. This was not the as at all. The contract only lasted for two weeks. The experience itself was not bad but that was more thanks to CDW.
good,"Amazing people at all levels of management.  Provided great opportunities to integrate into the company and very flexible and open culture to try new things.  Managers get lot of respect and independence to manage their own teams.  Mentoring and coaching is available and encouraged, and senior management and executive staff is very accessible."
good,"There are a ton of changes happening right now. You can make yourself a great career there or it can open doors to many other avenues. Fantastic young persons job and if you are good, you can make a lot of money. I'm not certain of the satellite locations, but the Riverside location is 7 huge floors of awesome right downtown Chicago. There are multiple free lunches per week, tons of swag being tossed around, there are happy hours any day of the week hosted by any of the hundreds of partners plus exposure to director and VPs to get that face time."
good,"Enjoyed being able to take a project from start to finish using and participating in all phases of the SDLC.  The ability to work closely with the business and operation community made it enjoyable and provide satisfaction.  Working with QA team was also an area of interest and satisfaction.   Being able to ensure a project met requirements and the users' needs was key to implementing a successful project."
good,"Learned a lot during my time there however, I didn't see many people of color in upper management. Great place to start your career and grow from your experiences."
good,I worked in multiple departments and it was an interesting experience to see the company from differing viewpoints based on the division you are part of. It's a typical big business full of good and bad.
good,"Other than my direct manager, CDW is filled with wonderful people.  I'd recommend it to others.  Great partnerships with internal teams and business partners."
good,"CDW is a good entry level sales job, with many recent graduates, and a excellent sales training program. The job however has a low base salary which can lead to high turnover, but high enough commission that leads to many earning a high salary in their second year."
good,"A great first job out of college.  I learned a tremendous amount in my four years here, many skills of which I will carry with me throughout my entire career."
good,Great place to learn sales.  Typical day consists of cold calls and sending quotes to new customers.  You must continually grow your book of business or it will be difficult to stay more than one year.
good,Fast paced enviroment with heavy empasis on coworker performance.  Coworkers were easy to work with and enjoyable.
good,"•	Provide onsite Technical Support for the Configuration Center to solve hardware, software advanced setup. "
good,"Completing customer's orders in a timely fashion, to keep a good productivity level."
good,"Even though it was a short stint, I learned many strategies in the sales world. "
good,A typical day at work consisted of managing the freight audit.  I learned how to become efficient with the vendors and customers.  The management team was determined to empower us to grow within the company.  The hardest part of my position was to ensure every billing was correct within our system.  But most importantly your co-worker were great team players.  Great company to work for.
good,"Fun company to work for - always something exciting going on. Young coworkers, fresh out of college and university. Easy to move up and advance, unfortunately pay & benefits are not competitive with positions elsewhere within the industry."
good,"OK company to work for, opportunity to move within the company to gain experience."
good,"Only in the technician area, did we see the extreme prejudice against black women"
good,CDW provides products and expertise to drive solutions solving business problems.
good,-Once was a great place to work
good,Great company to work for!
good,Got my feet wet in sales and figured out that I did not want to spend my days behind a desk at a call center.
good,"Amazing people at all levels of management.  Provided great opportunities to integrate into the company and very flexible and open culture to try new things.  Managers get lot of respect and independence to manage their own teams.  Mentoring and coaching is available and encouraged, and senior management and executive staff is very accessible."
good,"The job was okay, hours were long but I got along with some of my coworkers, and the pay was good."
good,Management takes contractors and technicians for granted. Team leaders aren't very efficient and leave their duties on the shoulders of others. You do make good friends here though.
good,"At CDW, there is a big focus on work life balance so it is nice to know that you can have both a personal and career life and not worry about one over the other."
good,"Nice work atmosphere with a ""casual Friday"" dress code everyday. Always busy trying to up-sell current clients or gain new business. Competitive environment but it was always treated as a team!"
good,Was a great first job because they provide a lot of training when you first start. good perks is fun activities for the office and people are generally helpful.
good,"lots of phone calls........................................................................"
good,The company is great and values coworkers personal life. Challenges are different with everyone and sometimes accounts get handed to people who may not deserve them.
good,"high turnover rate, but high energy and fun workplace. lots of college students straight from college start here. teams and management seemed to change often, leaving teams a bit confused"
good,"Currently I am employed by CDW Canada as a Health Care Account Manager. This position requires me to multi-task and work under pressure to meet deadlines with accuracy. Working with key decision makers I design IT solutions that meet the client’s budgets and deadlines. My position requires me to quote jobs from RFP/RFQ, tenders, and bids."
good,Print out your order and start working on it. i would work on project based orders as such I had a team that I trained on how to preform the job. I would also send emails and enter data on a daily basis.
good,"Great training program, fun work environment, co-workers are friendly and management is always there to help."
good,I enjoyed my time there and I learned a lot about sales. Money was OK.
good,"If inside sales is your thing, this is the place for you.  Potential to make great money.  Solid opportunities to advance your career."
good,"It was a beginning level contract job.   2nd shift was okay kept somewhat busy.  The security was tight.  I would like it better, if it paid better.  It was okay."
good,"great team of staff  looking to get the company going in the right direction, hardest part of job ,checking on customers  and a lack of correct  training"
good,"Motivated employees, but understaffed in the engineering ranks causing some strong technical personnel to leave.  People are great, but overworked.  Compensation is good."
good,"They should improve more contractors getting hire by the company. "
good,CDW is a fun place to work. There are lots of fun events and a lot of great people who work there. The happy hours that are sponsored by CDW's partners are definitely a nice perk for putting in a hard day of work at the office.
good,"Effectively a paid internship as you are told by veteran employees that if you're not making good money by year two, you're not going to get a whole lot more out of CDW."
good,"Good company to work for with many growth opportunities and training, but if you are starting as an account manager (entry level sales) do not expect to make any money for the first 1-2 years."
good,"Amazing people at all levels of management.  Provided great opportunities to integrate into the company and very flexible and open culture to try new things.  Managers get lot of respect and independence to manage their own teams.  Mentoring and coaching is available and encouraged, and senior management and executive staff is very accessible."
good,"Good job, poor benefits, no upward mobility."
good,"I love the people I work with, but something is missing.  I've been trying to advance within the company for the last two years (and I've been here for 4) but have barely been able to get an interview, even with stellar reviews. The branch of CDW I work for was acquired several years before I came here and changes have been rapid.  Many of my coworkers are happy, and many are frustrated.  I would recommend this company to high level candidates, but avoid it at entry level."
good,Not the place to be if you do not like cold calling or being on the phone. Starting pay is very low for being in Chicago.
good,"CDW is a great place to work if you want low-stress days with very little worry about work when you're not there. You are paid fairly low in the industry but in most cases, your eight or nine hour day involves time for lunch (or even the gym) as well as enough personal time to view emails, websites, etc as long as you get your work done (which you will). There is not great mobility and is not a place that makes a lot of sense for people in the middle of their career still trying to move up the corporate ladder but you get a lot of great experience as a straight out of university worker as well as a great place for older or more established workers that want/need a work-life balance for their family."
good,It's a good job pays well. Don't feel like the managers really appreciate the hard work people do. Some of the managers forget to do things for you when its urgent
good,The company isn't bad at all for Med/Lar or Gov. But the Reston office is new and was given a territory that was already combed through. So the pay wasn't that great.
good,"excellent work culture and team work environment. always something going on, vendor lunches/ happy hours, company events, free vendor swag. you become great friends with the people you work with. i met some of  my best friends working at CDW."
good,If your looking for a career in sales this is one of the best companies to work for. Their sales training program is one of the best in the states.
good,"Overall I loved working for CDW, and stayed there for quite a long time.  The work day was lively, and the environment was very upbeat with fun young people to be around. "
good,"Friendly teams across the company - empathetic and great energy"
good,overall it was a pleasant experience. Work is fast paced and you always have something to do. Management was great. some other employees are very competitive. have there own cliques.
good,"Overall, the company truly has a great culture. Developed skills in IT, procurement, and account management. There is opportunity to move within depending on how you perform in your role."
good,"Stressful at times"
good,"If you're looking for a company that you can use as leverage as a stepping stone in your career aside from Sales, then a place like this is perfect. "
good,"With CDW, if you're prepared to put in the work they will reward you. Management activily encourage you to improve and better yourself."
good,"Great training that lasts 6 months, felt close with the training class I was with and management was great.  Low pay to start but get a ton of free stuff from vendors and can advance to another position fairly easily."
good,Great company to start out with. Great culture and a lot of interesting people.
good,Minimal direction.  Minimal opportunity unless you are grand fathered in   Isolation.  Strong company for people that want to walk in and do a job and not look for secessions.  Unless you are in sales
good,Get here before 8am leave around 5pm. Some food given and Some drinks given. Wear business casual. Very political and favoritism exists heavily here...
good,"Amazing people at all levels of management.  Provided great opportunities to integrate into the company and very flexible and open culture to try new things.  Managers get lot of respect and independence to manage their own teams.  Mentoring and coaching is available and encouraged, and senior management and executive staff is very accessible."
good,I liked working at CDW but felt that I was held back by some members of upper management because I wasn't in their circle of friends or developed in their style.
good,Worked there for 6 years let go because the job title and responsibilities changed. In the beginning they were great and treated you like an adult. Then they started to micro manage. Overall a decent company I guess. Better for management position than an employee.
good,"CDW can be a very different experience depending on which team you are alligned to. Some teams are extremely busy while others can be very quiet."
good,"Beginning as a sales representative at CDW will likely include working under a manager who has no management experience, working for high-maintenance customers who expect you to live up to their last account representative's abilities (often a highly tenured and experienced seller with work from home privileges), and countless after-work happy hours where coworkers get highly intoxicated and sometimes act inappropriately. But if you have a beer at lunch on a Friday, you will get written up and sent home."
good,"The customer verticals and territories are very stifling"
good,"Great place to work, room for growth. Always room to learn new products. Management always willing to help if needed room for improvement. Learning something new was always fun"
good,"CDW is a great company, best first full time job as a graduate. Reality hits you really fast, issues happens on a daily basis, so you need to learn how to solve them at a quick pace. Every problem you have, there will always be a solution."
good,This was a great place to work.  I left for a better opportunity.  I would recommend this job to someone who is just starting out.
good,"I was a temp there and was offered a job as a full time employee, but there is no room for advancement. Management likes to make jobs harder than what they are."
good,CDW provide fantastic sales training to newcomers to the industry and a great refresher for people with experience.  Its hard work yet yields great results.  For anyone looking to get into the industry this would be the place to start.
good,upload reports - work with receiving department and AR department to close any open orders
good,"configuring computers, printers, iPods, Tablets etc."
good,Great Company to work for and I look forward to working with them again in the future. I gained allot of experience working there and I look forward to taking with me in to the next opportunity.
good,Great co workers and work enviornment. They care about their employees and treating them fair. Very fast past and their always something new to learn.
good,Good company to work for.  You can broaden your career and there are several career paths to chose from.  It is harder to move into management or upper management though.
good,"Revolving door. "
good,"Amazing people at all levels of management.  Provided great opportunities to integrate into the company and very flexible and open culture to try new things.  Managers get lot of respect and independence to manage their own teams.  Mentoring and coaching is available and encouraged, and senior management and executive staff is very accessible."
good,CDW allows employees to be themselves and make each day as good as you want to be. CDW provides many opportunities for advancements and ways to be successfully using the tools they provide.
good,I liked the work and everything so far. Everyone is friendly and cooperative. For me personally I didn't see many negatives. Work kept going up and down. Sometimes we would get send to others areas and I actually enjoyed learning other things and not just the one type of task I was set to do daily.
good,perfect start to a career in IT. the training program is extensive and the commission structure is amazing. its hard in the first few months but the hustle pays off
good,Early to work and late to get home. The salary itself is not great but you can make more than enough in commission to make up for that. I worked for there for 5 years and was making 100k by my third year there.
good,Help with customer's orders and returns. Work with account managers to provide good customer service.  Transfer customers to sales team or account manager to process new orders.
good,"interned, good experience overall. I think that they are a little too controlling or completely leave you on your own. very focused on paper work. I don't know what a full time position is like though."
good,"The environment was great, the people were also great. I would recommend this job to others because it's a lot of room to grow. The training program is great and they want the employees to succeed."
good,An enjoyable place to work.  Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help.  A lot of room for growth.  Always a positive attitude within the office.
good,"Growing organization, with exciting endeavors to improve productivity through investment in infrastructure. Great people, lots of opportunities to learn."
good,Lots of internal battles. Spiffs and bonuses are great. Made great friends but also enemies with all the accounts you need to take to sustain business.
good,"CDW is a thriving company with a rich culture.  I have the privilege of driving inclusion within the organization, so that all coworkers feel valued, are able to contribute, and maximize their talents within the organization."
good,"Extensive training program, great co-workers, account manager hardest part is the long time it takes to get to the floor with the base being what it is. Most enjoyable part of the job is the perks."
good,"A typical day at work would look like 80 “touches” every day. That means I’ll need to make calls to customers and quotes – 80 of them every day. In addition to that I ‘ll need to check for product stock, respond to client’s e-mails and requests, release orders, trainings."
good,The challenging part of this job to analyzed business requirement and develop Technical design as per business requirement.Business discussion with client and do the gap analysis for different systems.Handle offshore and onsite Team.
good,If you are a hard worker there is no cap that you can hit. Your salary is dependent on how hard you work. Top makers crack 6 figures and you can easily do that within your first 5 years.
good,Good Place to Start a career. Place for growth and develop new skills. Plenty of other options and departments. Good place to meet and discover new friends
good,"typical sales environment, good place to work. Coworkers are good and it is a very nice work environment."
good,"Amazing people at all levels of management.  Provided great opportunities to integrate into the company and very flexible and open culture to try new things.  Managers get lot of respect and independence to manage their own teams.  Mentoring and coaching is available and encouraged, and senior management and executive staff is very accessible."
good,Good company to work for. There are opportunities to move laterally and otherwise in this company. Good work culture.
good,Productive and fun place to work. Many sales benefits available.
good,There is never a dull day at CDW. Each day in sales is different because each customer has their own unique needs. Very casual work atmosphere with a mix of coworkers of all ages/backgrounds. You can be successful if you work hard. A little luck also goes a long way!
good,"A typical day at CDW involves managing your book of business and trying to grow this book. Whether it be setting up conference calls or going to trainings. You are required to be on the phone and hit certain metrics. The coworkers are the best of the job, it is a very young atmosphere. The hardest part of the job is staying motivated and knowing you will not be hitting goal."
good,"Hard working, fun environment."
good,Work hard and make great money. Atmosphere is fun. Looked forward to coming into work every day.
good,Lots of opportunity to grow at the same time good opportunity to learn about technology.
good,"If you are great at sales good"
good,I enjoyed working there because of the people. I dislike the shift I had. Working 3rd shift impact my family and was hard to have a lifestyle. Would go back but for 1st shift.
good,Good company to work for. The knowledge and technology is amazing. Great for entry position in Technology. Not always fun but it is an experience to be had.
good,"CDWs strategy is to hire young, talented people and mold them into very savvy professionals.  The catch is you will be under paid for average work and only when your work is exceptional will you make some serious income.  It’s a good place for people who work hard and have ambition.  If you plan to coast, you won’t make much money.  Leadership within the company is good in most places.  Some leaders- those that have been at CDW 20+ years- need to be replaced."
good,CDW focuses on there sales team above all else. If your in a support position outside of the Chicago office you can get forgotten easily.  If you can manage yourself this is a great company.
good,Not much room for growth. Didn't have the best time while there. Management really kept to a core group of people and career path was not really defined.
good,CDW is a great place to work if you want a great work life balance.  You become part of the family and they often make sure you take care of family first so that is one of the best part of the culture there.
good,CDW is a great place to work.  Great teamwork and collaboration.  Everyone helps with the success of the company.  I would recommend anyone to take a look at CDW for a career.
good,"Great job starting out of college.  Sink or swim atmosphere once you hit 4 years due to compensation plan being very aggressive.  Very high earnings potential, and good company culture."
good,"Based on a respectable salary and unlimited commissions, so the money really isn't the issue if you're willing to work for it.  The people are great and totally make the job."
good,"CDw is a great place to start your Sales Career. Also, A great place to start a career in Vender sales. Helpful people if you have the right mentors. Many different people to work with and a lot of knowledge in the company. Some people will never give any knowledge up and others will only do the bare min. big corporate world with a lot of corporate rules and sometimes make you question how do things get done."
good,worked here for 13 years and learned a great deal. Very well run company that puts the employees first. wonderful culture and allows you to have a great work/life balance. would love to work here again and would recommenced this company to anyone.
good,"Amazing people at all levels of management.  Provided great opportunities to integrate into the company and very flexible and open culture to try new things.  Managers get lot of respect and independence to manage their own teams.  Mentoring and coaching is available and encouraged, and senior management and executive staff is very accessible."
good,This is a good company. It's just not a good fit for me. CDW sales forced is basically entirely designed for entry level sales people.
good,"Answering incoming calls from customers and performing Level 1 technical support to determine what assistance is needed.  I've learned a lot about troubleshooting and different hardware products.  Co-workers are awesome and knowledgeable,  always willing to answer any questions.  Hardest part of the job is being somewhat new to all the procedures.  Most enjoyable is the atmosphere and the people I work with."
good,"The job itself was great with a lot of training available.  But there is a lot of travel involved with this position.  When you have a family it makes it tough, but they try to give where they can."
good,"With CDW (corporate division, Medium/Large) you'll start off building a book of business from scratch. Through hard work and a little luck you have unlimited income potential."
good,"Worked during a management restructuring time, and didn't like the direction dept. was going. This is the main reason I did not stay longer with the company. Great benefits but low pay for job requirements at the time."
good,This job is cool if ur a temp u get treated like an employee youll get included in most things they got going on in there but as a temp you may be a temp a bit over a year before you get hired on or even longer i guess thats the only con about that place and epstein didnt kill himself
good,"A company who cares about its staff, and who serves with heart. "
good,"When there is nothing to do for your role you are kind of screwed, stare at your screen and hope things come in to keep you busy."
good,Good company to start your career with. They set you up with a good starting point in business to business sales. You are required to manage accounts and provide order management as well as business development.
good,"CDW is a great place to start a career. They provide you with an Intense training program. They constantly provided free lunch and after work activity's. However, the pay is low so after some experience there is high turn over."
good,"CDW is an interesting place to work. For technical folks I think it falls a little below the mark from a growing perspective, for everyone else it is pretty great. The technical culture is a bit lacking and the emphasis is not on learning and understanding technology. This is great for sales folks, but can be difficult to adapt to if you are a technical minded person."
good,"I really love CDW's culture and benefits. It is a friendly place to work, and they look out for their employees. I would recommend it as a great launching point for a career either at CDW or elsewhere in the IT field."
good,simply a good group of people that can make it fun to work.  managers are not well trained and tend to not share information with each other .  A lot of things to be involved with a a lot of community outreach.
good,great culture and training gives you a  leg up on other sales companies.   base salary is incredibly low and not competitive at all and can take a while to get good commission coming through.
good,The work environment is fast paced with many opportunities to learn different tasks.  The hardest part of the job is the coworkers.  The most enjoyable part was helping customers.
good,"Excellent company to experience diverse industries. Work as always challenging and interesting. Advancement into was difficult, and was ultimately the reason I departed. Enjoyed my time there."
good,"CDW was a great company to work for! for 2 years, I worked across a variety of industries from bakeries to builders supporting a variety of infrastructures from big to small."
good,"CDW has taught me many valuable skills that can be applied in many other roles in the corporate world. It is a great starting point for someone who has just graduated with a bachelor's in the business field, and an even better career for someone lacking a degree. There are plenty of positions outside of sales, if you are willing to relocate near their headquarters/distribution centers."
good,"It is a great company to work for. I was a short time contractor. Co-workers are very helpful. IT service helpdesk is awesome! Management is very supportive of the work, project and employees."
good,"Amazing people at all levels of management.  Provided great opportunities to integrate into the company and very flexible and open culture to try new things.  Managers get lot of respect and independence to manage their own teams.  Mentoring and coaching is available and encouraged, and senior management and executive staff is very accessible."
good,The best in the industry for a reason.  I still cherish my time at CDW and wish I never left.  They are a truly gifted company that knows talent and the IT industry.
good,"I love the people here."
good,I have made great friends over the years! I know I can count on them for anything. I can call them and just talk about work or even life in general.
good,"CDW is a great place to work as long as you are dedicated and are willing to roll with the changes.  Technology is not a place for people that are not willing to constantly upgrade skills and their relevance to clients.  CDW is no different in this respect."
good,Providing technical support for customers upgrading current Cisco VoIP system or implementing a new Cisco VoIP system.
good,"CDW is a great place to work, I've grown both personally and professionally during my tenure within CDW. Currently, the challenges reside in senior management and the ability to grow into a more refined senior management role. The hardest part is knowing change can be made however there isn't room to grow additional director and VP level roles."
good,Be prepared to learn a lot.  One of the best functions of this company is the chance to learn multiple facets of technology.
good,"Work at CDW will help hone your; sales, problem solving and technical skills. With such a broad product offering you really get to sample the entire industry. Account management starts off with plenty of cold and warms calls but easily transitions to mature customers management. You will receive endless trainings, some relevant and some very useless. If you start off in the wrong sales vertical (like small business) you can easily get trapped in a job that really does not offer alot of opportunity. Some make as high as 120k but they are the exception (15 in 150). Your first 2 years you will unlikely make more than 35k."
good,Positive work environment.  High energy levels and great benefits.  Management can be very supportive in career growth and success of your future.  Working here opens up many doors
good,CDW is an excellent place to start a sales career despite their out-dated business model and favoritism-based rewards for sales reps. Success is more about luck and low level management decisions than actual skill or effort. Top reps are top because of attrition and ability to mesh with corporate culture.
good,"Must be willing to learn different areas of your department. Be willing to work as a team or indepently, but at a steady pace. "
good,Its a great place to work! plenty of departments to move into if you decide to change. they do require at least 6 months into your position before that but plenty of areas to look into if you decide to change routes. also they make sure they find out what exactly are you looking to go into so they can help you as best as they can. only thing i would say is the starting pay definitely could and should be better a company like that should be paying you more starting than what they offer now.
good,"Great entry level job. If your looking for a high base this is not the place for you, but if you are interested and learning and growing at the same time this is a good place for you."
good,"Great culture. If you're in sales, be prepared to be micromanaged.  Culture is good, people are great, there is always food provided at least twice a week."
good,Highly Sales driven. Turn over is very high. Average goal growth yearly is usually around 18%. Gets harder to make the same money every year. City location is centered.
good,"CDW is great at developing and nurturing fresh talent, primarily in a first job out of school capacity. While there is distinct favoritism and sometimes style over substance, if you sell well you can be very successful. With that, it is luck of the draw to what segment/market you will be selling into."
good,CDW was a great organization to lay the foundation for my career coming out of college.  I learned a lot about sales and the IT industry and remain both in sales and tech today.
good,"Amazing people at all levels of management.  Provided great opportunities to integrate into the company and very flexible and open culture to try new things.  Managers get lot of respect and independence to manage their own teams.  Mentoring and coaching is available and encouraged, and senior management and executive staff is very accessible."
good,"CDW provides much in the way of training and invests properly in their employees, but finds ways to pay their sellers less than they are worth.  They are great at promoting the CDW corporate culture, though, so many stay with the company despite more advantageous opportunities elsewhere.  Still, they execute pretty well on what they do and it's a company you can stand behind and feel good about working for."
good,CDW is a fast paced environment with little in the way of benefits due to its small size.  It needs more trucks to run profitability.  With the lack of capital it is hard to purchase the trucks needed to be a success.
good,Great company to start out within an I.T Role. Downside is base pay and you need to get lucky with your book of business. I lucked into great account but many of my coworkers could not make 50 dollars a month in commission.
good,"CDW is a great company and really takes care of its employees. I was a contractor, so I did not get any of the benefits. It is a team-oriented environment, which is very helpful."
good,"There is no typical day."
good,Great Company - Current Manager is Bad.  Been with the company for a long time and have enjoyed the coworkers.  Benefits are great as is the work/life balance.
good,"As an inside sales account manager, you will learn all the basics of what it takes to become a successful salesperson.  CDW offers some of the best training for those who wish to pursue a career, not only in technology sales, but sales in general.  You will learn the art of cold-calling and prospecting new customers, network with some of the best in the industry and make-life long professional and personal relationships.  If you desire to stay in the technology sales field, then CDW offers advancement and leadership programs along with preferred hiring within for other positions in their organization.  Work-life balance is great and very flexible.  overall, CDW is a great company to work for!"
good,"Backbone departments and support teams aren't paid well, but if you make it in sales, you're golden. Great people, just very sales focused. It may be hard starting out in sales but stick with it if you want a good career at CDW."
good,"You get exposure to a lot of different departments and depending on your manager, a lot of opportunities to explore different career paths. There are some very bright and motivated people who work here but also a lot of dinosaurs that have been around forever in the same position. You get what you put in."
good,"Leading provider of technology products and services for business, government, and education, with over $10 billion in net sales, ranked number 270 on the Fortune 500 list."
good,CDW is a great place to work with an extensive academy training program. There are plenty of resources to help jump-start your career in sales. Co-workers are helpful and friendly and is a very laid back enviroment
good,"Success highly depends on where you are placed. Small Business highly lowers your chances of being successful. Accounts are recycled and it's easy to get burnt out."
good,"I learned to respect and appreciate window displays.  Prior to my internship, I never took a moment to understand how much effort goes to find props that a retailer wants for their displays.  The hardest part was realizing I would not be able to be creative when I thought I would be as well as the location.  The most enjoyable part was the overall experience."
good,"Working at CDW was a good learning and work experience. My co-workers were respectful and completed their tasks. I learned to balance my work life and my job life. It was a fast environment to be packaging, loading and unloaded at work. I like to stay busy and finish my work; at CDW we were always busy with shipping and receiving."
good,"Typical day will be reviewing proposals with clients and providing expert consultative recommendations of our services that best fit their business needs. "
good,Job culture is about average. Company has a good IT department. Not very many opportunities for advancement.
good,Job included fostering relationships with government institutions and working closely to fulfill their technology needs.  Strong communication skills and ability to connect with people over the phone were important skills for this position.
good,"To work here you have to be someone who is self motivated. It's a very competitive environment. However, if you are able to put in consistent efforts it will pay off. I learned what it takes to be successful in sales and business development."
good,"This employer really values the work/life balance as well as stresses the importance of giving back. Definitely a good company to work for that does consider its coworkers. However, moving up can be very difficult."
good,Complete excel spreadsheets to send to Vendors for return of defective or unwanted product.
good,"Amazing people at all levels of management.  Provided great opportunities to integrate into the company and very flexible and open culture to try new things.  Managers get lot of respect and independence to manage their own teams.  Mentoring and coaching is available and encouraged, and senior management and executive staff is very accessible."
good,CDW can be grueling for the fist year but after getting into the swing of things it becomes much easier in all aspects. The fist year can be even more rough because of the low base salary and you will be lucky to earn an extra 5-10k in commission within the year.
good,"Depending on what dept you work in will determine how long you remain at CDW. Sales, from my perception is good. Other than that, you need to keep your head on a swivel and make sure you pick up on the hidden clues of the changes of the organization."
good,"CDW is a great place to work due to the dynamic atmosphere and supportive coworkers. The position was a stepping stone for me and was not where I wanted to build my career, so it came time to part ways."
good,"From classrooms to warehouses, boardrooms to battlefields, CDW’s architects and advanced technology engineers have been designing, implementing and managing technology, communication and security solutions for growing businesses, leading universities, healthcare providers and all branches of the U.S. government for more than 30 years."
good,Great place for entry level sales. You can earn as much as you want no capped pay. Managers are there to help you succeed and make money.
good,Very professional corporation with great people to work with.  Quota driven with flexible management style.  Always working against last years number and pays well with achievement.
good,"Good place to work with good benefits.  Overall, I enjoyed working and  learning in a very pace environment.  It was crucial that all overnight orders went out on time and accuracy was paramount for CDW"
good,I was not able to stay with the company long enough to advance as I would have liked but the perks of the sales job were great!  I thought they did an excellent job preparing us for our involvement with discussing our products with clients.
good,"I learned hot to trouble shoot "
good,"Deal with many stakeholders across different department, such as account managers, buyers, brand managers, etc."
good,"Overall I like working for CDW but sales is not the field I want to build my career in.  If you love sales jobs, this job is great because your salary depends on the amount of sales you do each month."
good,If you can make it it is very possible to be successful. The first year is very rough but if you have heart and a work ethic after time goes by you make a lot of money.
good,"CDW is a good company to get your start in an IT career.  If you are experienced, whether on the engineering or sales side it is a good place to work."
good,"A leader in its industry by far."
good,"Account Manager"
good,"Like most, you will start an account manager. What division you go into and in what territory is a roll of the dice. Make the most of your opportunity and maybe you will become a vendor partner."
good,"My position as an account manager was rather repetitive on a daily basis but my managers were very good, and I often felt that I a great opportunity to move within the company. The hardest part of the job was cold calling customers but eventually I was used to it and learned how to take rejection lightly. My co-workers were great people, and I still speak with some of them years later."
good,"Chances to progress but would benefit to be flexible, willing to work hard toward set targets but targets are not unrealistic ability to communicate effectively"
good,"Great place to work. Industry leading training and sales coaching. I had years of over achieving my goal and it would increase YoY until a point I couldn't reach it, my book of business would not support it. Management would pull accounts prematurely but most were very easy to work with and want to help you succeed."
good,"Great sales job overall. The pay is initially very low, but has potential to become great if you are willing to stick it out, I would say at least 4 years. If you make it past that point you will be making good money, perhaps sooner of course, based on skill and how well you manage relationships with your customers and leadership team. It's often said that CDW is the hardest job at 30K and the easiest at 100K. I tend to agree with that, as in the beginning you are working on building your book of business and establishing customer relationships. This is much more of a grind than managing a relatively set book of business and growing it, which is what happens as you progress through your career as an account manager."
good,"Amazing people at all levels of management.  Provided great opportunities to integrate into the company and very flexible and open culture to try new things.  Managers get lot of respect and independence to manage their own teams.  Mentoring and coaching is available and encouraged, and senior management and executive staff is very accessible."
good,Alot of hard working and great people to work with and for. They also take good care of their workers and families.  Great environment and the support from the managers is the key
good,"Benefits are average, Don't always work with team players. Great work life balance.  The people for the most part are very optimistic and full of energy creating a good atmosphere."
good,"I worked with CW for 5 years and I really enjoyed it. I became terminally ill and they continued to match my benefits for a year after I went on leave. Wow, a full year, thank you CDW. I enjoyed my team and managers. I am so thankful for their generosity and hope I regain employment so time in the future. Yes, I have recovered now thanks to a full liver transplant."
good,CDW is a Technology Sale company that trains and empowers its Account Managers to meet and exceed sales goals.  The structure is really set up so you are compensated based upon how hard and how smart you work there.  It takes time to build a book of business but the ceiling of what you can do there is exponential.
good,"Good environment, workers helpful, enjoyed remote. Many troubles to fix.  After getting TSM running good, some regrets on CDW to leave.  Enjoyed, revealing the goodness of TSM"
good,I worked for CDW several years ago.  It's a large company with room for both personal and professional growth.  The company culture is outstanding with incredible co-workers.
good,"I valued the partnerships developed while working on remote and on-site projects. The resources (training, development) were readily available to me. The leadership was adequate and knowledgeable about processes, structure and direction."
good,"Stimulating people and a challenging work environment.  Fair pay and a great Cisco WebEx collaboration system.  Great Pewaukee location, close to the frewway"
good,Working for a corporation that allows you to run your business your way with their tools. A working environment much that is much more relaxed than other companies within the channel.
good,Its a work your way up environment. Very competitive and lucrative if you have strong account base.  You have to defiantly prove your angle to be about to grow within the company.
good,CDW is a great place to work at. Perks are amazing and you're given food almost every day Monday through Friday. I just need a change of pace and something new.
good,When I first started working for the company I thought it will be a very hard job due to the fact of how big the warehouse is but as the days went by I gradually got a hang of it . And also it's alot of walking.
good,First experience obtaining a forklift license. Excellent for paid training. Great to get your feet wet on how a warehouse functions along with inventory control.
good,"Was a good place to work, but I was in a Funded role which meant that if any time the partner that I covered decided to pull funding towards my role I would need to look for another position."
good,Many opportunities for advancement. Good people around you across all the different segments of business in which you will interact. Benefits are very nice.
good,Great environment and highly skilled personnel.  CDW went out of its way to take care of its employees.  This included plenty of training and growth opportunities.
good,"Great work/life balance with a bit too much emphasis on making things ""fair"" in a totally PC way. Good management with emphasis on teamwork. Lots of free meals and toys from the IT vendors."
good,"Amazing people at all levels of management.  Provided great opportunities to integrate into the company and very flexible and open culture to try new things.  Managers get lot of respect and independence to manage their own teams.  Mentoring and coaching is available and encouraged, and senior management and executive staff is very accessible."
good,"CDW was my first job out of college. I learned so much from here and gain so many business contacts and close friends I would know how I would have obtained without. You have a chance to earn a ton of money, however you must put in the work. However the pay out if well worth it. Dubber for life!!!"
good,The sales environment at CDW was very supportive of account managers and fostered our continuous development and the growth of our business.
good,"I worked at CDW but not for them, it was a lot of new things to learn at CDW. Everyone was nice and helpful and well team base field. The hardest part of the job was just really getting work done on time and do our 8 hour shift but overall it was fun working there so many laughs."
good,"60 daily outbound calls "
good,"It is an awesome company to work for but the base is extremely low and really hard to live on for 2 to 3 years. I am force to write more o  my review but everything that i stated above is the only thing you need to know. If you stake it out for 3 years, you will make a lot of money if money is what matters to you the most. You will get the best training and great co- workers."
good,"Great place start to get your foot in the door of the IT industry.  Exposure to various different technologies and vendors. Great job culture, but compensation is low and it's difficult to advance your career in the sales side of the organization."
good,sort items by location for put away. operated powered pallet jack and forklift (sit-down).i learned how to operate powered pallet jack and was learning how to use scanning system for inventory control
good,CDW was an amazing company to work for and the management staff as well as the other employees were very knowledgeable in their position.
good,Great culture with a hearty mixture of working hard and playing hard.
good,"If you're looking to get into the IT sales world there's no better place to start than CDWG. The main draw back is the really low base salary but if you stick with it you have the potential to make a lot of money.  Less than 1 year reps are looking at 35k, 3-5 year reps can look to make 100k+,  a few driven reps have made over 500k."
good,Great people and good work life balance.  Occasional free lunches provided by vendors.
good,"CDW sells Hardware & Software and Provide IT Solutions for "
good,CDW is an excellent company to work for. They offer a lot of growth and opportunities.

good,CDW is the largest retain Tech retailer in the United States. They have a great culture and promotes the heath and well being of all of its employees.

good,"Great place to work. "
good,"Productive sales environment for an entry level sales career."
good,"The daily goals set by manager were not overwhelming at all, which made you work to achieve those goals.  Team leader guided you through your day so you can achieve your goals."
good,"Being on the phone 2-4 hours a day:"
good,"Amazing people at all levels of management.  Provided great opportunities to integrate into the company and very flexible and open culture to try new things.  Managers get lot of respect and independence to manage their own teams.  Mentoring and coaching is available and encouraged, and senior management and executive staff is very accessible."
good,A typical day at work would go by fast and everyone is nice and friendly. The work is somewhat easy and always work. Good place to work for a while. I recommend working here
good,"A great work environment with great people. A typical day depends on your role, but they are streamlined when it comes to culture. They have a strong management team, mostly located in Lincolnshire, and they are keep a strong culture and follow the rules. They have a bit of flexibility with hours and one day working from home, but like the culture to be in the office and very present. If you work well with your boss/upper management then you will be successful. Hard work pays off here."
good,"CDW has been one of the best companies I've worked, but the pay could be better for the work. The tools for the job need revising. Sometimes  things take way too long to come into effects because of the process."
good,Management is really good friendly people.  Good place to work. The cafeteria is really good they have al kinds of food. Bad thing bout it when work is slow they lay you off
good,"great company culture! Excellent management team, excellent leadership, excellent incentives, great learning opportunities, fun environment, positive environment"
good,"Most of all, I was lied to when it came to the job description I was given. days seemed very drawn out and long. bent over a table most the day doing tedious configurations on Chromebooks.Management was friendly, but a little worrisome. if you showed any sign of not liking the job, they would bother you to make sure you're fine, even if you were just stretching."
good,"work keeps you going "
good,"CDW has been the best company that I have worked for.  They really do invest in their employees, and it shows.  The environment at work is a work hard/play hard environment with emphasis on both.  There are many sales contests and perks, making it a very fun sales job."
good,Great work environment and an excellent place to work for those looking for a career in IT sales.
good,"Developed and implemented strategies to expand existing client relationships and bring new accounts on board. Forged partnerships with vendors and field personnel. Managed customer relationships, serving as a business partner and presenting solutions."
good,"Get into the office after grabbing Starbucks with a Co Worker. I learned time management, being able to think outside the box and on my feet, being able to multitask and stay calm under when things changed at a moments notice. My managers cared about my success and did all they could to assist me in growing my business acumen. Hardest part? Its sales in an industry with many like competitors,100 outbounds a day and 3.5 hours of phone time but was very rewarding when a relationship you'd been building became mutually beneficial. With great systems and seamless processes, this company makes it easy to do the job well and with ease."
good,CDW is a hands off approach when it comes to learning sales. They give you all the tools and bring in all the top vendors in the world to work with you. They teach you how to balance your day very well.
good,A typical day at work in CDW is building PC systems and troubleshooting any errors as well as configuring the host for the intended use. The environment is really friendly and every section of this company is in one way or another connected so its easy to interact with co-workers or managers from another section. It's always busy which is nice unless you take your time you might need to speed up depending on the number of tickets.
good,They were ok but Management will hold you back if they need you in a position. You can apply to advance but the Managers work together and will not hire you if the other Manager wants you to remain in a department. You are pretty much stuck in the department you are hired in unless you are lucky enough to get a Manager that will allow you to transfer.
good,The sales focus did not match the comp plan - we were encouraged to sell products and services that we were not compensated for ... but received very little credit for selling the products and services that we were compensated for.  It changed daily.
good,"CDW is Great! Learned a lot there, and had the pleasure of working alongside some really talented individuals. A lot of changes within the company recently, all for the good..."
good,"You have the support to be successful here. There are a lot of resources available to you. Definitely money to be made but you need to work hard for it,"
good,I really enjoyed my time at CDW. Really helped me learn about technology sales. Being an account manager was fun. Lots of perks and lots of training to learn about technology.
good,Overall this is an awesome place to work. I am disappointed that there is such a strict rule on moving into a Manager role. Other than that I would stay at CDW.
good,CDW was a great place to work! If I hadn't moved away I would have stayed with the company. They give you all the tools necessary to succeed while also making it fun. Everyone there wants you to succeed and everyone is an open book to get you to your goals.

good,CDW is a great place to get your foot in the working world and offers an extremely wide variety of professional routes to further your career. Success is based off your work ethic because everything you need is provided to you from the start.
good,great place with a work hard play hard mentality. alot of co-workers had very long tenures. this was the longest tenure ive had at a job.
good,CDW acquired Kelway in 2015 and in all honesty nothing significant has changed for me. The two companies were a great fit for each-other and their structure and vision was aligned from several years before the takeover.
good,"The environment is upbeat, the work is rewarding, the company cares about their employess, partners and customers alike and is always delivering excellent results."
good,"A well-organized company that has a sales position to always fill. Good benefits, and an open work environment. High turn over rate for sales and managers."
good,"I was a receiving team lead in a large inbound volume facility.  Over saw numerous employees, trained and monitored performance.  Helped out with labor when I had too, to help our team succeed."
good,"A busy and energetic team of co-workers."
good,Fun sales environment in downtown Chicago. Provide quoted and orders of all IT product offering

good,"As a contractor, my review of CDW would be irrelevant. Its employees, however, were generally quite positive about it."
good,"Great people great company, learned how to build relationships with customers from the Virginia/ dc metro area. Using resources and it based solution, as well as value added reselling."
good,Self motivating atmosphere. Great relationships with coworkers. Great experience with company but needs more oversight among locations creating consistent management style.
good,"i learned cold calling , customer management and cold calling skill there"
good,A very fulfilling role where I was challenged to work outside of my comfort zone. I was an intern for the Program Sales team and worked closely with the Proposal Specialist as well as the Sales Analytics team.
good,Great training and opportunity to grow. Your success falls on yourself and the book your provided by your managers. They partners host a lot of great events.
good,"Amazing people at all levels of management.  Provided great opportunities to integrate into the company and very flexible and open culture to try new things.  Managers get lot of respect and independence to manage their own teams.  Mentoring and coaching is available and encouraged, and senior management and executive staff is very accessible."
good,"CDW had one of the best company cultures and I was treated with high respect.  The pay is not very competitive, which made it difficult to return.  Highly recommended for first year sales job seekers."
good,"The 12hour shifts are the most tiring factor, but that is basically only for entry level positions."
good,"Desining and building SharePoint solutions."
good,"A lot of cold calling is needed to get started and be successful.  This can be incredibly difficult and stressful.  However, the support staff were great and there was always opportunities to learn more about IT."
good,"A great atmosphere to work in. The managers want for you to succeed and are there to help. Goals have to be met/exceeded which can get a bit stressful, but that's what happens in a sales position."
good,"•	Sell solutions that meet or exceed the customer’s expectations."
good,"The company itself has great partnerships and that means the ability to sell almost anything.  Restrictions on Apple, Dell and non-partners make selling some things difficult.  Accounts are distributed at random and some of it is luck of the draw.  Goals are extemly high unless you are a top earner, tough to get paid every month even with expereince so relying on other incentives at times.  Good incentives, plenty of other perks like food and giveaways and trips but a lot of people are tenured here now and would prefer more financial stability over the ability to ""maybe"" make 100k on a paycheck."
good,"Cdw is a great place to work. Everyone is always ready to help and Learn."
good,"Good friendly team, very supportive and plenty of out of work activities as well state of the art building and facilities good training and progression scheme"
good,"Solid company that really executes the work/life balance. If you want to learn how to sell, you need to work here! They do a great job in introducing you to different vendors."
good,"Greatest company that i could have ever expected to work at. As they grew to over 10k employees, they never forgot ANY of their employees. There are reasons that people work there on average of 10+ years!"
good,"CDW fosters a competitive sales environment.  This provides motivation to climb leaderboards in revenue and profit.  As an account manager, you essentially are a business owner with your book of business with the resources CDW provides."
good,CDW exposed me to the current market of IT. It rapidly changes. I'm always kept aware of the newest trends. There are so many resources to get things done!
good,"Perfect place to start a person's IT career, or accounting. CDW will give you the boost, training, and also education to continue their career."
good,"Loved working for the teams I assisted as a contractor. geared to stable employment of those with family, i find single living not supported. it is logical family people are more stable andless likely to job hop, but with cailber work place this is single people could have long term employment if giving equal chance."
good,"Typically working an 8-9 hour day, it has been an in the office day for me since starting. I do a little in the field meeting with customers, but definitely would like to do more. My co-workers are busy throughout the day, but are very close socializing when they do. Hardest part of the job was definitely learning the new technology constantly coming out. Most enjoyable part was definitely building the relationship with those customers who you could sense had that sense of humor I had and definitely enjoying those sporting events with our team."
good,relaxed and fun place to work enjoying being there to scedule people to come to our show room calling people to follow them with their purcheses and how they fell about our company
good,"Great Job and Environment. Just not what I was looking for at the time. Worked for a great team but was given the chance to apply because they weren't looking to hire, I was temping at the time and would have loved the opportunity to stay on."
good,"Amazing people at all levels of management.  Provided great opportunities to integrate into the company and very flexible and open culture to try new things.

good,"CDW is a great company to work for, they strongly believe in the companies culture.  Work hard/Play hard the motto for multiple LOB's w/in the company."
good,"As with any job, I'm quite sure all of us prefer if money grew on trees!, but after all my coworkers made it one of my best jobs ever. From the HR department all the way down. Everyone treated you as family"
good,"Typical work day - Started at 9 am to 5 pm until training was complete. "
good,"I really liked working for the company, great management and also the scheduling was very flexible. I really enjoyed working with my co workers it was a good place to work at."
good,Worked here for many years. Solid corporate environment if not a bit old fashioned. I had plenty of work to keep me busy on a daily basis. Would absolutely recommend a career here. Plenty of room for advancement in most departments.
good,the job was easy and the pplace was fun but very little money when it came to raises for the employees. if there was more money involved i would of definaltly still been there
good,"In a sales perspective, they do a great job in training their future sales representatives with excellent training tools for growth."
good,"Work hard, play hard. This company has thought of everything. Make as much money as you want through your hard work and dedication. Make friends, its all about who you know and who likes you. Pretty cool place to work. Lots of networking and resourcing. Most prosperous sales people are not salesy at all!!! They care about their customers and very supportive work environment."
good,"Great place to work .Nice work culture, People are very friendly. A great place to grow in your career.Great Management and mentors."
good,Work was always enjoyable because of great team leads and work was really easy. I learned how to configurate computers depending on customers specifications.
good,"CDW is a fantastic company. i thought i would like to stay forever until it got in its own way. it has become the company that we used to move past in our market and it has become overrun with bureaucracy and inefficiency. the people, training, balance are great. compensation is below industry average, but they made up for that with an empowering culture that is slowly dying. my career there has run its  course and i am looking for the next challenge in life."
good,CDW is a great segue into the IT industry. The training fully prepares you for any obstacles you may face. CDW was an overall excellent experience.
good,"For those that are hungry to succeed, you will.  I was in Sales for 13yr+ here and have nothing but great things to say about the perks and potential of the opportunities offered here.  The biggest issue is that in recent years, they have created a wave of 'compensation adjustments' where the tenured people with the most sales ability were making more $ then they wanted to pay us.  That gave way to a series of 'levers' that were put into place and some were clearly unattainable just so they could slight you on your commissions.  Overall, if you are looking to make $100K+ in 3-5yrs, this is for you but if you are looking to make $200K+, it's going to be very tough these days."
good,"Order fulfillment, and computer configuration all in under one roof.  This is the largest warehouse I have seen in Las Vegas.  The aisles are all three stories high."
good,"Working a CDW was a excellent work experience. Program computers, and making updates was the best part of my job, just due to the fact I love working around computers basically any type of modern day technology."
good,"Strong growing company, with very energetic staff.  Lots of room for advancement, and great benefits."
good,"Working at CDW  taught me how top manage a book of business. I learned coming out of undergrad, that IT was forever changing and that there was a need for people to translate that change to consumers. Understanding that demand within my first year made me realize that I would like to stay within the realm of Marketing innovative products and working with game changers in the industry."
good,"I have been with CDW for about 7 years, and I will be the first to aknowledge that there were more perks back in the day. That being said I originally started in 'low level' sales, worked hard, and have been making over 100k for the past three years. The first few years did leave a bit to be deisred, but they were not horrible. I have never been a 'favorite' of any of my managers, but as long as you put in some effort, and try to learn everything should be good. There is of course office politics, but thats everywhere. I have some good months and poor months, so it can be stressful, but thats sales."
good,CDW makes it a priority to make their coworkers feel appreciated and valuable.
good,"Amazing people at all levels of management.  Provided great opportunities to integrate into the company and very flexible and open culture to try new things.  Managers get lot of respect and independence to manage their own teams.  Mentoring and coaching is available and encouraged, and senior management and executive staff is very accessible."

good,Anyone who wants to dive into IT sales but wants a clear program that will prepare them should work at CDW. There are opportunities for growth if you work hard and smart.
good,Good opportunity to start your career as well as place to continue if you can manage to stick with it. Managers are great to work with and company is a manage up environment.
good,Loved working here. The only reason I left was because I was relocating and CDW doesn't have an office where I moved. Awesome company to work for. Would definitely recommend. Great training resources. Perks. Fair commission. Management listens.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time with CDW.  They have truly created a culture that provokes all who are apart to achieve high measures of success.  Whether it be though their training program to begin a career with CDW - eliminating those who are not knowledgable or fruitful - and then proceeding with continued education, encouraged relationship building events both in and out of the office, and professional groups available to all.  I would highly suggest all to apply and come ready to work but also come expecting success to be available."
good,"It is a great company, great people, I would go back in a heartbeat. The management could be alittke better but thats with alot of companies. Its a solid place to work."
good,"My experience at CDW is nothing but positive. If I could relocate and keep this role. I would, this role would not compensate for cost of living in the area where I want to relocate."
good,I loved working at CDW and would go back if I could. It was a great experience for someone right out of school to understand the sales cycle and sales in general.
good,Great place to work. I greatly enjoyed my time at CDW. I wish the commissions were more. However everything else about CDW was great.
good,I loved working here.  The only reason I left was due to moving out of state.  Great company with lots of perks.  I would have rather done client services.  Collections is very stressful but I give credit to those who have been doing it for years
good,CDW is a amazing company to work for. The management is very supportive of advancement. I work hard and long hours to achieve success.
good,A typical day would allow time for lab work certification prep. work. Also I would be involved with customer facing meetings or conference calls on both the design and implementation sides of projects as well as working side-by-side the a senior engineer on site.
good,"I will come back to work for CDW anytime I am called upon, that's how I loved CDW. I have had one of the best experience with CDW and they always give you room for upgrading ."
good,"Great company, low pay compared to industry. Only good for entry level work. The focus really is on employees and their satisfaction. You are trained extremely well, and work as a team."
good,"Amazing people at all levels of management.  Provided great opportunities to integrate into the company and very flexible and open culture to try new things.  Managers get lot of respect and independence to manage their own teams.  Mentoring and coaching is available and encouraged, and senior management and executive staff is very accessible."

good,"CDW was an excellent place to not only start a career, but to grow.  The management was excellent and supportive, and really allowed for a flexible day as needed.  I loved working for CDW."
good,"Your career is what you make of it at CDW. Great culture, amazing leadership and opportunities to try a variety of things. Nice flexibility and work/life balance."
good,"I was there for only a year. I was an Account Manager for the corporate sector. I truly enjoyed my time there and my coworkers were my favorite part. Only reason I left was because I was not for sales and I had just found another position elsewhere. My director at the time did try to persuade to keep me and find a job in a different department. By then, it was too late for me to stay. But other than that it was a great place."
good,"Great development awaited me at CDW. Patience required but hard work and aptitude recognized. Brand new office over four floors that is very employee friendly. Multiple, prizes, lunches and events over a month."
good,"Do not get distracted, there is a lot going on in the rows that make it easy to get distracted from getting any work done. That would be the easiest way to fail."
good,"I have been working at CDW in the Data Center for 3 months and I have learned such valuable skills that I know will help advance my career. At the end of August all CDW data center technicians are getting laid off due to operation changes within the data center, unfortunately that I why I'm searching for a new position. The management is very understanding and very genuine.  I will miss working for CDW."
good,"Solid company to work for, especially if you are just starting our your career. CDW continues to be a major player in the IT re seller space. "
good,"This was a great starting point career wise. I learned a lot of business relationships, client acquisition and retention and felt beyond secure with my role."
good,"Was part of team migrating external clients into COLO datacenter, of moving to pure hosting environment. Management was awesome, but as is the nature of this beast we were moving in older not-always-well-supported systems and applications, which made most moves a series of one-off migrations."
good,I worked for CDW the last 1.5  years and I loved the culture of the company and everyone understands their roles and expectations. Compensation is very good and management is focused on the employees and results. Wish I was still there.
good,"I loved CDW as a company, the job just wasn't a good fit for me. I would go back in a heartbeat if they had a non-sales opening. They really care about their employees."
good,"CDW is a great company to work for, they have built a very strong culture and environment to work in.  I have learned a lot of sales and business through their highly rated training program.  They put you through a lot before sending you to hit the phones and start connecting with customers and clients.  Management is fair for the most part and will give you every chance to succeed.  Most days I am dealing/talking to customers and trying to grow more business within my accounts.  The hardest part of the job is being willing to cold-call and just pick up the phone and talk to people who generally do not want to talk to you.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the perks you get from vendors and the company itself, whether it be happy hours or sales prizes."
good,"I enjoy working at CDW very much."

good,"CDW is a decent company. Probably better than average from the top down.  It has a fairly clear mission and objectives.  The salary and benefits are about average for the market.  The people are exceptional.  The team work is exceptional between coworkers.  As a whole, the company really makes an effort to take care of its customers."
good,"Working on the front line of a Fortune 500 company was an excellent experience for me. I was able to jump to the top of my hiring class and prove myself on my team. I started with a $250,000 book of business and built that up to $950,000 over the course of 6 months. I learned how to provide excellent service in the technology industry."
good,"Great place to work, I only wish I'd gotten into sales at an earlier age. It is hard to get through the first few years, expect to scrap to make a living, unless you are blessed with a great account off the break."
good,CDW is a great place to work. I love the energy coming into such a company Mon- Fri. As a single mother there is great life/work balance.
