rating,review
bad,The stock went down another 5% today. The internal rumors are that the company is going bankrupt. I need to get out before management dissolves the company. I do not want to go through bankruptcy with this company. They need better management and more funds. Bankruptcy is definitely coming shortly. I sold all my stock at a loss today just to get out of it before it becomes worthless.
bad,Poor management and no appreciation for employees who are not in management roles. Field operators are expected to do more each day while more benefits are taken away every chance management finds a legal loophole.  I would not recommend the San Juan basin of WPX as a place to work.
good,"its very disorganized, and not a very good team environment, management is very lazy(in my opinion) and a lot of favoritism is played when it comes to advancement"
good,"As spun off from Williams, this company has a world of opportunity ahead of it.  It is at times a little wrapped up in what is termed as the ""Good Old Boy"" world.  Everyone knows everyone, and business flows with those mixes most of the time.  This is good and bad at times.  Management is young at the local levels, but boasts many combined years of experience.  There are many positions with under qualified people in them, sadly."
good,The last few years were very stressful with low morale due to the constant layoffs.  There were always rumors about another one happening around the corner.
good,Am sure of where we are going.  Not sure if will get there.  We know about the layoffs - but don't know the reasoning.  I am getting the most out of work by mentoring with another engineer.  He helps me with the science and I help him with software especially database (Access).
good,"I very much enjoyed the work I was doing and most of the people I worked with.  Being a large company, the benefits were good. It was a good location for a company."
good,"My negative experience had to do with my direct supervisor there, who was a recent hire from IBM.  Overall, the rest of the company tries to treat its employees well. They have good benefits and a nice working environment. The company likes to do community events where employees get a paid day to help work projects, and help in local schools on a regular basis. Most everyone I met there worked well and worked well with each other."
good,Poorly run organization. Trying to balance the work environment at the corporate level and the field level are two very different things that take getting used to.
good,"If you aren't related to someone or best friends from the 3rd grade, good luck getting hired on with them.  It's a pretty good ole boys type organization.  If you can get in, work hard and keep your nose down.  Great benefits and compensation."
good,"I've worked for WPX since they spun off of Williams.  It started out as a great company, but over the last few years, I've seen how management has really gone downhill.  Meaning... the top brass actually make all the decisions.  No middle management person will make a decision without checking with the higher-ups first.  "
good,This company was a good company to work for. It had good pay and great benefits. 
good,"room for lateral movement and learning.  Lots of great people"
good,Wish they would not have sold out the Colorado portion. It was a good place to work with great benefits and compensation. Well thought out decisions with the current economic climate.
good,Worked specifically on Joint Interest pay outs. Was given the opportunity to work with Information Technology to install the Oracle Reversionary module.
good,"Set up Administation  department. Set up filing system, developed documents on PC, train administration temps, letters.  I was only temp and they kept us in a locked area due to the confidential nature of our work."
good,"Trade morning position, schedule pipelines and input trades and arrange in deal system for accounting. Trade seasonal positions and clear an errors for accounting"
good,"The overall culture of WPX was positive and employees sought to accomplish tasks effectively while following procedures to get the right results the right way.  It was a great place to work, but unfortunately the economic down turn within the Oil and Gas industry affected their finances which led to corporate downsizing and the closure of the Denver office.  Communication and planning regarding the results and processing of this change left something to be desired and later information regarding company purchases was also very frustrating."
good,"quick pace, helpful people... "
good,"Fast paced, work smarter not harder, upper mgmt good, co workers great, ensuring SOX requirements, adrenal rush fast paced challenges"
good,"This is a great place to work with great compensation, only downside is the stability."
good,"Good Company with solid leadership and forward thinkers.  They know that their company is only as good as the employees they have and they take care of those employees.  "
good,"work life balance if wonderful no stressful atmosphere! Great company to work for! Enjoyed the privacy and working independently."
good,WPX is well into its transition from a natural gas company to a crude oil company.  They have aggressively pursued this strategy with resulted in a change in personnel needed and a change in culture.  They continue to offer a good work life balance and it is a good place to work.
good,"WPX is a good company to work for, especially if you live in Tulsa, OK. They do care about good benefits, even if the salaries a bit low.  The people I worked with were absolutely great.  They do believe in doing the right thing, even though the industry downturn has put quite a few people out of work."
good,"My day was usually taken up with sorting, scanning and filing oil and gas well documents. To many this might seem to be tedium to the nth power, but I enjoyed the detail work and being able to move at my own pace;being allowed to listen to music helped. "
good,"Worked at WPX previously as Geological Technician and Sr.Administrative Assistant, but I also have Human Resources Coordinator experience."
good,"Enjoyed the department and team I worked with, productive and fun work atmosphere. Work place was nice, and benefits were great, wouldn't have left other than being laid off."
good,I have enjoyed my 9 years here at WPX Energy and would recommend it to anyone. Management is interested in your work and shows knowledge of the daily functions in the areas that you work.
good,"No job security.. the oil and gas field, there is no job stability.. it's hard to find a job in corporate America. I have a degree and its still hard to find a job. Overall WPX is a great company to work for."
good,the challenges that where involved in this position where excellent. Being able to learn a new culture as far as the methane fields as well as working in the oil part of the industry
good,I loved working for WPX.  Had it of not been for a lay off i would still be there!  The daily duties were equally balanced and the hours were very flexible .
good,Was blessed to work with WPX Energy from startup to sale. Great management team and relaxed work environment. My only issue was that they did not stay on the Marcellus for a long time. Economics forced the sale of assets otherwise I would have been a lifelong employee.
good,Great place to work. Culture is amazing and the work feels meaningful. This is my first job so I am learning what is like to work in the corporate world.
good,"no longer in Denver, CO"
good,"It has probably changed since I was there, but it was a great place. Very organized with good talent and personalities at the management level. You set goals at the beginning of each year which are great motivation for your bonus which is based a lot on personal performance. They care about innovating, rewarding people who know how to optimize and make things better there. People in general were happy there, you had good job satisfaction. Very good pay and benefits, above industry standard"
good,"WPX Energy is a very good company.   Senior Management makes decisions based on what is best for the company.  With many changes over the last three years,  the HSE Team was in the process of working to improve the safety culture of the organization.  At the end of my tenure with WPX Energy, Inc.   we were very active in the Permian Basin and we were adding many, many contractors to our field operations team.  I was involved in working with the Procurement Department in on-boarding these contractors through the HSE Assessment process.    Best part of working at WPX Energy was working with a great group of professionals in all of the Operational and Administrative Departments"
good,Daily scheduling of upstream gas out of the Piceance basin.  Great place to work and awesome co-workers.  Overall company atmosphere was always upbeat and inspiring.
good,"I enjoyed working for WPX Energy"
good,"Enjoyed working at WPX, only thing i would complain about is HR. They weren't consistent at hiring employees at a competitive wage that would compare with the market."
good,"This is a great company with even greater people!!! This company is very family orientated, I would have loved to continue to work for this company."
good,Busy and cleanup to prepare to move duties to the Tulsa office.  Worked new systems and different departments. The hardest part of being an employee was being a temporary employee due to the company was not going to continue our department in the current office it would move to the corporate office.
good,"I loved this position!!"
good,"Challenging projects,  good support and teamwork"
good,"Great co--workers, flexible, great benefits. "
good,"Having been surrounded by the best of the best, WPX embodied the concept of ""our people are our greatest asset"".  The level of expertise and experience are unparalleled anywhere in the industry.  Very sad to see the Denver office closed and all that talent scattered to the four winds."
good,I enjoyed the managers and the atmosphere the job was great and I wish I was still able to be there.
