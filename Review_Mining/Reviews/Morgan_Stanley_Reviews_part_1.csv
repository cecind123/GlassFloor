rating,review
bad,The company is a good company had I worked in a separate department. The national new accounts did not provide with developmental coaching not did it provide a healthy environment.
bad,"I worked for Morgan Stanley off and on from Dec 2015 to February 2017 when I was unexpectedly let go.  I started and ended as a temp, so that part of the job was tough.  I took 30-45 calls daily in the Online department.  Great training and supervisor to start with, but after a few months I was asked if I would be interested in transferring to Retirement. Not wanting to seem flexible I did.  The training and support in the Retirement area was severely lacking.  I was able to transfer to Insurance Licensing after a few months, however.  My training was great!  The support in the department from my immediate supervisor and team were fantastic. A new operations manager over Retirement and Insurance came to this department from New York.  I had a medical condition that I made ALL of my managers aware of.  I was even told that if I ever had an issue to let management know.  One time I did have an episode and let management know.  I got a call from temp agency, two weeks later, that instead of letting me go (WHY???) I would be suspended until further notice.  As a temp this is difficult because you never know your status, but it was also nearing Christmas time!  I tried to find other employment but in the end Morgan Stanley let me back...for a few weeks.  The new operations manager made found every excuse she could to ""legally"" not bring me back.  I was accused of hanging up on customers, but proved time and again there was an issue with the hard phones.  I had been in customer service/call centers for over a decade and NEVER hung up on anyone.  Even after proving over and again I"
bad,"NOT TOO BIG TO FAIL, as local branch is administered by co-managers: a sales supervisor, an operations manager, and a compliance manager- neither of whom communicate well with each other."
bad,Very unfair company to work for. Management is clicky and they are under investigation for how they treat their employees.  the new manager hired is making loyal workers now look for other jobs. One of the worst companies to work with.
bad,They are a very deceiving company . They dont support you .they train you poorly alot of people have quit and gone else where no benefits and no job stability
bad,"I hated the job and the people i worked with. I would not recommend MS to anyone. My manager was horrible, she yelled and screamed at people, can't believe that any professional organization would hire people like those that I worked with. Very happy not to be there anymore."
bad,"Hated working there; horrible management! Full days of compliance rules and regulations that hindered my work! Completed all requirements, but kept changing day in and day out. HATED IT!!!!!"
bad,"one of the worst companies I have worled for in over 20 years. they manage people like a 1960s typing pool, with permission needed to go for toilet breaks lunch and if yu leave at 5pm its frawned upon... they want 12 to 16 hrs days out of you with no atmosphere or cultural environment thats nice to work in.. There are a few companies i wouldnt work for ever again and this is the top one."
bad,"Mostly temporary employees from staffing companies. High attrition rates and employee turnover. Investment banking and financial services call center for Morgan Stanley clients and employees. Specialized field facing support teams including: Advisor Compensation, Client Reporting and Web Support. Client Support Services: banking & card services, tax documents/support, online banking, IT/web support, global stock plan services and participant "
bad,"Morgan Stanley more interested in getting rid of Financial Advisors and replacing them with call centers using Vangard and Fidellity as business models.Morgan Stanley is getting rid of employees gooing to more computer online accounts."
bad,"Don't wish to give my opinion about anything here because it would be negative if I did."
bad,"A number of people who where brought in no longer work at the company. Poor work environment."
bad,"I think my review summary says it all. This company doesn’t care about personal growth and they don’t value outside of the box thinkers. There is no accountability from anyone. They overcharge their clients in fees and their turnaround time to do anything takes a minimum of two days. The right hand has no idea what the left hand is doing and EVERYTHING has to be approved by someone in legal which takes another 10 business days. I’m surprised they are even in business.  If offered a job at this company, run as far away as you can. You start with two weeks of vacation and the health Insurance they offer is a joke. You pay so much out of pocket that’s it’s better to not have insurance.  The management is horrible and the company is filled with complacent people that enjoy coming to work to do absolutely nothing.  Personally, I believe that if you are close to retirement this firm is for you as it truly is a career killer. Most employees leave to go to other financial firms because this place is miserable and the ones that stay are complacent.  My advice, run and never look back."
bad,On the phone answering  questions that I had to ask myself to get an answer on. Hated everyday I had to go to work and should have never taken the job .
bad,"Horrible Experience, Poor Management, Dishonest manager, Very Disorganized. The entire contract was dissolved shortly after starting, lay offs and pay cuts occur frequently, very un stable."
bad,"stay away from it. Not a good company for life balance."
bad,"I'll not recommend  work in the Wealth Management section at Morgan Stanley. "
bad,"Worst place I've ever had the misfortune of working. Juvenile employees, favoritism shown towards employees who suck up, absolutely ZERO work life balance, no support from upper management and I could go on for days. I was extremely excited when I received the offer and started but it only took about 3 weeks for that to change and see what it was really like around there. The only good thing was that from day 1 you have 4 weeks vacation allowed and 2 weeks of that time, 10 business day's, has to be taken at one time."
bad,It's been to many years and it was only part time. Unfortunately I didn't have very much work hours here. It was throught a temp agentcy. I know certain brokers didn't like you offering a client to any other agents
bad,"Unskilled Management. Management only allows their ""favorites"" to promote. No business acumen or professionalism. Does not promote training or development."
bad,Sorry n\but they do not care about you or matching your experience with there needs. You will be brought on to help with seasonal demand January to April.
bad,"The worst company I ever worked for, it was simply a bad dream! The management was no horrible, no assistance , no compassion and no flexibility. Completely they had their favorites and it showed everyday. Glad to be out of that place."
bad,"As a contractor it was a temp job, but management was rude and disrespectful. Always pushed harder with the idea of getting hired fully but then you would be cut at the knees."
bad,A typical day at work is normally full with a lot of and the company has a very aggressive culture that is predatory in nature to abuse youth recruits
bad,Ask around before applying/joining WM strats team.  A lot of people couldn't stand it and left the firm within 1-2 year.  Tons of complain but this culture issue is still there.
bad,all negative and not even one star. there is nothing positive i can share here! I want to state here that all managers are bad and they take advantage as they burn the temps
bad,"The department I worked in for Morgan Stanley was micromanaged and instead of management praising us for a job well done, were always told what we were doing wrong.  Trying to get time off was a joke.  The only positive I can say about the company is the people I worked with."
bad,"poor culture, terrible management, do not provide any resources towards new-hires, unrealistic expectations and no work life balance...…………………………………..."
bad,"Head Trainer is good but not the others.  ""Fronters"" get promoted witihout merit.  "
bad,Incompetent management. Many people have been working there for 15+ years now and so have burnt out. They refuse to change to better adapt to the newer work cultures with more efficient methods.
bad,"Worst job I have ever had in my entire life. They lie to you, they will drop you without any reasoning at any given time even if you are doing the best on your team. They are cheap, they cut corners and they make you feel like a slave."
bad,Manager was a liar and completely inept at his job. I was promised that I would be the recipient of a certain budget and it was misrepresented. I was also promised that I would get uncovered households to help build my practice. Also a lie
bad,I worked there a long long time ago and do not know why they are forcing me to review this job when it was over 20 years ago that I worked there but oh well....
bad,"The full-time people enact their ""Wolf on Wall Street"" wet dreams on a daily basis with their bigotry and attitudes of entitlement. Listen to your instincts, the wannabe ""big shots"" are not going to value anything you have to offer to the table (foreign language skills, master's degree, ability to diffuse negative situations, etc)."
bad,Was in transition when I worked there. Terrible time to be at MS. Acquisition and digestion of Smith Barney tumultuous to say the least. Was not so great to begin with and really cut-throat and greedy people. Kind of disgusting actually.
bad,"only there for a year and went to Citigroup, would not want to work there again. I have nothing more to say on the subject,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
bad,They promote opportunities for advancement with the company bit only hire contractors initially. After 1-3 years working with the company they may offer you a position or they may have a mass layoff before it is time to promote and increase your pay.
bad,"Been a long time since I've been there.  Not sure what is happening.  Big place.  Bigtime stress and very cuthroat. Very smart people there, so you can learn a lot."
bad,It depends on the advisor you work for. Work environment can vary dramatically. My experience may have been unique. I would not recommend the job based on how my experience was.
bad,This is absolutely the worst job I've ever had. I regret the day I step foot in this place. The culture at MS does not allow for any work-life balance. They will send your job to another city or country as soon as soon as the stock price falls too low (location strategy). Don't ever expect to be treated with respect or as a human here.
bad,"Morgan Stanley is a tough place to work.  High stress and very little job security.  There are some excellent people, but the highly competitive investment banking and capital markets businesses continue to suffer under challenging conditions."
bad,"Awful culture, awful management.  My supervisors lack communication skills, are smug, and are very condescending.  If you can match the lack of integrity they posses you will fit in.  "
bad,Cut Throat Environment with a lack of of concern for customer service.  Always looking for the next sale to existing customers.  Very unprofessional work environment.
bad,"No advancement opportunities, departments are poorly managed and no one ever seems happy to be there. Not a good environment for those wanting to advance in their craft and utilize their best skills."
bad,management is terrible and they are no effective communicators. Most employees are afraid to be away from their desk for more than 15 minutes
bad,Company does not care about their employees. Concerned with decreasing costs by offshoring functions or by sending jobs to other companies. Not a place I would recommend anyone to work for
bad,"There is nothing special about this company, it's the same as every other big financial company. Too many managers, many of whom have no clue what they're doing, so they cover for it by micro managing."
bad,"People are very smart, international, driven and open minded. The deal flow is high and prestigious. The hours are long and the work flow is not optimised but the culture is good."
bad,They treat you like you are stupid and will fire you for no reason don't ruin your life like that and find another job! I was so depressed and sad while I worked there I've never been the same!
bad,"Non existent work life balance.  Long work hours with some weekend work.  ""The view is ok.  High rates for parking.  Nice view if you can leave the office to take a break."
bad,"If you would like to be in the insurance company, then by all mean do work for this company, but I won't recommed if you have other options."
bad,I was only apart of the training program for a year but overall i was not impressed with the company though over the years they have made many changes.
bad,I enjoyed each one of my co workers. we were all willing ot help a peer when necessary. I learned how to be more flexiable within the work enviroment and always willing to help
bad,"Contract employees, temps or as MS call us contingent workers are treated like subhumans on every level.  They will treat you like you're an idiot or try to and you will NEVER have an opportunity to assume a perm role unless it's one no one else wants."
bad,"One of the worst places ever worked.  Terrible culture, revolving door"
bad,"Very poor management, only looking out for themselves. Unstable work environment."
bad,"such an awful place to work in! there is NO job advancement, everybody is SO unprofessional. AVOID AVOID AVOID. they'll tell you you can get your series 7, but you'll be a temp for a long long time and never move up."
bad,"In January of 2008, the CEO of Morgan Stanley sent an email to all employees saying that if we were ever going to catch up to Goldman Sachs, our arch rival, we needed to take greater risks. In February of 2008, Morgan Stanley lost $30,000,000,000 (Thirty Billion Dollars!) and laid off 30,000 employees, myself included, most of whom had absolutely nothing to do with management's fiasco."
bad,Haven't received a pay raise in 4 years! Making less now than whe I started due to the new as tax. They don't care that you bust your butt and work 12 hour days. Horrible!
bad,Typical day includes a never ending series of routine tasks which involve little use of brain.
bad,"The pay isn't the worst, but has plenty of room for improvement. But mainly they rely VERY heavily on contract work. But unlike some places, their contractors are not treated like human beings. No benefits. No respect. No human dignity. And no job security. The management is so bad as to be almost beyond belief ..it's no wonder they needed a bailout, they don't really deserve to be in business the way they're run ..this at least coming from the perspective of technology/user support. Many of the users are pretty horrible too, but I guess you can get that anywhere. But the single worst thing, the source of all other issues, is the management. That, and the lack of benefits / time off. This is the kind of place that makes you wish you never left your last job. If the economy were more friendly to job-seekers, I would have been out of here a long time ago."
bad,"terrible leadership, hours, and outdated systems at MSFS. Everyone is underpaid and checked out. Could be a great place but everyone is miserable due to the way things are run and how overworked they are."
bad,"I did not work for Morgan Stanley directly, i worked for Capita. This was a horrible place to work, managers were not professional. Only saving grace was the people who were fun and diverse."
bad,"Worked here for a year in Glasgow’s Operations. 12 hour working days. Close to impossible to give yourself an hour lunch break as the works too much for one person. Very cliquey place. Perhaps my experience would have been better if I’d worked for a decent manager who happened to love micro managing. In my 17 year career, I’ve never worked for such an inefficient place. I still have nightmares about it."
bad,"My direct supervisor consistently put off his major responsibilities onto me because I was the ""lead"" or manager of the mailroom.  Significant pressure on individual employees to complete work that was meant for 2-3 people.  Extremely high work load with zero intentions to hire more help.  Very low pay.  Very low moral, the employees, including myself were very unhappy."
bad,"While the work was hard and I did learn, the atmosphere was unrelenting and due to politics by certain individuals, made this job probably the most difficult I have ever been at."
bad,"New hires come and go.  once you pass the intense interview process and go into training, they put you in front of a computer and expect you to know how to start trading day one with no instruction on how to.  "
bad,Morgan Stanley promised to develop a compensation plan and better incentive bonuses. This promise was in place for one year. In the end nothing came to fruition. They announced the closure of the whole site before the end of the year so they would not pay the yearly bonuses. We were deceived. As a culture Morgan Stanley lacks honesty and clarity with employees.
bad,"they pay for you to study for your series 7/66"
bad,Management doesn't care about their employees and they are only concerned with pushing lending products to meet bank quotas. Their research is garbage and cost my clients' money.
bad,"In short, true definition of Corporate Slavery. Because of mergers and joint ventures, there is plenty of favoritism and bias."
bad,"Horrible Corporation."
bad,"The worst experience of my working life. The worst morale, management and general work experience imaginable for a company of this size."
bad,you can tell from my ratings that I dont think MS is a quality employer.
bad,"okay, am still new but am looking forward to the challenges but so far i being shouted at and regret being here"
bad,"IT middle/senior managers are made up of long-tenured techies with no real-world management abilities.  Major infrastructure systems and processes are proprietary, old (10-15+ years) geeky and amateurish.  There are no sincere transformative efforts to modernize - they seem to protect their existing ""bubble"".  Management has no strategy or vision - work is very transactional and tactical with no planning or architecture.  Out-of-box thinking is viewed as subversive.  Success is measured by how well you can master the complex, home-grown environment (""Morganization"") and turn the existing techno-process crank."
bad,"people only care about themselves and how much they make, not you or your well being...no support from managers...unless your making them big money,,,only good thing was complete benefits although you had to contribute."
bad,"-Many different IT teams in who seek to only preserve their own reputation and face at expense of others due to too much work pressure, leading to excessive political blame games and fights"
bad,"Great company and culture with advancement opportunities  The WAA program provided the opportunity to study for the requisite licensing however, it could use a bit more structure."
bad,No diversity at all. Success formula is to  let go US citizens and hire foreigners CEO included. This gas to be stopped. I hope they will finally understand that this is not the way to develop America
bad,"A very cold work environment with no room for advancement. Salary and benefits were very competitive, but not worth the aggravation of always worrying about job security"
bad,"I worked there too long ago for my review to be relevant. ok, I would go into work, work on a model, and no one spoke or interacted with me, unless I initiated it."
bad,"I worked there 6 months under two mangers; one isnt licensees and didn’t know the systems at all, while the other was very knowledgeable and terrible at managing. It was a nightmare working there and I would never recommend it."
bad,Work day was typical.  Management was fine.  Nothing hard about the job.  Culture could use some improvement.  This is about all I have to day of my timing working here
bad,"Many holding the title of Executive Director or above in technology have a very weak understanding of technology.  All they do is send out email and perform budget exercise.  They wouldn't recognize anything innovative if they tripped over it. "
bad,Management was clear that there would be no room for advancement nor any interest to convert any contract workers to permanent positions.  The pay was also not competitive and management allowed many of the good talent to leave.  This made for an unfavorable working condition.
bad,"Lots of selfish people especially management who is extremely political and self interested.  Constant cliques and dirty politics. Factory style desks. No privacy.  Huge turnover which is fully acknowledged and supported by upper management.  Uneven workload.  You could have nothing to do for a month then work 4 weekends in a row.  Sterile workplace,  people are very fake.  Typical culture is for upper management to blast an email congratulating their department on completion of a project.  Lots of smart people.  Great junior people."
bad,A daily soul sucking grind which I will never be able to truly describe. Meetings which accomplished absolutely nothing and out of touch corporate hierarchy that only cared about meeting numbers and targets.
bad,"At times, It's better to stay quiet than to speak your mind. Not a great work environment. Very cut throat environment and not one colleague had anything positive to say. I felt bad leaving them behind."
bad,"Lack of career path growth or mentorship programs to aid any industry growth.  Under paid, with more responsibilities and risk added year over year.  Culture is horrible.  Anyone can be a middle manager as long as you have no idea what you are doing, you fit the bill.  Staff yearly salary increases involve a thank you and maybe next year.  They always blame the economy for the lack of raises."
bad,"Do not enjoy the negative experiences that are brought to light by the general environment by both management and employees.  If you enjoy feeling like your job is at risk by double-standards brought on by your superiors, then this is absolutely the place for you!"
bad,"I would not recommend work at Morgan Stanley.  I am a seasoned professional.  I needed help learning ""their system"" and ""their workflows"".  I received NO assistance from MY assistant nor my manager!  One advisor could be heard throughout the office CURSING at his own clients on a routine basis!  Typical Wall Street firm; not employee friendly, low payouts unless you were a MAJOR producer.  Do not work there.."
bad,"Work consumed your personal life. Constant pressure from management teams to push products that weren't right for the client. You're salary would decrease as your production increased unless you were apart of a ""larger team"". The Management teams were only willing to support advisors when it benefited them for their quarterly bonus. Management was very political in regards to helping certain individuals succeed in the organization. They promote and sell a training program with coaches that had little to no experience whatsoever. In my opinion was a waste of time and money. Can not stress the negative taste I received from the local management team."
bad,"The company requires you to be punctual to the minute and be available to take calls. I learned about the market and it's volatility. The hardest part of the job is your schedule is pre-planned to the minute for your start, break, lunch, and quitting time.  You must follow it exactly, any deviance will reflect poorly on your job."
bad,"Poor culture, no advancement, poor leadership...... "
bad,Friendly people but back office compensation slacks at times. Room for advancement in Finance within lower non-officer ranks is plentiful but less room exists for higher officer positions.
bad,"Some great people there."
bad,You are often given work with no guidance which teaches you to ask around and find out who knows what.  Very political and position level is not necessarily indicative of substantive knowledge.  Managers manage up not down.  No training here.
bad,Poor organization and communication made it impossible to be happy there. There was no true chain of command and the ability to receive the correct answers when needing help was far from possible.
bad,"Hostile work environment with zero transparency on job/ career aspects.Every year thousands are laid off on the name of restructuring. Human Resource is inefficient, most of the year company freezes any recruitment."
bad,"The financial industry has so much to offer people in helping them achieve their financial goals.  Unfortunately, Morgan Stanley gives a bad name to that industry in pursuit of product pushing and front-running clients.  Eventually left because I believed I was harming my clients."
bad,"The main concern is about production, not clients best interests. Focus is on sales ideas and how to increase production,not strategies that will further benefit clients."
bad,operations workers are just treated as expenses.  the weakest and strongest workers have identical career paths.  they make no effort to retain talent.
bad,All the stress of the financial industry and marginally more money.  Don't work in Wealth Management IT.  IT is a cost center looking to run more cheaply every year.  Frequent management changes and little advancement opportunity.
bad,"Manager promised things that you were never given. Never given a lunch break or regular break, but had to mark it on timesheet. No place to take a lunch or break. Always had to be at the desk. Were not allowed to talk to your co-workers"
bad,"they discriminate against people in the lgbtq community, whenever you try to address any problem, you get a lot of condescending smiles and false promises only to be given scripted answers in response to your problem with absolutely no resolution. They will not even heat their offices in the winter or provide hot water in the taps all year round"
bad,"I started at this firm through a temp agency contract to hire straight out of school with a degree in Finance and Economics from the business school from Ohio State University. A call center atmosphere is not what I had originally had in mind right of school, but like me an other recent graduates who I met and also took the position was determine and enthusiastic to do our best hoping for greater opportunities down the road within the firm. Months later these buddies I met slowly ended leaving the firm for better positions with better firms. I soon realize that the firm was not a place where I wanted to continue my career, not only does the firm take months to offer you a position (anywhere from 6months to 2 years), but once offered the position it takes HR I kid you not months to follow up with the paper work to make the conversion process. I knew some one who was offered the postion in May and did not receive the paper until my last day in the month of August. I debated about taking the offer due the fact there is an 18 month rule where you can not move up just lateral within your department, again there were other factors such as no matter how well you do or where your stats are in relative to everyone it doesn't really matter unless certain management and hiring decision personnel like you. This place is really like capital hill it's all political and if your rhetoric skills are great and have mediocre stats or somewhat of understanding of your postion you go far. It strikes me odd that this postion has a bachelor/associate degree has a requirement but less than half of"

bad,"A typical workday is very monotonous conducting daily processing. Initiative isn't rewarded, nor is avoiding responsibility reprimanded, just so long as the work gets done upper management is satisfied. Direct managers are very supportive and do the best they can with the modest resources they have, but Baltimore gets little respect in the MS world."
bad,"Everyone is trying to survive or maintain/create a positive perception in order to get paid or just survive.  Others are just happy to be plodders.  If you really want to get something done, like do something that has a traditional value (faster/better/cheaper), don't bother with MS.  Find out what your boss really wants, but warning it won't be stated directly.  You'll be playing a forever guessing game, with a few clues and mostly kept in the dark.  Very MI6 type culture - lots of cloak and dagger - much more British than American.  Does not feel like an American company or American culture.   But most of this is typical of all the big banks - culture is terrible.  Also, they suffer from adverse selection - everyone good leaves, only the bad ones stay.   So quality of talent there, particularly in technology, is very poor."
bad,"overtime work"
bad,I was transferred far from my family and was left with no support and some rough culture issues.I thought the firm had good back office and good systems but lousy with training and support even in all the positions I held
bad,it's just not the same place it was......I have nothing more to say.  Management is not fair across the board.  Employees should be interviewed at the Retail Branch to get the whole picture of how others feel about the office.
bad,"Management team only allows you to progress if they like you. If they don’t, your hard work and works ethics do not count. Culture at branch level is not sophisticated at all and the thirst for “power” makes underpaid team to occupied their time on the latest gossip"
bad,"Technology way behind and extremely poor Executive Senior Management which would impede productivity and efficiency. Projects and enhancements could easily come to resolution although everything was multiple meetings in which very little was accomplished. "
bad,The management plays favorites and all employees are not treated equal. The management team manages through fear in their employees causing a extremely hostile work environment for the employees.
bad,"I have developed a lot of experience from being in brokerage for a lot of years. This consists of learning about the different types of accounts acquired by clients(i.e: retail, ira, etc). There are different procedures to bring in an account. The most enjoyable part of my job has been establishing a repore with branches. I like helping people. I am on the phones all day long advising branches regarding status of a transfer or explaining a procedure of how a transfer needs to be processed. The challenging part of the job is maintaining professionalism when someone from the branch calls in with a bad attitude. The atmosphere is peaceful in which i like the people that I work with in my dept. Management needs improvement in a lot of areas. How they treat employees will make the determination of if they choose to stay with this company or go somewhere else. People like to be appreciated and highly compensated for their work. If an employer doesn't take the time to recognize years of dedication and hard work put in by their employees, then they're going to leave and go to another company who will appreciate their talents and won't mind rewarding them for their efforts. No job is irreplaceable but good workers are hard to find. I believe that ""happiness and ""peace of mind"" also plays a determining factor in remaining on the job."
bad,En España los puestos de soporte en especial RRHH estan vacios de contenido no se hace nada en 8 horas y se aprende 0. En puestos de negocio es buena empresa. Muy mala experiencia personal.
bad,"The business culture did not meet my high standard of work ethics.  Lack of transparency.  There was an extreme lack of communication between staff and management.  When tax reporting issues came up that would result in clients being audited, my concern were left ignored."
bad,Good People working Harder then they get paid to do.  NO yearly  bonus at the retail branch. A waste of 10 years. Look at other firms.
bad,"The Call Center in Columbus OH is an oppressive work environment which is run by a pack of millennial bullies living out their high school dreams of ultimate power.  It is easy for mature adults to ignore the juvenile snickers and comments, but being passed over for advancement because of refusing to play silly games was the last straw."
bad,This was THE WORST COMPANY I HAVE EVER WORKED AT.  No team work.  You are on your own and no one cares. First in last out on a daily basis. Management is horrible.
bad,"The work was mechanic; the management was 100% profit-driven; there was little humanity involved in the workplace; the creativity, other than that reserved for the investment bankers' type, is suffocated."
bad,"It was like the Army, literally"
bad,"Its a case if your face fits then you'll be treated well. I did my job very well, put up with a very ride colleague but never complained, I went sick for 3 weeks for a serious issue, rushed back for fear for my job. All my reviews were good and no issues were discussed with me.they cut me loose soon after citing performance issues which they told to an external recruiter and not me "
bad,"I was hire as a consultant after a long courtship.  I was there only six weeks when I was released due to budget cuts."
bad,"Firm employs outside 'consultants' who change the job requirements based on their metrics, and then changes this six months later.  No consistency, no loyalty.  Cronyism abounds."
bad,"Was recruited from Edward Jones, promises were made that were not kept. Transferred to the main office to work in Operations and Receptionist area. Was layed off due to cutbacks less than 2 years later."
bad,"Waste of time and energy. They will fire you anytime that they want. Always in danger of losing your job. No respect, never care about your life and your family"
bad,"Very challenging and stressful place to work.  No sense of accountability or impact, just political advancement.  Compensation is very good so if you can tolerate the culture than you can do well."
bad,"After 21yrs of service I was fired by my new manager after having medical leave, my workload double and after asking for help that fell on deaf ears  LOS means nothing.  Had a younger boss who thought I was over paid and put the measures in place to have me fired with no severance.  Continued to compare me to a co_worker and tell me my former boss did me no favors.  Smith Barney was great place to work but unfortunately it was bought by this terrible Company.   If you work with the right team you are golden but they are few left at this Company.   Go to UBS"
bad,"- not a realistic job for someone straight out of college unless you have access to hundreds of people with around 150,000 each and are willing to just hand it over to you so you can survive in the FAA program.."
bad,"The actual substantive work was interesting and I was able to practice my craft and be completely challenged due to the strength of the Morgan Stanley brand."
bad,The biggest problem I've seen that they don't hire talented managers they just prefer to keep loyal people for 20 years. Their methods are so outdated. Most of them just learned about Agile in 2020 and successfully failed with its implementation.
bad,Horrible managers in bangalore. I worked here for more than one year in RMZ Ecoworld. Work culture is really pathetic and there is no respect for employees. Manager used vulgar language deliberately against employees by calling them into room. I have seen one employee leave every six months from my team. People in my team were also shouted at and I moved out because of vulgarity from manager.
bad,Morgan Stanley hires tons of temp people and terminates them when their busy season is over. No matter how good of a job you do  chances of a permanent  positions is slim to none! I would never want to work their again.
bad,I had to scan in and out of every door and my manager tracked the location of my work phone. Very dull and strict. The compensation is great but there is no excitement to anyone working there.
bad,If you are not liked you will fail and they will make sure of it.  The company as a whole is not a bad place it was the management.  There was little leadership and many people were very unhappy.
bad,Not a great place to work at. Too much politics for a consultant to handle. Contract was for 10 months but was cut short due to budget issues. During my short tenure no constructive feedback was ever given
bad,Entered the company through their operations analyst program. Minimal training to do full-time functions. Pay is not competitive within the market. Work is either super busy or not busy at all with minimal learning/growth opportunities.
bad,"I am not sure where all of these positive reviews are coming from, but besides the great work-life balance, compensation is very low, management is stale at best, and the review system does not allow for any real advancement. "
bad,Manager never liked me felt I was a threat.  Never gave me work.  Never provided any direction.  I would not recommend this place to any one.  Not a good environmnet
bad,Morgan Stanley is the most average company ever. There is nothing that stands out about this firm from the upper management to the compensation. I'm not sure why I have to do this for every company I've worked for.
bad,Nice work environment and management. The procedures are well structured. Senior management very well proficient in leadership and lead the entire staff for te success of project.
bad,"good benefits, fast environment, good money. Its a very organized place with a lot of rules. The benefits are great, 401k and health insurance are greats."
bad,Management had no respect for the client.  Computer systems continuely failed.  New York management informed me that they had enough clients and would not allow me to access institutional level products for my corporate clients.
bad,this was just a temp job I took. I honestly have no clue what I was doing there. there was no guidance or anything. the facilities were nice but other than that I have no idea why I was there.
bad,Right after I started the Dean Witter manager who hired me was fired. From top management down the company has unscrupulous business practices and allows corruption to flourish
bad,Management blatantly shows favoritism and is very unprofessional. After interviewing a potential employee one manger came back and openly discussed the interview with a group of employees. I honestly wouldn't judge the company as a whole based on the department I worked with but my particular department is known for leaving a bad taste in your mouth.
bad,Worked long hours on a regular basis.  Little guidance and high expectations.
bad,"No job security, no raises, no bonus, not a good company to work for."
bad,Really disorganized and pay isn't that strong compared to other shops.
bad,These people were my family. My first real job. It was unfortunate they had to move out of state.
bad,Father son team and they are very bad managers and do a lot of back stabbing to a lot of people and do not follow all the rules in the company. The Company overall might be good but the work place in Kerrville Texas where there is a Father and son team and the Father covers up for his son at all times.
bad,Having to deal with a lot of closed minded elderly clients was difficult. There were racial comments made a lot of the time. You have to have a very thick skin to work the front desk.
bad,"I have around 5yrs of functional testing experience in Core banking, AML and compliance and IT Risk domain. "
bad,"Very difficult to move anywhere, no work-life balance unless you are at least executive director.  Primarily consulting work and low budgets mean that you will eventually be handed additional job duties.  Work twice as hard for half the reward."
bad,"I have been working at  (More than a year)"
bad,Veteran brokers who are willing to help should you initiate contact and provide value through partnership. The FAA Program has high sales goals and overlapping hurdles that may be challenging within the first months of training.
bad,Working on the floor of the NYMEX would make any shark tank seem like a slice of paradise
bad,"This is a great job for college students or adults with minimal obligations. There is no real training in place to refer back to you an depending on who you ask you'll receive a different answer. "
bad,I did not have a good experience at this company.  I had a poor manager (she doesn't work at the firm any longer).  It's been many years since I've worked there so not sure how much weight my review deserves.
bad,"Little autonomy, even for top performers.   Great place to learn, horrible place to grow.  Work from home (WFH) under the right manager is a great benefit, but you will be dinged for it if you 'overuse' it.  Overuse is not defined in any policies, departmental or firmwide, so good luck walking that fine line.  If you have a certain disposition, you like doing the same thing day in and day out, and/or you are satisfied working in a very slow to recognize talent, slow to promote, slow to change with the times, MS is probably a wonderful place to work and grow.  If you prefer a more autonomous, entrepreneurial experience where you and your opinions matter, this is not the place to work."
bad,"I was disappointed working here. The firm could really benefit by a better culture, which would need to start from the top down. The pay was not great and I did not enjoy working here."
bad,"too much politics as usual."
bad,"Not the greatest company to be part of,  co-workers not so great."
bad,"Not much to say, I was glad when I left. Very high turn over in the office."
bad,"Staff are really good people. However, company line is toed heavily. Hard work is not valued or rewarded. Operations staff is treated like lower class employees, management staff is weak and the contact center is eerily similar to mean girls (both male and female managers). Great place to get licensed and move on to somewhere that pays and treats employees like mature adults. Ohio operations/contact center is less than impressive and caliber of employees is very low."
bad,"The work life balance is horrible. They take too much for themselves and leave nothing for the trickle down. I would look elsewhere, the name isn't worth the pain."
bad,"Depends on your placement, surely some people are happy to work here.Generally speaking the environment is characterized by unabashed self-interest on the part of managers."
bad,"Great place to work only if you have the right management team.  Not everyone is in tune with the mission.   Some managers have their own mission and  do their one thing,"
bad,"Morgan Stanley has a toxic work environment with a unilateral objective:  to make the most money for the shareholders.  Morgan Stanley goes to whatever extreme necessary to squeeze out every penny of profit in both the way they compensate their advisors and employees and in the way they charge their clients.  After seven years at Morgan Stanley, I learned that I want nothing to do with the company neither as an employee nor a client."
bad,Would not recommend for working mothers.  Cry conpetitive environment and not team players.  Everyone is out for themselves and many people lost values
bad,"All I can say is that working here has made me realize that this is not the type of company I would ever want to work for. It's like being in high school where everyone gossips, secrets are told, and you get a cold look for the other employees. Nobody here is eager to help or teach you anything, they only care about themselves."
bad,"I felt very strongly that this workplace culture is detrimental to ones' health, particularly if you are a woman with children needing a bit of flexibility for children."
bad,"I worked there as a contract worker to help handle the influx of calls during tax season. The managers kept extending the contract promising that it would turn into full-time jobs. "
bad,Every one is an silo and an island. Compensation is great if you are in sales. Not so much anywhere else.  No Holiday Party; if that is something important to you.
bad,"Run the office, mail, checks, help clients."
bad,Very easy to get stuck within a team. Bonuses and raises are becoming less frequent. It is a good place to get some good experience to put on your resume as a young person.
bad,The culture at Morgan Stanley is definitely not what it used to be. I am hoping things change in the near future. There is lots to learn and very many knowledgeable people to learn from.
bad,ML was an internship. However the company did not offer any position to any interns which was concerning. The job security was the biggest concern.
bad,"•a typical day at work - 8:4:30"
bad,Management is blind to the actual work that is being completed. The tight deadlines are unachievable and as a consequence deliverables are severely impacted.
bad,"This is was a typical internship. I was able to learn a lot of how financial advising goes. Duties were typical to intern duties, not to fulfilling."
bad,Prepare and process paperwork. Resolve client issues. Meet with clients. Take client phone calls.
bad,"The managers would take days off with no notice, come in late, and take long lunch breaks. This impeded people who needed management to be around when there was none.  However, they would complain if one of the employees took 5 extra minutes for lunch.  "
bad,"Everything happens in NYC, and if you are not there, no chances you can make it. Big salaries there, only. People are very intimidating, I lasted 1.5 years and left. If you are not the shark type, I would not recommend. "
bad,"Since as an near-shore worker, the treatment is various based on the manager and groups one's assigned to. Mostly (98%) only NY/NJ workers got promoted or valued."
bad,"Pros:"
bad,Execute responsibilities based on remit. Difficult to navigate a monolithic org that is not terribly transparent. Most management seemed to be most concerned with their own advancement.
bad,"With proper guidance and management, the environment would be so much more helpful and desirable to work in. Since working at MS., ( 6months), 16 people have left and all for the reason to get out as quick as possible. Toxic atmosphere, low morale, no superior guidance and or training to carry out your job. Dead end spot."
bad,I enjoyed helping clients and the financial advisor I worked with. The atmosphere and management was poor however. I felt there was no room for growth. The income potential is unlimited for this position.
bad,Morgan Stanley has had a long history of budget cuts and laying off employees.  This isn't a ideal place to work if you want job security.  My experience in this position is that we were very poorly MICRO managed.  Our director treated like we were her little children and brought her issues from home to work as well as lash out her feelings on her staff.
bad,Global company and reach. company culture does not allow for real innovation. only ex-consultants welcome. not diverse in make up or its creative process.
bad,"Morgan Stanley was mostly good to me. Training leaves a bit to be desired. as for promotions, job performance was not the most important factor.  "
bad,Ever changing managers and directions. Many mangers are under so much pressure to produce results they never develop talent. If you have a family this maybe a tough place to work
bad,The company has gone through numerous changes over the years.  Compensation is near the bottom in the industry.  The firm is run by former consultants who have never been bankers.
bad,It is hard to get a good starting salary.  The promotional increases are poor to none existent.  Management needs to focus on retaining top talent.  However the overall culture is not as toxic as other large financial institutions.
bad,It all comes down to your management.  I found my senior management to be less than supportive which proved challenging and did not always promote an environment of teamwork.
bad,"Cons: Horrible Management, bad team dynamics, sometimes clueless senior people, and not the best pay.  "
bad,Not the best place. It would not be the best to put more in here than that. Since I need more than 150 word I would say I commend all employees to stay in the situation.
bad,Not a good place to work.  Management is to hands off.  The way I work is not respected.  I work on a team and really don't like any of the members.  Glad to leave.
bad,"I work harder now than ever, with less compensation.   The only perk is that my team is stellar and bright and a joy to work with; but unfortunately, I still need to pay the bills..."
bad,"They really work hard to shove their ""culture"" down your throat. Some of the financial advisors treat their support staff well, but most are arrogant pricks who could not care less about how they treat you. Management is no better. They are either so burned out on the job that they go out of their way to be unhelpful in difficult situations, or they are totally drinking the MS cool-aid and the Firm can do no wrong."
bad,"Not the best place to work in the world for sure. Revolving door for new hires. Your not meant to succeed, just bring in your friends and family then they can you and keep the assets..."
bad,"Handled all operational work for a HNW producer and all administrative aspects. "
bad,this job is all about who you know! the turnover rate is pretty high. chance for promotion is not based on merit but who you know.
bad,"Seems dated."
bad,"not to far off from the movie Wall Street.  If you are a big producer, you can just about commit murder before you would get fired.  Always alot of tension between brokers and manager, each is trying to gain a better position over the other.  Bad research is pretty common, very few new ideas come out of big wirehouses."
bad,Review bulk loan purchases from broker most were stretch borrower who could not afford the stretch value of property.
bad,Below market compensation and few opportunities to move up or take on more responsibilities
bad,The job is nothing as explained or promised from the beginning. It does not fit the description of what is posted on websites or what you are told in interviews. The lack of support given to complete the job is little to none. Compensation is a lie when you are told one thing and then given way lower than what you are told. Stay away if possible. The mortgage portion of this company is hotties.
bad,I work in technology. My department used to be a place that values your contribution to the business. Now it is a very bureaucratic place to work. Just sing along with their modernization theme and you will do fine there.
bad,"it is a good place to work.  People are nice there, work environment is  good, I have learned a lot from this company and my current job. like the place for giving back activity during summer time."
bad,Lack of management experience and lack of advancement. Managers are always in meetings and you are lucky if they take escalations. You have to figure out everything yourself. Your peers are nice and helpful which makes the job somewhat enjoyable. This call center site has to do a better job of hiring upper management.
bad,Horrible pay for the amount of work.  Management sets unrealistic goals but then blames employees when goals aren't met.  Blaming culture exists.  Office is very young which makes for good social life benefit.
bad,Ridiculous backstabbing culture among the administrative staff.  Immensely insecure administrative staff who don’t mind their own business. Ineffective management as well.
bad,"I was a contract to hire employee, and I was set to be converted from a contractor to an employee. Just days before my expected hire date, I got a call from my temp agency saying my contract was terminated and I was no longer being hired. I was never given a reason, and all of my personal belongings were thrown in the trash. Several of my colleagues (who were also contractors) lost their jobs shortly thereafter. "
bad,"Work hour -  from 9am to 6pm, answering emails, provide project status, responds to business partners inquires, attend calls/meeting on projects, translating business requirement to functional specs, delegating works to team, hold daily scrum call, tam status call"
bad,Not a good place to start your career the company is always looking out for their best interest first.  If your good at your job you will be stuck there.
bad,More focused on who you know rather than what you know.  Did not provide guidance when needed.  Its a financial firm so you are thrown to the wolves and you either sink or swim
bad,Too much red tape to get anything done. Most decisions need to be approved by multiple levels of management. The main focus is on reducing expenses and not servicing clients or investing in the business.
bad,We got in at around 8am. We started the day with a morning huddle. Lunch was extremely short and many employees ate at their desks. There were a lot of lay offs and many people were concerned about losing their jobs.
bad,"My review is more about the culture of the financial sales industry and not Morgan Stanley Specific."
bad,This is the quintessential corporate job. Incredibly structured and no freedom. They did not offer overtime or food for working late as other divisions or companies offered.  You will feel unimportant. New ideas are shut down at every step
bad,Morgan Stanley has pretty good benefits. It seems as though they tried to dig up problems constantly and create HR issues all the time over things that are irrelevant to progression of the company. They spin their wheels wasting a lot of money working employees on days where it's a holiday and literally no customer service calls will even be incoming and then they skimp and cut corners on other facets of the job like education and certain benefits to save money. It really makes no sense and their systems and business models are pretty separated from what they claim to be.
bad,"My day would start with me reviewing reports from our main page Actimize.  My reports consist of daily, weekly and monthly surveillance reviews.  If anyone on the team needed assistance with their workload."
bad,I gave it a shot but you have to love and live  the stock market  and that wasn't me. It's cut throat with everyone after your customers and you going after someone elses. Again not for me.
bad,After you received your license to sell securities they gave you a high sales quota to meet which only 20% made.  The majority of people who made the quota did so due to wealthy friends and family clients.
bad,Only good for those coming straight out of college. Too many layoffs and bonus and raises are non existence. Every year a group its moved offshore and it such common practice the upper manager does not even care.
bad,"Love the company and I always wanted to work here until i was part of it and i couldn't stand it. It's still a great company but it depend with the team that you are working with. This is one of the worst job that i ever had, overtime is required and no work life balance. My manager was disrespectful and very condescending...everyone on the team wondered how he was hired"
bad,"This was just an internship and there was no salary at all.  They required a lot of work and it was good to get experience but that was it.  Other than work experience, working there as an intern has no pay."
bad,"The work days are fast paced and stressful. Overtime and weekend, including overnight, work is expected on short or no notification. The priorities of upper management do not align with priorities of back office professionals. Very little resources are dedicated to improving and streamlining processes. The commitment to automation of manual processes is non existent while the focus is on the reduction of staff."
bad,Poor management is probably the number one concern.  Upper management does not give enough support.  Always short handed.
bad,"A good start for younger employees, a nightmare for experienced professionals.  There are numerous silos and senior management communicates only through an occasional e-mail and a quarterly Town Hall.  A lot of 2-3 year employees leave for more money and better working environment."
bad,"A typical day was to complete your daily duties, learned new functions such as Vendor Management. The new management team has completely change the culture of the environment of the work space new expectations of everyone's day to day job functions. The outsourcing of many functions. My co-works were great and would love to work with them again. It was not that hard I would say just the nature of the business that made it a little hard at times."
bad,"Does not appreciate it's employees and views everyone as an expense. Takes measures to cut vital employees in order to show quarterly profits, then hires cheaper replacements the following quarter."
bad,Advisory Analyst / Project Manager of Mutual Fund Order (MFRS) and Networking applications. IT organization is not transparent. Unbelieveable bureaucracy. Attitude is if you don't like it leave.
bad,"During the transistional phase of MS and SB, the culture and emphasis was squarely MS and SB employees were largely left in the cold. Wages are very poor. Conditions sub standard"
bad,"Good place to start - beyond that luck of the draw of who you work with."
bad,"Very busy, with high demand for quick turnaround on projects. The best advice I received while working at Morgan Stanley was ""keep your head down, shut up, and work faster"""
bad,"A great learning experience"
bad,"Poor culture, little to no training. antiquated systems. Lack of management. No structure. Employees treated like a number. NO work life balance. Unrealistic expectations."
bad,lots of lingo that no one outside of the firm understands. management expects near perfection and doesn't give the associate time to learn the job. very stressful
bad,Whole org is dependent on vendors and they dont wamt you to work just manage the vendors. Even if you try to bring in new ideas or current market trends they will nkt consider or take the credit if you have done some thing.
bad,"They pay well. For that you better be ready to keep your head down and not have opinions, especially anything which management can't claim as their own."
bad,"Its a mans world there they pay men more then women even when the woman has yrs of experience.  Dont leave any voicemails to anyone in HR in Spanish even if they have a spanish last name cause they will let u go. Training was good and Insurance Licensing dept was good, employees cool, mgmt & HR suck."
bad,"Competitive place to work "
bad,This is not a quality company. It lacks a decent culture and a soul. This is a place that uses people and clients. I did not enjoy my time there and regret ever taking a position with them.
bad,"Not a great place to work. little to no training, dying industry (Wealth Management) Managers want to take away from your commissions for themselves, no incentive for anyone to help you including your mentors."
bad,"Excellent employees, team players, supportive of each other. Weak and cowardly management. Systematic overhiring followed by annual reductions in force. Openly encouraged nepotism."
bad,"This company has fair benefits. Working hours are improving with the advantage of working from home at least 2 days a week."
bad,"Never felt comfortable working their. When hired from the outside you are always looked upon as an outsider. Some members of the management team were "" Two Faced"" when dealing with the employees, especially if they were hired from the out side. To this day, I still have nightmares about working there."
bad,Great opportunities to advance. Management lacked in critical areas of support. Promises not kept to me as an employee. Bigger advisors were taken care of.
bad,"I was skipped over annual cost of living raises twice. The manager gave me poor feedback at my annual review and I was caught way off guard. He did not give me any feedback during the year and then when it came to my raise, gave me a terrible review."
bad,"If you're in a support role, this place is not great. Not a lot of opportunity for advancement, the hours are not great, and management will always view you as a liability because you are not a producer. Great place to get experience and move on with your career somewhere else, or make your intentions known early on. You'll either get supported or you will get passed over because you are not what they are looking for."
bad,Very stressful day...with low salary and room for growth. no bonus and very low pay raises. only good thing were my co-workers I met during my years at Morgan.
bad,"There was a very negative atmosphere. Lack of raises for many CSA's for over a 5 year period. Dwindling benefits. Management very disconnected from the CSA's, they only cared about the FA's. CSA's were not respected or valued by management."
bad,"I am a very smart and capable manager for many positions. This position, however, was NOT hard to learn, it did require some knowledge which was, time and again, not supplied by the person responsible for my learning.  If you are full time employed you were treated fairly well.  My position was not treated with respecy."
bad,"I was a consultant for 2 years and the morale was horrible. They have a minimum of 2 years and they didn't inform me, I had to find out via a woman from another team in the pantry. My manager was always on the internet and talked too much."
bad,Good company.  A lot of resources to learn and advance yourself with.  My typical day at work was pretty busy from the beginning to the end of the day.  Management is hands off but I feel they should be a little more hands on towards the new individuals because every individual may not have that strong work ethic from there previous employers to bring over to Morgan Stanley.
bad,management was never satisfied and changed their minds constantly.  Credit group was micromanaged and never willing to accept free thinking and individuality.
bad,"Middle managers are lost in the process and clueless. Some really try but get lost in the bigger picture of mismangement overall. "
bad,"If you do not have experience within financial services firm, MS is a good place to start and learn. Rely heavily on excel skills which you will enhance while working there. Typical work day is 8-9 hours with busy month and quarter ends ranging from 10-12 hours. Workplace culture is relatively young or old, not many individuals with 7-10 years worth of experience."
bad,an experience I would not care to repeat. made certain that you knew that you were nobody.  everything is black and white. about the company and not the client.
bad,"The firm is ever changing to add divisions then without giving the team a chance to be successful, terminating that division.  It is disruptive to the employees and clients."
bad,"Yes this is the money making part of MS but at a price. Culture is toxic and cut throat. Ironically, they are surprisingly cheap in they way they do things that ultimately cost more money in the long run. There is hardly any collaboration and it's every man and woman for themselves. If you've worked in finance and have developed the callouses to survive in these environments go for it. Everyone else run away!"
bad,Management has no prior experience in mortgage and good ol boy system. You mine as well work for a broker they are way behind in everything that needs to be present in a mortgage company. You will work harder here then any other place. Don't let the name fool you with the name.
bad,"I worked at MS for 6 months and found it to be a very financial culture. Its fast paced, cut-throat and busy and the culture is very corporate and buttoned up."
bad,This role was an internship role. I was unpaid at the time and I was young and full of expectation of what this role would provide me. I quickly learned that those that worked at the company were locked in a lot of managerial red tape. Most people only worked on their core job roles. There wasnt much collaboration and generally the environment was not open or trusting.
bad,The training was good and the interview process explained the position very clearly. I knew my expectations and there were not any surprises after I accepted the position.
bad,There is no typical day - dealing with clients and management changes on a daily basis.  I prefer not to comment any further.
bad,You must have a high attention to detail at all times with cases you cover on a daily basis. It is extremely repetitive as you are assigned a batch of cases every day.
bad,worked for brnach support over all company is good but managment at regional side maked you feel like you are in army and they micro manage everything
bad,"I was only a part of the training program for about a year, but overall I was not impressed with the company. Though, over the years, they have made many changes."
bad,"Long hours, intrusive culture, expect calls on weekends and vacation time regardless of what you have scheduled "
bad,Morgan Stanley is a global company. Support teams are located all over the world. The firm  has created a technical infrastructure that is solely specific to their environment requiring new employees to undergo  specific technical training to be functional  in their technical roles. This is a good thing for in the long term for employees  but for consultants the time required to be functional in their jobs  usually is 6 months or greater and  they typically go off contract within a year or more and  have not really gained  transferable skills to their next assignment.
bad,I had the opportunity to learn a lot but I would never go back. Team members can be very rude and unethical.
bad,A career development experience that I can use for a career at another firm.
bad,"The department I worked in was particularly difficult, because there was no work/life balance, but you also didn't learn any transferable skills. I think elsewhere in the company is very different, and having Morgan Stanley on your resume is sometimes worth the sacrifices. I would just not recommend Public Finance to anyone unless you're very interested in staying in Public Finance for a career."
bad,"Poor mentoring, non existent morale, poor implementation of new procedures, no training and poor senior management."
bad,"This was a difficult positon. It was all geared towards sales and gathering assets. They offered little training and little support which would explain the 90+ percent failure rate for new FAA hires. The managers were nonexistant for the new hires as they were focused on the established FA's and helping them grow their business. The coworkers were focused on their books and not open to assisting new hires or teaching them. My day consisted of studying for my licensures, then once that was completed, it was cold calls from the moment I clocked in until I clocked out. This was the most difficult part of the day, constantly dealing with disappointment and refusals. The most enjoyable part were the few relationships I did develop with some of the coworkers."
bad,"large firm, great environment,reactive client base firm and tech savvay."
bad,"Doing the right thing is embossed on their mission, but when employees do the right thing for each other or clients, not management, they are outed. Not a great place if you have integrity or care about your team/ colleagues."
bad,"Morgan Stanley has a workplace culture where advancement relies on favoritism and clique associations and not merit of work performed. This leads to high turnover rate on high performers. Your experience at Morgan will be determined mainly on who is your direct manager and their management style. Basic training is adequate for new hires, however any advance skills or knowledge will only be offered to those selected by management for advancement"
bad,"I was a software developer but my official title was technology associate on Montreal. Also, the following review might be different depending where you are in the world / company."
bad,It is a call center environment.  The management is poor.  Their systems are poor.  They never do anything to improve the systems.  Micromanaging at its finest.
bad,I learned a lot at Morgan Stanley. We worked a lot and learned a lot of different systems in order to work effectively and efficiently. We always had heads down so we were able to provide the proper info to the Portfolio Managers daily.
bad,"While some people might enjoy the stability of a corporate job, and the static progression path a financial institution can offer, I felt like the slow moving bureaucracy and corporate overload mentality was too restricting and demoralizing."
bad,"Every day is different at MS, which provides plenty of learning opportunities. Like any organization, however, managers have their favorites, which makes career advancement difficult."
bad,"I worked as the Administrative Assistant/CSA (Client Service Associate) for the Branch Manager.  I did not have my Series 7 at the time I was hired.  I was asked to study and was given the book to study for the exam within a month of working there.  I decided about a quarter of the way through the book, that I was not interested in pursuing my Series 7 license.  Morgan Stanley was not willing to compensate me (they would pay for the exam) in anyway when it came to getting an increase or $$ for passing the exam.  I felt that this was extremely unfair to be expected to have a heavier work load and not be compensated.  The office environment was extremely hostile and I was picked on constantly by my Manager.  After working there 2 1/2 years, I was fired.  I believe my firing was a result of not wanting to pursue my Series 7 exam.  This qualification was NOT a requirement for the position at the time of hiring.  Although I did have a great rapport with all of the Financial Advisors at the firm."
bad,I left this position 6 years ago and the organization has radically changed. The company has incurred a number of reorganizations/ downsizing events including many of my peers/ managers who are now at competitor organizations. A review would be irrelevant.
bad,"no support from management, support staff is viewed as persona non grata; no bonuses; required to use your personal device for work with monthly stipend"
bad,"Good company, great people to work with. I have been a temp for too long, looking for a company with permanent employment with benefits. Best part of the job is everyday is different. Some days you are so busy you realize the whole day has gone by."
bad,If you have a family of small children don't sign up to work in a call center. Anytime you work in a call center your hours are subject to change without consideration.
bad,"days very busy, sometimes go into office before my original start time just to catch up, most enjoyable, speaking to clients"
bad,"Joined Morgan Stanley prior to the credit crunch in 2006.  Ever since the Smith Barney integration, the company culture has gone downhill, compensation is no longer competitive.  Had to leave because it was no longer the prestigious company that I joined.  The company also started laying off tons of employees as they focused on cost cutting and offshoring jobs to India."
bad,"Difficult management with zero job stability. Office was in a great location and lots of nice people; however, my boss would fail to show up to critical meetings."
bad,"Professional office environment and great for someone who does not want to move up through the ranks, is satisfied with status quo and who does not mind the stressful work environment"
bad,"Company trains you then drops you, makes no sense.  It is a Ponzi scheme to build their book of business, then let you go after not meeting near impossible hurdles."
bad,Management has total lack of regard for leadership staff development and recognition. No true track of productivity or path for advancement.
bad,"Company had a high staff turn over, meaning lots of opportunity for development. However the HR team was poorly managed. "
bad,"It was a decent transitional period job, but the work environment was not to my liking.  Constantly felt like I was just another numbered cog and had little personal touch."
bad,"Promotes on time served, not intelligence."
bad,"I was a prior Smith Barney employee. Since Morgan Stanley bought us and we merged into their management and computer systems things have gone down hill fast. I would not recomend working for this company. It is literally impossible to get your work done with the new web based system they have available. No training and not enough operations staff to support the branch. Operationally, it is impossible to be efficient and get things done in a timely manner."
bad,Morgan Stanley was good to have on a resume but there was little upward mobility in title/pay.
bad,"When I started my old position under Citi/Smith Barney associates where challanaged to want to excel and promote themselves to want to move forward, givien opportunities to learn and advance were abundant. Management and associates working together in finding new ways of how to make our environment better, co-workers worke together in problem solving, training and maintaining a cohesive working space. The hardest part of the job was volume, each associate averaged between 70 to 85 incoming calls a day, but even with that high volume we had the skills to maintain a high level of performace of providing great customer assistant. The best part was the problem solving and interaction with had with the different levels of internal customers, networking with employees in different departments and creating support systems that allowed you to network throught the company."
bad,"The company's values are very twisted. This is a very top heavy company that has no focus on the analysts and associates who drive the company. Employees are not valued at all. There is no job security, as they send more and more jobs to India and replace full time jobs with contract employees. Management is promoted based on seniority. The two managers that I have are horrible, but have been with MS for 7 years each. Pay is poor. Bonuses have not been give the past 3 years. No raises the past 2 years. No ability to move within the company."
bad,Overall great education and training for employees. Management was from a top-down approach so Senior levels we rarely heard from but from a Branch Manager perspective it was a good experience. I enjoyed working with my co-workers but it was a very competitive and demanding job that really was not commensurate with the overall pay and benefits.
bad,The company has departments that offer work from home. This is great benefit.
bad,promotions and pay is not performance based in the analyst program. people can do bad at their job and still get paid more than others on the team. New York is king to baltimore. Whatever they say goes.
bad,"Fun place to work if you like stress. Most of the people are excellent.  But, after recent staff reduction of 25%, there is too much work for too few people.  Good resume building"
bad,Each employee had a large amount of work assigned which resulted in long hours.  Management provided very mimimal guidence and direction on prioroted. Unrealistic expectations.
bad,"* Directors are coding on small projects , rather than taking care of the team"
bad,"culture was adversarial and management was unpredictable. Worked long hours and while pay was decent, there were no raises or opportunity for advancement."
bad,I stayed there too long. They say that they are an environment that is moved up in via achievements; not really. They are very stingy when it comes to raises.
bad,"I have not been employed at Morgan Stanley for over 14 years so at this juncture I have no opinion.  As I remember it was a good experience, nice co workers."
bad,"Supportive work- environment with ability to grow and develop.  There are opportunities if you  take them and good leadership.  Unfortunately, unable to retain top talent due to inability to pay."
bad,"The management structure is disorganized and are not on one accord with most of their company objectives. Processes and systems are out of touch with the market and industry objectives."
bad,"Morgan Stanley doesn't foster a culture of innovation. Their policies are traditional, and management is allergic to change."
bad,Morgan Stanley was in significant transition at the time I worked there.  This was for a short period of time and I would not think the challenges of the environment are typical and still present.
bad,Office politics the most needed skills. Company does not care about their employees whatsoever.
bad,"You cold call a lot.   It's a classic sales job.   If you sell you make money.  If you do not sell you starve and go away.  "
bad,The risk is not worth the reward here.  Employees are extremely underpaid for the amount of daily workload and the risk of what goes along with it.   Compensation also almost never happens.  There were two years in a row where no one got a raise or a bonus.  It takes years to get to a higher level if you begin as an analyst I. Which means you will be getting paid very little for at least 4 years.
bad,"Lots of politics, Very good Co-workers, Management kinda sucks, Not very trendy with technologies"
bad,"This company is still a two headed monster. Due to political infighting there is no risk taking. Collaborating with other colleagues and departments is effectively stifled. Its not uncommon for a colleague or manager to scoop your idea if it is working and claim credit for it, or for an idea that is not working, torpedo you. As a result, more time is spent managing up, thinking inside of a box, and towing the party line."
bad,"A typical day at work was a grind. Get there earlier than everyone else and then stay later than the full time staff even when they tell you that you don't need to because it's understood. People were miserable or didn't know it. The extreme lack in diversity of thought was very off-putting. You are paid well for this, but I didn't want that lifestyle."
bad,"Morgan Stanley is a good place to work, however they pay their employees very low wages and career advancement is also very limited.  Management at Morgan Stanley is however very competent,"
bad,"Great pay and work-life balance. They are very flexible with schedules. Poor management & they don’t care for their employees unless you’re an extreme brown-noser. Lots of disorganization when it comes to cross training, switching departments & overall as a company. Poor communication from management & above. Training is not sufficient or thorough."
bad,It was very difficult to bring new client given the time frame goals without the full support of the firm. The training at the time was not gear and concentrate to make an individual successful in the finacial Advisor role.
bad,"Worst place I ever worked at. Did not like the culture, the people, the top down hierarchy, not one opportunity for growth or development. Hours were ok."
bad,It was a sales job.  The branch was awesome but I felt like I was just a number to the main office. It was hard to navigate the ins and outs of the big company.
bad,This was last job in finance I worked and working at this company was very average at best. I have worked at several other finance companies that are leaps and bounds better for growth advancement and culture.
bad,overall experience was below average. Management was not helpful. Senior advisors don't even sniff your way when starting the program. You do have the opportunity to make a lot of money but that much further down the line
bad,"Hard to get work done. You fight with the systems and management more to get stuff done thank you do doing the actual work. Spend more time following up on things making sure that management approves or does there part, which they almost never do."
bad,"The company offers great benefits for its employees."
bad,A good place to be if you like the stock market and meeting people. Demanding culture but rewards those that work hard. Lot of smart and hard working people.
bad,There is a big turnover in the Budapest branch of Morgan Stanley. Mainly because a 10 year old could do the job that for some reason requires a degree in business on their job postings.
bad,"Not a good company if you are looking to advance in other professional areas, company is primarily about the advisers and not other employees."
bad,Incoming workforce is not sticking since senior management is having a hard time relating to millennials and their needs. Almost all of them plan to leave 1-3 years in.
bad,"Consultants are not very well integrated into the team."
bad,"Provides nice environment for professional development"
bad,"On boarded project without any direction, and with offshore team treated me as consultant. when Client got involved Offshore team became responsive. MS needs to have better communication in writing about the roles and responsibility to allow successful project completion."
bad,Competitive and full of type A personalities ready to take you to the cleaners.  Horrible experience and would not recommend to anyone that actually likes working with teams and collaborating.  Everyone is out for themselves and upper management does not care.
bad,"Meeting weekly deadlines and management goals, prioritize and satisfy the OCC regulators, very long hours but great people and management."
bad,for a young man that wants no social life but desires to build a business and has an 8 year plan to do so.  Investment banking is the place for such a person.
bad,"Not very trendy with latest technologies. Lots of in-house proprietary software no one else uses in industry, lots of obsolete software to maintain."
bad,"At some point, compensation will need to be increased for staff. Currently, the practice is to only increase on promotions (and even that is waning), or as a counter offer for an employee who has a new opportunity. Recently more and more frequently, these counters have been refused even when the counter was greater. This is in part due to the lack of bonuses and the recognition that ""if money is available now, why wasn't it during year end comp discussions?"" It leaves a horrible feeling throughout the firm and no work/life balance or education opportunities are going to make up the fact that a good portion of the workforce is underpaid by industry standards. Some of the best advisors and financial professionals work for this firm, it should be an honor to be employed. However, until talent is compensated at a top notch rate, we will always be considered lesser to our competitors."
bad,"I learned the basics of the Financial Industry (type of accounts, process of acquiring and following up on leads, etc). I worked with a representative and made all the cold calling. I received my share of rejection during my time but managed to generate"
bad,"While I'm sure other areas are run better but if the entire Firm was run the way my group and the areas we supported are, they would go out of business"
bad,Company has great perks and several good managers and employees.  They follow SDLC principles to the best of their abilities.  Change of technology is dependent on the division.  Some divisions are very slow to change.
bad,I did not enjoy my experience at Morgan Stanley because I thought the management treated their employees very poorly and also the people in general tended to be very cut throat.
bad,Most employees commute up to 2 hours to work there. The employees are friendly and easy to work with. Expectations are reasonably in line with the salary. Benefits are great.
bad,"Good co-workers, decent information systems and infrastructure, and a generally strong direction as a company overall. Fixed income has been scaled down and probably will continue to scale down. Management was slow moving, but smart people are at the helm."
bad,"You have meaningful goals. Our Financial Advisors can help you reach them. For nearly 80 years, we have worked with individuals, families, businesses and institutions—to deliver services and solutions that help build, preserve and manage wealth. We understand our clients’ aspirations, and we’re as devoted to their goals as they are"
bad,"A lot of products, needed better guidelines and benchmarks on commissions for each product. Management was great and supportive."
bad,hated the company mostly because work load was heavy and no one was helpful.  would not recommend this to any one.  stay away from it .....
bad,"      Support critical low latency trading applications used by equity DMA division, and external buyside clients, i.e. Morgan Stanley PASSPORT"
bad,Transition of JV not handled well. Forcing focus on larger accounts. Fees increasing
bad,Financial Advisor training program needs improvement.  Success rate far too low for a reason.
bad,"I work for a financial advisor that manages $1B in assets. A typical day consists of heavy phone coverage and responding to client requests, such as transferring securities between accounts, wiring funds, and sending checks. I prepare/complete client forms and work with the advisor and staff (two other advisors, a second CFP in addition to the primary advisor, and two CFAs) determining strategies for clients funds and situations. We take clients through a rigorous financial planning process that covers all areas of life, including insurance, annuities, long term care, lending, wills, estate planning, retirement planning, and philanthropic strategies. I open accounts, establish them on management (on our discretionary platform where we 100% manage the funds and with 3rd party money managers), prepare research and performance reports for client meetings, and countless other similar tasks."
bad,"Cutthroat business and there is no real culture. Management does not care about how you bring in revenue, only that you do. There is no leadership."
bad,"The work is very repetitive and even though the motto is ""quality of over quantity,"" there is an extreme pressure to process applications. Due to this I am able to pay high attention to detail. I enjoy working with my co-workers who have a lot of energy. However the culture of the office is alway under a constant stress. There is also a poor level of comunication between manager and employees, which creates a dent in the work."
bad,Good experience. Development of skills. Limited mobility and advancement opportunities.
bad,typical day involves selling MSSB's principal inventory to the street and acting as an outlet for FAs to buy third party offerings
bad,Wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless you have some rich friends.
bad,I worked at Morgan Stanley for a year and was given a package and told that my position was eliminated while on maternity leave. Every job I applied for since then with the company was an automatic response that my application wasnt accepted.. good luck!
bad,it's a place you can use as a stepping stone. Job movements within the form can be difficult...
bad,"Greatest part of the job is the people you meet. Overall work environment is stuffy, quiet, no real sense of community. Feels like management only cares to please the big fish. The admin staff don't get treated well...no real perks."
bad,A leading investment banking company which delivers excellent platform for wall street. Very stressful job especially when you need to work with global team from different countries in different timezone.
bad,"o	Comparing budgets with actual cost & revenues related to production, marketing and capital"
bad,learnt to deal with clients
bad,Fixing bugs. Debugging the code changes. Understanding the business requirement. Worked mostly on handling error during trading
bad,"Extreme work life balance"
good,"Management doesn't care about their people. There is a lack of transparency and they play favorites. The department claims to  promote work/life balance but that's only for the favorites. If you haven't been at the company over a  certain number of years, you're seen as dispensable with no regard to how hard you work."
good,"Dont bother, they contract large portion and then let them go in an instant. No job security, no benefits, horrible hours, a bureaucratic place. You are better off working an intermediate job else where until you can find a position worth working for."
good,Good place to gain experience. But in terms of growing I personally did not feel like it is a place to do it. And the perks for the employees are not good.
good,"The typical day at Morgan Stanley is high energy and demand with very little work/life balance. "
good,"this was only a temp role of few weeks so no much time to get insight of the company but overall, fast paced very busy role with not so good life work balance"
good,"I learned a lot while at Morgan Stanley, however there was poor support or investment by the management.  The style of the Vice President was to put people down and challenge them by insulting their efforts and office support staff openly said the entry level program is designed so that people fail.  Disappointing and yet I learned a lot - training was excellent.  If a person did not meet the expected sales numbers training was denied for them."
good,I had a  terrible manager. She monitored how long I was offline even bathroom breaks. Sucks because it was a great place but some managers needed additional training. The culture is very young and diverse. I was laid off after they had a bad year. Last in first out. The sick and vacation benefits were amazing. The pay was not great  considering I  am highly educated.
good,"I wanted to work in the back office. There was no way to get to the back office from the front...it wasn't for me at all. Beware, at any time the lowest producers are let go!"
good,The environment is fact paced and operations are 24/7/365. Call Center associate shifts range from Monday to Friday to offering several 10 hour shifts to cover the weekends.
good,Sell fee based products for awhile then get fired for not producing enough. You are working for the senior brokers as they will get all your clients eventually.
good,We were outsourced to another company owned buy MS and had to train them on how to do our jobs.  Then we were out of a job. Worked Sunday nights alone not a good environment to work solo.
good,"Its all about Morgan Stanley!!  You do get free lunches paid by wholesalers and note it's not Morgan Stanley taking care of employees. If you don't already have a BIG book of business you will not be in the eye sight of management.  Training was HORRIBLE!!  Failed Financial Advisers are training new young employees. What does that say? "
good,"Though this is a very well known firm, it is one of the most uncomfortable atmospheres I have ever worked in.  Though this atmosphere seemed to be vary widely from department to department.  The department that I supported, Private Wealth, was one of the most restrictive and monitored.  The high points were the people that I worked with.  After 15 years of working together, we had become a tight knit group.  We laughed a lot.  Days were very hectic.  Some more so than others.  My duties ranged from opening accounts for clients to transferring funds to receiving firms and vendors.  A typical day would start with wire transfers, ACAT Transfers and Journal movements.  Followed by account maintenance, documentation review and fielding calls from the sales teams.  We acted as liaisons between the sales teams and the Legal Department.  Every day was different but my coworkers and I were very good at what we did"
good,This company does not care about their long standing employees!
good,"A typical day is never the same as the job consists of various hats, from on-boarding, budgeting, event planning, processing expense and travel to project management."
good,It really wasn't for me. Same thing everyday and no ability of advancement.
good,"They give you the tools to make it and you have to give it the sweat. You can make it if you have a great niche as an FA or if you work 12 hours a day M-F and half of Saturday. I didn't take advantage of the opportunity to the best of my abilities. It's not easy, nor likely you will succeed, but it is possible."
good,"A typical work day consisted of working with your group of financial advisors.  Maintaining and managing client accounts, opening/closing accounts, client support.  Maintaining daily operations of the firm.  "
good,"I am not comfortable begin forced to provide an on-line review."
good,"Morgan Stanley is ok environment. I was consultant. The environment and the group I was working was OK. The thing i did not like was to get some access , it takes long time.Not sure why. may be too many levels of approvals,"
good,"Not an employee-friendly environment. All about revenue and fee income. The company seems stuck in the 1990s, with very poor employee retention strategy."
good,"needs work in advancement of Minorities, more work life balance , this company is very cliquish and don’t allow people to advance out of the circle  . The salaries are very low"
good,salary much better than peers. office locations are good. type of work is very low type. hire-fire policy with no help from management to progress career. india is a puppet to usa management. spineless india management unable to provide any true leadership
good,Working for Morgan Stanley was a good for gaining experience but thats all.  It isnt a place that I would want to work for too long.  I would recommend working there for a little while to get experience and then leaving to getting a better job.
good,"Operations Management.......is a joke . There is no ops management. Management is supposed to lead by example , be willing to help there employees , create a positive work environment. Working here feels like your constantly trying to slay the dragon or at least duck from the fire . They are rude to their employees , unwilling to help or do anything . They play people against each other . They have there favorites for sure which just causes more animosity. "
good,Flexible working arrangements. Work from home benefits. Great Maternity and paternity leave. Your opinion is valued and appreciated. Collaborative environment.
good,Managers are very selfish and unwilling to teach and mentor you towards growth. Pay is not impressive and work life balance is not encouraged.  I didn’t not enjoy me stay.
good,"I worked at MS for 8 Months. Since day one it was clear that i was a contractor, hence different treatment."
good,"A well known firm that was pumping out brokers at the time with the most basic training with very little guidance. They literally gave me a phone and said here you go, start opening accounts."
good,"I was treated like a child for a lot of the time, and the last manager absorbed my multi-million dollar book and made me an over-glorified sales assistance to an older, tech challenged broker."
good,"I met and worked with some cool people; others were a bit more awkward.  It was a flexible working environment for me as I worked as a temp, but it did not seem so flexible for the permanent workers. I think that was the culture; they seemed to prefer for people to actually work in the office. Overall, I'd say it was an interesting work experience."
good,"This company is good for learning a job but not good for a long term stay. I would advise to learn as much as possible, then more on to a more desirable possible. Back office positions to not pay well. You need to come in with a good salary because yearly pay increases do not occur."
good,While I enjoyed working for this company there weren't much opportunity to move up. Great place to start your career in the financial industry.
good,Largely what you would expect to find at one of the largest financial firm. Many opportunities to be had with in organization but politics will play a larger role as someone moves up through ranks of organization. This is not to indicate that is the only thing but it will influence decisions. In my overall experience the people in the firm are highly intelligent and great to work with.
good,"The work experience was limited by poor management."
good,"No growth and noone willing to help you, no work life/balance, boring, long hours, little vacation days, bad healthcare"
good,"I enjoyed most of my co-workers, we had a very good team.  There were a lot of issues with management.  There was very little promotions given department wide."
good,"Good Job Culture, low job security and advancement, Management in Operations is not great! Several positions are being outsourced offshore. Consider working in risk management, audit, compliance, not in operations. No advancement, compensation is not great, bonus is not the  best"
good,"Are not honest company"
good,"Not much training, for an individual new to the industry. 3 month production evaluations."
good,"be careful of office politics. this is why I want to leave. Fast paced, triple my work load than my previous company. Not a place for you to stay life long"
good,The company attempted something new within the mortgage industry but failed to deliver in almost every way possible.  The company is a great company but the mortgage division leaves a lot to be desired.
good,I met many very intelligent and thoughtful individuals.  The firm has a strong presence across all three of its main businesses.  Growth opportunities are limited at certain levels due to entrenched management.
good,"Typical expectations of metrics and customer service balance. Flexible schedule, flexible pay. Plenty of additional details to train and improve upon."
good,"Coworkers were amazing, culture was terrible. They would fire people the week before Christmas giving no severance. This didn’t happen to me, but several coworkers of mine."
good,Very stressful environment due to the constant layoffs. Also had to oay for parking. Not much room for growth hwre and no bonuses. Not much incentive to work harder
good,There extremely strict and management sexually harassed me and nothing was done. They are extremely uppty everyone acts as if their too good. not personalable
good,"Morgan Stanley is a large financial service firm involved in all of the global capital markets. The company has an extensive range of clients, and caters to their needs."
good,"Wore a full suit most days. The office was in a good, convenient location. It was very nice to work in and everyone was pretty friendly. Would help the Financial Advisors by calling prospective clients."
good,Morgan Stanley is a reputable company but does not have any flexibility or up to date culture. Managers are good but there is not much room for growth within the company
good,"Work day was great, no massive pressure but expectation to do your job well."
good,"Limited advancement potentional, compensation is way below the industry standard. Decent work life balance. Flexibility to work from home. Rarely have to work weekends"
good,"A lot of smart professionals to work with, which is very nice!  The work / life balance is not very good. Extra working hours are needed some time during the year."
good,A good pace to get started in this industry but there is a lack of advanced positions in the central Ohio area. Most require relocation to NY. Hours are fixed with stock market schedule. Be aware that this company usually requires employees to use 2 consecutive weeks of vacation at some point during the year as a fraud prevention procedure. MS is generous with their paid time off but the 2 weeks can be problematic for some that choose to space their vacation days. Raises are infrequent and low even for the best performers.
good,"They want more work done with less people and it is only getting worse.  Executives leave when they want and rarely work late, attending parties, etc.  They have the worst work/life balance I have seen in 20+ years of work experience."
good,"Overal a reputable company to work for. A leader in wealth management banking.However, location in Ohio is small which hinders career advancement prospects."
good,"Management is not knowledgable of any employees position, there is no career advancement and no culture, management does not support associates and will not pay attention to your needs"
good,"Management could not make decisions, always afraid of loosing his job.  Over loaded support staff without any concerns of balance.  Speaking up only resulted in more stress.  The harder you worked the more they expected you to do.  Other employees were able to take advantage of excessive time off/sick days with no repercussion."
good,Love The job but the job culture and management is bad at times. Poor management leads to employees routinely working 7 days a week. pass through vendor means terrible benefits and no paid vacation.
good,"Lower the hurdles and give the FAA a chance to actually learn the business (how to service a client, open accounts, build portfolios, etc) before throwing them out to the wolves as soon as they receive their series 7 and series 66 licenses. Program needs much better structure if the company actually wants the younger FAs to succeed in this industry and at Morgan Stanley"
good,Finance operations is always looking to outsource all jobs. Job security is scarce. Mngt is always hiring temps over full time employees. Training is just shadowing.
good,I prefer not to add a review based on personal experience.  All in all an OK place to work  but everyone is out for themselves and if you are not in management.
good,"No job security,no work life balance no scope for growth management is not helpful only listen to senior management no team meetings, no skip level meeting , HR is not at all approachable only listen to  senior management"
good,very political place.as with any large organization need to be working to please numerous bosses. competitive and cut throat culture (especially as you get closer to more senior level)
good,"fast paced, touch environment to stay in, a lot of people leave "
good,"Was a great job with a lot of room to step up and take initiative.  There was already a culture of hard work, but internal changes over time made it more difficult to maintain a life outside the job. Most of the internal event team has left in the last 2 years due to poor management."
good,"It was insinuated that work was more important than family and that > 50 hours a week were expected. This isnt just during a busy season, but all year long."
good,"My job is intense and high stressed...this is the nature of the business...My day starts off trading in the morning and processing clients requests in the afternoon...I multitask all day...from answering phones, wishing clients happy birthday to sending out Million Dollar wires and Trading Stocks, Bonds, Mutual funds and Managed Accounts...you wear multiple hats in this position...The frustration of this job is the Financial Advisor I work for...Tough Lady, very successful however she is a super micro-manager which makes my job 100 X's harder...plus my position does not offer growth potential."
good,prefer no to disclose on a webpage.Please feel freee to contact me with any questions.
good,"A typical day at work consists of prepping documents for meetings. Setting up video conferences and managing three senior level executives. I have learned so much about coordinating and planning in the upper management field,. The hardest pert of the job is that it gets extremely busy, but I have now learned how to manage my time effectively. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my co-workers to get things done in order for my managers to run a big company."
good,"I learned a lot about shipping and receiving and basic warehouse knowledge and UPS, FEDEX, DHL AND USPS"
good,"Easy work but unstable environment. Some of the shop is permanent workers and others are contractors, which makes it a hostile environment. These days the mostly hire contractors."
good,"I took a long time to be officially hired there. I was a consultant for over two and a half years. Overall, I enjoyed working there.  I found the hours to be extremely long. Since I don't have a family, I didn't mind this but would certainly have an issue if I had small children at home.  On the plus side, the culture is the overall pretty flexible meaning if you have to step out for an hour or so, that's perfectly fine."
good,"Low morale as effort is not acknowledged.  Be sure to negotiate compensation as salary increases are non existent. Bonuses are rather small. Vacation for VPs is only 4 weeks and no personal days.  Poor management, constant restructuring and realignments and lack of job security.  The health insurance package is relatively good and other insurances are available at a reasonable cost.  The campus and amenities are also very good.Indoor parking can be difficult."
good,"- 5 reorganizations in 2 years"
good,"The culture at Morgan Stanely is bittersweet."
good,Not for everyone. You definitely have to have the mental toughness and desire to become successful in the financial advisor training program. Make sure you establish good relationships with senior advisors. They will not come to you.
good,"Not technological, not many incentives, not typical Silicon Valley culture, solid bank."
good,"Horrible compensation management does not view talent lack of management, work life balance is horrible with the Operations functionality. Lack of management experience in understanding culture and team strengths."
good,no comment - i do not feel comfortable about my work experience there and trials tribulations that was bestowed upon my self. I feel its best to leave things unsaid.
good,"Typical day would start at 8:30, with Off-offshore team meeting, followed by QA calls and various meetings with business for collecting and discussing business requiremtns."
good,"The work was fun and challenging, usually always busy. You do need to keep your options open for advancement elsewhere. There are smaller franchises, making it difficult to climb up the ladder."
good,Not a good place to work. Company is very cheap and no one is willing to help. They cater more to the financial advisers and are not good to their employees. Management is very disorganized.
good,Competitive Culture with smart people. Great experience. Good team atmosphere. Challenging day to day work. Average compensation and benefits. Limited opportunity for advancement.
good,I enjoy working for Morgan Stanley but am disappointed in the lack of mobility and compensation. I have experienced continual change in managers and responsibilities but have not been able to achieve the rewards of hard work and dedication.
good,Employees are seen as numbers and work \life balance is non-existent. At least that's the expectation for any form of advancment. Politics plays a very large role here.
good,"Mission driven"
good,"I have to say, it's just a internship, but I learned a lot from it. But I'm a little bit upset that they did not even let me know the license test that is required for financial industry. They only want me to read the documents that they don't want to read. They don't really care about me."
good,tense working environment. Little bit above average pay. Consultant treated like a utility for the company. Don't have chance to do any interesting work. People there is very skillful and willing to help each other.
good,"You go in, do your job, and leave.  There is not time for talking to anyone if you are not working.  You don't work with anyone you know, it's all done on the phone talking to clients and workers at other locations."
good,"Work was OK but not challenging enough. Office had free coffee but there was no break room to eat lunch at, you had to either eat at your desk or go out somewhere."
good,"Those joining Morgan Stanley fresh out of school have a lot of opportunities and exposure to different aspects of the company. You have a clear career track and standardized expectations of how you will develop and advance with the company. "
good,"Working at Morgan Stanley-"
good,The commission payout is very low and in favor of the firm compared to other firms on the street. The turnover rate of financial advisor associates is even higher.
good,"I'd have to say the wealth management side of Morgan Stanley left little to be desired.  I do believe there were some people there that were extremely hard workers, but management doesn't do much to help you out."
good,I wasn't with the right group at Morgan but it is a great firm with a great platform and it's own company. No big banks to call the shots or make life more difficult than it must be.
good,"- long hours and unpaid overtime"
good,"An okay company to work for, but really depended on which team you wee able to get on.  It was very hark to move from team to team if you weren't part of a particular family, or part of the operations managers group of friends"
good,"Same old work, same old technologies."
good,"Poor management, no job security. Good compensation. Lack of support from branch management.____________________"
good,I was a Smith Barney alum at Morgan Stanley.  I preferred the Smith Barney office culture because it seemed more personable.
good,"The management needed to be changed.  They hire you as a temp with no benefits such as holiday pay, sick leave or vacation.  There is no given time frame as to how long you will be on temp status."
good,Morgan Stanley is good place to work. Most hires are temporary to hire. The culture is business professional. The dress is business casual. They main charity to community and world at large is volunteering and is promoted monthly and calculated for great incentives.Morgan Stanley is very well know for their volunteerism and community contributions.
good,"Lower Pay then median for industry.  Long hours.  Excellent co-workers, very talented and easy to work with.  Management will revisit decisions often and change project direction midstream."
good,"good environment to work in,."
good,"Finding investment solutions for client’s investment needs.  "
good,Good work life balance. But management needs to improve on advance careers for workers. It'll be better if there is bigger room to grow careers.
good,Decent pay and work life balance for a Major Investment Bank. Always talk of layoff and lowering bonus expectations which tends to bring down morale. Your experience there will depend solely on your relationship with your Manager
good,"It is a great place for young people to grow their career. It gets great  brand name and lots of things to learn from. In addition, it has great global network."
good,"Busy"
good,Too much favoritism and not enough opportunity to advance. Your advancement depends on who you know not on what you know or what your capability is.
good,"Investment banking is a difficult field to work in. The work / life balance is terrible. The pay is quite good -- though not as good as it used to be. Morgan Stanley is a fine place to work... just try to go into it with open eyes -- which is to say, expect to sacrifice your personal life and experience considerable stress for the sake of either money or the professional experience you will receive, which is quite good in the first few years."
good,"Currently working with Morgan Stanley with Prime Brokerage team and have handles following areas:"
good,"Long hours, average pay, poor management from top down. The"
good,"New Sourcing Management regime operates as a cult....If they dont't let you in...they put you out. Extremely biased, rapid nepotism with zero growth if you are not welcome to the kool-aid!"
good,"Overall - typical big bank. Managment is old, very tight mobility and systems out of date."
good,"Not stable at the moment,lack of management Great people to work with"
good,"Be careful, this is not wealth management, but sales. Also, if you were a Portfolio Manager in a past life, this is not the job for you."
good,"The tradition of Morgan Stanley legacy as a noble institution continues but under the current circumstances of trying to adapt to a changing world, the challenges of continued success seem elusive."
good,fast paced challenging environment with great people to learn from. Management is weak in their approach as they are confined by production goals. No room to grow in FL.
good,"Alapjában véve a Morgan Stenley egy átlag multi cég, előnyei a versenyképes fizetés és nem kötelező a túlóra, de opcionális ha valakinek jól jön a pénz."
good,"being an attorney at MSIM is a really good move if you are:"
good,"Well paid salary considering the technologies adopted."
good,"If you work in wealth management, there are limited options for advancement if you are not a financial advisor.  If being an FA is your goal, have a plan to prospect potential clients prior to starting and find a team that will support you in executing that plan.  The wealth mgmt division is not supportive of personal development, it purely comes down to revenue generation."
good,"No work life balance, nice people to work with but more stress and work than they are willing to pay. Good place to work your way up, plenty of opportunities to grow. Pay doesn’t match growth and no firm bonuses."
good,Was only interning for one day a week and they never had much to do for me. Always told me that i would get hands on experience but never did. Never got any advice or tips from Financial Advisors just mostly worked with their assistants.
good,"I had multiple instances of clients expecting me to know one off instances of highly specialized investment products or accounts. Even Senior Management was not aware of these items but I was chewed up and spitted out for these ""failures on my part"" In most cases it was like the single or one out of two accounts in Brazil or Argentina that had that feature."
good,"No real culture. Very independent. poor moral. Strictly a hard sales role. High expectations. Financial products or wid gits, it didn't matter........"
good,"Really enjoyed the various projects that I got involved in, which are intellectually stimulating. The fast environment can be exciting, but at times might be too much pressure. People tend to look out for themselves and may blame each other for their mistakes. One has to be on their toes."
good,"Focused on financial advisors and very strict policies. Managers are ineffective and do not care about employees, only covering their butts. Other employees in my business are wonderful, the management issues hinders a full 5 star review"
good,Workplace with many opportunities if you know how to network.  The company is big enough and offers many opportunity for mobility. You have to learn to build connections
good,Starting out this was a nice introduction into the corporate world. Now 6 years in the thrill and passion has dwindled. There is no room for advancement or salary compensation increase and the lack of motivation and appreciation has taken its toll. As I strive to make a difference the culture has changed limiting problem solving and free thinking. This was a great job to start out but not meant as a career.
good,Not a good work environment.  Poor management. Poor customer service. Felt like the company did not value its clients and employees.   Not a good enviroment to thrive in
good,"Wake up and start reading email off the mobile device, it's a global company so other time zones are waiting on a response. I learned that it very hard to move up from within certin divisions, many of the senior management staff do not leave their positions so it's impossible to move up. You can achieve a better title however, not a more senior position."
good,"They accommodate schedules, remote work and the people are generally collaborative and willing to work a project to completion. It is difficult to move from contracting roles to full time."
good,If you are not prepared to leave your social life behind then it is not for you. You must be able to always network and attract new assets to the firm with your monthly goals being lifted higher month by month
good,provided employees the ability to work from home 1 or 2 days a week depending upon a managers approval.  provided paid compensation for performing volunteer work that is under the companies approval
good,I do not recommend any person to work as a contractor in morgan Stanley. they have lot of discrimination for full timers and contractors.SO I strongly do not recommend
good,"Overall, Morgan Stanley are a reasonable organisation to work for."
good,Closed office without notice.  Overall positive work environment but with changes morale was lost and moving to another state.  Regular corporate restructure without thought of employees.
good,Not much direction for new advisors looking to make a career.  The program is more about feeding the older advisors with new assets when the new advisors fail out.
good,"There is somewhat a disconnect between upper management and the lower levels management.  Plans and vision that seem interesting are too often botched when implemented because of politics and ""pointy-haired bosses"".  Lots of reorganization that don't really change anything.  Who you know is actually more important than what you do and how well you do it."
good,"As a CSA if you don't work with a respectful FA who will compensate you then your life will be miserable. The company does not care about us. Our concerns are not heard, including when we have felt unsafe."
good,It is a welcoming fast-pace environment. I learned a great deal about finance there. The people are friendly and encouraging.  The company will work with you to make sure that you receive all of your certifications.
good,"I worked here as an intern and pretty much was locked into an office to cold call the entire day. I definitely used as an office jockey used to make the manager money. There was not much room for advancement and I did not really learn anything new as I was doing the same thing at my last internship, where I was making commission as well. This was just a job I took hoping to be a start to a career after college but the manager that I worked for definitely was just looking for cheap labor to man the phones and bring in leads."
good,It was an internship.  The majority of time is spent chasing customers.  There is no analysis of financial products.  Althought it was interesting how many non business realted degrees were employed there.
good,"Wants to be Goldman, but not as competitive or serious about it. Compensation is decent, but definitely could be a lot better. Work-life balance can be difficult depending on your department and role. The job is literally what you make out of it because no one is going to do it for you. Mostly relaxed environment or more self-directed, as there is a lot of work and it's expected to be completed regardless of the work hours required."
good,"The culture at Morgan Stanley has become very cutthroat over the past few years.  Emphasis on cost savings and reduction in force has management at all levels looking for people to set aside at a moments notice.  Until the past 3 years, it was know the company was coming through a rough stretch and people were willing to ""do their part"".  Unfortunately, as the results started to get better, Mr Gorman shifted the focus to ROE which directly meant shedding people and compensation."
good,Great Company staff a bit strained and stiff but other wise OK. Would work there again if the opportunity presented itself. Wsa my second time with the enterprise.
good,It is a good place to grow as a professional. This place is very competitive and has grate diversity of people working there. During my years working at Morgan Stanley I had meet a lot of talented individuals.
good,Expected to be welcomed into the group and considered for advancement.  NEVER happened!  Cutthroat would be a kind term for the group.  They were nice enough to my face but were secretly waiting for and expecting me to fail.
good,"I enjoyed my time at MS. I was there since they were Citi Smith Barney and the technology rollouts were the most stressful because it didnt feel like they could keep their programs predictable. But overall, it was a good and encouraging place to work. I was recruited by RBC and paid more, thats the only reason why i left"
good,Work life balance does not exist.  Baltimore traffic is terrible.  Having children is seen as a disadvantage.  Must be available at all hours.  Having family commitments is a negative.
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with at the branch in Colorado Springs.  But trying to get work done through the back office/corporate was so frustrating.  I felt very unproductive when working so hard due to lack of knowledge from the back office. I would go back to work there if the back office was better trained for the job they are trying to do.
good,"Morgan Stanley has been a great place to work but the lack of work life balance has created a negative work environment. You have to be able to have a life out of work and as a person with a young family, this has become more and more of a challenge. I absolutely love working hard but the pendulum has swung too far to that side and there is no balance.  "
good,"takes a certain type of personality to work there. culture is young, a lot of go-getters. Likely recent grads and those who have time to spare will do well. turnaround is high as it is a high stress environment. management needs to figure out how to retain talent."
good,"More and more is requested of each person, with little to no pay increase.  Management does not coach or encourage development, but are quick to point fingers at their subordinates."
good,It's a great place to start your career but not a great place to end. Don't expect for managers to encourage you to grow in within your profession. Remain positive and you will succeed.
good,"When learning the financial industry, individuals need guidance and monitoring to represent the company in a professional way. Brokers need monitoring to learn presentation skills, asset allocation, and earn the trust of potential clients. Many of these skills you must already possess, because management doesn't have the time to teach, nor the interest to oversee each adviser's activity. It simply numbers of accounts and assets."
good,"It's fine to be fast paced in some situations that call for the quick fix, bounce up and resume working.  But for projects there is need for reflective thinking and careful design. The ""fast-paced"" mantra is IMHO poison to such a project.  I have seen the results of such production pacing - heavily patched code that becomes progressively difficult to debug.  Actually, their mantra is ""A sense of urgency""."
good,"a wide variety of administrative tasks.  Including opening accounts, handling client requests, wire transfer of funds, meeting FINRA compliance standards, daily telephone contact with clients."
good,"management team only cares about the bottom line, some of the compliance measures are only there for show and to protect senior management. I have learned about investments, portfolio constructions and client servicing."
good,Work can be fun and productive during the day.  The culture there is alright but can be better.  Management is good teaching us new things.  Have to solve discrepancies for branches through service portal requests.
good,"For the better part of my career time there, I enjoyed my job. I learned so much and was challenged everyday.  My job entailed being busy and working diligently from the morning to end of day.  I worked endless hours, but had fun doing it because I got to work in a team environment and made great relationships with my colleagues."
good,The CAC is where I work and have worked from day one. The culture /moral is poor. Management is unwilling to listen or support anyone but their own. They will even block anyone from moving to another dept. The pay is reasonable until you want a pay increase. They will say no raises department wide and then give them to management.
good,"I have been in the industry for over 34 years and Morgan Stanley has a lot of management overhaul to do. I do like the company, but they need some adjustments."
good,"Though there are many departments within the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney company, I can only speak towards my experience with Ultra High Net Worth.  The department is very restrictive and almost suffocating at times.  The management style is very heavy handed. Every facet of the day to day functionality is so heavily scrutinized that is saps employees productivity.  There is little to no room for improvement or movement, outside of transferring to a different department or branch."
good,"Working there on a temp basis, was not what they told me I was doing, although I was a team player, when another offer came, I took it."
good,"Average work environment. Good work/life options.I'd rather not say more, but you keep make me typing more. Like I said, Average work environment. Good work/life options, and I don't more to say more."
good,Morgan Stanley provides good learning experience. Depending on management you are able to move ahead and move around. I work there 15 years and gained a great amount of knowledge.
good,"Working Day & Night Shifts, monitoring the Network for any issues."
good,"My experience with Morgan Stanley was good overall. This position requires gut wrenching work in the beggining to build and very little time to produce results. There are many ways to go about building a career as an advisor, Morgan Stanley is good place to do so."
good,"On the phone, call, call, call.  Could only sell product that the company was pushing.  If you sold anything else you had to explain your actions"
good,"Excellent deal flow, steep learning curve. Zero work-life balance, understaffed teams."
good,"Acquired Series 7, Series 66, and Virginia Life, Health, and Annuity License"
good,What a company!  Too many employees doing nothing but resource allocation.  Many unnecessary layers of management.
good,"A typical day is full of meetings. "
good,"A typical day at work: Day consists of: calling clients on relevant market events and developments, creating pitch materials, execute security offerings and working with clients on broad capital markets / M&A strategy"
good,"Solid Broker/Dealer with strong fixed income desk. Learned everything I knew at that point about B/D operations and trade execution. Developed a solid base of the credit markets, particularly Public Finance."
good,"Great place to gain an education in financial services. Within wealth management, there is a strong drive from cross collaboration amongst other areas, and you will gain exposure to the various parts within the organization and how they are run."
good,"A typical day within the Securities Settlement Operations team at Morgan Stanley consists of liaising with external counterparties and brokers, overseeing the offshore vendor in Chennai, India, and working with other internal business units to settle trades. Every day gets very chaotic around the close of the stock market at 3PM. The primary focus is to settle all high sensitive, large value trades without any issues. The most difficult part of the job is managing the offshore vendor. The language barrier made the hands on training very time consuming and frustrating in the early stages of the transition. However, the team is very diligent in getting the work done and always eager to learn."
good,Morgan Stanley provides diversity but overall it is hard to move internally to another department.
good,"Stressful work environment, lots of management and staff changes. Lots of policy changes over the years, resulting in negative work environment.  Worked very closely with other offices."
good,"The work is challenging and exciting.  There are always new things to learn regarding the business and technology."
good,My colleagues are generally smart and hardworking. I learn a lot from them. Leadership can be focused on the next quarter versus on the long term benefits.
good,"It is a good job but looking for more.  The pay is below average. As a registered rep, you will place trades for stock plans and IPOs. You will cover vest dates,  stock discount, registration, available shares, and ect."
good,"I’ve given 12.5 years of service, showed a 30% yr over yr PnL growth, and my bonus  was cut by 28% due to mismanaged groups in other divisions incurring losses. It’s an unfair assessment of talent and contributions."
good,The work/life balance is good. Hours and set schedule are good as well. There needs to be better incentives and career progression. The pay seems to be on the low end compared to other firms
good,"Regular corporate environment with tendency to save as much as possible."
good,"Good company for people who want to work in the finance domain. Not suggested for pure tech people. Uses more in house technology than OSS. So, some times it completely different than what is used in market."
good,"The company is very flexible with your work/life balance.  Often times working from home is allowed and depending on the office you may even be smart casual with your attire.  However, the overall work culture has declined in the post market crisis era.  Layoffs at all levels are a common occurrence.  The sense of team has largely been lost.  Even when the firm reports strong earnings it does not seem to translate into increased salaries and bonuses.  Moral is maintained by the thought that if I work hard I will be rewarded and there no longer seems to be a connection between the two."
good,I enjoy what I do and Morgan Stanley (the firm) might be more professional and high tech in other department but the Mortgage department still does not have a strong and solid leader to take it to the next level in terms of technology and process.  Please higher competent leaders who know about Residential Mortgages and the entire process!! Anyway it's too late for this because they are going to loose all their productive and smart workers (the ones who do actual work!) and no B.S.
good,Team working environment with a lot of opportunity to learn new things. The management team provided adequate training and sharing knowledge for you to grow.
good,"Once in the position of Portfolio Associate, unless you work in the corporate office there is no advancement possible.  Company is good, but the local management was not"
good,I worked as a contract worker with the expectation to hired on full time. After over a year without vacation pay or sick time I was burnt out. The job function was fine but the process of being made full time was dangled like a carrot that most likely you will never get.
good,"As a firm, Morgan Stanley is an amazing company to work for. However, the culture within the different Business Units does vary and some are more engaged and supportive of their staff than others. Would suggest contacting people from within the BU you are seeking to join for their honest feedback."
good,Leadership continuously changing with different visions makes working there a chore at time. Constantly behind on technology for banking. Good pay for phone agents.
good,"It's ok to get experience, not a good long term place because they lay off people every year. The department and management opinions  dictates the success that you will have."
good,"Not for everyone"
good,"You are under constant pressure to perform and deliver. No work and life balance at all. You will be fairly compensated. Place is very political, it's who you know."
good,"Morgan Stanley is an industry leader that is making concerted efforts to establish themselves in the Mid Atlantic area. The firm offers knowledgeable and respectful colleagues, exciting business, competitive compensation, learning supports, mobility program, generous RRSP matching programs and vacation package. Great place to work and to learn about financial products."
good,"- operations had high turnover, low bonuses and could at times be hard work / long hours"
good,Worked long hours/pay did not add up.  Management was good. A lot of politics. Job promotions based on popularity not performance. The review process did not reflect boune given.
good,A great place to learn. Great people and partnerships. Disappointing though that there seems a perennial focus on even very small expenses that could actually do a lot to motivate staff. Focus on professional development is poor relative to other banks. Does seem that transactional leaders are more prevalent and not transformational leaders.
good,I had two different managers at the time I was there. They worked on the floor with you and were very helpful. The phone calls were overwhelming and you had to learn information fast. If you don't mind working in a call center then it's not a bad job and the pay is good. It's is really competitive to move up because a lot of people are trying to get out of the call center.
good,"Morgan Stanley is not for the little people, they are for the higher ups. The salaries for the employees are minimal but the CEO and upper management make out for the better."
good,"Work on your own as long as you meet your deadlines. Typical day is spend 4 hours in the morning with the team in India. Have several additional meetings locally, then do your work assignments"
good,"If you believe you can just do your work and put your head down and advance.  Good luck forwarding your career up the corporate ladder. Its dominated by white people and ethnic diversity is only among the junior analysts.  If you want diversity and feel like your making the world a better place its not at Morgan Stanley.  Go work for Microsoft, Apple, Amazon where they innovate."
good,"I enjoyed my time with MS. I generally worked in a sales capacity and later learned that I did not wish to be a sales rep for the rest of my career. Thus, I chose another path."
good,No desire to fill this out. Each day was different. Management was not consistent and catered to longer tenured individuals with higher sales. The hardest part of the job was the changing of goals.
good,Great people work there but management seems totally unaware of the staff. A bit of fear throughout the office and staff afraid to step away from their desks. Did not seem like a good place for growth but I was not there very long. I could see there was a lot of pressure.
good,"My positions at Morgan Stanley have allowed me to enhance my skill set, particularly in how I approach the ADDIE learning development process and how I work with business units to identify learning objectives."
good,"Good benefits if you get hired on full time, but everyone must start as a temp first. In the columbus call center, there is not a whole lot of room for growth/advancement, so most people don't stay too long."
good,"the firm should focus more on retaining good workers in the middle rank in New York City rather than focus on shifting jobs to lower cost centers in other states and hire entry level people with very limited experiences and knowledge. Also the firm rather only focus on retaining top level executives in New York City. The turnover in other states is really high, because young fresh graduates will quickly move to other firm for advancement, as there is very limited advancing opportunity in the firm to move up to middle rank."
good,"Day at work should be Pleasing to come over to Office - Though there is work pressure."
good,Decent. Come in at 9 and leave at 6. Not too many meetings. Work is exteremly fast paced and you need to be very attentive and alert at all times to ensure no mistakes are made.
good,It was a typical office space. They require you to know everything about the position before you even get the position. And no training given. But the work culture was nice and fast paced.
good,"People are afraid to leave the office after it gets dark.  Multiple employees have had wallets, phones, etc stolen near the office during the day.  The office building is a bit run down, elevators break and get stuck.  Parking is really expensive.  "
good,"My immediate manager people that I interface with daily are enjoyable to work with.  However, it is a financial services firm, each division operates independently, even though it is supposed to be one firm, under one umbrella of business practice and culture.  This is not a good practice.  HR rule also changes from division to division, employee to employee."
good,Great opportunities for learning especially in information technology and financial industry. It became a little challenging with budget cuts for the last few years. The upper management is pressured to adhere to a low balance sheet. Do more with less.
good,"It was a great place to work, but volatile as the brokerage was going through many changes, and merges with other brokerage firms. There were a lot of upper management changes and we eventually all got laid off."
good,"Pros"
good,"You’re mislead and filled with empty promises.  The firm is penny smart/ pound foolish. The better and more experienced an employee is, he/she is spread out horizontally to do more tedious tasks for more people rather that being rewarded with advancement vertically as discussed when hired.  It is also very chauvinistic."
good,"Morgan Stanley is a great firm, but tends to lag in compensation.  I work with smart people and it is very collegial.  But there is also a cement ceiling in terms of opportunity.  There are lots of people at the top that are not going anywhere.  And so when you are at a senior level, it's hard to see the opportunity when you know there is this brick wall that exists."
good,"Long working hours"
good,its is a goof company with good salary and bonus paid annually. Nice people and good perks like cab facility. Work culture if good with flat hierrarchy.
good,MS is a great company to work for but not as stable as one would think. Losses in the Fixed Income Division led to major layoffs which impacted most areas within the company.
good,"Decent starting point  for a career. Learn to balance work and life, but not many stimulating activity and management is sometimes lower tier........."
good,"There are a lot of hard working intelligent people working there, and good cross team exposure.  You can lean a lot, but be prepared to work hard."
good,Morgan Stanley offers opportunity for employment but doesn't necessarily pay to scale. Promotions and bonuses are based on click relations rather than effort
good,"A typical day at work is usually the same on most days, the people are great but the opportunity for promotion is absent for the most part. It is a great place to start your finance career."
good,Working environment is good and nature of work is also good.Co-workers were very supportive. Not much stress. But being a temporary employee there was lot of discrimination.
good,"review daily mismatch report, training offshore team in Guadalajara"
good,"Management is inexperienced and it shows. Not a terrible place to work, but nothing special here, no reason to really invest yourself."
good,"First big job out of college.  Thought is was my dream job, however, found out it is pretty cut throat within the office and very high stress.  Was a good learning experience for me, just wasn't for me as a career."
good,"The most upsetting thing about working for Morgan Stanley is the managers say they want to help you advance your career, but actually do very little to help you do that."
good,"Constant change, with opportunity for advancement.  Corporate culture is intense and has no room for doing what is morally correct."
good,The culture at Morgan Stanley can use some work. The banking portion of the firm is not well regarded and has caused immense negativity across the staff.
good,"Had a great time while at Morgan Stanley, picked up on new techniques and full of great people to learn from. My co-workers were awesome, we connected on a personal level which made day to day activities while at work so much more simple."
good,"Wealth management at Morgan Stanley, particularly for FAAs (trainees) is a difficult existence. Managers essentially leave you to sink or swim. Advisors are happy to help you close business and then keep the clients when you fail out of the program. Very few are successful without a team or having family in the business/family money."
good,"As part of Smith Barney the culture, work environment and management were the best in the industry. When Morgan Stanley bought the company all of that was destroyed."
good,"Working at Morgan Stanley gave me an opportunity to learn Instructional Design. It allowed me to develop my skills with Dreamweaver, Captivate and HTML."
good,"Worked with brokers assisting with day to day operations.  Reset passwords, resolved issues with market data, remotely connected through pcanywhere to address certain issues inhouse and externally at high end user homes.  Worked also to resolve issues with the operating system, market data feeds and all other aspects of the help desk."
good,"Very busy with new challenges every day.  Working in Business Management, gave an opportunity to work on many projects that were not  typical of day to day work.  Working as a business continuity coordinator for 109 people in the Mutual Fund Department broaden my work knowledge with different departments in regards to their business process, and systems applications."
good,Large prestigious firm with a good work/life balance.  Outstanding environment for cross functional involvement.
good,"High paying jobs with no work life balance."
good,Great people going through a challenging environment.  Was difficult to facilitate change in the office I worked.
good,Currently there are many new products which have been introduced in market which to claim to provide analytics on large data sets. Currently actively involved in doing POC with some new vendor products like DB2Blu columnar database/Hadoop to process large datasets and provide analytics using tools like Tableau/ Business Objects R4 etc.
good,all of the staff is reminded daily that we should be happy we have a job. 
good,Work culture is good. You get ownership of the things you work on allowing you take full responsibility of the work  
good,- Motivated People
good,"Based on the fact that I was working in the IT/Space division of the company in a temporary position. I feel that I did learn many things regarding the facilitation of space for new and existing employees. A typical day of work would start by checking my email to see what inquiries or requests I received to facilitate a particular division on the company w/space as well as helping employees with whatever their needs may be not associated with space. I always feel that if I have the knowledge and ability to help any fellow employees make their work day easier I would be obliging to do so. I enjoyed the opportunity to meet the employees/supervisors while fulfilling my daily duties. I honestly couldn't say that there was actually a hard part of the job. The only thing that was a little challenging was making sure to get the monthly inventory report correct, given that I would need to do a weekly walk-through of each floor I helped to maintain and a few times I would run into an issue with the employees who would not be seated in their assigned desks, that would make it difficult to verify occupancy. Other then that it was not such a taxing job."
good,"A typical day within the Securities Settlement Operations team at Morgan Stanley consists of liaising with external counterparties and brokers, overseeing the offshore vendor in Chennai, India, and working with other internal business units to settle trades. Every day gets very chaotic around the close of the stock market at 3PM. The primary focus is to settle all high sensitive, large value trades without any issues. The most difficult part of the job is managing the offshore vendor. The language barrier made the hands on training very time consuming and frustrating in the early stages of the transition. However, the team is very diligent in getting the work done and always eager to learn."
good,A typical day includes working with printers and computers to create presentations for clients. Management and employees were great. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with clients deadlines and broken printers. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the emplyees.
good,Very demanding deadlines. Lots of pressure to produce results.
good, Assist revenue and non-revenue campus recruiting teams with administrative support
good,The work demands a well organized individual. A lot of emphasis is placed on being a self starter. The hardest part of the job is delivering and juggling on multiple projects.
good,The lack of generational diversity and Inclusion leads to a real suffocating environment. I can't speak for all technology departments. Can't adopt an agile mindset and environment when most people don't either believe in it or care to know about it.
good,"Overworked and underpaid, more work is added every year, pay stays the same. Very underpaid for the amount of work, and compared to peers within the same industry."
good,"First and foremost, Morgan Stanley is a great name brand and a good place to start your career in technology. You will learn about how to deploy technologies and ultimately work with various stakeholders, internally and externally."
good,"Excellent culture at this firm. Everyone looks out for each other on the team. However, not a place to be if you are looking for pay. HR department does not promote employee motivation nor employee retention. This is a conservative type of firm that likes to work more with less."
good,"Much like other employers: some good, some not so much."
good,"You need to identify , relate and find the right group to help you contribute and grown. "
good,"The plus side to the company, they allow you to take your series 7 and they fund it. The call center is back to back and has it's busy seasons. Co workers get along very well."
good,"I enjoyed my colleagues and the work that I was doing at Morgan Stanley. I came to Morgan Stanley with little securities background but a strong sales background and a desire to learn more the ins and outs of creating portfolios and mutual fund strategies. I requested multiple times for help from my manager, preferably a mentor but never received it. I feel that the advisor development is weak and is my only complaint working at Morgan Stanley."
good,If there is one thing the firm does well it’s their drive to give back. There are always charitable events sponsored by the firm and they strongly encourage all employees to participate. They also make accommodations to allow employees to take time away from the office to participate in these events during normal work hours. Everyone’s experiences at the firm will differ based on their individual circumstances and I’m sure it’s possible to have a great career at the firm.
good,The company itself is a good company but management makes it hard to take care of self and advance to the next level in your career.  Some Managers make you feel guilty for being away and taking care self unless you are a brown noser.
good,"How to handle the high pressure"
good,If your branch manger is good then your experience will be good at MS. I was a FA so the hardest part was prospecting and gathering clients. Your relationship with your branch manger is key though.
good,"The best part about Morgan Stanley is the people. People are intelligent, friendly and great to work with, however the company does pay less than competitors and they tend to not promote from within."
good,"People at management level are usually technically competent. The pay is relatively good. "
good,"I needed a job at the time, and was able to get one here. I have been a temp coming up to a year in April. It seems like a slow process, so I'm not receiving benefits as a full time employee, but it's currently paying the bills. If I'm not able to get hire on soon, I will have to look elsewhere."
good,"... the choice is up to you really.  I took this job even though I wasn't very excited to work for a bank because it was an opportunity to stay employed in a very bad economy. At present, I'm going on a decade+ and this surprises me as well.  I stayed because I had many opportunities to develop my career that I took advantage of. However work-life balance is terrible,  job security is good for top performers and terrible for low performers, and pay is average for the industry.  was it worth it? based on what I achieved I think so, but with some sacrifices to time spend with family/friends."
good,"Everything is good at Morgan Stanley except the Job security , they may terminate your contract the next day or the same day specifying it as cost cutting."
good,"I loved the experience that I received at Morgan Stanley, but as a temp hey leave you dreaming that you will become permanent. The point of contracting is to land a permanent spot, but they are not thinking about it and would rather take the less expensive route and keep you as a contractor with no benefits or paid time off,"
good,Good place to start in the industry but difficult to meet sales goals.  Compensation is also difficult if you are seeking to make significant income in the first three to five years.
good,"The day starts early at 7:45, working straight thru some days till 5, 5:30 with lunch at your desk. Management does not recognize the talented temps that are hard working and deserve recognition. There are several long time employees who are disgruntled. The hardest thing about working here is trying to learn the job you were hired for. They have a work place committee who try to plan events to boost morale, but it does not work."
good,"A good place to start a career. Once in, it's hard to move up."
good,"Positions sent from NYC to Baltimore paid less in Baltimore and then positions were outsourced to India"
good,The culture of the entire industry has changed dramatically over the past 20 years.  The firm lacks a commitment to both the financial adviser and the client.  The firm is concerned with the firm and the firm only.
good,"I did operations work. Which in the grand scheme of things is not exciting or important. One time a manager said that your presence here is like putting a finger in a glass of water, if you take the finger out, then nothing will change. (AKA the glass of water looks the same). I didn't really feel valued. Mostly because our job was outsourced and the company does not try to relocate us to another department or anything. I mean, they got us in touch with an HR person, but you are expected to apply and find something else."
good,The epitome of “boys clubs” (not just for boys). Upper management enjoys their perch and kicks you down if you get too close. If you are looking for career advancement this is not the place. If you want to take it easy in a good environment at a top bank come one come all but don’t expect to get paid.
good,They put a high emphasis on “telling a story” even when individuals on the team are communicating the work/mission isn’t feasible in the time frams. The technology is outdated in comparison to JP Morgan. The operating systems seem disjointed and manual. The firm is constantly hiring/firing it was challenging to figure out if individuals outside of a management built their careers at the firm.
good,"Made some great friends for life and learned some great skills to carry forward in the next leg of my career. Folks are professional and mature, and very smart."
good,Demanding job which requires you to work throughout the day and even weekends when needed. Work life balance was not important to some divisions. Resources were unlimited for learning and progressing in professional development.
good,Good place to learn a lot of soft / process oriented skills but many of the skills in Capital Markets are not transferable to other more corporate finance-heavy roles. Overall was a good place to start a career but most people only stay for 2-3 years to significant turn-over.
good,Great Company but with the stress of the mergers and re-organizations going on a lot of the good managers left and we were stuck with average managers who only promoted who they liked and who was legacy Morgan Stanley employees.
good,"Morgan Stanley is place where you can gain financial knowledge. Regarding other fields like software engineering, I learnt a lot in the first 3-4 months but later my work has become quite monotonous."
good,Productive and fun work place. Good job culture and supportive management. Competitive salary. Limited growth and advancement. Good job work/life balance.
good,Morgan Stanley is a place with lots of smart people that are willing to walk you through how products work and why they are important. There is lots of difference instruments to be learned and many hours to work on them.
good,Very stressful environment and cut throat. No room for advancement and management wasn't very friendly. Compensation was good and my co workers were good people.
good,Powerful firm in terms of investment banking. Stressfull place to work.Management and mergers created turmoil.Too structured for creativity.Goals were hard to achieve in the management position.
good,"No room for advancement here for me- inter-office politics. I am not sure if it is that way in their HQ, but it is fast paced with little room for error."
good,"It was a nice place to work with excellent new hire training and on going training programs, flexible work schedule for an excellent work/life balance, all the necessary benefits were available, very open and honest management staff and comfortable culture"
good,"Morgan Stanley attracts top talent and the people there tend to be very bright. However, the culture is white- and male-dominated, politics and connections is everything, and voicing an unpopular opinion can be career-damaging. Comp and benefits are good, hours are long, pace is fast, pressure is high."
good,"Oriented to providing quality of service in training.  Coordination among teams to deliver a great quality training program,"
good,Nice Place to Work folk a very friendly and smart and always willing to help. Compensation could better much better. Management seems out of touch.with direct employees.
good,"I enjoyed working at Morgan Stanley during my career. However, the last few years were the most stressful. Overall I had a good time at Morgan Stanley, the work was enjoyable and challenging."
good,"I've been a Financial Advisor there for more than a year. The hurdles are very difficult to reach if you're not part of a team, but you get your licenses and learn a lot"
good,"received good exposure at onsite (Canada) & chance to work closely with the client on DBA activities. Also, was SPOC for setting up test environments in SIT/UAT"
good,"as with all employers, much is decided by your manager. If your manager wants to advance you, then great, if your manager sees you as competition, then advancement will be tricky"
good,"Although the company is flexable with working from home, "
good,"Depending on the team you work with, Morgan Stanley can be a great or miserable place to work.  My experience has been mostly good however, I have been lucky to work with mostly very bright and hard working people who are quick to roll up their sleeves and work together for a common goal."
good,"workplace culture is good, comp outside of front office positions is not strong. ok first position out of school but limited growth."
good,"When the economy tanked in 2008 - Huge lay Offs. Every company has three essential elements, Good IT system, Good Processes, and Helpful Management. The latter was a problem"
good,"I was kept busy, at times supporting 7 Financial Advisors, but I didn't have to work a lot of overtime.   I was only as good as my last mistake, meaning, none of my contributions were recognized verbally or otherwise.  I received no raises, no advancements and no share of the revenue for the Financial Advisors I supported.  I felt like many of the support staff, that I was totally expendable and replaceable.  Some people seemed to thrive in that environment.  If you want the same job forever, at the same pay this might work for you.  If you are ok with being treated like a second class citizen because you happen to be female, than this might be the company for you.  If you value the quality of your work, want to advance into management, and feel like you should be able to afford to retire someday, I would keep looking."
good,"No comments at this time I was laid off 8 years ago.Most of my colleagues were laid off the same day"
good,Compensation is great how ever leadership and management needs to be more diverse. and FAA could use more guidance.. instead of just throwing you out there to fend for your self
good,"Depending on what department you work in, Morgan Stanley can be very high stressed. They have however great mobility opportunities . They are very career focused. At the end of the day, it all boils down to what team you are on. This company is very serious and has very high standards. Each team has a different culture ."
good,"I manage a portfolio for Latin America countries:"
good,"The work/life balance at MorganStanley is good.  Employees can work from home when needed.  Depending on your manager, you can create your own work schedule."
good,"Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm that maintains significant market positions in each of its business segments. The Company provides a wide variety of products and services to a large group of clients including corporations, governments, financial institutions and individuals."
good,There is no room for advancement within the branch unless you would like to move into management or as a Financial Adviser.
good,"Financial Planning and Analysis."
good,"Awesome training and development sessions. Strong work ethic. Very good pay and health benefits, including perks. After the several reorgs, some people became bitter, selfish, and vicious. Volunteer opportunities were the best."
good,Some functions are better then others but the function I am currently in has very repetitive work.  We also have 1 more person then needed as the function only needs 2 people but they have 3 people on the team so their is coverage when a person is out.   The managers don't know how to provide enough work for normal days when there three of us so everyone isn't bored with their function.  My last function was better as I was doing daily reconciliation for house accounts and there was always constant projects to work on to fill the down time.
good,Morgan Stanley was a great place to learn and to indulge. The co-workers were great but the compensation/benefits offered by Morgan Stanley should be much more. Nice company to work for but pay is way to low compare to other financial companies.
good,"If I was just satisfied with moving up I would love this job, but they don't really provide any feedback on ways to move up within the company."
good,Brokerage teams got treated like orphans by the investment banks despite bringing in most of the profits during my tenure.
good,MS really helped me in grooming my professional career and personal growth. I am really thankfull that i was a part of morgan family. It really helped me build up and gain my confidence back in terms of profession and personal.
good,"Extremely demanding schedule, typical day is 12-13 hours"
good,"Providing customers with their fax/copier needs, inventory was extremely busy.  I've learned to ask for help.  Management was very strict and wanted things done a certain way.  The coworkers that I worked with were all down to earth and very family oriented.  The hardest part of my job was doing inventory where I had to go to all the departments and find all the fax/copier machines.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting my work done on a timely manner."
good,The people I met at MS were highly capable but very unfriendly and avoided team work.  Most people were only focused on their own job and not the development of others.
good,•	Provide day to day margin support to Listed Derivatives Client Service Group such as authorization/ releasing of payments in SAFE and Collateral Management Team such as coordination of non-cash substitutions with clients
good,Firm is too large to generalize based on one team. Investment banking teams work standard long hours and lack good culture.
good,"It is a bank, so you get the perks of a bank but not the pay.  The people have become jaded since the last crash, management does not realize they really hurt the morale with the lack of pay for those left after all the cuts"
good,handled client calls and FA's needs.  Overbearing management after merger
good,"Large company good training program for the FA role in the beginning, after production begins very limited support."
good,The company is changing as are many others on the street.  There have been many management changes that has changed the culture.
good,The work environment is fine .Most days the work is the same. The people are good to work with. Management is lacking on a number of levels.
good,"The Baltimore office is currently growing which is great for job security. Many roles, especially front-office, will remain solely in New York so there is not much room for growth unless you want to stay with your current team. The office location is great, right on the water in Fells Point and there are plenty of places to go after work. Co-workers are generally friendly and helpful, but most people have functions that require that they only work with very few, if any, other people besides themselves. There are several levels of management and they often become managers in departments where they have little or no experience, so you are often managed by someone who knows less than you."
good,"Coworkers are nice enough, but it can be hard to be set up for success with limited access to systems."
good,"Morgan Stanley was a quality Employer that afforded me the opportunity to become a quality specialist in the qualified and non-qualified retirement plan marketplace.  The majority of my time was on the road meeting with Financial Advisors, Plan Sponsors and Recordkeeper/DCIO partners.  There was a substantial amount of turnover in my position (either through layoffs or counterparts leaving for other job opportunities) which led to very large territories and the challanges which accompanied that size of regions.  Sales drove compensation."
good,"Administrative Assistant for 4 Financial Advisors, customer service, open new accounts"
good,Morgan Stanley is a great company to work for.  They provide appropriate training for new employees with a combination of a productive management team.
good,It is a good company but unfortunately they do not have the right people in management in certain departments.  It was not a good fit for me.
good,"The culture at MS middle office is pretty laid back. We work long hours but a friendly environment. Management leads the culture, so for different departments the culture may be different. My coworkers are great, there are some very talented people and we all got along very well. "
good,I enjoyed working with my co-workers. The constant change in staff and upper management was the hardest part of the job.
good,I had the opportunity to increase my experience and knowledge in a corporate setting. I was going to school full time and the company was very cooperative and understanding of my work and life balance.
good,Conduct investment manager searches and due dillegence. Help put together client portfolios and compose capital market views. Put together client reviews
good,Very nice work place and very friendly co workers. Management is friendly and you would learn more from them.
good,"After so many years in public relations, my position at MS was refreshing. Working in the LATAM research division was right up my alley with a challenging twist....applying what I love and knew so well to a different industry. The comfort of 'international' communication was very familiar, especially Latin America and Europe, and has always been my 'forte'. The use of the various languages was also familiar, especially Spanish and Portuguese. However, the paranoid tendencies of some of the executives and the insecurity of some of my collegues made the environment uncomfortabe. The office politics was a solemn one with so many 'don'ts' that one could not be sure if wishing someone a 'good-morning' would get you into trouble. The floor I worked in was wall-to-wall people when I started as a freelancer in 2007.Unfortunately, it was only inhabited by a third when I left in 2011."
good,It's a sink or swim culture but has a lot of bright people. There are too many senior people who talk a lot more than executing.
good,Working for people scout is great. Definitely a learning experience. Room for self exploration and skill development. Nice management. could be better.
good,"It's a great place for anybody who is seeking decent pay and a nice working environment. Co-workers are smart, but most people only focus on their own job tasks."
good,"A good working environment that will help you grow your career.  For example, many classes are offered to strengthen your role but also a work life balance too; concentrating on health,  physically an mentally,."
good,I was hired through a third party company and just finished my training but after I finished my shift got a call they I was being let go due to budget cuts yet they just posted a job looking for more people
good,Started work remotely each day to review and approve multiple reports. Traveled to applicable work location for that day. Upon arrival checked in with all staff and manager of that location. Logged into computer to catch up with management team. Worked on escalation items.Reviewed emails and service/operational approvals. Hardest part of the job was that my team was spread across 3 states. The most enjoyable part of this job was engaging with the Financial Advisors and mentoring the Support and Service Professionals.
good,"ok culture, and work-life balance. Must follow the chain for communication up to senior management. cant go directly to senior management, must go through their admin first."
good,"Morgan Stanley will have you working from the moment you walk in to the moment you leave. The work is mentally taxing, but it is better than not being busy.  If you are good at what you do, you will be noticed. The culture is not that great but it's what you make it."
good,"Good company for people who want to work in the finance domain. Not suggested for pure tech people. Uses more in house technology than OSS. So, some times it completely different than what is used in market."
good,"Morgan Stanley is a decent employer.  However, the early dispute resolution position was difficult given that the issues were related to Morgan Stanley’s clients investment accounts."
good,"the company is structured in a way that each division/lob/biz unit, and the teams within each are silo. It feels as though it is structured that each group is structured to  ""fend for themselves"", and make due."
good,"Very diverse and with many international teams to work with."
good,"Worked for a few months as a deployment tech and wasnt worth it. The pay wasnt great, hours were horrible and team was not professional. Filed many complaints."
good,"Challenging job environment but a bit stressful too."
good,Not provided by employee for this job. Do not want to participate in this evaluation because not really relevant to usual positions open at this firm.
good,You are stuck as a temp worker until they see fit so if you fall ill you are not paid and have medical insurance. This makes the pay reasonable but not worth the hassle
good,Work from home options lets you balance your life as well as manage work effectively. The management is employee friendly and emphasis is given to the learning and growth.
good,overall a decent place to work but there is virtually no advancement opportunities. Goal is to make everyone produce and generate more revenue. The industry is outdated and is dying.
good,"Overall assessment: average"
good,"Managers are great with work life balance. However, in Investment management there is a lack of career mobility and incentive to grow. "
good,The workplace culture and management was very clickish.  Too many clicks in the office and if you were not in those clicks you were not the chosen ones.  Often you were picked on for petty stuff.
good,Be prepared to put in some work. This can be a great place or the worst place depending on your work ethic. If you continue to do the activity you'll do well and it will show among your peers.
good,"Pretty standard contract position at a phone helpdesk. The benchmarks are reasonable. The pay is fantastic, but the benefits are trash unless you are brought on as an FTE"
good,You need to be in right inner circle to be able to advance.  Constantly restructuring and laying people off.  Work/balance good depending on your manager.
good,"I worked in Data, a dry subject. I worked in closed off cubicles and could hardly communicate with my coworkers because of their personality type. I would not do it again."
good,"Numbers Game.  Tough to meet revenue Goals."
good,I did not work there long. I was unable to actually formulate an opinion but during my time I was treated somewhat unfairly but understandably so. I have a difficult personality.
good,I can say everyday was something new and different. They need ot provide more training so the new people feel more comfortable on the phones. That would make want to stay longer.
good,"Led the advanced administrative support to the Executive Leadership Team (ELT). Leveraged highly developed communication, organizational, and interpersonal abilities. Coordinated office activities, maintained client files and appointment calendars for the executive leadership, keeping them apprised of meeting times and deadlines, preparing reports and confidential materials."
good,Everyone was very friendly. The staff made you feel at home and the work was very easy. The patients were kind and understanding to your work. Perfect
good,In almost 5 years only a 0.25/hr raise in 3 of them.  They expect your advisor to pay you a supplemental compensation which you need to negotiate and will need to re-negotiate if you need to change teams.
good,"Worked in both local branch and corporate wealth management HQ at Morgan Stanley. Management has high expectations, local branch office was short staffed, I covered five different teams in the Sound Shore Complex. "
good,"They just experienced a reorganization in their NY offices"
good,Good work place. Exposure to new technologies and business opportunities. Opportunity to interact with highly technical individuals and intellectuals.
good,"I have worked in the Fixed Income Division at MS for 30 years ~ I've seen the company undergo many changes ~ witnessed many RIF's ~ support staff is under-valued and at times one assistant can be supporting 50+ professionals ~ no yearly compensation/bonus' given, their reasoning is that the other financial institutions don't compensate their support staff and MS is inline with them."
good,"Independent work environment in a highly established organization, with various cross functional team and specialized teams."
good,"Morgan Stanley is a values driven firm that believes in doing the right thing and putting client's first. However, the structure lends itself to silos where individual managers can their own division without the same ethical compass."
good,"many new stock brokers i saw were shocked to learn they had to be sales people first before being some financial analyst wizard for a few rich people.  "
good,The financial advisor role is very difficult and I wouldn't recommend it unless you have a great network of wealthy people that would trust you with their money. Steep goals are hard to reach and most are fired after a few months. Start in a role to help you learn more before becoming a financial advisor here
good,Enjoyed my time there showed me what i would be doing 20 years later - answering phones making minimum wage and debted to a student loan from a school who didnt do as they said. Like lifetime job placement.
good,"Retirement planning is a very slow and does not incorporate teamwork. From 9-5 I had very little to no communication with coworkers. As per LinkedIn messages, there are plenty of Financial Advising opportunities for ANYONE!"
good,"Morgan Stanley was a good company to work for, the location was ideal, the pay was decent. However, there was weeks of time that I was not trained and essentially just had to figure it out."
good,"I work at a relatively new division within Morgan Stanley that focuses on the mass affluent market, which is at odds with processes and procedures designed and implemented for a traditional face-to-face branch network, and not a centralized phone-based business model. The bench mark is Merrill Edge but there is still a lot of work to be done to reach it that goal. A minimum of two to three years."
good,"Management needs better training. It's the old story, hire the best engineer to be a manager but they have no leadership skills. Morgan Stanley seems to hire the best people for the wrong jobs."
good,Good company with work life balance. The culture focuses on obtaining and keeping good employees. There's plenty of training for those who would like to attend.
good,"The workplace culture is outstanding, the benefits are above fair and great vacation packages. There are plenty of internal systems to assist with your career growth and personal growth. "
good,This company does a great job at sucking your life way.  The more you give the more they take.  They spend a lot of time preaching how great their culture is - but it is truly no better than anyplace else.
good,"This job was good for the resume as I was gaining entry into the world of finance, but the job was not particularly enjoyable.  Was happy to receive another opportunity elsewhere."
good,You will learn a lot and is a good place to work out of college but be careful with upper management as the turnover rate is incredibly high but I recommend specially if you want to get into operations.
good,"A lot of micro-management from the manager I had. "
good,"What you would expect from a large advisory firm, looking for assets and for people who can sell. They focus most of their effort on the large advisors with the biggest books"
good,"Work enviornment good, not many opportunties for advancement unless you get in temporary first.   Regular 8-5 job with little flexibility. That is all I have to say."
good,"The company was better when it was Smirh Barney, Morgan Stanley is better for institutional business not retail ."
good,High demanding and sensitive custome. Always changing and challanging work environment. work place was well structured and organized .Team and management was collabarative
good,"Work depends on team. Team highly varies, some could be fun and others not so much. Also depends on the work you do, some could be interesting and other might be tedious."
good,"The day starts early at 7:45, working straight thru some days till 5, 5:30 with lunch at your desk. Management does not recognize the talented temps that are hard working and deserve recognition. There are several long-time employees who are disgruntled. The hardest thing about working here is trying to learn the job you were hired for. They have a workplace committee who try to plan events to boost morale, but it does not work."
good,"Normal working place, nothing exciting, fun, extremely stressed managers and very hectic schedule, there is an actual schedule, but it is usually not followed. Very hard to take time off."
good,The culture was more about business and profits than about employees. Every few months the threat of lay-offs would loom and people would wonder which department was next.
good,Finance division at Morgan Stanley allows for flexibility to achieve a nice work/life balance although at the expense of compensation levels which are lower than its peers.
good,"Morgan Stanley is a good place to work for the most part.  You have to understand that depending on your position, your work/life balance will suffer if you don't set hard boundaries and stick to them."
good,Worked as financial associate to top producer in office and was responsible for maintaining excellent rapports with high net worth clients in a very demanding position!
good,While at Morgan I was part of a team which included experienced financial advisors.  As part of the team I was able to gain experience and guidance as I began to develop my practice within the team environment
good,Morgan Stanley had a very basic office culture. They did not invest in much  that encouraged employees to do better and work together better. Everybody kept to themselves and i believe that is because Morgan Stanley lacked in areas of creating a good workplace culture.
good,Good mix of exposure to the finance world. Good first job out of undergrad. Will give oppurtunities for overtime. Will outgrow quickly. Empty promises.
good,"MS is a great place to start your career in financial services. I will warn that it is extremely old school (Coat/Tie every day, No WFH, etc.) so be prepared for this. I would highly recommend if you are set on becoming a financial advisor as they offer an amazing program with a ton of support."
good,Morgan Stanley is a good company to work for and they care about their employees.  They believe in providing stellar customer service to their clients.
good,"consultant task driven not required interplay"
good,"Had a fun group of coworkers where we would get together after hours. Unfortunately, I was not extended an offer at the conclusion of my contract so we parted ways."
good,"MS had a great teamwork environment but requires long hours. People are generally very friendly and creates an enjoyable workplace.  However, management tends to favor outsourcing and sometimes very cut throat."
good,"A good place to be with good people to work with.  Good about providing resources with understanding the demands placed on employees.  "
good,"If you want to work at a fun, fast paced, open opinion, valued employee company...go somewhere else. You either fit the mold of this place where money is god or you don't. Not a great place for the younger generation and the old guard is still set in their old dog no new trick place."
good,"I was not suitable for a sales position. constant pressure to bring in new assets. difficult to survive on salary provided during training."
good,"I do not wish to volunteer a review, not today, not tomorrow, the day after or the day after that or the other day or yesterday. "
good,I really enjoyed my job as a whole. I really liked the people I worked with and really had great managers. I really felt that advancement was difficult and that overall compensation was not good for the licenses and experience that I had.
good,As a consultant you are treated relatively fairly. Teams appeared to work well together. Compensation left more to be desired. Have worked with more flexible working arrangements elsewhere as a consultant. WFH not permitted.
good,"The project involved managing an outsourcer to run a conversion factory. The factory was to convert data between an older and newer version of an application critical to the functioning of Morgan Stanley's business units. I was brought on to attempt the rescue of the project that was already in a state of failure. The outsource had so far been unable to successfully migrate any data between the applications. On the technical side this was due to the outsource not hiring knowledgeable people, but more importantly it was on the senior management side not holding the outsourcer accountable to deliver on the contract. The contract itself had enough language to protect the Firm, but the senior management team involved in the negotiation of the contract wouldn't hold the outsourcer accountable."
good,"The commute to office would be too hectic"
good,"It was a very professional environment.   People are all confident and very self-focused."
good,Not the best company culture I could have asked for but did not stay long enough to have a proper say. I was able to receive great training at Bloomberg but aside from that it was very quiet and not a creative environment.
good,"It was a decent place, countless of OT very fast pace. Training wasn’t as detail as needed. Metric was unattainable but the culture was nice and warm."
good,"My supervisor did not follow through on commitments he made to me.  In view of my abundant experience, I was promised that I would be given full discretion to manage accounts on completion of training.  This did not occur."
good,"It's a different culture than Smith Barney.  smith barney was more laid back and a fun place to wore.  Morgan a little stiff and once we got new mgmt...forget it.  Morgan is a good place to work, if you have good mgmt"
good,"Failed to pass licensing exam and they have a one and done policy...meaning if you do not pass the first time you do not have a second chance to get your license.  No license no employment.  Priority is to get licensed, then concern yourself with all of the office politics, management, culture, and personal atmosphere.  The people I know that work there are successful, strong characters, and I would still be there had I past the licensing exam.  Morgan Stanley is a top rated firm in the financial industry to be associated with. Must get licensed to enjoy the benefits of their quality standards."
good,"Hard work. Good people. Everybody helped each other and looked out for and supported each other. Not competitive, cooperative. A bit stratified but that's to be expected in large organizations. Career mobility was about average."
good,Good company to work for.  First job after graduation and it helped to prepare me for my future opportunites in the business.  A great place to start.
good,"When I worked for Morgan Stanley this was my first exposure to the Risk & Governance area, and I learned a lot about the controls structure and introduction into risk management"
good,"you get one chance to take the series 7 and if you do not pass you are gone. Typical work day was show up, sit in an office alone, and ready a book all day."
good,"Hard work and play hard"
good,"This firm will continue to delegate more and more responsibility as you continue to exceed expectations.  It's very exciting in the beginning when they're giving you these glowing reviews.  But when it's time to talk pay raises for all that ""excellent"" performance, they do not compensate in kind."
good,many years working with the same folks creates many lasting friendships; alot of knowledge growth but not alot of career growth; great for straight out of college
good,Answers phones and worked with clients to ensure they are happy with Morgan Stanley and the resources available. Worked with other client reps to ensure calls were handles properly.
good,The supervisor was clueless about the desk and always took th credit for work that was done by others. I people were really nice but you could see that they were worn down from management group meetings.
good,"This job is all about who you know.  Personal connections are the only thing that lead to advancement, not education, training, or experience.  Benefits are good."
good,Working for a company like Morgan Stanley is a pleasure however it is at the end an ordinary company where you need networking skills to grow. My manager found his job because his manager was his college room mate.
good,Great place to work and build a career. The compensation was competitive and the work environment was collaborative. I had a great experience and I would recommend the company to friends .
good,"Very busy place, you get to work on many projects, family friendly, managers are approachable, a very diverse atmosphere and no 2 days were exactly the same"
good,"This is a huge company, with tons of assets and technology.  Too big though.  Also, certain areas had very poor management and failed to work together cohesively"
good,"The pay is fantastic and the benefits are standard."
good,System is pretty stagnant and the work is pretty consistent throughout the Warehouse environment. Management is more controlling than in the past due to industry consolidation
good,growing and fast paced Wealth management division. competitive and challenging environment. strong leadership an partnering opportunities across the firm
good,Management provides 3 months to pass your required exams.  This is nice as you are being paid to study and ramp up for your career as a Financial Advisor.
good,"Good place to work, hours were normal, management didn't really care about the employees. The clients were amazing. Co workers were nice. Stressful dealing with others money."
good,Morgan Stanley sold its lending division and people were laid off. Some were given the chance to go to the new company but many were not.  We had no work for the last 6 months of employment.
good,This office housed way to many financial advisers without enough experienced sales support and management and Compliance.  Stayed less than a year due to wanting to relocate closer to home.
good,"In this position, I learned a lot about IRA accounts.  This information is extremely important because it determines on how to handle your finances in the future."
good,Good company to work for.  huge presence in the financial arena.  offering array of financial services for investors with offices and satellite office world wide.
good,"If you are able to be a self starter then consider MS, as an advisor your ability to be persevere will come in handy."
good,"Great team to work with.  Demanding environment, each FA has goals they must make in order to keep their jobs.  High paced.  Willing to help employees get the certifications that they need to perform their roles within the company"
good,It is a decent place to work for but the nature of the work is pretty routine. You can bring out your ideas and ways for improvement and you get recognition for it.
good,"It is very good work place to work and enhance skills."
good,"The office dynamic changed depending on who you worked for.  As a financial advisor, the company was wonderful but for those assisting them, that's a different story.  Low paying salary because financial advisors are suppose to compensate with monthly bonuses."
good,"Corporations, organizations, and governments around the world rely on Morgan Stanley’s reputation as a global leader in investment banking. Our advisory and capital-raising services are recognized as among the best in the industry"
good,"I have met a lot of good friends and mentors in my tenure at Morgan Stanley. I have developed management skills related to contact centers and operations. "
good,"In the CSA role there is little room for advancement.  The people were generally nice.  I didn't learn anything that I didn't already know.  In fact, some material and/or issues I had to educate my financial advisors about.  "
good,"A good place to work, good work ethic and culture among employees. Although last few years, it has become more management heavy. Too much of management overhead exists currently."
good,"Management in the area I work is not very friendly except for with the inner circle of management. The job is not real difficult, but can be routine and boring."
good,"Meritocracy, where the truly talented can find a way to succeed, even if it requires changing jobs internally. Management is hit-or-miss, but there is a strong culture of internal job mobility. There is routine, stress-free work, but the truest ""career"" jobs will generally be immensely time-consuming, and probably stressful. A lot of fulfillment to be had for those wanting to achieve, but I'd suggest the company primarily for ""live to work"" types who won't burn out after 11 hour days, missing project deadlines, etc."
good,"• Utilized sales presentations and networking to develop and maintain client base"
good,"The company is a very reputable company to work for, salary and benefits are in line with the location and the job. The commute was not easy, 2 hours each way, this made work/life balance very difficult."
good,"I was an intern so my experience is limited as far as full benefits and understanding of the work culture, employee expectations, and benefits. Note that I gave  low ratings because I wasn't sure how to answer given my job was temporary."
good,"This was an internship when I was in college. I didn't get the full experience working there. Family members of mine work there, and they all love it. It would be irresponsible for me to give any sort of review as my time there was so short."
good,Good place to work depending on the group you are working in. Everyone is approachable in the firm. The downside is there is not much life balance as work can become very crazy.
good,"Morgan Stanley is leading Fintech Company, the most enjoyable part of it is the cutting edge technologies, but the Bad management makes it bad workplace."
good,"Very quick-paced makes the day go by fast. Can be stressful at times. I have learned a lot. I also receive many benefits working there such as paid lunches, 401k benefits and time off."
good,"It was a very stressful workplace. My manager and project manager didn't inform me about them leaving the firm in the middle of the project. Some other manager worked with me. "
good,"i worked for one of the most successful greystone teams in the country. we were a well oiled machine. everyone i worked with was great. if you are thinking of working for a consulting group team, research the individual team members and their clients."
good,great place to work. structured training that is result driven. no backoffice stuff here. you will learn about the wealth management business and get a great name on your resume
good,Life here is very monotonous its the same thing each and every day. People are mostly fun to be around but managers are a pain the MD and ED are surperb and You will love them
good,"Some days were busier than others.  The environment was easy going sometimes and when deadlines needed to be met, it was fast paced. I enjoyed working there."
good,"I really think this was a well-paying job that is well-paying and a job. I was able to work this well paying and a very joby kind of job. I appreciate being able to work at this job, and get paid to do this job. Thank you for the opportunity to pay my bills. "
good,"Overall, typical investment banking firm!"
good,"Understanding where they are going you can not argue.  The process is a bit brutal especially if you come from a different corporate culture.    NO exceptions all act and respond the same to have uniformity with regulators.  The central body controls the sales body.  Like the Borg of Star Trek Resistance is futile you will be assimilated.  No more Branch Manager Captain Kirk exploring new clients and letting Star Fleet know after the fact.  Star Fleet now tells the captain when, where, how much and how long.  Silly competitions to get client's to sign up for things they may not need nor want but the firm needs for liquidity and then measuring managers on the success of these efforts.  RAH RAH campaigns"
good,Team member are good. Easily communicated. Good working environment. You won't feel alone. But there is a changing management undertaken in my team. New VP and supervisor micromanaging everything. People leaving the group.
good,"MS doesn't seem to care much about employee anymore. excessive workload with lower pay. Also, it's brutal when it comes to layoff. Layoff is understandable. But the way they do it, it was have been done better"
good,"- Good Work Life Balance (in few LOBs)"
good,"Morgan Stanley is a unique place to work. One's experience depends on their team, manager, and attitude. However, it helps to have a recognizable name on one's resume."
good,A professional environment with good training opportunities. Senior management fail to provide direction on occasions. Work life balance is not great.
good,"Not much advancement opportunity, myself and the majority of employees in my division only received a small raise twice in 7 years. Don't know why I stayed as long as I did."
good,"Morgan Stanley overall is a good place to work, The great part about the job is there are so many different departments. Work balance is cool and the PTO is great."
good,The most difficult part of this position was to work with individuals who had been at the firm for a long time.  They did not embrace any changes and would yell to get what they wanted.  Ultimately management usually gave in....
good,I worked for a private wealth management team in San Francisco. Lots of cold calling and calendar management. Good to have on the resume buy could have had a more productive internship.
good,I enjoy working for Morgan Stanley in my current capacity. I am grateful for the experience I've gained and the people I've met.
good,"Descent place to work, employed for 11+ years there.  Colleagues were good, very old processing systems, technical nightmare."
good,"Good people to work with, stimulating work, good balance of people. Opportunities are beginning to develop leading to the ability to advance"
good,No work life balance and very competitive role. Everyone work very hard and don't take much vacation. The salary will decrease after first year by 10% a quarter until it's 100% commission after 36 months.
good,"solid company to work for benefits are great. promotions are possible, nice working conditions. sometimes too much of a separation between management and staff"
good,"Working here all depends on your manager and your department. It can vastly vary from one team to the next. You can have a manager that's flexible with work/life and others that are very rigid. "
good,"The most challenging part of the role would be the stakeholder management, this is often quite tense given the nature of the business."
good,MS has good points and bad points. In the last couple of years they haven't really compensated their employees well. A good point is MS is all about community involvement and volunteering. They dedicated 2 months to giving back and encourages every employee to participate.
good,"The firm is acutely focused on keeping headcount low and budgets thin. The firm provides some nice benefits that come with a big company, but is not competitive with non-bank financial institutions."
good,"It's what you can make of it. If you build a large enough book, have nice clients, and team where everyone gets along, you're golden. If you have a hard time bringing in assets, have difficulty with investment performance, and/or have issues with your partners, it can be soul sucking."
good,I learned a lot from my management team and i fully respect their opinion.  My peers are great. We work well together and understands what is need to get the work out in a timely manner.
good,"The hours are generally between 8am to 6pm . Occasionally finishing later , close to 7pm. Management is good and listens to what you say and seems to value your opinion. Also you are given the opportunity to make an impact on your role, finding improvements to process etc or adding controls. Co-workers are good and are always there to answer questions despite how busy they may be."
good,Advisors have the potential to make strong income if they bring in $500k to $1.0 million in net new assets monthly.  You must have a strong network of high income or high net worth individuals and the ability to build trust with them.
good,"MS once cared for the people, that is no longer the case. It is now a place to get experience and leave. It is no longer a place for a long term career."
good,Taking phone calls for brokerage accounts. Resolving missing documents for accounts. Co-workers were fine and nice. Management was fine and nice.
good,"I began in 1999 when Morgan Stanley was Dean Witter. Please review that review."
good,The training (8 weeks) and the money that they invest in new employee's only to terminate after tax season is a waste of my time and their money.
good,Company overall believes everyone is expendable.  High attrition rate due to this idea.  However a great place to start career fresh out of college to build a name for yourself in the finance industry.
good,"Very fast paced work environment.    The hardest part of the job is staying on top of all the details required to perform the job, while at the same time being subjected to extreme time constraints"
good,Good company to learn new technologies and technical competencies. Enhanced skills on understanding banking domain and wealth management in particular.
good,"Some really great leaders, others micro manage and put unnecessary pressure on team. Big organization with lots to learn."
good,Its good to work there. I'm able to pick skills fast and it is fast paced environment.Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
good,A great place to work and gain exposure to many insightful areas of  finance. Employees have a great influence of how to drive change but changing roles is a challenge.
good,"Morgan Stanley is a fine place to work, very difficult to make it without teaming up with an already established team. There is a lot of turnover, the training program could do a better job setting up their trainees for success."
good,"processing transaction , work as a team to clear as much as we can as team, and communicate with other teams to get the work done"
good,"I have no opinion as to this job, it is a good place to work. Hours and benefits are good. I've learned a lot through licensing, however it is basically learn as you go"
good,"Fast changing environment with continues changes that impacts the motivation and morale in teams, Management more keen on cost cutting rather than keeping experienced hardworking people on board."
good,"Pros"
good,"Large company, many benefits to a diverse work population.  Local branch in NH have good people that are flexible and willing to listen and improve on any issues."
good,"Knowledgeable co-workers and good benefits."
good,"It was an excellent exp working for MS. Good workplace, complete motivation and support, perfect work culture. I worked for this organisation as a management trainee but was never treated like a trainee. I was always considered a part of the team."
good,"Not too fond of the hire on process. More training needed on taxes. Financial Advisors were not too friendly. More job opportunity needed in Columbus, Ohio."
good,Great opportunity for recent college graduate looking for experience in the financial services industry. International contact with a wide variety of companies and their employees.
good,Good management training to enhance ability as a manager to develop team whilst streamlining processes to drive down risk metrics.
good,The company was okay.  Due to the jump in mortgage applications the employees were overworked which resulted in them being overly stressed.
good,"Nice company, trying hard to push to be the best. Quality people and management. There is a good opportunity for advancement."
good,"Reported to the COO & Business Unit Manager within the Global Wealth Management division. As an Executive Assistant the responsibilities were diverse and event driven. The environment was collaborative, team oriented and frenetic."
good,"Fun place to work with a supportive staff. Very supportive of your overall career and growth as an employee."
good,The company is great and and can lead to may opportunities.  There are not a lot of options unless you live in a bigger city or metropolitan area.
good,"I’m an operational specialist with over 10 years of experience at both Commercial & High-Net-Worth Lending units.  My Strength as an employee includes constant communication with my team and manager on time sensitive projects.  I am thorough in a professional manner when I am presented with an issue, getting the facts and escalating when necessary to have the issue resolved.  In addition, my experience allows me to work on multiple desks and my knowledge makes me a strong team player, especially"
good,It's a great work environment. I learn something new everyday. The building is beautiful and the entire staff is very welcoming.
good,Dedication to the position is key. There are many incenitves  offered to enhance your compensation package. Management is supportive and  incourages you to reach the next level in your career.
good,Investment Instution with excellent benefits and an amazing midtown office location.  Great company to excel in financial industry
good,"big name company to have on your resume. however, it depends on what group you are working on, hard to say good or bad. support staff compensation is not good"
good,Overall the work culture is good in TCS. The infrastructure is also good here in Pune. Its a good experience of work in TCS
good,"I was able to cut my teeth in the Prime Brokerage space @ Morgan Stanley, absorbing a wealth of knowledge from some temaneted peers and managers."
good,"working at this company was a good experience that I will bring with me everywhere I go. a typical day at this job was a smooth and full of energy kind of work flow management did there port through out the day to ensure that the work flow went as expected, the coworkers at this job works as a unit to ensure that the job got done on time.the hardest part of the day was making sure nothing got left behind and if did got taken cure of immediately to ensure positive reaction for the days to come"
good,"After the merger of Dean Witter and Morgan Stanley, the Dean Witter Employees were treated as second tier employees. We had separate HR and separate pay scales. In the the past we were the lowest paid, but had job security from your 20's to retirement. After the merger we were not only the lowest paid, but treated as trash. Even with employee outings the MS employees acted as if we were freeloading on the air they were breathing."
good,"Great place to work, overall the benefits are great and they allow you to create and run your own business under their umbrella."
good,Great culture to work in. Leadership is helpful but limited to what they can do. Great coworkers. Great work from home culture but too much work if you are in the management.
good,Good company but the industry is in constant flux because of 2008. It is difficult to stay on the right side of the company and the law. It is not like I've heard it use to be just 10 years ago.
good,offered excellent opportunities to learn. The managers were very supported for your professional developments and advancements. Workloads were intense but interesting.
good,"The people and culture make the firm."
good,"I believe that Morgan Stanley would be a fantastic destination for an active advisor to move a large book of clients. That being said, there is very little opportunity to succeed at Morgan Stanley for those who are building a business from scratch."
good,"I work in one of the most fast paced environments, I happy to have learned all the tools needed for success. I like my coworkers and I enjoy the challenge, each day brings on a new challenge."
good,There's a good sense of comraderie in this firm. There are much skills to learn from as well as be challenged with on a daily basis. Senior management is approachable and willing to provide guidance for career grow.
good,"worked overtime a lot when my group moved from another company"
good,"As part of PMO, I participated in many projects and day to day service delivery. Projects included , training the trainer for the account along with upgrades, and roll outs. I got lots of experience in Vendor Management and Client relations . The PMO provided support for U.S. , including Alaska , Hawaii and Puerto Rico"
good,"Analyst program could be vastly improved. Management should be more aware about analysts being overworked. In addition, management could take steps to improve mentorship opportunities with analysts."
good,I don't really have much to say about Morgan Stanley. Worked there twice.
good,"High pace, shifting priorities.  Heavy workload. Started 2009 as consultant, transitioned to full time in 2012"
good,"Revolving door of FAAs made it hard to get traction."
good,I enjoy providing excellent services to the clients who depend on accurate and efficient quality work.
good,"Mostly sent out invitations, sat in conference call and learned ins and outs of the business."
good,The gym is great! Hardest part is the commute. Great employee networks.
good,Work with clients on the phone.  Management is only interested in their own advancement.  Some good co-workers.  Dealing with the back office.  Dealing with good clients.

good,"Nice place to work, Nice people. "
good,Compensation was good.  I enjoyed the people I worked with.  The industry changed with regulations.

good,"Great Experience. Learned a lot. Basel III."
good,"Responsibilities required extensive interpersonal and organizational skills while working with a number of client relationship managers in a fast-paced, client-service oriented professional environment in a highly competitive financial services organization."
good,The days were productive and; I enjoyed working with my counterparts.  The teams I worked with were cohesive and professional.
good,"Large company with very good benefits. Year to Year compensation increases not so good."
good,"it was a good job"
good,The projects that interns are assigned are very applicable to what you would be doing as a full time employee. The skills and knowledge I acquired in school were refined at Morgan Stanley. I became very well versed in analyzing data and conducting market research.
good,"Good place to learn and develop skills.  Co workers were nice and very helpful. Unfortunately, the company has poor job-security. I survived two layoffs."
good,Pay was decent but the culture of the company was horrible.  I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone.  We were initially told they were closing the office & laying everyone off but they didn't.
good,Traders were extremely helpful whenever you offered to help. Trading Floor was small but Useful
good,Enjoyed my time at Morgan Stanley. Great beneits and salary.
good,"Financial Adviser Associate Training program."
good,"Enjoyed my time, easy colleagues to work with and encouraged mobility."
good,Was told I would be training in their FA training program.  In reality I was cold calling for a Senior Broker.
good,"expect it to be a numbers game.... 80% in the FAA program are on the street looking for a new job after the first year to 1 1/2. Quality platforms, but the mgmt treats newbies like cattle. They use the same formula that all wire houses have used for 70 years .... bring in new people with understanding that most fail--the one that fail, they still win because they keep the assets you worked hard to bring in -- it's a pure numbers game for them."
good,"Prepare, evaluate and initiate commercial claims arising from charter parties and sales and purchase contracts for tanker vessels."
good,"Pros – "
good,"Fast paced working environment."
good,"Dealing with management was not the most challenging part of the day @ Morgan Stanley. As Soon as you enter the office be prepared to move fast, prioritize, and be a valued team player. "
good,"Productive place to work, learn, and grow.  The atmosphere is professional, but also flexible."
good,"•	Over 9 years of business analysis experience including software development, infrastructure, business process reengineering, conversion, and audit & compliance projects."
good,Morgan Stanley is a temporary employment. I am looking for a job where I can get an opportunity to advance and be able to use my professional skills.
good,I received my initial training in Securities and Securities affiliated products.
good,"•	PBX Trunk checks generate Daily Alarm Report to identify trunk failures & service affecting alarms"
good,Very young atmosphere. A lot of things to learn. a very strict compliance in place. Colleagues are very learned and very hard working. Very competitive atmosphere.
good,I worked in the mail room for over a year. It was a very diverse environment. Everyone was helpful and the managers were great as well.
good,"Benefits were great. "
good,Typical 9-5 for back office operations for a financial firm.
good,"I have been working in investment banking operations since August 2010; along with it I am pursuing CFA certification."
good,"I learned lots while diversifying work force and introducing flexible hours before it became company policy. Could not impact the misguided desire to combine with another firm or industry move to deregulation, so I left the industry as a full time employee after that."
good,Overall a very stressful job.  Learned so much about the wealth management side of the business. Definitely a great experience and helped to boost my career.
good,Morgan Stanley helped me develop as an individual by constantly challenging me in different roles within the company.
good,"I worked there for two days as an independent contractor, it seemed like a great place to work."
good,I typically get to work around 7:15am each day and leave around 4:30.  I have learned a lot through the years from this firm about client service and the client experience.  I also got to complete Performance Measurement Training classes and learn how to use both proprietary and non proprietary software programs.  I get along with all my co-workers who are great about helping each other with questions when we have it.
good,"As an intern for a team of two very successful Advisers I learned a great deal about wealth management, business communication and writing, and meeting deadlines appropriately.  However, the culture did not fit my upbeat personality.  It was old and lacked a lot of enjoyment from other employees.  The hardest part of the job was making sure I did not break any regulations without being have any certifications.  The most enjoyable part was hearing the wisdom from the team I worked under."
good,"Daily and Timely delivering the PnLs."
good,Faced paced working environment that is both rewarding and challenging.
good,busy enironment working with few employees.  Working in a business part of the city i was able to interact with many people.  Co workers were great but the hardest thing about the job waqs the long shift sometimes working 12 hour shifts can take a toll on your body.  the most enjopyable part of the job was dealing with different people which was great for a people person like myself
good,"Big money potential, BUT more fail than succeed. Close to 90% failure in this business with little training provided. You have to love cold calling people and talking about their money. "
good,Typical office management and production work for a major player in the financial industry.
good,Very professional ambiance.
good,Hour works are pretty flexible. Management is understanding when personal situations arise. Co-Workers are driven and ambitious - best part of the job.
good,Typical day at work includes advising FAs on municipal strategy within their portfolios and interacting with the trading desk to provide value to our customers.
good,"The local management didn't always adhere to corporate policies unless it fit their own goals and needs; thus, it made it hard sometimes at the local level to maintain a standard that was acceptable. Company on a whole was pleasant to work for, however, changes in the structure of the nature of corporate investment banking world has made financial institutions a difficult place to work."
good,Good place to work with a great pool of talented professionals
good,The branch in which I worked was extremely focused on new Sales vs. servicing existing clients. I decided to leave and move to a firm with the opposite focus. It turned out to be the right choice.
good,At this job I was an intern for the summer period. I enjoyed the different type of work that I had no experienced. My co-workers were extremely pleasant. There was no difficult part about this job. The most enjoyable part about this job is I learned a little about money management.
good,Morgan Stanley offers a environment for career growth if you encounter the right networking team. Not a bad place to work in a controlled environment ( call center). Overtime is offered abundantly. I learned as in every environment that politics (not your skill level) can determine your fate at the company.
good,"I worked there as a consultant, so I was never officially a Morgan Stanley employee."
good,It was a good company to work for people and management was like a family.
good,Morgan Stanley is a great company with which to start your career.
good,"low ceiling for growth with the company, great co-workers and talent with the company but not recognized at the manager level"
good,This was a good place to work. The biggest draw back was the cold calling.
good,I like my job and the people I work with but without any extra licensing there is not a lot of room to grow at my current job.
good,Analyst
good,This firm has a good industry reputation. Morgan Stanley is known for being a leading institution within financial services.
good,Seemed like a fast paced place. People were friendly on the operations side.
good,Everyday was a learning experience. Management was always available and helpful.
good,I enjoyed working with the staff at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter as well as my operations manager.
good,"It was a good job coming right out of college. However, although I was able to advance to different parts of the company, none of the advancement came with a raise."
good,good place to work if you like the huge global firm with a lot of rules. Nice workers.
good,Good introduction to the financial services businesys. I worked about 60 hours a week and made a very low salary. It was a good learning experience.
good,Good company to work for with good package and good environment
good,MS gives you the tools to start your own book of business. The managers are supportive and helpful in the grooming process.
good,"Excellent place to work and have a professional career."
good,Too much competition and accountability that no one actually did anything.  Meetings were excessive and unnecessary.  Technologies outdated and low productivity.
good,"On the surface, good company overall, but too many ""clicks"" and ""loose processes"" with ""cut-throat"" greedy manages, who have their own agenda looking out for their own best self-interest, bringing their own friends and family and workers, who do not always care. "
good,"Depending on the department, you will find it difficult to move up in the organization. Its works best when you know people, but i guess that's everywhere"
good,"Pleasant atmosphere, nice and dedicated team. Job load was pretty fair with deadlines to meet usually at the end of each month. Salary is competitive, overtime"
good,"Nothing really stroke me as out of the ordinary. I worked there as a fresh intern making daily phone calls to customers. While the calls were self-paced, we were instructed to hit a certain target by a certain time."
good,"Upward mobility is not great at Morgan Stanley. As an internship you will learn a lot, however as a long term career I did not see that the company would promote as much as they should."
good,Many positions were too open and not enought training or mentoring.  Also very negative competitive environment between departments with similar functions
good,"3/5"
good,"Numbers game. Needle in haystack system. They will tell you they have amazing training, which is false. They give you a study manual and prep tests and expect you to memorize all of it within 15 days before the first test and hardly check in with you. Scheduled meetings with the ""mentoring coach"" are supposed to happen weekly but the manager AKA your coach has no idea about the training process and literally says ""I give you enough rope to hang yourself with."" Once you pass all your tests you are expected to bring in $3-5mil AUM and $150k in revenue or your gone by month 13. So unless you have someone ready to give you over $2mil you will be looking for another job within 14 months while your salary decreases quarterly. Like I said, all numbers to them."
good,lots of management changes and strategy shifts. resulting in a mediocre culture and constant turnover of staff with layoffs eroding morale even further
good,I don't think much else could be expected of a company situated in New York city. Its work force are a bunch of go getters who are extremely focused on getting things accomplished it least time possible. This gives the company an edge in delivering the artifacts in a timely manner.
good,This is an enjoyable place to work.  The other employees are helpful and enjoyable to work with.  The work is demanding and deadlines are tight.  Be prepared for a fast-paced environment.
good,"Young hard working people"
good,"Long hours at work, and lunch time at the desk. Good salary for basically no work/life balance. The hardest part of the job was leaving it at work, and not bringing home."
good,"The fringe benefits at Morgan Stanley are great.  Maternity leave is approx 4 months.  They have a program for back up child care and depending on where you live they have discounts for local attractions.  They sincerely try to communicate bottom down but sometimes the messaging gets lost.  The company is huge.  If you come to work, you will do just fine."
good,"I enjoyed working at Morgan Stanley, for the most part. The people that I worked with were awesome and they welcomed me even though I was the youngest person in the office. The only issue is that the upper management is terrible, they do not give anyone the benefit of the doubt. Also, they do not promote internally they look for candidates outside of the firm, which does not show loyalty to me. I applied for a position higher than the one I possessed but did not have any of the licensees and was told that I would need those before being promoted. They ended up hiring someone who did not have any licenses or prior experience in a brokerage office."
good,MS is very similar to the many other top lenders as far as the job and management go. The clients and coworkers make the position and job slightly different.
good,In my time there I had some of the best managers of my career. That's not always the case. Hours were good and had a good work/life balance. The pay was underwhelming and the benefits were meh. If they paid more I probably would have stayed.
good,overall the firm is a good company to work  - I would prefer to only add this information - the most enjoyable is helping others at the firm - it is multi cultural and professional  - the clients always comes first
good,The name on your resume will open doors.  But the pay is mediocre.  The work is challenging and rewarding but sometimes the firm tries to squeeze 3 or 4 jobs out of the responsibilities of 1 person instead of hiring more staff to meet these demands.
good,"The interview process is very regimented and designed to filter out most applicants at each stage.   There are about 5 stages and each one is the end if you don't pass.   Even once you are hired, the survival rate is dismal.   In my training class there were 204 new hires from around the country.   By the 5 year anniversary, there were only 6 of us left.   The first two years none of the other brokers acknowledge you.   They know that your odds of being axed are very high.   Despite what they tell you, your initial job function is to bring in new money and then leave it there for the others to split up when you are fired."
good,Very high sales goals with little warm leads to help achieve goals.  Long hours and very cut throat sales environment.  Online training wasn't very helpful.
good,Great Work life Balance. Management very much professional. Work profile very specific to a particular area hence leaves less scope for understanding the overall frame of things in which we are contributing.
good,"It is a very fast paced environment. You will stay busy from the moment you walk in the office until the time you leave. There is no overtime pay, but typically you end up working overtime."
good,"Morgan Stanley hires a lot of talented people. Every technologist could suggest a solution to any problem presented. My time at Morgan Stanley helped me improve a lot as a technologist. "
good,Strong organization with great people to work with. The IT department is forever growing and management respects and receives input for IT. The employees are focused and responsible.
good,"Productive work, involving 8+ hours of work on weekdays.Need to interact with lot of teams to get right kind of exposure and getting work done.Great environment and location.Easy commute."
good,"a typical day at work will be answering the telephones, processing and delivering packages to the clients. I learned how to process daily reports. the work place is mainly quiet. The hardest part of my job is when the packages don't add up to the copies that are being made. The most enjoyable part of my job is holiday time. we get to leave early"
good,"Interesting culture.  "
good,Bad technology and too many autonomous chiefs that aren't required to work together. Many micromanager managers and no on site gym or cafeteria or other perks.
good,"Salary and bonuses are good . If you are okay working as a developer ,tester, support, BA then you will excel ."
good,"Worked for Morgan Stanley for 16 years.  Great job, great employees, pay was very good and so were the benefits.  After working there that long, I just felt like it was time to do something different.  I really love working with people and my customer service skills are excellent.  I just want to work for a company that appreciates their employees for their hard work."
good,"This job had a steep learning curve when you first started, having to learn all of the different systems Morgan Stanley used, but got repetitive once you learned all of them. After months of doing the same job with little to no role development you would be doing mindless work."
good,Hit the ground running. Start working and hope there aren't too many problems. When there are a lot of issues time passes amazingly quickly. Quiet times enable you to catch up on paperwork.
good,"The best thing about working at Morgan Stanley was working with like minded people, with strong confident work ethics.  The worst was the inability to truly know if you are being treated fairly interms or Total package this can build resentment, they need to have brackets where employees can measure themselves."
good,"Morgan Stanley is very similar to most other wirehouses where they still believe in mahogany furniture.  They offer little assistance to those who are starting, but when you get going they treat you well.  The support for you and clients can be hit or miss, while MS is not a horrible place to work, it does not stand out either."
good,The group that I work for is most populated by career Morgan Stanley  employees that have grown disgruntled with repeated years of low or non-existent raises. To combat decreasing morale leadership has decided to focus on creating a better work life balance via work from home days. The trade off for a young professional is worth while though my peers have stressed that the luster of this short term fix will wear off after a while .
good,"Great work life balance depending upon the team you are on."
good,"Culture and Management is good "
good,"It was nice place to work, the work culture was good, but the timings was not flexible to work. There were no rotational week offs. Friends were cool and very supportive."
good,Decent starting place for entry level but not geared towards seasoned professionals - for seasons pros you need to be in New York or London only. The culture of Baltimore office feels more like launch pad for offshoring work.
good,Tough place but great team to work in.  Hours are long and days are tough. Compensation tends to be good but expect staying long hours.  Not much chance for flexibility from management.
good,great place to start my career... learned alot from the advisors i worked with. work life balance and pay were very fair culture was nice and competitive
good,"-Fantastic opportunity to learn from FA's and analysts."
good,"Firm has great perks and a good culture.  However, lots of red tape and politics like any large company hamper growth.  Would recommend as a starting point."
good,Very professional work atmosphere. Excellence is expected. Communication skills are a must. Helps promote growth within the company.
good,My time with the company was good to work for over the time I have been there. It did have it's ups and downs. There have been a number of very good co-workers that have come go it were good to work with. Of course they will be missed. I have learned a lot and had a very god re-pore with our branches and also with the contra firms. I turned into one that was reliable. Like a go to person.
good,Working with different sectors within Morgan Stanley. Gaining lots of experience and exposure in performing day to day tasks. Good growth and development.
good,"I really felt that this Hospital had a lot of potential, but there were a lot of glitches in communication, and continuity of care. The staff was not very welcoming or supportive. It felt as though the older staff were out to get their young, instead of empowering and encouraging grow in new hires. I was really disappointed."
good,se stava bene solo che lavoravo parttime cosi guadagnavo poco ero costretto a cercare un altro lavoro
good,"Received inbound calls, provided stocks market priced daily, assist clients processing accounts online, trouble shooting if the online issue persistent to IT department, reset password. Processing debit cards and checks transactions, escalated to upper level if card need to increased balance and mailed card overnight in US or out of country, processing fraud transactions on cards and checks.  Provided cost of securities and dated of purchased when 1099 tax issue."
good,"Overall enjoyable place to work, and was a good place to enter into the financial world.  The benefits were surprisingly great, I did not expect to be able to start with 4 weeks vacation."
good,"Positives:"
good,Productive java web application developer in health care domain
good,"Daily Responsibilities:"
good,A great team and a good solid staff. You will learn more about the firm and general corporate culture.
good,"Work place is very comfortable."
good,"The corporate environment has changed dramatically in my tenure at Morgan Stanley. This was the first company I worked for which performed an annual routine exercise of reviewing staffing needs, and then laid-off people in alignment with projected needs. The company also began a practice of moving much of the IT functions outside of the continental United States, and even went as far as opening up Technology Support, as well as Operations office outside of the United states, namely India, as a ruse to be competitive, which were called costs savings.  There is not much job security domestically, and I among many others are a testimony to this. Additionally the Technology area is so compartmentalized which has made it difficult to find the right area to assist in determining who is responsible for different application components within the firm. In a positive effort to make things easier, and standardized, they created web form applications for most everything related to technology change, but when problems, or question arise for all these virtual forms, there is rarely a contact number, or email group included to get questions answered or to get things accomplished.  I always joked that the company had become ""Too Big to Succeed"".  This has only been magnified more and more by creating different review processes, and review committees for everything, which has add an unnecessary 20% of ""red tape"" overhead to every IT project,"
good,Great sales learning environment.  Long hours and lots of cold calling.
good,"A typical day at work with balancing accounts with strict attention to detail with ensured accuracy and timely processing of accounting data with the transactions posted using the proper data system."
good,"A typical day at work was high volume of telephone and email.   I learned alot about estate planning and using life insurance and long term care insurance to accomplish many varied goals."
good,"My typical day consists of reviewing FA actions, completing financial plans, scheduling quarterly and annual reviews, scheduling appointments for new business."
good,"I worked there a while, pressure is tremendous to meet goals but meet them and they pay you well."
good,the finance division is a difficult place to be in at MS. pay and moral are quite low.
good,"Very competitive internal work environment. Leading edge projects, and product offering make every day different and a challenge."
good,This company had excellent benefits & an excellent bonus plan. The management was not approachable & very unpleasant to work with. The morale of the company was also very low & unless you were in management they didn't care about you.
good,Most of my day would be talking to clients and trying to keep them happy. I would have to call Mutual Fund and Annuity companies. I did mail merge letters and any type of correspondence needed. I would make sure that all copies being mailed out were in compliance approval.
good,Morgan Stanley is a very well known Investment Bank with many functional areas of expertise. Often top-rated in M&A and Retail Brokerage. Management has become very conservative since the departure of John Mack in pursuing a less risky revenue stream. Systems are top notch and usually propietary.
good,I feel my view isn't as positive for this company because I have no interest working in finance. I think my boss was a bit Jekyll and Hyde. One moment he's relaxed the next he's acting totally uptight. This made me feel uncomfortable because it was difficult to read what kind of mood he was in. I was originally hired to organize client events although this never happened due to budget cuts so I just ended up helping the administrative assistant with whatever tasks she had leftover.
good,"Morgan Stanley represents a typical large corporate structure. Advancement is based on structure rather than merit, making advancement a slow grind for those willing to stay,"
good,"Long hours, learned a lot about the financial industry. Depending on the dept you work for, it is not accurate for me to comment on management because it is such a large company."
good,"Good people, available opportunities for growth, but not promotions. Lower paying firm compared to other organizations within the financial services industry."
good,"Depending on which business area of the firm you are working in, your experiences can vary. "
good,"I learned different systems within the company, with help from management members. The worst part of the job were angry clients. They most enjoyable part was when you're able to solve a customer's issue."
good,"This is a great place to work, and benefits were great.  My particular manager, however, micromanaged to the point of making it unbearable.  Other departments were much more lucky."
good,"Typical day at work - responding to emails, approving expenses, reviewing exceptions to policies"
good,"Busy days and if slow I would ask for work. "
good,I was lucky to have a very supportive manager that helped navigate my career path.  The firm offered many opportunities to grow as an individual and to build a collaborative environment.  Work life balance can be challenging.
good,"I loved the job I had at Morgan Stanley, Sr. Client Service Associate; despite I wasn't registered with the SEC (which I feel that MS frowns on now). Several experienced workers such as myself were terminated as a result."
good,"Although the business direction of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management seems to be going well,  the constant changes in I/T's senior and middle management does not provide an environment where one can thrive."
good,Morgan Stanley was a productive and fun workplace with opportunities to grow  . Designing and building new Multi-partition parallel ( MPP ) systems handling terabytes of data to support reporting and analytics requirements for the global operations and  Technology teams within Morgan Stanley had lots of challenges and learning .
good,"The culture of the organization is sensitive to the needs of all; however, free thought and expression is frowned upon as one might be offending another. The issues are too complex to discuss here."
good,"hard to get new clients"
good,"At MS you do work with smart people, who will challenge you. Career advancement is there, but you have to fight for it. For that to occur you have to let yourself be known, and make sure your work is above par."
good,Each day lasted 10 to 12  hours.  I learned that company take over can cause low moral and hasty upper management reductions. The hardest part of the job was trying to use time-management  with resolving issues.    I did enjoy the people I meet and worked with.  I wish the transformation was more organized.
good,"Morgan Stanley is a great company to work for if you love finance and are willing to work hard at obtaining clients.  They greatly value financial advisors but have quite a long way to go in appreciating the back office staff that make what the financial advisors do possible.  There are limited opportunites for growth unless you are an advisor or on track to becoming an advisor and the business itself is unforgiving to anyone who is unable to bring in clients and maintain a certain amount in client assets. That being said, management is fair and accomodating they have great benefits and an excellent 401k program."
good,Worked under a great boss who helped us get the resources we needed to improve the system for which we got recognition.  Coworkers are very friendly and helpful.
good,"Jobs have come from New York and New Jersey and the city of Baltimore, Maryland was promised tax breaks for bringing jobs to Maryland.  However the turnover rate for lay offs and separation is very high with Jobs going offshore for cheaper labor and cut costs.  There are plenty of acquisitions and joint ventures in this company so you can expect anything to happen while working, whether you are a new employee or with Tenure."
good,"Great place to start your career, you learn a lot and meet very smart and driven people. It forces you to be on top of your game. Expectations is REALLY HIGH. Do not expect it to be a walk in the park."
good,Lot of good folks still exist here but lately the culture has changed to one of talkers than doers. However i still contend this is one of the good companies to work for
good,"Good company , work life balance , extra curricular activities, good working environment  , good package for lateral candidates and various incentives."
good,"Morgan Stanley is a great place to work; you'll work with intelligent motivated and ambitious people.  However, if you are not in the front office,  then your compensation is lacking. You will develop skills and will have a variety of experiences; ultimately you will become valuable to other companies in your career."
good,"Company has much diversity and a lot of job opportunities, they get involved in a lot of community  activities.  Company had many areas of job growth."
good,"We faced tough time during 2015 december floods in chennai."
good,"Fast paced, high stress, but great mobility opportunities, training, and overall learning experience. Great personal challenge and motivation. Career advancement is there and available, however, if you are more interested in title and power promotion and not overall salary promotion, this is the place for you."
good,"Morgan Stanley is a very great place to start out of college. You delve into the financial industry and gain exposure with different lines of business, asset classes, and people. The learning curve in the beginning is steep while you learn about the process, product, and systems but quickly adapt by the 6 month mark. There are plenty of sessions to interact with senior management and gain a higher level understanding of the firm. Once you familiarize yourself with your role, the day-to-day becomes very simple. The hardest part of the job is trying to look for ways to bring valuable change because the organization is so large."
good,"It is a good place to start your career, get exposed to a plethora of network technologies. Bad work life balance, and company is slow to adopt new technologies in the market compared to competitors"
good,"Enjoyed my time there, just was rough period being there (late 2008, early 2009) when nobody wanted to talk with a financial advisor"
good,"Great experience.  Long hours as expected, but learned a lot.  Group of very intelligent bankers that help develop the junior staff."
good,I am very happy with my experience at Morgan Stanley.  I have learned all aspects about what goes into valuing a company.  The workforce is very diverse and in general it is a very collaborative environment.
good,"Not much room for growth potential, but good for someone who is looking for work life balance. Seems like a place where accountants go to die. No one will bother you unless, you mess something up pretty bad. On the other side no one will know who you are, even if you spend good few years of your life in this group. The campus has gym, for which you certainly be able to find time."
good,"Working hours are not too long 8-5"
good,"The firm has continually broken new ground in advising our clients on strategic transactions, in pioneering the global expansion of finance and capital markets, and in providing new opportunities for individual and institutional investors. Click below to see a timeline of Morgan Stanley's growth, which parallels the history of modern finance."
good,"This was my first position in such a corporate environment, but everyone was so nice it didn't feel like a boring corporate job. I was challenged on a daily basis by the work that I did, which I enjoyed."
good,"A typical day log into call center or if reconciling uploading your fund descrepancies for the day."
good,Nice place to work for.  Every manager I have worked for has been a pleasure to work with.  The work from home option is excellent especially for those with long commutes and families.
good,"Tough environment."
good,Had a genuine time spent technically learning things with he team of well experienced and knowledge professionals of different background.
good,"The work is engaging form a technical standpoint, and there is a good balance between the three pillars of my skills set: producing, shooting and editing."
good,"Hours are about 8-6.  The mood in the office laid back.  I have gained some valuable knowledge of the foreign exchange market, and the overall fixed income market.  Management is easy to talk to and seem excited to get to know you.  Management works closely with the employees.  "
good,Strong corporate culture. Smart people with good management structure.
good,"A typical day at work requires interacting with clients to prioritize new requirements, working on ongoing development items, co ordinating with the stakeholders to keep everyone engaged and informed. Sometimes issues creep into the production environment which must be dealt with urgent priority, the work load otherwise is just about right. The co workers are all friendly and cordial. Though the management exudes an air of a corporate environment, its still a fun place to work at."
good,Great role interacting with bright and hardworking team members
good,"One of the major brokerage houses in the nation. They are dedicated to next generation products, services and technology."
good,The hardest part of the my job was support.
good,"The pay was great as an intern, but the people were too hardcore for being a backoffice Fund Services function. Overall it was a good first corporate experience that kept you grounded and a good way to learn the back operations of a bank and its services to fund of funds."
good,Morgan Stanley offers the many benefits of a big company
good,If you are interested in sales and you are good at it this is a great opportunity to make a lot of money and have great hours.
good,The company is constantly changing.  I enjoyed working at Morgan Stanley.  Generous employee benefits.  Good corporate culture.  Constant changes in management.
good,The review process was fairly easy. I received a LinkedIn message from a Morgan Stanley recruiter and scheduled an interview shortly there after. I had three interviews and received an offer after the second one. Easy onboarding process.
good,Well known company in an international level. Areas that could improved is the technology/ platforms used as well as the office work culture for the staff.
good,"Fast passed, always busy, very focused on compliance and avoiding risk at the expense of all else.  Your experience depends on the FA you work for and the management team."
good,"Mobility was not encouraged by all Managers. Many people in MD office left the company despite it being a great place to work, because they could not advance internally. If Managers need you, they can deny your internal job change which is unfair for employees' career and growth."
good,I had a brief Internship at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and it wasn't my kind of work environment. Nothing was wrong with the place it just wasn't for me.
good,"The excitement this company delivers is just endless.  Wow, every day I went to work was the best day of my life.  They make the greatest product you can imagine."
good,"There are many amazing projects happening at Morgan Stanley. All of the people with whom I worked were top notch. The corporate structure tended to feel too heavy sometimes, although the interesting projects more than made up for that."
good,"Great culture for learning,  little room for upward mobility,  each level takes a year minimum,  so count on making some lateral movements to get the next level if there is any sort of abundance of management in your center."
good,"This company has good health benefits.  The work/life balance makes it a nice place to work.  Depending on your management, you can create your own work schedule which includes working from home."
good,"Typical day was in performing the research desired to follow the progress of the companies your working with and keeping in touch with the needs of your clients to plan for the future."
good,"I start my day by reviewing my voicemail and email correspondence and following up with company employees to move the expense process along the approval tiers. I am then ready to start the review of expense reports, reconciling AMEX accounts and run various accounting reports. The hardest part of this job is dealing with employees that want to expense non-policy items that are not in compliance with firm policy ie: client gifts, accessories, clothing, and sundries The best part of each day is the camaraderie among my coworkers and fellow auditors.  Management is generally supportive and allows a flexible schedule as needed."
good,"good environment to work"
good,"* A typical day started at 6:30 to 7:AM, and ended when you called it a day. As a new Financial Advisor, that meant 4:PM (if you were lazy) and 11:PM if you were a workaholic. "
good,It is a younger company and the employees like to have fun. Most positions are structured.
good,"While Morgan Stanley has great compensation, the work is grueling and employees are expected to work long hours."
good,Learned how to manage people. co-workers were friendly.
good,Overall rating 3.5 out of 5. Good management and work life balance. Good working place for females.
good,"Excellent working environment due to highly energetic co workers. Daily work included but was not limited to account management, wires and money transfers, reviewing complex compliance procedures such as correspondence and account documentation while fielding reception calls. Management was very organized and driven but lacked a connection to the base worker. Large reorganization of hierarchy of management lead to employees fearing for their jobs and lack motivation for advancement."
good,Every day was a new challenge.
good,"I been within company for 4yrs and it has been the best business I've worked yet. The benefits are normal, volunteer time is great, remote computing for work & family life and culture is wonderful."
good,"Great team of people but difficult to get to know because it is a call center environment and micromanaged. "
good,Pay structure is not the best but a good place to get your career started. Benefits are good but 401k is only fully vested after 3 years. There is a lot of younger people working out of the Baltimore office.
good,"Banking firm with a technology attitude - great people to work with and more importantly, learn from. Work-life balance is excellent, and technology really is top-notch."
good,"big company,"
good,"Good learning/highly productive and very good process."
good,Morgan Stanley is a top tier company with excellent roots to grow with. All the tools are provided to further your career in any direction as long as you applied yourself.
good,Morgan Stanley provides a good environment for individuals who have just graduated to begin their career. Analysts are encouraged to get involved in projects that will help them progress within the company.
good,"a typical day at work ...good fun place"
good,"Great place to work. I have learned so much at my time with Morgan Stanley, the work atmosphere is top notch. Benefits are amazing and pay is above average."
good,"My team at Morgan Stanley was fantastic, probably one of the tightest knit teams that I have ever been a part of. As someone still young and growing in the industry there is a great amount to learn here. As for your social life, plan to never have any weekends free and if you are in the technical field there is just a small team so you will be on call 24/7 some weeks. December is the worst month for all at Morgan because of End of Year financial reviews, at the end of 2019 there was nearly 1500 jobs cut mostly in the technology sector, so never be confident about your position here, it can be cut at any time."
good,"Morgan stanley is a great working environment, with an encouraging team environment. The company is very lenient and promotes work life balance, they are completely understanding of staff who attend school or who have children."
good,Ok place to work depending on who you worked for. They do have one week every year where they do something special for the assistants every day of that particular week.
good,"I learned a lot, made good money, and was put into a position to grow. However, the micromanagement by some advisors and the lack of work culture made it very depressing to go into work everyday."
good,its a good job the people are nice work together clean place  in evey boby on time  and  work hard to make fresh food for the customer  im happy to be a team player for
good,"Great place to work. Employees are encouraged to grow and have full management support. Work life balance is a plus. Surrounded by smart, driven colleagues."
good,From day one my work at morgan stanley was purely learn as you go I was given duties such as calling FA clients and updating client info. There were also instances that I created a customer relationship database which required strong excel skills and great attention to detail. This position strengthened my skills as well as challenged by having me multitask throughout the day at a fast pace. I really enjoyed the customer interaction and the friendly atmosphere that was shared among the co-workers.
good,Went through lots of mergers from the beginning of career all with the same branch / companies being bought out never had a question as to my job security until be became Morgan Stanley little fish got lost in their big ocean.
good,"I personally had issues with the small office, multiple off site managers that have poor communication with each other and to support staff within the small offices"
good,"The area which I worked was growing too fast and the team in place was not experienced enough to handle it.  MS gave away the house and promised everything to their clients without realizing that the firm couldn't live up to that promise.  People WILL stab you in the back with you in the room...happened too many times to me.  If you have no conscience or morals, MS is for you."
good,I’ve always enjoyed working here but the lack of oversight in this company is insane. How can one silo not know what the other is up to? A reduction in size would help
good,"Micro Management"
good,"The job was great, awesome learning experience. Manager was THEE worse part of the job. Coworkers are great to work with in a very inclusive environment. Pay is decent, if you have a manager that is willing to go to bat for you, otherwise, they will underpay and overwork you."
good,"Management ok, Peers decent enough.  Contractors underpaid. Contractors shoud have a say on Management review forms.  Pathway to perm status needs improvment."
good,The days are long but rewarding.  The teams are cohesive and vastly intelligent. Business objectives constantly shift to meet regulatory deliverables.
good,"you will find an incredible dealflow, getting exposure to live deals from the very beginning of your experience. you will need to fight your way to seniors' approval, as your direct superiors won't give you credit for your work. average of 18/19h of work per day"
good,Very Stressful place to work. I learned a lot that I value from working here. Overall a great learning expereience and great team culture within the branch.
good,"Morgan Stanley is a greart company, after i was laid off  just after 9/11 they began to drain the swamp.  Unfortunately i was a casualty prior to getting all the problematic upper management out.  I would have retired there had it not been for a un-favored few who were forced out just after I was!"
good,"I joined the advisor training program at Morgan Stanley in January of 2007.  I chose Morgan Stanley because of the mentor that would train me.  My mentor left the firm the week I passed my series 7, followed by my branch manager.  Circumstances led to no leadership/guidance as a new advisor."
good,"Assisting high demanding financial advisors and outside vendors with issues and inquires. I acquired strong  interpersonal skills and developed a strong customer service background. Management created a good work/life balance for employees and lead by example."
good,"This job has turned into a high level call center, the pay is decent."
good,The company really focuses on ensuring the client has a wonderful experience and integrates the different groups to deliver this which makes it unique.
good,If you do not partner or joint the team of an experienced advisor you will likely fail.  Individuals are given no real business plan or plan of execution and survive on a decent salary.
good,"Started out as a great company and although the stock has been steadily improving, the overall work experience has not.  They are beginning to shrink their footprint here in the US by outsourcing many jobs to indian consulting companies."
good,We were going through a merger at the time so things were a bit stressful.  Many hours worked with less than needed employees to do the work. We all had to reinterview for our jobs and the selection process seemed like it had already been decided.  Lack of upward mobility.
good,"The work was amazing!  But, the people were weird.  One anglo guy was rude and unfriendly.  One Asian lady was jealous and worked hard to undermine me.  They were mad and jealous, because i had an undergrad, and they had MBAs, and I received the same perqs.  I choose to forgive."
good,It is very tough to make it as an FA you are on an island and don't have support from management because most of time FA will not make it. Less than 10% make it five years as FA.
good,"While there is nothing horribly negative about the company there is also a distinct lack of culture, a fragmented since of camaraderie, and lots of top down inititives that are questionably communicated. It tends to be a vanilla experience that will never truly excite or infuriate you."
good,"Overall Morgan Stanley is a good place to work. learned a lot about working with our business partners and management. had excellent relationship with managers and co-workers. hardest part of the job is administrative work around the project, spending a good amount of time working on non-developmental issue regarding project delivery and release management and enterprise services. most enjoyable part of the job was the location - I have worked the same building for nearly 20 years in 3 different companies"
good,"Pricing, Valuation and Model Risk review of all Equity Structured Products traded by Morgan Stanley in North America"
good,Healthy environment. I like that I was not micro-managed. Staff was very helpful and I felt challenged.
good,Was booming until 2001
good,At Morgan. Stanley each year layoff are done company wide with no exception or reason. This company does not pay well compared to others in the industry.
good,"Good place to work and gain experience, learn new skills, exposure to new platforms and skill sets. good and helpful interaction with different groups."
good,"Great environment, with great people but a lot of management changes taking place which can lead to decreased morale. Unique complex in that all of the branches are located in one building."
good,The department I worked for did not have a formal training department and had a poor training program.  The training and cross training was applied unevenly across the workforce.  The department I worked for had typical management compared to the industry with some experienced and educated members of management and some managers were not so good and inconsistent with their advice and feedback with infrequent one-on-one reviews.  The workplace culture was good and the employees are mutually supportive.  I thought the internal tools and systems would be more advanced.  Overall it's a great company and I enjoyed working there.
good,"My internal clients, FAs and CSAs are the most professional and hard working in the industry. I am honored to help them serve clients. The company is producing some of the best online tools for investors as well."
good,Intense with daily reviews of accuracy and productivity.  Stressful physically on computer/keyboard non-stop 8 hours a day.  High turnover because no full-time employment is offered.
good,fast paced. required to learn on the job and not much coaching. new training classes brought in regularly and many experienced professionals let go. Must relocate for any real type of advancement.
good,"I work long hours, but can also take time off when I needed."
good,"My work was based on  a deadline each month and became to stressful to balance life and family with. As the deadline was reached each month, there was a lull in the amount of work to do creating a mundane atmosphere."
good,"Depending on your department it can be very demanding on time and offers poor work life balance"
good,Excellent ability to learn and grow your overall experience.  However there is no loyalty for contractors/consultants...  The hardest part of the job => Training is crucial in each and every Data Center position.  due to the fact that every Data Center is run differently.  However there is zero time to be able to get the training that a new comer needs to get up to speed in an exceptable amount of time.  Never anytime for knowledge transfer.
good,"Morgan Stanley is a good place to work. It depends on which group you are working in. Some groups seem to be really nice, challenging and innovative while others seem lacking in some departments."
good,great place to work. Really has a great feel and the people strie hard to learn and get better on a daily basis.  You're also striving to uphold the MS brand so if that's not for everyone.
good,Make sure you do research on the team you work for before you take the position. Do not take a position without agreeing on compensation because its tough to get after the fact.
good,Morgan Stanley is a great place to start a career. Lots of training and industry exposure. Long term internal prospects are not very good given limited opportunities.
good,"Less work life balance Salary Discrimination reward for work"
good,"Like any typical Big Bank, MS is about getting the right talent and I do have to say that they do retain very impressive people."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the the job was client interaction and the opportunity to learn something new."

good,▪ Performed tasks on a daily basis to ensure cash movement was balanced for trades that were
good,Co workers are fun to work with.
good,"At times a great place to work. Travel to office was long time, moved most operations to NYC. Technology was readily available. Had the tools waas available. Management chaanged often."
good,I experienced a great work environment.  Support staff is helpful and knowledgeable.  Management is very involved in client relationship.  Success is measured by assets under management.
good,"Long hours"
good,"I worked as a consultant and while working at MS was the happiest I have ever been at a workplace, I felt I was not valued by the upper management as a worker. I worked hard for a promotion that went to another individual. Then the management asked me to train him for that job for two months. It definitely made me feel undervalued."
good,"Before working here I was not informed that this was a call center. Even after interviewing it was still not displayed as a call center. Management is of very little help to new employees coming out onto the floor. I'd never worked in a call center environment before and will never again. New employees often do not know who their immediate supervisors are for weeks. In my opinion, ALL supervisors should welcome and introduce themselves upon the new employees coming onto the floor. They often do not want to assist with problems, yet tell you to skype them or post a message to the general population. The turnover rate is ridiculously high and it's due to management and supervisors not taking a proactive approach with great employees. I would have remained there in the workplace culture was inviting, helpful and enjoyable."
good,Member of 2 year analyst program that provided strong opportunities for career advancement. They are now looking to hire more people from within which should help the overall culture.

good,"Learned a lot in a fast-paced environment"
good,"Management has made a big push in IT Operations to out-source as much as possible and to move all IT Operations jobs from New York City to less expensive locations in foreign countries such as Canada, Mexico and India."
good,"The work isn't stressful and it is a true 9-5. BUT, you aren't growing in your career, aren't learning a new skill. If you just want a ""maintain a job"" position, this is the place to be."
good,Morgan is fast paced. Must continually work hard and need to make deadlines. Has potential to be very stressful but employees there are incredibly smart.
good,Work was very stressful. Management was not professional at all. work culture is very poor. long hours and no future advancement at all. company did not have any proper training program.
good,You learned a great deal in financial management due to the demand in tax operations was tight and the window in meeting the deadline was short. The challenges were to managing the demands at that time.
good,Large firm with all the pros and cons from that .  Often management change leading to changes in strategy.  Great IT support which helps with the day to day
good,"Being a financial advisor is a tough job. You need to be able to hear a lot of ""No's"" before you'll get some ""Yes's"". The sales training I received was very good."
good,"I'd worked for Morgan Stanley for many years, and remained there for as long as I could because all of the bankers were a pleasure to work for.  My only issues and conflicts were with New York managers who seemed to resent and not understand the relaxed atmosphere of the San Francisco office."
good,"It is an amazing place to work, so many people have been there for over 15 years now. But it all depends on the team as it is said - You work for the manager not the firm and you leave your manager not the firm."
good,Room for advancement if you are watching your time management. Friendly management. Lots to learn if you are willing to pay attention and do what is expected of you.
good,"i thoroughly enjoyed my time at MS, i joined as a graduate and progressed to VP.  the hours were long, and the people very smart and ambitious with a great team atmosphere."
good,Loved my immediate team but there seemed to be a long term vision lacking.  Big proposal to offshore lots of production work without understanding day to day risks and expectations.
good,"Being a new department in the US tax reporting and withholding space, everything was ad-hoc.  I was one of about 10 employees in the department when I started and now has over 200"
good,"It's a culture and at the end of the day it's a job. My experience has been great in many ways. I continue to learn so much. Although the team I was assigned has turned into an epic disappointment, there are still amazing people at the company who continue to inspire. I do not fit with the team I am on, however hold faith there is balance to be found somewhere else within the firm."
good,An overall good stepping stone for getting your foot in the world of finance.  But jobs in Utah usually come with little to no advancement.
good,Great name to have on your resume but a lot of politics involved in order to move up.
good,"Extensive, industrialised process for onboarding in place in their Fixed Income teams."
good,"They used to pay well till they shifted focus on offshore offices, since then their compensation is going down a little, no job security since Indians are practically ruling the company, management is getting more and more pathetic so as the Job Culture"

good,Morgan stanley smith barney was very profession and a great place to work but they are a little too professional.
good,Large broad based company with talented employees. Under regulatory focus due to market and size of the company.
good,This was a great company to work for. They worked hard to provide all that their clients wanted and needed to reach
good,"It's an ok place to work, but management are a bit chaotic and stuck in their ways.  Could do with a refresh and also could do with giving more opportunities for advancement"
good,"good name on resume, standard training, analyst program is BS and too long just keeping low wage work, pay sucks, advancement sucks. mixed management mostly bad. funny people but they dont know what they're doing and too disenchanted from high turnover"
good,"Strong workplace culture that is very demanding."
good,"J'ai travaillé pour Morgan Stanley à distance, et nous faisions des points par Skype. Le contact était facile et agréable."
good,company puts employees first with strong work life balance and good benefits.  I enjoyed working in a positive environment with top notch colleagues who shared common goals.
good,Good place to work..good work experience ...good culture...good salary..good overall company..good management..recommended for all. My 11 years of experience warrants all of the above
good,Was discouraged from pursuing a career as a CPA expressly because I was a woman. Pay as a CSA is not commiserate with the level of work that you're expected to do.

good,"The people who work with are the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Never worked over 40 hours, virtually no chance for growth. Pay was good for the job and vacation time was great for an entry level position. Management needed work"
good,i was disappointed with the company's rigidity and red tape. i was treated unfairly at a time when i needed the company's support the most in a time of strife
good,"Working at Morgan Stanley provides a great learning experience and development in any career.  The work is intense but you will become really good at your craft.  On the other hand, the long work hours and intense work creates a poor work/life balance."
good,"Great company, good benefits. Enjoyed the opportunities given. Operations has a wide variety of positions to look at. I held a line role directly supporting trading activities which was extremely fast paced and demanding. Many project roles within the operations space aren't as demanding/stressful. Enjoyed the community service events the firm is involved with along with participating in campus recruiting efforts."
good,"Nice to work in MSSB. Able to develop the analytical and analysis skills."
good,Overall good place to work with good people. Could be somewhat limiting for some in terms of internal movement due to the size of the firm. Others find comfort and security there and stay for an extended period of time.

good,"Very structured.  Learned about not trusting every single person because they will shoot you in the back.  "
good,Good employer. Really great place to work. Have worked there for past 4 years full-time and 3 internships before them. So really got to spend a lot of time there.
good,"This is my first job after I graduated from College.  I stepped into Stock/Option trading environment.  On the stock/option exchange, I have  to work fast pace and accuracy was the key to success."
good,The contract was for a year and was renewable.  Learning the systems was very easy to do based on my prior experience with other financial institutions.  It takes too long to go permanent.

good,MS is characterized by high quality employees. It is a resource rich environment.  Management changes come in waves and can create new opportunities for staff.
good,"This is an exciting and rewarding role. Under 10% success rate and you won't have work/life balance, but it's well worth it if you're willing to work."
good,"compensation not competitive for existing employees. had been at company for 5 years and yearly raises were essentially cost of living adjustments. if you've been there for long time, you realize you'll make more elsewhere."
good,the work environment was decent. I liked a lot of my coworkers but it was clear that we were easily replaceable to upper management and the turnover was really high.
good,"I found the job to be redundant and decided to leave and explore other opportunities. "
good,"Although the primary duties of the internship involved cold calling prospective clients daily, the lead financial advisor was very friendly and made the work place fun by throwing a small football back and forth to keep the blood flowing and energy high."
good,culture change has occurred.  Less spend on IT more focus on business.  IT shift toward vendor support and offshore/near shore locations.  Move away from metro locations for IT
good,No real career pathway in wealth management in the CAC. You have to watch out for yourself. Also switching from one division to another is hard to swing. You almost have to leave and come back.

good,"clean"

good,Great company to work at.  Understands family value; Great working culture and enjoyed working with some amazing individuals.  I would recommend to work here.
good,I was an intern and the job was what I expected it to be. I learned about stocks and the various accounts that Morgan Stanley was able to offer their customers. My leadership was great.
good,"Morgan Stanley embodies the negative and positive stereotypes of corporate employment. If you're hard working, you can make a successful career for yourself."
good,great culture. good firm . alot of opportunities to move within the firm. lots of charitable events. lots of free advice and services available. the culture on Long Islanf is different than Manhattan
good,"As a Branch Manager charged with the overall operation of a financial service franchise, the job was both  incredibly challenging and ultimately rewarding."
good,Industry Leading research.  Morgan Stanley has analysts in any imaginable field and provides top down as well as bottom up strategies for multiple sectors.
good,Great opportunity to work with sophisticated professionals and learn new skills. Reasonable working hours and great community. Could improve their technology.
good,"A bit rote, but that should be expected with contract roles. Nice location. Decent working hours, decent pay, but a big corporate structure, difficult to stand out."
good,"Good company to work with.  Micromanagemnt has increased exponentially, you must be in each position for 18 months minimum before moving into a different group"
good,Working at Morgan Stanley is an eye-opening experience for anyone at any level. A large organization as such has extensive amount of resources and opportunities for learning.
good,"Fast paced, cutting edge technology. Company is located at one of the best places in NY City. A great location for people to commute living in NJ, CT or NY."
good,There's not much to say other than I hope their Resident Financial Advisor Trainee porogram has been revamped to match actual outcomes instead of unrealistic expectactions.
good,"Working for Morgan Stanley is fun and i am working for past 4 Years so the journey was like a roller coaster. Learned lot of things during the journey from different locations. In short, Morgan Stanley is the best  company for learning and growing in your career"
good,"Being a trader at Morgan wasn't a very satisfying problem-solving experience.   That being said, my co-workers were hard-working, motivated individuals that I enjoyed learning from."
good,Allowed to work & take care of other matters. Held responsible & accountable. Always busy & must wear multiple hats to be looked at as part of the team
good,If you are willing to be on your own and work at your own pace this is for you. You must meet the certain hurdles but other than that you are on your own.
good,Morgan Stanley is a top-tier firm that operates in a very fast-paced manner. Ability to multi-task is a must in most areas. Business models are vey dynamic and require employees to adapt quickly.
good,"The culture is very east coast based. Its a very high stress, faced paced environment. Those who are willing to put in the time and effort will be matched with compensation and advancement."
good,"You're basically on your own to build your business. The agency provides you an office, computer, phone, and the research and products to offer to clients to meet their financial investment needs."

good,"-small but friendly office"

good,to build long term relationships with our customers and clients and provide exceptional customer services by pursuing business through innovation and advanced technology.
good,"Work on Morgan Stanley Global Network through/as a Verizon employee.  Great engagement, employee collaboration and coordination of efforts. A very diverse set of skill sets required to successfully complete engagement."
good,Morgan Stanley is an extremely competitive lifestyle. I would only recommend this company if you are willing to work very very hard. The pay is not so great at first.
good,Learned a lot but it was really due to self initiative and desire to succeed.  Hard to be truly objective because I was there just following the dotcom meltdown of 2001.  Having expanded greatly during the tech boom MS was now shuttering offices daily.  The environment proved too difficult in which to achieve the lofty goals.
good,"A decent company. Day start with supporting Tky Traders and operations with their IT and business operation issues."
good,very competitive workforce as intelligent people are hired.  Cyclical business where job stability is not assured.  enjoyable part of the job was dealing with different branches throughout the country.
good,Morgan Stanley was a best in class broker dealer in the late 90's.  There was great support for young brokers such as myself.  I have always spoken very highly of my years at Morgan Stanley.
good,"The team I interviewed with is not the same team I work for.  I was fooled into what my responsibilities would be.  I am doing things an intern should be doing and I a disappointed.  I have been in the industry for 26 years and want to work with the clients, not doing personal things."
good,This is a large operation.  Do your job well and you will have advancement opportunities.  The leadership are mostly folks that were promoted from within.
good,I would get in early and leave late. It truly depends upon which team you get to work with. Management was extremely accommodating. Stay away from negative people.
good,"Overall I really enjoyed the culture of the Morgan Stanley office. Everyone was very friendly, they all work hard and are able to prioritize their responsibilities very well."
good,"Morgan Stanley is overall a good place to work, however in my role, there's no opportunity. The perception is if you don't have your Securities License 7, 63, 66, 9/10, there's no other role for you to obtain unless you're in the Northeast. On the branch level, there's no other options."
good,Important to manage your time efficiently and think ahead of what your manager is requesting. It was stressful at times but I'm organized and efficient and was able to multi-task various appointments.
good,"Trying to be efficient and effective in use of technology and operational processes. Great infrastructure, good working space and very nice and helpful people."
good,Worked with highly professional people and enjoyed part of the job. Would love to go back if i get a chance. Great company to work for where you have proper work life balance.
good,"At Morgan Stanley, my direct team was invested my development and success early on.  I had almost none of the qualifications the role required when I started, but my managers ensured that I quickly became equipped with the technical skills to allow for my success.  I have since been given the opportunity to manage a team of my own and have enjoyed helping others pursue their career goals.  Throughout my tenure, there has been a culture of camaraderie that makes working on my team fun.  I've enjoyed creating relationships around the country as I've advised branch managers about the how to best manage a P&L."
good,Great experience working at the company.  Lots of emphasis on work life balance and really great benefits.  Worked with a great team and management group.
good,Professional firm whose values include its' clients and employees. The company encourages and recognizes growth in its' employees. Opportunities to learn new responsibilities are readily available.
good,Overall a good place but it depends where you end up. Some departments are prone to large turn over due to stagnant management  policies. There are very few people that stay here long time.
good,I enjoyed my long tenure with a big-name firm overall but the last couple years were marked by large amounts of change within management and little support by co-workers. The firm culture was struggling.
good,Great job and learning experience.  Started as a receptionist and was later promoted to assistant office manager.  Couple of years later was promoted again to Administrative Assistant to IT Dept
good,great company to work for. they really take care of employees. i learned a lot from everyone who worked there. definitely would recommend working for this company.
good,"good people working there..very nice..supportive..nice to work for..But they merge with another Financial group, and some employee's were let go.. I would have liked to work there just a little longer with the good people.."
good,"Pretty normal office environment, everyone is friendly enough, free lunches at least once a week. Nice enough place to work when you're lower down on the totem pole."
good,"it all depends on who you work with, who you team members are.  office management can be very iffy.  they have a tendency to look out for them selves and not you"
good,I enjoyed the team I worked with but not necessarily the work.  It is a great entry into finance if that is your end goal.  I am no desk jockey so this position was not fulfilling to me which greatly impacted work ethic in my final few months with the firm
good,"Efficient & productive"
good,"Liked the environment and staff. Just couldn't be a long term career."
good,"Nem szeretném értékelni a vállalatot, többszöri kiszervezés."
good,The life of a Financial Advisor is not easy.  I worked more than 60 hours a week.  Don't do it unless you really like it.  I personally considered everyone a prospect until proven otherwise.
good,"Rigid structure. No flexibility to work from home like other companies A lot of time goes in traveling back and forth from my home to downtown Manhattan. This in turn affects my performance. As soon as I got the opportunity to work for a great company like United Healthcare, I left."
good,"You will learn a great deal working with the very intelligent people at this firm. Business always comes first and its's all about the money. "
good,Management & People are nice. Work hard and play hard. Contractor/Temps aren't acknowledged.  If you're not a full time employee you are seen as non existent. Offers a nice work/life balance.
good,"Throughout my years here, I've learned so much and made great professional relationship.  Always busy and lots of work to manage however a great learning experience."
good,"Joined as a fresher, so learned a lot from the seniors and management people."
good,Good company and opportunities available. Friendly and professional atmosphere to work in. Good location to get to and work in
good,A typical day includes juggling multiple projects and addressing several business clients. There are always meeting which make it a collaborative environment.
good,The company definitely expects a lot out of you. Work is demanding and challenging but you get what you put into it. Great place to build a career and make good money if you work for it.
good,While at MS i had a great time learning from others. Great place to learn about technology and finance. Would stay there as long as possible.
good,I provided customer service and all other office duties.  Everyone was very friendly and all employees were treated with respect.
good,"The goal of this position is to prospect and acquire clients through many different means. Using cold calling, seminars, mailers, and many more. There are strict sales goals that need to be met. I enjoy the freedom that you have to create your own hours. I also enjoy meeting many new people in this role."
good,It was a great interning experience where I had the privilege of working in an office setting. The office setting proved a sort of camaraderie that I hadn't experienced prior. And I learned a lot about the final industry.
good,"The company is diverse and does have a solid foundation. The turnover rate is high, but I think the current upper management staff is working to keep employees longer."
good,Each day is different which makes the job very interesting dealing with real world events. You learn to deal with pressure and making fast decisions. The culture is filled with many intelligent people who are looking toward achieving clients objectives while meeting or exceeding sales and profit goals in line with the companies visions and values.
good,great company to work for. great opportunity to grow with this company. pay is great as well. worked at the easton location which is the only office in columbus. team to hire position usually.
good,"Great company to work for.  Learned about the Asset Management business. I was very hands on as an IT Developer at the time.  I worked to with multiple languages (Java, perl, shell, JSP) and had a great team which allowed me to grow and learn"
good,"You develop at a fast pace, but pay does not match merit compared to industry. Really enjoy the ideas and the culture of giving back. I would recommend the job to anyone who feels bored in what they do"
good,Morgan Stanley provides a good opportunity to learn about the financial services industry. Colleagues are knowledge and create a welcoming environment that promotes learning.
good,"Pros : Flexible work hours, friendly work environment. Encourage new approach for problem solving."
good,"Truly professional work culture and environment"
good,People are nice and understanding and accommodating of any personal issues. Good infrastructure and nice place to work
good,Management needs to be more supportive of their nurses. Tough and stressful work environment. 12 hour shifts.
good,"Fast paced environment, good opportunities if you are willing to work hard and put your carrier first. There are also options for mobility, both geographically and across different business areas."
good,"You will work hard, learn quickly and often, and form professional relationships that will last. Management is supportive and promotes continuing education."
good,"Speaking from a Registered Associate (CSA) role, the firm and the branch I worked in valued the employees.  The managers, compliance, operations and reception staff were very respectful and trusted you until you couldn't be trusted. The hardest part of the job was getting accustomed to constant changes in operations and things beyond one's control (i.e. market fluctuation, handling multiple client requests) and the most enjoyable is fulfilling a client's request with ease, having assistance from the managers when you really need it. It's vital that the CSA has a good working ""chemistry"" with their FA's, it makes all the difference especially during stressful times as in any relationship."
good,"I typically worked eight or nine hours a day.  I learned many things about prime brokerage, and the financial services industry as a whole.  I also learned a lot about operations in general.  Morgan Stanley is a great company because it gives you many opportunities that other firms do not, such as being able to interact freely with upper management (VPs and above).  Middle managers are not that great.  It appears that they may be sandwiched, or pulled in too many directions, and therefore lack focus.  The hardest part of the job is the turnover / attrition.  The most enjoyable part of the job is processing / production, as it does not carry over into the next day."
good,Day to day Morgan Stanley Wealth Management is a great place to work. It presents employees with various challenges but gives them to tools and platforms to find success at all levels of the company.
good,Fast pace environment with numerous bright and dedicated individuals. Great compensation and benefits. Great Life/Work balance with opportunity to work remotely occasionally.
good,Was fully sponsored for licensing and registration. Tough place to start at as someone new to the industry....................
good,"I still recall the time I was an intern.  This was a great opportunity and my entry into the corporate world.  The manager was great, the opportunity not so much because it was still in production.  But it gave me an idea of what the corporate world was about.  The intern program was great.  The resources were awesome.  And with many giving headaches about their experiences, versus what I saw, I still recommend it!"
good,Great environment and company but I need to expand my horizons and be more challenged. The people are nice and everyone has an open door policy and we get along well. I need more work to do and need to be stimulated.
good,"- Mitarbeiter aus ganz Europa, sehr Multikulturell"
good,"Great firm overall."
good,"Conducted legal and financial analysis of companies quoted on European stock exchanges (covering over 20 countries in the region) with primary focus on their corporate governance performance."
good,Typical day involves learning and being challenged. Great people great environment.  It has been a dream.  Thankful for this opportunity.
good,"I was an intern at Morgan Stanley learning about the stock market and how finance work. Jeffrey Won was an amazing person, who knows all his fact and does his research on stocks."
good,"Very good life work balance with a very good group leader. there is a lot of politics, which makes it a little difficult sometimes for mobility. Overall it is a fun place to work that is not always about number but how well you do the job."
good,"My experience at MS was good; however, I got bored with my specific job responsibilities as it was not challenging and I did not see my career progressing with upward growth mobility."
good,"Great group of people to work for. I learned a wealth of knowledge at Morgan Stanley.  Very fast pace, strong work ethics.  A great deal of the employees there are very intelligent and know their positions very well."
good,"The management team is very hands off on micro management and your work throughout the day. You determine your own work schedule, which is great, but you do feel that you never leave the office even when you're home. The job can consume your life, which means that a balance between recreational activities and work activities must be attempted. Training is very basic, and because of the structure of the business (totally being open) it can be a bit overwhelming to learn what is the best method to develop your own business. You are given some guidelines, ideas, and some notes, but then are left to sink or swim."
good,"Great place to work with great people. Management is great and you can build your career here. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected for a big company."
good,"Working for Morgan Stanley was a great experience, and all my colleagues were very helpful and friendly. The work environment was relaxed and very comfortable."
good,"Morgan Stanley was a great learning experience for me. It provided with knowledge of different investment products, industries and investment strategies. Many of my tasks I had to learn how to do on my own, but my advisors were always willing to help if I had questions. As an intern I worked under two different financial advisors  with whom I interacted with on a daily basis. My tasks varied depending on my advisors needs. A typical day for me consisted of producing client reports, generating client lists and creating marketing materials to be sent to potential clients."

good,People are very talented and helpful. Great learning experience and usually the work is challenging. Had a chance to work with diverse people around the world.
good,Branch analyst program was set up as a learning yet hands-on environment. Proved to be a great opportunity for a finance-driven intern.
good,"I enjoyed my time at MS.  However, I only worked as a temp.  Once the assignment was over, I moved on.  The NYC office dictates the work flow for ATL."
good,I like it because of the dynamic work place. It's fun. Prestigious. well paying. Lots of career potential. Not cutthroat at all.
good,"My co-workers were friendly and my Team members were great.  the hardest part of the job was being ""just a CSA"".  They really don't appreciate CSAs with extensive knowledge.  Seems like they tend to group us all together as ""the help""."
good,Typical day was dealing with different client issues and situations. Great co-workers and wealth of financial information to learn from.
good,Morgan Stanley was a fantastic place to work and had better benefits. The unlimited investment information was more educational than any degree you could obtain. Overall my experience was great but upper level management had no consideration for lower level employees.
good,"Morgan Stanley is a very good place to intern with friendly employees who will not hesitate to help you out, especially if you're an intern."
good,At Morgan Stanley my daily responsibilities include producing reports reflecting the profit and loss of different traders in the foreign exchange market. I also provide other metrics and analysis based on requests from regulatory bodies and other management in Morgan Stanley. I have learned many different things about the market and different financial products and how the traders use these products to manage risk and generate a profit.
good,MS is a great company to work for. The management is really supportive. THey are also very understading of women leaving for maternity leave.
good,The firm is very well organised and has state of the art resources.  The IT capabilities are also very good and provide all the tools to do the job efficiently and effectively.

good,"Had nice Experience ,Worked on very good learning project  apart from IT skills."
good,"I initially worked as a sales assistant to stockbrokers and later was offered a management position to oversee the operations at a local office. I learned a great amount and enjoyed learning about an industry directly involved in the economy. Aside from running an office, I embraced the product knowledge provided."
good,"Morgan Stanley was an enjoyable place to work."
good,"Educational Loan Financial Management System (ELFMS) provides operational and decision-making support to the asset side of balance sheet for bank.

good,"Had a great learning about the corporate culture, also got insights about hedge fund working. Some of my co-workers were very friendly and helpful. The tuff thing was the close deadlines to deliver the work. Various fun events conducted use to bring fun at work place."
good,A very professional atmosphere for anyone entering the finance industry
good,"Morgan Stanley's Global Loan Servicing business is currently growing, both figuratively in size and in scope for the Loan Syndication business.  Many opportunities exist for someone wishing to launch a career.  Senior management is disorganized, forcing staff to work long hours in high risk / high turnover positions to ensure daily tasks are completed.  Every error is treated as an Incident and requires immediate escalation, including identification of source cause and preventative action plan, within same day period."
good,Plenty to learn and many individuals to assist you.  Lower Manhattan location is wonderful during the summer months.  Everyone you work with is very helpful.  Fun and exciting youthful recruits.
good,Organized and run by good talent.  Good automation with the systems..as well as controls in place

good,"Young and dynamic colleagues, lot of interaction globally and possbility to learn & grow."

good,"A typical day consists of performing due diligence reviews of Financial Advisor's currently managing Trust client assets. Performing Reg 9 or Annual Investment Reviews for discretionary portfolios. I learn new things everyday about Trust, Stock Market and how the regulatory environment can help to improve our business. I am surrounded by knowledgeable individuals who are always willing to assist me in providing our clients with excellent customer service whether they are directly responsible for the client or not. The mos difficult part about my job is also the most enjoyable and that is trying to meet everyone's expectations. Some clients and/or Financial Advisors are easier to deal with and understand what Trust is and the role it plays in the overall Financial Planning process. I enjoy working with people and enjoy the fact that no two tasks are ever the same even if the overall task may be the same. A request to raise cash for upcoming discretionary distributions for two different accounts are treated and processed the same but, the portfolios, investment objectives, beneficiary circumstances, etc. are never the same so determining how the cash is to be raised is different."
good,Good place to work but limited opportunities in offices outside of NYC

The advisers at Morgan Stanley shared many valuable experiences and insights.  I learned how to evaluate equities from both a fundamental and technical standpoint.   
good,"Good Healthy Work-Life balance"

good,Great place to work and learn. Management are great and alway willing to help. Co-worker work hard and play hard. Sometime things get so busy that you could forget to eat.
good,"At Morgan Stanley, employees are understood to be professionals, and as professionals are given the freedom to work with their team members to determine the best strategy for accomplishing the task at hand. As a member of the client litigation department, I work closely with a handful of senior attorneys to develop defense strategy, draft legal documents, and meet discovery requirements. Our department is small, so there are strong working relationships among all the attorney's and support staff. At Morgan Stanley, I have learned to be a more independent worker, better at anticipating needs and future developments. While the most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships I have developed, and the stories that emerge in the process of working on a case, I find the most difficult part to be dealing with a large bureaucracy, in an environment of forever immanent cutbacks."
good, Obtain CUSIP numbers for issues and ensure accurate setup in Products.

good,Great experience learned a lot about current market trends which in turn helps assist the clients on making the correct financial decisions.
good,Day at MSSB consists of working with different Fortune 500 clients and top United States Financial Advisors. The reason why I enjoy working at MS is because each day brings a different challenge and learning experience which keeps you on your feet and develop the ability to deal with all types of situations at any time.
good,"A typical day was fielding phone calls fromshareowners, answering or researching any concerns they may have had regarding their accounts or any other questions. Also I deposited, transferred, wired or redeemed money from retirement accounts upon request."
good,"Great bunch of co-workers, very helpful and willing to share knowledge."
good,"On a typical day as a financial advisor associate you arrive at your office just as or a half hour before the market opens in New York (6:30 AM AZ time during daylight saving time and 7:00 AM otherwise). You spend about an hour catching up on what has happened in the world between the market close yesterday and the market opening that morning. You spend 5 hours, in 1hour blocks, making cold calls, follwoing up with leads, and making warm calls to people you know. The objective each day is to develop leads from cold calls and setting up appointments for face-to face meetings to develop leads into prospects. On 3 nights a week you spend from 5:30 PM until 7:00 or 7:30 PM making cold calls to residences. Every other Saturday you come into the office for half a day to catch up on administrative duties and make more cold calls."
good,Top notch firm with extremely talented people and a very warm and welcoming culture of teamwork
good,"great work environment and people , challenging work, training and learning opportunities are available in the workplace"
good,"During my time at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, I gained knowledge of corporate finance through a work-friendly environment. My co-workers would assign me small daily tasks that were never too time consuming or stressful. Loved working in mid-town Manhattan."
good,Morgan Stanley has very driven intelligent people and is an excellent starting point for a career. They have a great reputation and most jobs interact with so many areas that you gain great exposure to all areas of the businesss.
good,"When I started at MS I didn't know anything about the market and through my time I was able to learn a lot about not just the market but how the business was run. Employees were pushed to ""think like an owner"" and take initiative to make the best customer experience possible.With any customer service job the toughest part is some of the client interactions (internal and external)"
good,Advancing to higher positions is not noticed by management. You will need to actively go to managers and speak to your accomplishments. Management does not notice the work.
good,Working at MS provides for a lot a benefits such as high salary and career advancement. There are also downsides such as crazy work hours and needing to be on call 24/7.
good,"I enjoyed working at Morgan Stanley very much, though the multimedia organization still needs to be consolidated. This firm has an outsized proportion of middle and senior management in the technical spaces overall. The firm does hire or roll over contractors who perform well, and in technical fields really excels at finding and retaining the right talent bench, which I appreciated in the expertise and skill sets of my coworkers."
good,Senior management has to connect with the sales force to better understand solutions. The trading desks were highly efficient and the research was outstanding
good,"Day was typically busy, dealing with a lot of different tasks at a time. large learning curve and a lot of the job you learn is done on your own  with some help from team members."
good,Busy and fun environment. Good culture.  Time zones doesn't always make it easy to get things done.  Good management structure.  Good team members.  Easy going.
good,"I love what I do and enjoy my colleagues, but there is a glaring issue with direct management. Lots of laziness, promises not kept, and looking out for themselves. You are asked to enforce standards yet the managers never hold themselves to the same level of expectations. And somehow upper management never catches wind of this behavior, or turns a blind eye to their ineffective management team. This ends up causing the subordinates to feel unappreciated and overworked. People in my group who have been promoted to VP or PM have literally no clue how to use certain softwares yet are in their roles??? Tenure instead of knowledge - that’s why. I have experienced gaslighting and condescending remarks from direct managers in my role and have mentioned this on EOY reviews, yet nothing changes. Constant reorganization of our group, which disrupts lots of effective processes, to be replaced with archaic ways of doing things. If you want to have modern ways of thinking and doing things, promote the right people. Not just someone who’s been around for a while."
good,Good training ground with individuals to start their practice in financial services. Typical day involved a combination of monitoring markets and executing your business development strategy to meet performance goals.
good,"Excellent company with incredible brand name recognition and resources such as the bond desk in San Francisco and top rated industry analysts. The culture is very cutthroat and bureaucratic though, and the ""What have you done for me lately?"" mantra fits well here."
good,"Morgan Stanley is a good place to work because things run relatively smooth compared to other investment banks.  They expect high standards and this translates to overall better environment. They are definitely a little management heavy.  Large number of people giving their opinions and telling you what to do, and not being in touch what everyone is doing."
good,"This is a great first position for anyone thinking of getting into finance or wealth management. I've certainly learned a lot since starting in January. The pay is good for a recent grad and is livable/comfortable depending on your lifestyle. This is a call center based role so I understand it is not for everyone. The hardest part is dealing with angry clients/participants and busy call volumes during certain times of the year (tax season is an example of one). This position is great stepping stone for solidifying your career in wealth management and for other industries that fall under this realm. I was hired on as a contractor and it does take awhile before you are fully converted over (still a contractor). Overall, a good experience with the position and the company."
good,"Productive place to work, the managers had an open door policy which allowed for any concerns to be addressed. The Department managers always encourage to use the firms resources for work knowledge and encouraged advancements. The hardest part of the job is when your trying to explain policy and procedures to internal clients and no matter what they want what they want. The most enjoyable is when the departments recognize your hard work."
good,Morgan Stanley is a great place to be a financial advisor as they teach you the ins and outs of the business. If you're not 100% into being a financial advisor you will not make it as your career is sales driven.
good,"Management is rough, but the company overall had a good name. Their technology is not up to par as other companies I have worked for. Its the typical NY culture that prohibits this company from going forward."
good,"Located in downtown, easy transport, flexible hours, nice work environment"
good,"Solid place to build a financial advisor career, but the job culture will vary based on local management team and branch advisors. Great opportunity to help families and business accomplish their financial goals. The role requires consistent activity with a focus on 2-3 niche markets. Leverage the full resources of the company to differentiate from other advisors in the marketplace."
good,"Company as a whole is pretty good. Montreal salaries are above average but far from top notch! Good benefits!"
good,"As someone in their first 5 years here, when you go to work it is all about keeping busy all day. No one really helps you and you are on your own to hit the goals your management has given you. The only time you talk to management is when you either need help with something or you didn't hit your goal. The pros, if you hit your goals, no one really cares if you come into the office to work or work from home. "
good,"The hours were regularly 8am-7pm even though the firm says 8-6. Starting salary is $65,000 but expect only $1k to $3k increase every year. Bonuses were between 15-20% of salary. It was the type of job you could show up and do your work, then leave at night and weekends and not think about work until you get back there. An hour is given for lunch, so you could work out or go out to eat. The slow pay increases are typical, even if you’re a strong performer, which is frustrating."
good,Overall it was a nice place to work. I had a really good supervisor in both departments I worked in. Almost everyone was nice to work with. They did accommodate me when I had some issues with child care.
good,"You won't be relaxing here, work will keep you busy 24x7. Shifts are rotating which takes a toll on health. Tackling Management politics for onsite will be part of your job."
good,"Required too much time away from my family. I worked 12-14 hours a day 5 day a week and it was non stop,. I was fed breakfast and lunch, but dinner was often when I got home and my kids were in bed"
good,"Morgan Stanley has a very collaborative culture and people are generally encouraged to share their thoughts, suggested improvements and concerns."
good,"Kind of work was good but was given very less time to migrate whole application so less balance between work and life"
good,This is a good company to work for depending on what you are looking for in career advancement.  The hardest part of my day is the commute.  They did give me an opportunity to expand my knowledge.
good,"Great workplace culture, colleagues support and help one another.  Work Life Balance, great for individuals with children, families.   Managers do not micromanage."
good,Morgan Stanley was a fast paced environment where you had to learn quick and learn how to handle every different type of client. They have a reliable system and the work culture is good.
good,"Morgan Stanley is a great company, but you have to like what you do.  You typical have to seek out support because it's not often given. "
good,"started my career here and had a chance to work on an agile team with a lot of smart folks. "
good,"good workplace culture, would consider working there again if given the opportunity, learned quite a bit there,obtained the 7 and 66 while there, could have definitely used more time for the 66 licensing"
good,Depends on the team you work for your salary varies. Great place to gain experience  but career advancement is hard. Great environment but wealth management is a  who you know business.
good,"It was an informative internship, but not beneficial for the industry I'm hoping to go into. It was very corporate, so there wasn't much opportunity to provide my own perspective - it was mostly about following the directions given to you without much room for creativity."
good,Worked with some of the most talented and smart individuals.   Morgan Stanley is the top financial corporation and it's a great place gain great skills and knowledge in any field.
good,Very little work-life balance.Very demanding workload. Very rewarding job. Worked on many high profile deals. Usually worked from 7AM - Midnight. Culture is Wall Street.
good,Morgan Stanley was a great place to learn the ropes of the wealth management industry.  The culture was a good place to work and the work/life balance was exceptional.
good,I have enjoyed my time at. Morgan Stanley although I've had my share of difficulties. Overall it has been a great start to my career however feel that it's time to move on.
good,"Work culture is nice and professional. Management is helpful in  nature, stakeholders management is a key to survive in MS. Work life balance is very good, they need to improve on systems and automations."
good,"I enjoyed the job... however there was no real room for advancement. The benefits were great, and the people for the most part were wonderful to work with."
good,"Good place, important to have a good manager who is focused on your personal career plan.  Many are only focused on themselves and their own compensation.  Find a good group and a good manager and you'll be happy there."
good,I joined as a fresher and I learnt so much. Everyday I go to work I learn something new. What I enjoyed the most was the interaction with different silos and the openness and transparency the firm has and its people.
good,I love MS its a great firm.  I just am exploring options.  I feel that MS is the best firm on the street for WM.  We take care of our clients and always do whats right.
good,Worked with the smaller accounts in the office to help manage the day-to-day needs of those clients and try to build the account sizes up.  The position was eventually eliminated.
good,"I work for Morgan Stanley as a third party, with regard to the job culture, management and how the team treats me all is well. I am disappointed with how we are treated when it comes to benefits and compensation. We do the same or more work than the MS admins and yet do not see or access the same benefits and compensation."
good,"Too much reliance on friends and family for success. Limited by market that I worked in. Unless you have access to high-net worth prospects going in, it is very difficult to earn enough income when starting without any book of business."
good,"Started out right after school at the Dean Witter half,  pre-merger,   while we did share benefits,  our salary was 75% of what Morgan Stanley Employees during my time there.  Other than that,  great place for work,  lots of career development and mobility.   Good work life balance,  great benefits."
good,"Worked closely with my manager in coordinating moves, attended meetings on moves. Answered phone calls, worked with move management teams during large moves, answered emails. there was a lot of different cultures working at Morgan Stanley. I enjoyed all aspects working at this firm."
good,Great place to work however the company is in the process of outsourcing or deploying to cheaper locations from larger metro centers.  Really enjoyed my time at the firm but have seen the transformation from a well paid highly engaged workforce to a staff that understands less and less about the business.  MS gives you an opportunity to to work on something start to finish if you have the desire.  It can be very rewarding. Compensation is becoming a real issue over the long term.
good,"worked as a client service associate to a 5 member financial team,  spoke with clients daily and took the many classes that were required at Morgan Stanley"
good,"very productive Place, work with some talented people, weekend changes are always a challenge that keeps me grounded in this job."
good,"Morgan Stanley has thought me a lot, about the products, about investment banking in general. Very risk-focused and forward thinking mindset in risk-related issues, always one step ahead in planning."
good,"Culture at MS is actually friendly for the most part, but the field is inherently a competitive and relatively stressful one. Management at the Miami office was great, I enjoyed working for and with my bosses at the time. Hardest part of the job is getting new business, so be ready to work."
good,"If you don't mind cold calling and being held to an aggressive quota, this is the place to work.  Lots of tools to help you and some decent people to work with."
good,"too much pressure , other perks are good . location is good, people are not friendly , judgemental people overall not a great company to work for. if ready to just earn then it is ok"
good,"No complaints here with the company other then at one point with the management team in which overall got better. Lots of work which is great, with little time to relax. I enjoy a. busy work life."
good,I had a positive experience working at Morgan Stanley. Learned a lot about the Loan market and operations. Enjoyed the experiencing something new everyday.
good,"Its just a good brand name. All the work culture and benefits are the same."
good,"Although I work at Morgan Stanley as a temp, I felt like a regular part of the staff.  There was always something new, and sometimes interesting to learn."
good,"I have been gone for 15 years, but still have colleagues there. They appear to be back on an upswing with some good management moves. Still considered an elite house"
good,"Troubleshooting issues, provide SWAT calls for Incidents over an hour."
good,"I was a contract worker there, and the job was great. Management didn't really speak with each other as to the typical day to day duties, but they were positive and easy to talk to if you had a problem. They seemed to have great benefits, they love to volunteer, and there are a lot of ways to move within the company. Unfortunately, they did not have enough work to keep me on, but I would work there again if possible."
good,Professional and friendly environment. Work life balance is good as long as you complete the tasks at hand well. Team structures are efficient in the sense that fewer people are used to get the work done.
good,"like working here, however, looking for another position in Delaware"
good,"I worked with a wonderful group of people and a very good boss, so this experience might not be typical. I always was able to express my opinion and was respected by my co-workers. "
good,My first assignment as an independent consultant. There was tremendous learning as I set up everything on my own. Remote working with teams all over the world was fantastic.
good,This is a very well structured organization with the ability to pool resources to rapidly address any exposure to the integrity of the firm. The Morgan Stanley brand has long been synonymous with the Goldman Sachs and has separated itself as a leader in the financial services space.
good,Great place to work with very intelligent colleagues and at the forefront of the financial markets. You receive the best training and exposure to senior management and CEOs and CFOs all over the world.
good,"Fast changing environment with continues changes that impacts the motivation and morale in teams, Management more keen on cost cutting rather than keeping experienced hardworking people on board."
good,"A typical day at work can feel somewhat slow paced but this is a productive workplace. The opportunities to learn more about finance here are endless if you are willing to put in the effort. These opportunities don't easily present themselves to you though, you must make the effort to become involved to gain any valuable knowledge. I feel this company provided a positive experience for anyone interested in the field of finance/investments."
good,"Start with checking inbox for orders to process first thing in the morning. Pull and sort Wire transfers to appropriate Financial Advisors. Then pulling faxes and sorting to appropriate employees. Getting mail, sorting correspondence, making copies, and slotting to employees mailbox. Back up assistance to Receptionist, Funds Received Clerk, and New Accounts Clerk. Responsible for all client files. Assisted Compliance Manager with his filing and other projects as needed."
good,"Morgan Stanley. has been my home away from home for almost 18 years. The people I've met are like family to me. However, there comes a time when you need to break ties and move on. I do believe that time has come to explore other options."
good,"Overtime, but great company culture, smart people,business acumen, great opportunity, not much job security. Great co-workers, great location"
good,"i had a very high workload, always kept busy. Enjoyed all of the people that i worked with including my boss. 30 min lunch wasn't good, but got used to it."
good,Job was diversified . which will offer a variety of challenges and responsibilities where my abilities and skills can be fully utilized.
good,"Hard work and sometimes quite long hours but the team of people is very good and sociable."
good,"A great company that exposes you to a lot of industry leaders.  Unfortunately, the bottom line leads to a lot of politics and red tape, but I think common for large firms in the financial industry."
good,"Morgan Stanley Advantage Services taught me many things in life. Great place to work and amazing work culture. Got global exposure and came across financial products which otherwise, would not be able to experience."
good,Immediate directors are open and willing to engage in learning opportunities. They understand that a full understanding will lead to more efficiency. Work/Life balance was more than sufficient - leaning almost too much on Life side. Upper management does not do a good job at funneling down objectives from their direct reports so agendas can get lost in translation. Overall a great opportunity and learning experience.
good,"A typical day for me involves sitting in front of the computer processing items in various client accounts. I don't have much interaction with other coworkers because I am limited to communicate due to my status as a temp worker. When I started here I was told that this was a temp to permanent position but my manager doesn't even know when a permanent position will open. So i'm kinda in limbo about that. I don't really feel secure so I have been applying to other positions within the firm. I wish the communication was better though. "
good,"The culture is great, but the hours are long. Management is getting better, they need to continue to work on communication with lower level employees."
good,"Work hard, get recognized.  Great work life balance. Team player, everyone is always will to help out.  Great Company. The draw back is all about business at the end of the day.  If you fit that mentality then you will do well."
good,I was there for about a year right out of college.  Good starting point.  I was in mutual fund operations and moved on after a year.
good,"Found my career in MS Operations to be monotonous and limiting. Nature of the Ops department, but seemed they wanted mindless hamsters instead of talented go-getters."
good,I had exciting time working at Moragn Stanley. I was working Real Estate Investment Management Division which gave me the opportunity to lear about the MS funds and real estate devision
good,"Good opportunities in Risk, and other cross functional areas."
good,"Typical work day is 7:30-5PM "
good,"A typical day comprised of meetings with the stakeholders, vendors and team to vet details to be included in SRS documents, tech nicad specification documents and so on."
good,Was an enjoyable place to work. Everyone worked together to get the job done. Excellent management which was easily accessible when you needed guidance.
good,"Very nice working environment, have all the training and tools to get the job done efficiently.  Always looking for new ideas and technologies to reduce work volume and error."
good,"Business Analyst with successful experience in eliciting, analyzing, and documenting the requirements for business process, policies, and information systems.  Worked as a liaison among business stakeholders to understand business problems and opportunities in the context of the requirements and recommend solutions that enable the organization to achieve its goals. Areas of specialization include creation of Test Script, end to end UAT Testing, HP Quality Center, creation and review of Business Requirement Document (BRD) and System Requirement Specifications document (SRS). Significant experience in building and enhancing long-lasting relationships with clients. Highly numerate, and the ability to deliver clear, concise and comprehensive information to all levels of colleagues and management. Adaptable; able to adjust to widely differing management styles with no loss of work quality or quantity."
good,"Very busy, continuous training always available."
good,"Productive work environment, yet culture is very independent. Everyone tends to work alone and stay to themselves. On the other hand, whenever there was a birthday most of the employees would come and celebrate. All in all, there were a bunch of great people that worked there, but you seem to be on your own."
good,Good department and energetic people. alot of information to take in. Detail oriented.
good,"typical day at work"
good,"My daily duties included batching, coding and entering invoices into system; researching information regarding open purchase orders. I also created new vendor information and made sure 1099's were accurate among a host of other duties. "
good,One of my favorite places to work. I learned how to handle stressed and irate customers. My customers knew I gave them 110% of my ability to get their issues resolved.
good,Processing Derivatives documentations for Institutional broker dealers account across the region.
good,"Having worked a short time with this company they have shown me to be a very fast paced, driven and overall good company to work for. Being an admin for 12 traders on the floor, my team made me feel great to be at work everyday."
good,Good company. good values and culture. healthy competition. growth and advancement
good,"The job always provided a challenge. Leadership, good judgment and thinking like an owner were skills learn and built upon. Management was promoting and approachable. Co-workers were a pleasure to work with. The hours were long but worth the time spent, I enjoyed the experience the job provided."
good,Working in Morgan Stanley gave me enough knowledge about brokerage industry.
good,"Morgan Stanley is great company to work for. They value their employees and would want to promote them. Job security is stable. Although Morgan Stanley is great, I am seeking for other opportunities out there to further my career."
good,Valuable work enviroment that exposes employees to many aspects of the financial industry. Among my best experiences on Wall Street.
good,"Morgan Stanley had a LOT of consultants in the tech area- more than I've seen in other banks. I knew multiple people that were consultants for 3-4 years there. It was a pretty decent place to work (by big bank standards), with reasonable hours and expectations, but layoffs would come in big, unforeseen waves. Technology is seen and treated as a cost center of the business, rather than a driver or differentiator."
good,"The hardest part of the job was all the layoffs over the years and the hiring freezes. This meant a lot more work for those who were still there. Hard to get the support you needed."
good,it used to be fun there but not any more.  Bonuses have dried up and the current management are more task masters than leaders.  At least in Operations.  Raises barely exist.
good,"Morgan Stanley is an old-fashioned firm, with old-fashioned executives, management, and team-members. It wasn't particularly challenging, but that being said, the culture is positive (better than most Wall Street banks) and the people are on your side."
good,"Excellent company. Work/life balance difficult. Outstanding people, great work environment. Morgan Stanley sets their standards high for professionalism. Competitive work environment. Requires a lot of energy and focus in any role at Morgan Stanley."
good,My favorite part of MS is the people.  Our column of desks at work became like a family with everyone being very supportive and personable.  I'm not sure if all areas of the floor were like this but I sincerely liked the people I interacted on a day-to-day basis.
good,I find that with my experience the work is not a challenge; the co-workers are professional and courteous. Pay scale is medium especially working in California.
good,"Work life balance, good pay but very competitive environment. No job security exists. Culture is harsh due to US influence. Make progress quickly if you are skilled."
good,"There is job security if you are a full-time employee. If you are a contractor, management can get rid of your from the position with any prior notice. Large team."
good,Productive work environment. Opportunity to learn new technologies. Long hours expected along with responsibility. Support of critical systems required.
good,"Collegial atmosphere where everyone is happy and wiling to help others (no sharp elbows), but a lack of management and development 0f employees as well as an unwillingness to trust employees with doing even the smallest tasks is a downside."
good,"There are opportunities to grow and move to different departments, offices are nice, good location in Canary Wharf. I would definitely work here again."
good,"Working at Morgan Stanley has been a great experience overall & an opportunity that I will always be very grateful for. While the work is fast-paced & often complicated, the workplace culture and competent management allow for both team & personal growth."
good,"Opportunities are very limited in the fund administration space. There is not work life balance . Please check the unit you are interviewing for as the fund service unit is managed by Indians from Mumbai and tend to discriminate against women, Latinos and African Americans. They are very open about it."
good,Its a nice place to work at. People tend to come late and stay late in office. The office canteen is good and you can have nice food there. Management is stable and tires to invest in each employee.
good,"Great company to work for with many opportunities for development, career growth and mobility. Total compensation can be heavily improved for long tenured employees."
good,Very good. typically very busy work days and critical projects to handle depending on the department. Multiple opportunities to learn technically and functionally
good,Company is a good place to work. It had provided me with great work  ethnics and skills. I worked there for 11 years until I took sick. They can be family  Oriented with right department. I will ho back if I had the chance.
good,"In Wealth Management, the office atmosphere varies by your direct team members, location and the branch management. Management can push hard at time to meet certain metrics and recently there has been a push towards career development."
good,"My primary responsibility was to provide administrative support to a Global Head. This included scheduling calendars, overseeing various processes, travel arrangements, expense reports, correspondence, report preparation, supply ordering, filing, proofreading, organization chart updating, coordinating reports issued by co-workers, etc. While at Morgan Stanley, I grew as an admin and as a person. Overall, MS is a great place to work with an impeccable culture. The people really are quite exceptional."
good,"A typical work day consisted of talking to clients and assisting them in anyway possible.  We were the point of contact for all client related items.  I learned a lot from different financial advisors.  I learned about the bond markets, equity markets as well as mortgages/banking."
good,"Great place to work! I worked there for over twenty years in different positions, last position I held was as the Administrator for a young branch manager, who was very green!"
good,"Talented and hard-working co-workers, great informal and formal training, ample opportunities to rotate across teams and geographies, great track record and deal flow"
good,"Good place to work with lot of opportunities but no job security ,was given opportunity to move to US and did went over their was another good experience bilateral when moved back was not welcomed and was not given the opportunity to move in other team within Mumbai office"
good,"Good direction and overall culture, but like most large firms, job satisfaction varies greatly depending on the team."
good,Top firm with great technology.  Invested a lot of money in making sure technology was up to date.  Some of the most brightest people in their profession
good,Great culture but doesn't compensate their employees enough. Management encourages a better work life balance and implements policies that encourages that.
good,"However, contract-versus-full-time decisions don't seem to be made very intelligently by upper management."
good,Competitive work environment. Brandname recognition. Strong and competitive employees. Great location (midtown near times square). Room for improvement for Senior management. Too much politics.
good,good to place to work but i was joined as a contract employee as usual there will be difference between permanent and contract employee in all aspect overall good to company to work.
good,"VICE PRESIDENT AND SENIOR TRUST OFFICER"
good,"There are a lot of pressure to sell in this company, as a financial advisor you can make your own schedule and there is only metric for you - did you make your sales target."
good,"I enjoyed my time there but did not have the best relationship with my group manager and The micro management was a detriment.  I was given the opportunity to mentor and help where I could but was marginalized at times and unable to move up in or out of my group. "
good,"A typical day consists of meetings, trainings, prospecting. You learn a lot about communicating product value and lot of support and training and engaging at a high level. It's a supportive culture."
good,"I was straight out of college and had no idea what I wanted to do. My academic history earned me a spot there, however being a Financial Advisor was not what I wanted to do."
good,"I consulted at MS for several years in many departments and divisions.  The people are mostly amazing.  It's mostly a stimulating work environment.  I had great managers --- I was lucky -- not all managers were great.  The culture was competitive and clinical (friendly but very corporate).  The hardest part of my work was when I was asked to do tasks not within my skill set.  The days were long 8am - 6pm and frequently work from home and during the commute. "
good,Work can be stressful but I enjoyed my co workers some people were kinder than others. They aren't at least with me very clear about training. I was just throw into the fire.
good,"Morgan Stanley is a good company to work for.  The benefits offered are very good, associates start off with 4 weeks off.  The pay is not market value for employees that have been there a long time."
good,Company had a very large offshore model.  Most of the meetings and all planning events occurred early in the morning.  Because of this if there was anything that required immediate attention had to wait for the next day as it was off hours for offshore.
good,Working at Morgan Stanley was a great experience in my life.  The worst part was that I was there around 9/11 when the dynamic in the financial markets changed and they re-evaluated my division.  I would have loved to have stayed there longer if I could have.
good,"Gives great freedom to build your own book of business. "
good,"Deploying new infrastructure to the branches was the most challenging job. Ensuring they were educated on the products and resolving issues when we deployed was the most exciting work we did at the Branch's."
good,"Working in a new area within Morgan Stanley Mortgage Originations, a lot of moving parts. New Updates weekly to procedures and policies.  Since it is a new area there are many hurdles which they are overcoming."
good,"I started working in Newport Beach, CA and was able to transfer to the Denver, CO office. Strongly advised to get series licenses to open up continued opportunities. Most if not all positions require individuals to be licensed. Coming from an administrative/assistant background was helpful but not conducive to learning finance industry. Employer provides equal opportunity for gender, ethnicity, etc..."
good,"Its a great place to work. Will provide you with lot of opportunities and has a good work life balance."
good,"Workday was busy and moderately challenging. I learned about the financial markets earlier in my career, a little about how to navigate a large corporation later, but not as much as I would have liked to. Management was competent but cool and business-like for the most part. Culture was forced, cold. Career mobility was hardest part, most enjoyable part was getting to know certain people there."
good,"A manager can make all the difference.  When mine changed from someone who encouraged my personal and professional growth to someone who micro-managed everything I did, I began searching for a new opportunity."
good,"Communication at Morgan Stanely between departments seriously lacks. Major changes are made on a whim that throws everyone off. The firm seems to want to jump head first into new technology, however, they do not seem to give it proper testing before thrusting it on everyone."
good,"There are great opportunities to grow and learn, but you can end up on a team that sets unrealistic goals, which sets everyone up for failure."
good,Work at Morgan Stanley was fast paced and attention to details was a must.  The people were friendly and detail oriented.  Everything needed to be done in a timely manner with many deadlines in play.
good,A large part of wealth management is building your book. This requires you to network as well as cold call in order to obtain clients. The advisers I worked with described the first five years of this role as a grind and if you don't have a good group working with you then you probably won't make it.
good,"Tedious job taking calls all day and depending on callers attitude it could wear you down, but great managers tried making it worth it. Could get repetitive resolving same issues 30 times a day."
good,"Great Company , Competitive, Great place to grow. While I was only working as an Intern at Morgan Stanley, I can tell it would be place I would like to work for in the future"
good,"Typical day was staring at a computer waiting for work. Answering client calls and inquiries. Dealing with risk and trade processes. Culture was really fun, a lot of great young people. Definitely a resume booster and then lateral somewhere else."
good,"A place I looked forward to going to every morning"
good,"Overall, a well-managed company with a good culture. Well-respected and recognized place to work. Compensation very rewarding, but work/life balance lacking at times."
good,"When you worked hard you are not always rewarded right away. But with consistency and perseverance you will be rewarded with what you deserve. Communication is a big part of your success in whatever you do. Also, never be afraid to say what you need to make your job a success."
good,Been too long to post anything relevant to today but Morgan Stanley was a solid company with good fundamentals that needed to adapt quickly and was slow to move but seems to be in a good place now.
good,"Good firm and culture; enjoyed working with different teams globally. Management plays a good role in communicating strategy, building effective teams and developing people"
good,"I loved my job because it was challenging. However, the job was very demaning as is the culture at Morgan Stanley. I spent a lot of hours at work and rarely saw my friends and family. Management did not promote work life balance. However, the compensation is good, the company provides great benefits and they are several perks & discounts."
good,Morgan Stanley has a great culture and provides outlets for collaboration.  Tools for that collaboration need work.  Administrative Staff has very little chance for advancement.
good,"Since i'm a product manager I spend much of my day working with technology teams, QA and design teams focused on improving our client offerings. Lots of meetings."
good,"I enjoy my work very much, finding it both interesting and challenging. My colleagues are fantastic and the work/life balance is good. The only major issue is a lack of advancement opportunities."
good,"Morgan Stanley was a Great experience.  Morgan Stanley is a World leader in the Investment Banking Industry that stays on the cutting edge of every front. From technology to its caring of their employees welfare and benefit. I would recommend highly, if offered an opportunity to make a career at MS."
good,"The company is heavily based on month end work.  Long hours are to be expected during month ends which last about a couple of weeks, quarter ends which will last about a month and year ends which last an entire quarter.  Expect your time during the quieter periods to be spent on process improvement.  There is an insistence on cross training which offers great opportunities for career progression."
good,"The culture at Morgan Stanley is amazing, we are always encouraged to ask questions and clear all the doubts. If we face any problem we can approach any person without worrying about the hierarchy. It provides great work life balance, all the work is completed in the office itself. The company recognises talent and rewards it."
good,"The pay and benefits were excellent and the overall company was tremendous, but my specific team's culture is very toxic/difficult. The management style is focused around micro managing and pushing employees when it's unnecessary."
good,"Work is perfect, benefits are really good. but management has their vision and direction, but don't have the managerial charisma that one should have, due to which fails most of the times"
good,No room to grow. Salary is low compared to other firms. Some brokers supplement your pay. Good health benefits. Ample vacation and sick time. Great location and paid parking.
good,Good Place to work overall.  They are flexible and well located.  The office is run down and the compensation is below industry norms.
good,"Good culture, good risk control.  Great professionals as colleagues.  Good work life balance with flexible hours and no issues and proper support for daily operations both personally and profesionally"
good,"Requires dedication and hard work. Commute can be arduous over time."
good,"Morgan Stanley is a productive and fun place. Never a dull moment with the day to day interaction between peers and clients. One objective ""Service""."
good,Did not find anything special. They interviewed me in Sybase but I ended up doing DB2 and Teradata along with some Sybase. Laid off as a contractor in one day. Gave good severance when employed full time for only 11 months. Little job security..
good,Good place to work. Enjoy many people I work with. Still learning the job. Do not like working early morning hours though.
good,"Process clearance of Physical restricted securities. Liaison between DTC and custodians, and  clients.Pocess free receives. Review and approve Private securites"
good,"I enjoyed my 16 year career at Morgan Stanley.  I started as an entry person and have had opportunities to advance, which I took advantage of. I worked with 2 teams and clients to develop asset allocation plans.  I found myself good at and enjoying the research part of my job."
good,Work environment was professional. Typical day at work consisted of busy phone coverage; scheduling various client meetings 2-3 months out along with heavy travel arrangements. Co-workers contributed to a smooth workflow in assisting each other as a team.
good,"Good culture and privileged to work for good managers and a good team. Professional development is encouraged and depending on the team, there is work life balance."
good,"Interactions with multiple technology groups and businesses. The majority of the business is in New York, but a large amount of peers work in London and Asia Pac offices. Morgan Stanley technology provides many intuitive internally developed applications which provide significant user value and require attention when the user environment changes. There are a lot of good people there who have the same common interests, to provide a quality product."
good,"Deep culture sentiments taught to employees. "
good,"At Saxon, I assisted one of the top account executives in the company. The job entailed, dealing with brokers, and coordinating closings of Loans and underwriting the clients files. Unfortunately, the company closed."
good,"I worked there as an IT consultant therefore, I do not have much of a compensation/benefits. It was a great working experience and everyone I've worked with were willing to teach and help."
good,Great place to work for if you are looking to grow your financial domain knowledge but the work won't be challenging technically.
good,"I have over 2 years of qualitative experience in the Banking & Financial services sector primarily in Compliance - Anti Money Laundering and KYC, Trade Surveillance and Project Management spread over Capital Markets (Wealth Management, Broker - Dealer, Investment Management). ﻿"
good,"I have been working at Morgan Stanley full-time (More than 3 years)"
good,"This place was a good place to intern for over the summer, it helped with computer skills and taught me a little about the stock market. Co-workers were helpful and the typical day of work consisted of sitting in on meetings and note-taking."
good,"Morgan Stanley is a large company with a lot of opportunities to learn and grow professionally. On a typical day, I assist Financial Advisors with operational aspects and reporting and clients with questions and requests related to their account. My favorite part of the job is learning from some very bright people as well as opening new accounts and processing paperwork. The most challenging aspect is the inevitable large bureaucrat structure that can slow productivity."
good,"I spend the early morning and evening hours tweaking financial plans and keeping current on new advisor requirements such as online training. However, as a new advisor, the bulk of my time is spent prospecting. The most enjoyable part of the job is the needs analysis part of the sales process where I get to find out more about their relationship with wealth and how that aligns w/their goals. The most difficult part of the job has been the steep learning curve. Meeting performance expectations means working long hours and neglecting other areas of my life. I look forward to the work/life balance that I see the senior advisors enjoying now that they've built a solid practice."
good,"As a consultant working for Morgan Stanley in IT divisions, I worked with highly knowledgeable and skilled MS managers and MS employees.  In each instance all MS employees are highly knowledgeable in their field and willing to share their knowledge at any moment."
good,"financial modeling, drafting memorandums, helping to solve client problems"
good,"This company has a good culture and do take the buzz phrases seriously like ""Job Work/Life Balance"".  I would make sure you are aligned to a team that fits you and then it could be a good place to stay in the long run."
good,"At Morgan Stanley, I have very closely seen and learned how traders approach towards any macro themes developing in the market and how they position themselves to play it."
good,"Most of the task that you are given are remedial, but very important to the overall big picture but you are not given any credit. Its tough to stay motivated in that type of work enviorment"
good,I enjoyed working for this company and the people that I worked with. It was very stressful but self-rewarding at the same time.
good,Management lets you know what is expected and will provide you with the tools to succeed but a huge part of this business is taking it upon yourself to make your own business.  It isn't the right career for everyone.
good,The work culture at Morgan Stanley is its greatest asset in that it fosters hard word and exposes you to world class business performed at the high level with the utmost intergrity.
good,"Great place to work if want a career in IBD. Learnt financial valuations and deal execution even in the summer which are typicaly quieter. "
good,"Senior Account Rep Hours: 8:30 - 5:30 M-F"
good,"Morgan Stanley is an outstanding company. However, there is very little learning within the group (mine in particular and we have had a mass exodus),there are few opportunities to move forward within, unless you move externally which can give you a 15-20% raise. Co-workers can be childish and management picks their favorites and promotes them, even though they may not be doing the same amount of work."
good,Morgan Stanley has a great culture and incredible people to work with. In two years I have been given opportunities to advance and learn from extremely intelligent people who are always willing and receptive to help.
good,"I worked at Morgan Stanley for 8 years.  I started off as an Analyst Paralegal in the Levy and Garnishment Unit.  I was promoted to Manager two years later in 2007.  My Unit was supervised by one attorney.  Overseeing the Levy and Garnishment Unit came with a lot of risk as well as a voluminous flow of work day to day.  Legal correspondence was received from the Internal Revenue Service, various state tax departments, child support enforcement units and "
good,Great training program and support for obtaining securities licenses
good,I learned new skills and great place to work.  Worked with a great team that is filled with talented people that are ready and willing to share knowledge.
good,"In 2008, it was a different environment that what I imagine it to be today. It was a wealth management office that was growing its business. I met with a lot of prospective clients and saw some of the challenges of being a financial advisor."
good,Morgan Stanley is a solid company overall with many intelligent people. One must be careful about the manager they report into or life there can be very difficult.
good,Provides best in class open architecture platform in which to build a wealth management practice.
good,Morgan Stanley is a nice place to work at .Lot of applications are appropriately structured. Sate of art technologies  are available.
good,MS WM is a great place with huge resources. The downside is that most of the back office and HQ gigs are NOT in NYC.
good,"The hours can be long, but the tasks are always new and interesting.  You will learn something new everyday about the job at hand as well as corporations you are analyzing.  You are educated on how the US tax code can effect companies and people."
good,A typical work day includes a lot of interactions with your co-workers on solving the tasks at hands but there is also a big emphasis on working independently to come up with your own solutions and input. There is great work-life balance but very little opportunity to advance in the field of fraud. Management does not reward those who go above and beyond their role and consequently there is not a lot of morale to remain loyal and work harder.
good,Its a vast system and its great to be a part on big financial giants
good,"I enjoyed my time there and learned a lot. One thing they do best is the employee training, from presentation to proprietary system training they offered many classes and for the most part you could get the training you needed. Work differed from department to department but my supervisors were ll very good people and the culture as a whole rewards merit."
good,On a typical day I responded to regulatory inquires the firm received.
good,Beautiful office
good,"A typical day of work consisted of challenges. There was something to learn as well as knowledge to gain. From dealing with co-workers, management, and clients a day at work was always enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was sometimes being a manager to previous co-workers. Sometimes there were individuals that didn`t know how to seperate the two and it could get difficult. I enjoyed my team, managers and co-workers and the times we had together at potlucks."
good,I worked as a temp and thoroughly enjoyed my time there! The management made it wonderful to come to work every day!
good,"A typical day at work would consist of people traffic. I have learned a new software in computer. Co-workers were pleasant. The hardest part of the job was trying to figure out who was who with so many employees, since job was temporary. The most enjoyable part of the job was how friendly the employees were to me."
good,"Hours are long, you work with very smart people  and there is very much a team atmosphere. Company is not the same company I started with,  the is little job security as they outsource much of the work and compensation seems to be less every year."
good,"I was hired to run a large nationwide installation project.  Role was clearly defined and was provided with necessary resources to get the job done.  My mangers were very supportive.  Working between the vast number of departments was a little daunting and difficult to manage during the ramp up of the project.  Mostly because to the size of the company and the disruption my project was bringing to each location.  Overall, great experience while making a great salary.  Downfall was I was a paid consultant, not a MS staff employee.  This makes you an easy target when the bank industry gets a whiff of an economic slowdown or downturn.  I made it through one layoff, but the second one a few weeks later got me.  I was expected since I had successfully completed my project at this time."
good,"Work life balance difficult "
good,"MS puts clients first, focuses on employee conduct. Spends a lot of time and money protecting client assets and information. This protects the financial markets and shareholders as well."
good,"I am not comfortable begin forced to provide an on-line review."
good,Great place to enhance your technical and soft skills. Provides various platforms and competitive environment to come out of your comfort zone and learn.  Job security can be a concern.
good,"Working at Morgan Stanley teaches you to be sharp and collaborative. It is the most professional work environment I have ever been in."
good,"Great place to work, you get a lot of autonomy, but that also means if you're struggling you need to reach out to people for help and support. The squeaky wheel gets the grease as they say."
good,"Working as a Contractor at Morgan Stanley was one of the best jobs I've worked for. Hours were flexible, with overtime on occasion, the employees were nice and willing to work within available time constraints in order to provide the best quality to their clients."
good,"I worked for the largest wealth management complex in the country at Morgan Stanley and was very fortunate to be surrounded by very smart and thoughtful people.  The culture was competitive but fair.  The hardest part of the job was finding new affluent prospects to get in front of.  Management was approachable and fair.  I learned a great amount about capital markets, financial planning and investment portfolio management during my time at Morgan Stanley."
good,"a lot to learn and grow, however management drives most decisions that free flow of information. There are frequent 8am meetings in person and sometimes meetings impact the overall productivity"
good,"Morgan Stanley prides itself on its culture and provides a collaborative work environment. "
good,"Nice place to work, all depend on the team. However a lot of legacies technologies. They are always recreating the wheel and some people there need to update their knowledge in many areas."
good,There is an expectation to work as hard as possible. As an associate or analyst you are payed well. However if you move up the money does not equal the work put in. There is low work life balance depending on what team you are on.
good,Good place to advance your career. Great environment and culture.  Management always ready to help. Management encouraged all assistants to advance their career.
good,"Great work life balance"
good,"Strong leadership at middle to upper management level with a focus  on both team and individual growth"
good,"As a member of the legal compliance division, I worked with some of the best in the industry. Motivated, smart, and aspirational, are just a few words I would choose to describe them. "
good,The company is good. Management is very supportive and helpful. They encourage you to be proactive at your work. My VP is very approachable. No topic is off limit during your one on one's.
good,"There is little room for advancement and job security is not guaranteed because of the way the company is structured.  There are too many low-level managers who are in positions that they are not qualified for.  Positions are granted based on likeability and not expertise.  This does not help employees grow, in fact, it hinders the ones who are experienced because their opinions are not valued.  I found the hardest part of the job was transparency.  I constantly found myself searching for things I thought I should have been given.  The most enjoyable part was being able to work from home when necessary."
good,A productive work environment for staff and students . Administrative team is very supportive and encouraging. Administrative staff encourages personal growth.
good,"Great compensation, fun and productive working environment. Commute was rough in out of Manhattan. Great team culture and management was very supportive."
good,Morgan Stanley work environemnt is flexible with the option of remote work.  Medical insurance(200% company paid) and matching RRSP contribution and other benfits
good,"You should know a group of high net worth individuals and be good at cold calling before you start. Between National Do Not Call lists and company restricted lists, your network can dwindle down faster than you think."
good,"Morgan Stanley is a very good company to work as a computer programmer analyst, it has very good tools and software like Change man, Entertest and other tools"
good,I've worked for Morgan Stanley for several years and have watched the changes and now I believe it's time for me to explore other options that would allow me to utilize the skills I have learned.
good,It is good highly technical environment. Management is very flexible and accommodative. Just means business. very respectful. Only thing is it is demanding and work hours are routinely much longer.
good,Overall I like working for Morgan Stanley. In the past 7 years I worked in and interacted with various teams. Most of my colleagues are helpful and professional. The company has great culture which is emphasized and strengthened by the management all the time. Unfortunately salaries are getting really low compared to market rates if someone stay more than a couple of years.
good,"My over experience with Morgan Stanley has been very positive. They are very good at recognizing hard work and rewarding you for it. However, there's still some old mentality for promotion on tenure rather than exemplary performance. This can discourage folks and cause them to leave."
good,"I started Morgan Stanley when it was originally Dean Witter .  Initially it was a great company with excellent benefits and I definitely felt I  would retire here. In the early stages on my tenure there I moved around the different departments and I felt that there's a lot of growth potential .  After 911 things changed.  The culture, job security and the direction the financial industry was taking.  No longer I felt I would retire here.  "
good,Work life balance is very reasonable.  They care about their employees providing them great benefits.  Very fast paced and you have to be able to learn and figure things out independently; prep and training for your role is poor.  Lots of micromanagement with reporting.  Giving back to the underprivileged is mandatory.
good,"long hours, but good place to learn. get your salary negotiated at the start, it won't go up much after you've joined. expect 3 years between each promotion."
good,"Helps to be a lateral hire or be hired out of their summer intern class. As contract employee, received less salary than other co-workers and no benefits while doing equal or more work. Upward mobility can be limited, depending what team you end up on and who your manager is."
good,"A very challenging place to work, but has a great management team. The hardest part is getting all the licenses completed within the time frame and progressing through the associate program."
good,"I enjoyed working with people in the firm. They would do free lunches      "
good,"Investment banks are not known for furthering the lifestyle choices of their employees. They are about money."
good,After a very successful career in insurance sales and service for a very competitive company I decided to take a risk and change careers.  I got my security licenses and became a financial advisor in a three year competitive FAA program .  I did not make it the three years.  I feel I was not properly trained and was mislead on this opportunity.  I learned a lot and took my prior experience and new experience and moved on to retail banking (taking a banking position to get the retail experience).
good,This is a great company to work for with great values. It is a very Productive Culture and face paced days. I learned a lot of computer skills and hosted events and gained confidence.
good,"Despite the heavy meetings dynamic, very good and smart people at the firm. There appeared to be legitimate direction from management. The firm has maintained a top-tier status for a long time."
good,"It was a great place to establish and get to know your client's needs in order to help them achieve their financial goals, while being able to pursue your own."
good,Long hours but rewarding.  Good place to grow your career.  Supportive managers and a mostly friendly environment.  Opportunity to travel if you want to.
good,"Good benefits,  Bad Senior management.  Looks awesome on resume overall.  Some departments are better than others.  Must wear suit and tie every single day."
good,I am in a unique position therefore my review may not really apply to most who will read this.  There are opportunities that do not fit the usual advertised job descriptions which can be viewed as a positive.  Lots of training opportunites.  Overall good corporate culture.
good,"My typical day as an intern included reporting first thing to my supervisor and receiving my tasks for the day. "
good,"Not an exaggeration, The guy that hired me (by a phone interview) only spoke to me by phone, so we never developed a relationship. Work would have been 100x better if we had a face-to-face meeting at least at the beginning to define my role at the company. I had some successes, but floundered from time to time, since my idea of the position apparently differed from the undisclosed notions of the ""manager""."
good,No great perks.  Unless you want to be in management or a financial advisor there isnt much growth from Client Service Associate.  There is a lot of turnover in managment.
good,"Good and efficient infrastructure. "
good,"Provided client service for the firm's clients on behalf of 4 financial advisors. "
good,"I have spent most of my career working as a developer for investment banks. Having worked at multiple global investment banks, one area where Morgan Stanley stands out is quality of peers. I had a great time learning from my colleagues and supervisors here and would love to join back the firm at a later point of time"
good,"As far as jobs go, not bad and the pay was amazing, but management sucked, They Know nothing about the job and sit around getting paid to do nothing. Not surprised either."
good,Great place to challenge yourself by working with the best talents in the industry.   Overall firm culture is collaborative and driven to provide the best service to the clients.
good,"I worked with a certified Financial Planner as well as his assistant. I first learned the ropes of being an assistant as well as terminology I would use on a regular basis in the office. I came in in the mornings and began my routine work of checking emails, answering voice messages, and updating appointment dates & times. I learned what goes on behind the scenes of an advisor as well as hands-on what exactly an adviser does. I was able to sit in during meetings as well as prepare a presentation of my own."
good,Morgan stanley indeed a employee friendly company. Adhere to rules and regulations. Culturally enriched. One of best company in an industry to work with.
good,"It's a call center.  You will take a lot of calls, I don't have prior call center experience to compare to but for the most part everyone you work with and talk to are professional.   Don't expect any bonuses or perks and OT is offered sparingly.  Health benefits are probably some of the best I have ever seen."
good,"Great company to build resume and gain industry knowledge of several financial industries and opportunities to move internally. However, salary is not as competitive as other companies."
good,"I had enjoyed working there because of the other employees I had associated with. They were all way willing to shared information and knowledge. The environment was low keyed but quick paste, it can also be stressful."
good,"Morgan Stanley is one of the top Investment Banks on Wall Street and it shows with the individuals working withing their offices. My team had visionary management that expected a lot from his team. But the workforce was a bunch of bright minds and hard workers. This made the time there very enjoyable in both the successes the team had and the learning opportunities that existed, if the individual wants to seek them out."
good,"The complex management is terrible, but it's a great company with great values. The FAA program is very competitive, it's probably a better place to transition an existing book than to attempt to build one from scratch."
good,"I loved working with this company as I had very broad responsibilities. Never a dull moment.  I enjoyed learning all aspects of running a large office, handling customer service, employees, HR issues, technology, phone, security, etc."
good,"Very professional, business atmosphere. Good place to learn the financial markets and investing.  Extensive training for Series 7, Series 66 and all Insurance licensing."
good,"I like working at Morgan Stanley, the people and the technology are great to work with.  The people and culture are two awesome reasons why it's fun to come to work everyday."
good,Generally a great place to work. It can get political and you need to be able to navigate through and be vocal about your career advancement. It depends a lot on who is your manager.
good,"I enjoyed my tenure at MS. My coworkers were capable and management was engaged but not overbearing. This was in keeping with the corporate culture that demanded excellence, but supported the workers."
good,"Comfortable work environment"
good,"Allows for a work life balance or advancement, depending on what you want in a career. Ability to move to many different parts of Operations to keep general interest."
good,Day consisted of prospecting and closing.  Fast paced and competitive workplace.  The hardest part of the job is cold calling.  The most enjoyable part of the job is landing a new client.
good,Not a lot of opportunity for permanent employment.  I have worked in two departments.  Job experience was great.  Permanent employment not always in their fiscal budget.
good,"High Management turnover"
good,"The location I worked at was small, at the time and we were like family. Everyone seems to care about each other and I enjoyed my environment for the most part. I didn't have enough opportunity to advance in my career and the pay structure changed for the sales assistants, so I ended finding a higher paying job."
good,"One of the best Financial banks in India to work ."
good,not enough reps to handle call volume.  lots of overtime due to this.  not good training.  each person fills several roles.  seems to be a job not a career
good,"There is a disconnect between management and staff, but otherwise it is a great company to start with if you want to be in finance. they also need to work on their compensation packages."
good,Morgan Stanley hires a lot of contract employees because it is lower risk. This is when you really have to prove yourself. Friendly environment as long as you are always on top of your stuff
good,"Morgan Stanley for me was a great experience coming directly from college.  While most colleagues of mine did not stay with the firm long-term, the Morgan Stanley experience will prepare you well for future opportunities and successes."
good,"Whilst all organisations are trying to save money / reduce spend, my person experience was that the company looked at the long term when considering current spending. Also very focused on detailed recharging to allow Total Cost of Ownership to the end user."
good,"Person of contact to deal with multinational compensation plans."
good,"I worked  a short time in this company, unfortunately I cannot  provide a good review, But in general this is a very good company to work with a very good salary."
good,Competitive and fast-paced. Good culture overall. Sales targets are aggressive but reasonable. Good support. Terrific management.Overall a good experience.
good,Great team to work and learn new skills.  Team is very supportive of you.  Typical day would start with review of reports and conference calls with business and offshore location teams.  Enjoyable part is working on new projects and working with business.  Hardest part is to working on new projects with limited resources.
good,I started there in a training program with other fellow college graduates.  Excellent program that taught everything inluding how to dress professionally.  Great place to start a career.
good,"The hardest part of the job at MS is the working hours and constant work challenges given by the senior management to deliver on the job. However, the company has great working culture. The systems are great and I also love that and we get to work with one the best people in the market."
good,It was a great place to work very competitive environment. There were no 2 days alike it entailed working with doctors nurses techs and patients. I had a huge staff of employees all with different personalities and union that used those traits to abuse the expectations.
good,"Great workplace, with talented people around you, where you can learn a lot. Only real challenge is to organize meetings with New York colleagues due to the different time zones among offices."
good,Great work culture. Management is dedicated to your success. Great work life balance. Big company so there is opportunity for growth. Encouraged to seek out people and opportunities to advance career growth.
good,Good motivated people. Work hard and you'll get noticed and rewarded. I recommend. They take care of you if you show effort.
good,Mailroom associate.Operated large letter and envelope system. Great boss. New learning curve. Typical corporate America with no job security.
good,"You must make it known that you want to get ahead to get ahead.  I have not witnessed where managers step forward to help a career.  They will do things for the benefit of the shareholder, nit necessarily for client or employee.  Communication is limited.  It is a standard kind of existence with very little innovation, it seems like they are just hoping not to get sued."
good,The role was quite challenging and also a good scope for opportunities and career development. Friendly atmosphere and all the colleagues are friendly. The top management guys are also helpful with their feed backs and all at relevant times.
good,Management was great and every one was very friendly around the office. I was impressed on how well management ran the office setting
good,"I enjoy the world of Investment Banking.  Over the years I have gained so much knowledge in the Brokerage field. To and excel in this type of industry, you must have the willingness to learn, and accept change.  There is no ""typical"" day, each day can bring new challenges, from client deposits to changing policies and procedures."
good,not to hectic can sometimes be a little overwhelming but very good work place.just was let go with no warning or anything.
good,Great work environment that allows for growth in ones career. Colleagues are capable and friendly. Downside is that management needs to provide better structure for the operations department in order to allow for a smoother and more efficient overall process.
good,Right now the firm is contracting their FA's. The culture and infrastructure is a little too NY to adapt to unique environments like DFW. The management and people are great to work with.
good,The mutual fund distribution channel is a start up still trying to find their way in the business. Some days can be very frustrating but the potential for good things is there.
good,"Very professional and result driven work environment."
good,"Typical day consisted of project planning, and executing tasks for  branch office moves,expansion, downsizing, and renovations. I hosted 3 conference calls a week, on average, to coordinate IT portion of branch projects. Certain projects would require travel to job sites. Working virtual in my home office, and having Blackberry required me to be available to stakeholders to address issues."
good,Learned how to deal effectively with very demanding clients.  Learn how to monitor the financial markets and make solid recommendation to clients. I really enjoyed the work environment and my associations with my fellow advisors.
good,great technology infrastructure (definitely missed it after leaving for a smaller company) - many people with lots of technical experience that are more than willing to answer questions and help out! - excellent training program for new grads (this is really a great experience and you get to meet and work with people from around the world) - related to previous point: the company is massive and it's exciting working
good,I enjoyed working at Morgan Stanley.  I was recruited by my division head who I worked for previously at Credit Suisse.  We have and still have a strong relationship which made working for him easy even under extreme conditions.  I had to relocate to Seattle for family reason.
good,This was my first corporate job and I was amazed how structured and organized it was. I was able to sharpen my computer skills. See how meeting are conducted and how the company operates.
good,"Typical Day involves answering incoming phone calls from Financial Advisors and Client Service Associates."
good,"I really enjoyed working here. The people were wonderful. The management gave you excellent opportunities, allowed you to learn various jobs."
good,This was an overall good company to work for. The management was great. The market was not good at the time I started working there though. They do invest in the people that work for them.
good,"Morgan Stanley is great company to gain experience. If you are starter and looking for experience, I would say go with Morgan Stanley."
good,"Awesome work environment, great co-workers/team, room for advancement is limited to the departments, a lot of learning opportunities"
good,"1. good experience to start with"
good,Great company to work around. Nice professional environment. great team worker and working environment. Fun place to work around
good,"Morgan Stanley has an excellent program for training new and upcoming financial advisors, however the industry at this time is very hard to enter into if a prior career and network has not already been established. The support that Morgan Stanley offers is impeccable and I highly recommend them if looking to enter into the Financial Advising industry."
good,I have learned alot of new things at this job and look forward to staying long term
good,Review of existing files and tape data for purchase of loans.
good,I learned a great deal and worked with a diverse set of individuals. Answering calls and heavy calendaring was a typical day. Compensation could have been better. A lack of decent raises over the past few years was due to the economic downturn as was the case with similar companies in the industry. The company encourages you to incorporate challenges in your career. Overall the work-life balance and benefits was excellent.
good,"good day of work, good people, management is weak"
good,"Good place to start a career, but limited growth potential unless you join a team. Good compliance measures in place."
good,"There is no typical day in DCM, there are several task that you have to do usually, but you have to learn to prioritize as you never know if its going to be a calm day or a non-stop day. Task in DCM include pitching, doing presentations, following the markets, sending relevant information to clients, coordinating with other divisions or analyzing data."
good,"Overall, MS is a great place to launch a career in financial services!"
good,"A typical day would be manage and assigning approximately 250-500 incoming emails to various team members. Liaise with claims team located in Glasgow regarding risk global risk. Supervise the Hybrid products process consisting of continually increasing number of  products. Create various reports including BD trade failures, Baltimore account balancing and email activity.Perform various ad hoc projects including validating failing trades and dividend reinvestment and train new analyst and temporary employees various dividend processes. I have learned to multitask at a very high pace, work efficiently under pressure, use time management and importance to organize task throughout the day and to lead by and teach by example. My co- workers are learning and becoming stronger members of the team daily. We work as a team to bring down risk and keep clients happy by close of business each day. The hardest part of the job is the hours spent as I begin work at 8AM and close at 6PM. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning an existing process and modifying the process to make it easier and less time consuming for future employees."
good,"Morgan Stanley is a fast paced work environment. On any day I would; approve all money movement coming in and out of the firm, assist the financial advisors, and ensure a smooth work flow."
good,"I am the man of many hats...with one goal....Excellence"
good,It was rewarding working for a successful brokerage firm.  The environment was fast paced and always interesting and challenging.
good,The working environment was casual and enjoyable. The compensation seemed fair to what was offered in the industry. However the financial industry is volatile and the whole department was moved to New Jersey from Houston where I worked. I heard years later that it ended up moving back to Houston.
good,"Quick paced atmosphere with high productivity,"
good,"My first exposure to the brokerage industry. Very fast paced, but it provided tons of training."
good,"Great place to work, learned a lot, work life balance is great."
good,"Had really good health benefits."
good,"create all investment and financial planning proposals, asset allocation and rebalancing of $200 million portfolio. Investment analysis and research. Sales support."
good,"At the beginning of the day, I would start by servicing my current clients. Later, I would do research and analysis of the current financial market state and would try to relate it to my clients goals and needs. Later, I would cold call to try to meet potential clients. Afternoons, I would meet with potential clients from cold calling and networking."
good,"I learned a great deal from my senior coworkers and managers, who had a lot of business knowledge and how things work in the market. I enjoyed the client interaction, although that was challenging as well as I was a fledgling at the time."
good,Morgon Stanley prides itself in hiring the best of the best and it was evident in the corporate services department. I worked with very talented and dedicated people.
good,"MS has a great culture and great people, but we have recently hit a rough patch for our business model that is effecting me financially and my growth potential."
good,"As a consultant, my duties are to lead an offshore group of 3 - 5 QA Analsts with the QA Validation of the mission-critical applications. In this role, I have to participate or facilitate many conference calls. Management is very supportive and gives me the independence to lead the project freely. My co-workers are cordial and helpful. The hardest part of the job is the communication. With all of the staff being off-site, it is important to ensure communication is clear and concise to ensure the target dates are not missed. The most enjoyable part of the day is when you have completed your tasks on time to ensure the timeline are met. That truly makes my day!"
good,A very nice place to work for but it wreaks havoc on your work/life balance. The job is challenging and there is never a dull moment.
good,Morgan Stanley gives you alot in terms of being able to learn and to advance for the right motivated people
good,Plenty of oppurtunoty. Less micromanagment and was to work independently.
good,Well educated management
good,"There was no typical day being in the financial world of business, everyday was a different day. I learned how the financial world works, and how important investing is plus all the different investments that are available. I had wonderful co-workers and we all worked as one team helping each other out. The hardest part of the job was calming clients down when the market did not perform as expected. The best part of the job was talking to and fulfilling our clients needs."
good,The people I work with are always willing to assist with any questions and I was able to lear a lot about the finance industry. I preform technical support to clients and I love being able to help them learn about the different tools offered on the web site.
good,"The manager gives you maximun freedom to grow your own business within the SEC guildlines. Most colleagues are firendly and helpful, the company strive to be the leader of the tindustry"
good,"A typical day started with an early market analyst call followed by a sales meeting. Then, it was taking care of pending client needs following by prospecting calls. Marketing follow-up came next followed by more prospecting calls later in the evening. The co-workers and managers were great. The hardest part of the job was building a client base through cold-calling. The most enjoyable was the encouragement among all of the co-workers."
good,Smart and Nice people to work with The advancement opportunities are there with hard work and good timing
good,Enjoyed working for quite a reputable company. The culture and atmosphere was great.
good,• Responsible for organizing the Castle Parr Team & James Group Team
good,The culture at Morgan Stanley speaks for itself. I have been at this firm for several years and have only positive things to say. It encourages hard workers and good performers. People are constantly around to nurture and support you.
good,"Significantly advanced my knowledge of financial assets, working under pressure, better understanding financial management."
good,"Though people often see my job as stressful and important, Morgan Stanley can be calm at times. Just a few months on the job I had already learned much more than I could ever imagine. Being promoted so shortly was also very encouraging. By taking on this position, I know now that I want to continue my career in a fast-paced business environment."
good,Great company to start fresh out of college. Many opportunities for advancement.
good,"I guess I liked the people, the jobs I held, and the culture enough to stay with the firm through all the mergers and name changes, 24 years overall. I am now looking for a new company rack to hang my hat on."
good,The salary is not the best across the firm. But there is a great work-life balance and growth opportunities. People and culture of the company is very welcoming.
good,Strong company with resources best suited to sales-oriented personalities.  Culture is supportive and management is aligned with interests of the financial advisors.
good,"every day was was different, never new what to expect, our group was always problem solving, i worked autonomously, always updating management of outstanding and new issue, family oriented atmosphere.  hardest part of the job was waiting for our tech group to fix the issues being reported, most enjoyable part was testing the fixes our tech group made to assure accuracy of their fixes."
good,always a campaign to give back to the community. provides a nice working environment. good benefits. lots of smart and experienced professionals around you.
good,"Good Place to work at with Investment banking domain and learning curves are high and good."
good,Takes a lot of technical experience with computers and software pertaining to computers. Having an actual degree in computer programming would be major for this job.
good,No big complaints about working here. Was a contractor so can not speak to the FT experience. most of the time things were fine most of my complaints were of a personal nature
good,"Morgan Stanley provided me with many opportunities for career growth,"
good,Morgan Stanley is the name of the game. Reputation is unparalleled. Lots of really smart people in those offices. Top notch training and resources available.
good,"You will need to show up eager and ready to learn.  Work ethic is a key driver to success at the firm.  Keep your head up because there will be challenging times.  But, it's an excellent firm to sharpen your skills and given the right opportunities could be the ideal destination for both the young and seasoned pro."
good,I currently consult at Morgan Stanley and found it a great place to advance yourself and have a work/life balance.  Would heavily recommend the company.
good,Morgan Stanley as a whole is a great place to work.  I think it varies from department to department but for much of my experience there the management was inspiring and I was managed well.  There focus on people is at the forefront but I would say it is slightly incongruous at times.   Working on committees such as the Operations Expo and the People Committees have really given me new focus.  It is part of what is driving me to look for a new opportunity.
good,"Morgan Stanley is a very good place to work. Smart and determined people, interesting problems, excellent management and generally fun to work at. I recommend Morgan Stanley."
good,"Dream job any one can have. Excellent work culture."
good,"Morgan Stanley clearly believes in investing in their employees; they provide great benefits, above par training, and flexible work schedules. Leadership overall is great, I thought highly of all the managers at my branch. Nonetheless a handful of individuals on the leadership team seem far too focused on a facade around maintaining a benchmark. Also like any large company, there seems to be some miscommunication between employees at a branch and leadership.  The company is trying to carve the right path, that can sometimes be frustrating for some, specifically when there's conflicting rules with past company habits... yet I believe this is always preferred to a company that is stagnant."
good,Working at Morgan Stanley is not always easy but it also comes with significant benefits. Great place to start your career as the opportunity for licensing and overall advancement is significant.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time working here. The Firm consists of great people, with a good work ethic, which ultimately results in an excellent culture."
good,"A great company to work for - very diverse in people, culture and talent. Equal opportunity for everyone to innovate, implement ideas and think like an owner."
good,"Morgan Stanley stands by its core values;"
good,Advancement as an administrative assistant is very possible.  Must obtained required licenses and show loyalty and dedication to the position.  Ability to work with a team and by yourself is a plus.  Taking the initiative to problem solve is a big plus.
good,"Certain areas are better than others (particularly in the front office where resources are focused), but overall an enjoyable environment for a classic 'big bank'. Working in the HQ office as opposed to some of the satellite cities like Baltimore also has its advantages. More resources (classes, on site amenities etc...) are focused in the HQ building."
good,"Morgan Stanley is a stable company and does provide a measure of job security, work is challenging and rewarding. In my present role I manage a team of payment processors. There is risk involved with this role so I help with approvals along with managing the team. I've learned a great deal about being a manager and how to provide white glove customer service to our clients. I've learned a lot about myself along the way. The culture is what you would imaging for a typical call center. Morgan Stanley does it's best to protect and give their customer high customer service. It's great to be able to care for their participant's financial security."
good,"Good place to work. I liked it...it was fine. Good culture, good benefits, good management, work/life balance was fine. I really don't have more to say about it."
good,"Great culture but must manage your own career advancement. Also compensation is low compared to other banks."
good,"MS is an excellent place to work, and I have enjoyed my time with the company. It's clear that I am not alone in that sentiment, since I have many colleagues that have been with the firm for 20+ years. The firm can seem extremely large at times, which can make getting things done difficult. However, there is a culture of partnership that permeates the business and drives the firms success."
good,Overall a good company. Management is not bad but pay is not as much as other smaller shops.  Met a lot of great people and professionals there.  Give it a try for a several years then move on to other companies.
good,"Fast Past moving company, very competitive environment. Quick and fast company changes. Constantly growing. Room for growth once you have completed atleast one year"
good,The day is intense a good deal of challenges and a good team there to assist. The process is manual around the products supported. A good deal of work is happening to improve the situation. Which will overal fix job work life balance. It will also help reduce client and finacial risk.
good,I like working at morgan Stanely but the commute was very long.  I had two small children and although I worked their 12 years it was a hardship for my children.
good,Worked my way up through the company to the top person in my training class out of almost 1000 people. Went on to achieve many advancements and recognition achievements. Was a top 10 or 5% earner each year at the company earing significant bonuses as well.
good,"Ever changing environment, extremely self directed. Enjoyed the entrepreneurial lifestyle. Appreciated the ""sky is the limit"" mentally of the firm, however, very difficult career."
good,Good exposure to senior management and pro-active approach to dealing with issues and queries. Working with smart people and learned more about the industry and other aspects.
good,Interesting workplace culture.  The most enjoyable part of the job were my teammates. The hardest part of the job was being different and standing out.
good,"Fantastic opportunities offered and plenty of extra-curricular events to attend if the demanding workload does not hinder attendance, great location to work."
good,"I tenure at Morgan Stanley is not very long. So I comments maybe biased. According to my experience, the "
good,"By far the most relevant company in my career. Despite the high pressured environment, the company provided the tools needed to achieve all objectives, which turned into performance rewards."
good,Overall good management and people but can be political. A lot of intelligent people working there. Strong culture. Big on the values. Overall very good experience.
good,"Work life balance - 4/5"
good,"It was a temporary position. Manager was moving to another company. Roles were pending to be assigned."
good,"Its a highly process driven organisation. Since its a IB, it is highly regulated. The work culture is good with good opportunity to learn.Flexibility is something which is missing in MS. The hardest part of the JOB is the many regional approvals that you have to take at every step of the work which makes you feel lack of empowerment."
good,"There are several great projects at Morgan Stanley however, there are also teams where the work is mostly focused on bug fixes and maintenance. The management of tech side could be better."
good,"Flexible as far as work/life-style balance.  Work hours are flexible, and management advocates the work/life-style environment.  No negative comments regarding management."
good,"I don't have a review of the company at this moment.  At the appropiate time I will write a full review of my experience working for Morgan Stanley"
good,"I was contracted as a business analyst doing back office work for the wealth management division. I was probably a little underpaid but the work I did was ok, the time for completing the work was reasonable. I was probably in a more laid back area than in other parts in the company. I would recommend working there though because the people are nice and the company is very prestigious within its industry."
good,"Great place to work,fun co workers and great oppurtunities for career advancement if you are strong enough to handme it but overall its a great place."
good,"Verdadero trabajo en Equipo, Competitividad sana, accesibilidad abierta a la alta gerencia, excelente experiencia de trabajo para quien tiene la oportunidad de ser parte de este equipo."
good,"Great manager, tough to succeed as a young advisor. Seasoned advisors help little, goals are extremely hard to reach. Not a lot of help from complex employees"
good,"You're encourage to do your best and the exceptions on EEs is very, very high. Very healthy competitive culture among colleagues. Great place for interns versus experienced."
good,"The hardest part of the job is supporting over a handful of people. The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships you build with your managers. It is a very family oriented enviroment and although it is a busy department, family does come first and that is understood and accepted."
good,Lots of projects and constant growth of your knowledge. Opportunities are good.People are really helpful and you can express of what you feel is wrong freely
good,"In general, managers are supportive of working staff and do well at backing up their teams.  Strong culture which is being periodically reinforced.  Big emphasis on doing the right thing."
good,As a part of Multinational Investment Bank the hardest part is the cultural barrier but the employee oversight makes it easier plus the management support. The culture the company thrives on Diversity is appreciated & scope of learning across region professionally& personally (Culture) is always there & it makes day to day easier 7 worth learning.
good,"Morgan Stanley is a good place to work, no complaints with the office.  The pay and benefits are pretty standard for the area and comparable positions `"
good,"Working private wealth management is not for everyone, but if you're one of them, there is nothing to dislike about this office.  The people are great - extremely friendly and helpful - and the view is unbelievable."
good,"A lot of moving parts with a lot of stakeholders. If you can navigate this there are plenty of opportunities to work on cutting edge projects and progress."
good,"Morgan Stanley is a very professional and intellectual organization. Everyone there works very hard however, the environment also can be competitive which is a good thing if controlled by management."
good,"The compensation of the company is really good, but it is expected to work really long hours everyday and sometimes weekends. Very high work intensity, and very strong problem solving skills are required"
good,It was a great company to start up a career in financial advising. I would recommend them to anybody.   Very nice support staff and beautiful office space!
good,"Allow several breaks between. Great lounging areas. Management always approachable friendly work environment. You were allowed to get breakfast enjoy it and then start your day, I learned so much from MS. I truly appreciated my experience with the company. Management was very friendly and approachable. The hardest part of the job was trying to find space to file paper work since I liked to always keep a paper trail,  The enjoyable part of the job for me was finding a discrepancy. Closing pout the date with a zero balance."
good,"Financial call center. Monday to Friday 8-5. Half an hour for ""lunch"" and two 15 minute breaks is all you get away from the phone. You will sit plugged into a phone for 8 hours and answer questions, that's it."
good,"If you want to be a full-time employee, this is a good place to start your career. With a global working environment and internal mobility program, you get chances to improve your professional skills and work across different teams."
good,"I worked in this place as a consultant through a third party.  The work experience was conducive for learning new skills to build teamwork and the ability to compete in the job market as a whole.,"
good,I enjoyed the training and the time spent at the former World Trade Center.  I learned a lot about trading stocks and business development.  If you have a good network of wealthy friends even better.
good,It can be a very rewarding career if you are willing and able to devote a great deal of time and effort into establishing your client base. It is also extremely necessary to continue to build on that base at all times.
good,"Entrepreneurial environment.  Good management."
good,"Morgan Stanley offers a very welcoming environment consisting of a friendly, collaborative staff. Together we are productive and energetic. We can go from being immersed in our work one minute to joking around the next."
good,"Typical day is to go into work, sit at my computer and work independently (potentially reach out to our counterpart abroad) or use the Bloomberg terminal to do research, attend some meetings, and then go home."
good,"great management but the requirements are very stiff"
good,"Bank (trading as Barclays, formerly Barclays Capital or BarCap) is the investment banking division of the British multinational Barclays bank headquartered in London. It provides financing and risk management services to large companies, institutions and government clients. It is a primary dealer in U.S. Treasury securities and various European"
good,"Morgan Stanleys TIR division provides an excellent collaborative and challenging work environment where problem solving is a highly rated skill.  In terms of technical and functional content, Morgan Stanley is easily on the bleeding edge of adoption of advance security practices and this mkes it an excellent place to work and learn."
good,"I've heard people complain about their workplace and going to work. Not me, I actually loved it. My motto was to my colleagues and clients ""if its not fun, then  its work"".  I had the luxury of going to the gym before I started my shift, sitting at my desk with tea, and checking my emails, as i prioritze my day. Some days were much busier than others, where I couldnt have my tea or sort thru emails. I had to prepare time sensitive new hire packages for our London office. My manager and colleagues were very supportive and were able to assist when available. We backed each other up on several days. I believe the hardest part of the job was leaving."
good,This was very quire working place and also the professionalism was very good. All the employees were too supportive and helpful in daily works. Over all great place to work.
good,"I really enjoyed working here! It was pretty fast paced which I liked and was expecting. The overall morale of some of the older FAs was down because of a lot of the new government changes in how Firms would do business in regards to retirement planning etc. etc. Sometimes you got the feeling that some FAs had no interest in the Firm or their roles. "
good,"I wanted to develop into a large organisation with added financial and regulatory responsibilities. I found Morgan Stanley the perfect fruit."

good,"Very supportive management however compensation could be better and ever since they went to the branch complex model, opportunities for advancement are limited."
good,"My team deals with all of the trade bookings, reallocations and acts as a liaison between the client and us. We execute and clear trades on dual platform, meaning we can execute trade with Morgan Stanley and/or Dean Witter.  My co workers are very friendly, always willing to lend a helping hand when needed. Hardest part of the job is to stay afloat of incoming emails, since we deal with dual platforms. The most enjoyable part of my job is flexibity and upward mobitity."
good,AtoS provides a technologically challenging environment. Lots of opportunities to be discovered and can be worked upon.

Was admired by my team, but unable to acquire full-time position... or even a professional response from the hiring manager."
good,The hardest part of the job was waiting for more work to do. I am an employee who loves a challenge and projects. I found that many of the systems in place were dated and that we were overstaffed much of the time as many of the employees had time to browse the internet and take extended breaks.
good,Both the Baltimore and New York environments are similar in that the energy levels are high. The company encourages that employees act like owners.

good,"I think the bank stumbled well before the financial crisis taking a lemming-like approach to its balance sheet and earnings. I think it is better now but it might still have a ""me-too"" culture at the top, looking over its shoulder at Goldman and JPMorgan instead of thinking for itself."
good,"1. Busy long days"
good,"*Arrive early before others to get a head-start on assignments "
good,There is no such thing as a typical day at work when it comes to Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.  You do not know what kind of question you will receive from the employee.

I also was able to understand the value of client service excellence and how to master process efficiency. For the most part, my co-workers were recent college graduates, however upper management were highly experience and knowledgeable industry leaders. The hardest part of the job being able to handle multiple tasks at once and meeting tight deadlines. Although challenging, it brought out my work ethic and enabled me distinguish myself amongst my co-workers."

The culture was decent. Lots of team happy hours and christmas party every year. The management team was a little out of touch with their associates but they did their best. The hardest part about the job was just making sure to not make mistakes in judgement when approving wire transfers overseas, large item purchases or suspicious money movement."

good,This was my first experience in the workforce and the environment and culture revolved around the stock market and getting things done. Co-workers are friendly and will answer questions.

I worked under a very experienced manager who exposed me to various aspects of his day-to-day job. A typical day for me consisted of assisting the private wealth management team in molding investment portfolios for various clients. Generating these asset management models required in-depth MorningStar reports that my manager would have me organize. This research involved extensive equity research related to the stocks and mutual funds provided to me by my manager. Ultimately, I would sit down with him and discuss the grouping of equities and organize those that he would eventually implement into his clients portfolio. This process served as my main source of work throughout my time at the office. Through the process, I was able to glean a considerable sense of what it took to fully evaluate a company's financial statements as well as using market information for investment advice. Generally speaking, the office environment was very welcoming. I was surrounded by experienced individuals who were more than glad to answer any of my questions and assist me in my work."

Furthermore, I have designed and implemented development programs for managers, professional development initiatives, and managed various global processes, such as talent ranking and promotion."
good,"I was a consultant at Morgan for about 9 months and found it to be a good place to work.  One particular positive thing that struck me was the public recognition of people who had received a promotion.  The executive in charge of our area actually gathered the entire group in a common area and announced each person, their new title and said a few words about each of them and their contributions.  I thought that was a great individual touch for such a large firm."
good,"Work culture is very standardized and it's easy to adapt. We feel more flexible, We can learn how professional to be in the workplace."
good,Worked there many years in good economic times and bad. CEO did what needed to do to stabilize company post financial crisis but is not yet paying employees what they deserve. Also no loyalty to employees that have been there.
good,Learned all my skills on the job. Culture accepting of taking vacation. Didn't have to work weekends and hours were intense but still decent work life balance.
good,Overall I am grateful to be working for Morgan Stanley. I am proud of what we do and how we do it. Hardest part of my job is the micromanaging.

My supervisor and boss in the McLean, VA office were very nice but with their super busy schedules, it can be difficult to ask for their assistance and guidance at times. It is definitely a very independent type of work-style in that everything is basically self-taught and learned through trail-and-error and experience. There is practically free-food lying around all day long that were leftover from meetings prior so lunch is pretty much free for most days and accomodies are also very nice. Speaking of meetings, they take place virtually daily so be prepared to sit through both long and short meetings everyday since they act as a form of teaching you how to go about doing your work. Most of the meetings are hard to understand if you are just a novice in the financial-advisory field so you must take a lot of notes and listen diligently but otherwise, most of the time everyone is doing their own work whether it's studying for certification tests of client-meetings and other related tasks.

We had a great relationship with our clients. I learned a great deal about the stock industry and everyday was something different that I had to learn. The hardest part of my job was dealing with advisors that weren't that great at communicating.

Co-workers and brokers were very respectful. The hardest part of my job was constantly being needed, I was able to make a decision or come up with resolutions quickly, so all you here is my name over the PA system.

As challenging as it may be on many different levels, the company strives to produce value for its clients and it's employees.

For a person who hasn't been involved in any type of testing for an extended period of time, this can be very intimidating and full of pressure. Definitely a job for everyone."

Also frustrating because some of the people we support were not very nice. They demanded action right away, when standard procedure was hours or end of day to have a request completed. The people I worked alongside with were very nice. A lot of the day we spend bantering at our desks as it would lighten the tension a bit. We were always professional but light hearted. Upper management understood and supported all of us in our endeavors. Good work was acknowledged often.

The management teams are extremely knowledgeable and always willing to lend a hand when needed. I have learned so much in my time with the firm from an accounting and financial perspective, but also from a professional viewpoint.  I have learned how to take a step back and look at a process to be able to look for was to enhance how things are done today.  Over the course of my career here, I have learned many essential skills that one would need to advance my career.  I have been involved with client invoicing and understanding all the business impact for different products and lines of businesses.  I have been exposed to the expenses paid to internal and external parties that market our funds to investors.  I have become an important part to our teams that generate our forecasts for the future and profitability of our products and services because I now understand how the revenues are offset by our expenses to determine what the firm is actually earning from one product to the next.  The hardest part of the job is understanding who provides all the information we use to complete our responsibilities.  There are a number of teams such as client services,"

good,"Overall Morgan Stanley is a great place to work.  However, there is an area of concern that should be pointed out.  My concern is that management asks for you ideas, but when it comes to it, they don't want to hear them.  In in some cases and I speak from experience, providing areas of improvement will get you a bad branding.  When you shine the light on troubled areas and provide solutions from experience, most companies appreciate this.  At MS, not so much.  If presented at the wrong moment, even if it's needed at that time, you can be looked upon in a negative light for rocking the boat.  This was what happened in my case.  A few months later, higher management wondered what was happening an my manager took everything I had provided and used it in his presentation, which garnered him favorable reviews, all the while I was blacklisted."

Established new accounts for new Financial advisors coming in from other locations, including sending out proper documentation, getting to know the new Financail Advisors in order to better service there needs while servicing other Financial Advisors with orders, meeting clients, closing on Morgtagae loans.

good,"The people who work hard are kept on, but those who may have issues (be it family or otherwise) that impact their annual rating will be let go very quickly. The culture is great and the people tend to be nice, but upper level management have their own goals about how things should be run and that can have an impact on your day to day. All that said, they do give you the tools to succeed and invest in their employees. It is a good place to work even though their pay is not fantastic, the environment makes up for it."

good,"Typical work day consisted of working remotely and waiting on answers from headquarters.  I learned a number of things about their products as they related to trading.  The management personnel were very good at their jobs, but extremely busy thus causing unusual wait time.  My team members were well trained, but a lot of times seemed unaware of the project requirements.  The most difficult part of this project was the wait time for answers.  I did enjoy meeting people from various locations throughout the country and off-shore."
good,I was able to see what the work force was going to offer on an average day. They trained me to do daily tasks to stay productive and helpful to the team. It was an excellent experience for a graduating high school senior and I am thankful for the opportunity.

The platform the company provides is unparalleled for those who venture boldly in their careers."
good,"Good culture and relationships between management and employees"
good,Great place to work but a little far from the metro. Lots of great benefits. Nice cafeteria but lacking options for employees. Lots of restaurants around the area

good,"The people are not just intelligent (the norm for Wall Street), but grounded and kind-hearted, as a rule.  The company culture is excellent and people really value the ""Always give back"" (one of the four core values on the sign in the lobby).  They actually live what's in the manual.  That said, the hours and pressure are fairly high (it is a top investment bank) to some people, but I enjoyed my time there immensely and would definitely return on a project or permanently."
good,My internship at Morgan Stanley was a great experience that gave me exposure to the Wealth Management side of the firm. A typical day on the job consisted of completing various tasks for the Brokers.

The odds of finding a new client with a scripted message is highly unlikely. Great resume booster though."

good,"Typical day involves processing requests from branches across the nation, data entry, processing, analysis and problem resolution.  Management does NOT micro-manage, they treat you like adults.  Hardest part of the job was training, their training program needs a major overhaul.  Great people to work for/with!"

The management was great and easy going, the job balance was steady so you rarely got swamped. The location was great with Downtown Brooklyn really on the rise. I still have great relationships with the co workers I had while working there. A typical day at work was coming in and doing the treasury report for my supervisor, then at lunch putting together the SPO's and getting them authorized by two levels of management, and then my day to day job was working with up to 30 clients per month making sure the fails charge that we had with them for each month matched up with there's. If they did not then we would go back and forth until it was figured out."
good,Requires hard work and dedication but will be reworded with advancement and monetarily if deserved.  The hardest part of the job is the hours and stress that comes with the dedication.

good,"Morgan Stanley Smith Barney is an excellent company to work for. The company itself can't be responsible for how people in the workplace choose to act. Like any where you work you're going to find people that choose to make the environment hard for everybody. The company took very good care of me, and upper managment worked to ensure that every person felt a part of the team and not an outsider. That's intelligent management. Hard to review Job Security and Advancement in these times. There was also a tremendous effort by the company and it's management to ensure a work/life balance for its employees.

If you fail the exams, you're terminated, no questions asked. I made it through several but as some of you know, these securities exams are no joke. Unfortunately I failed one and I was no exception. For this reason, job security is probably 1 star for this position. For those who make it through the program, I've heard the benefits are all but worth the risk."

good,"Challenging high energy environment in which they paid me while I was studying for my exams. I passed all, being a Series 3, 6, 7, and insurance exam. After I passed my exams I believed I was going to be able to offer the best possible solutions for my clients needs. But actually it is more like a flea market where you have a quota of products that you must sell each day whether they fit you clients needs or not, and whether they are performing well or not. It seemed a little unethical. But to be fair it was right before 9/11 and thee was not many products performing well then."

As a quick learner and  a self starter, on entering the office, I would immediately start working on various reports to ensure trades are settled on contract and accounts are reconciled. I quickly moved on to prepare other reports for management. I have learned that being able to work independently is an asset to management.  I assisted my co-workers with their daily assignments to ensure  issues are resolved in a timely fashion. The hardest part of my job is having to leave a task for the next day. However the most enjoyable part is being able to train new staff and assist where help is needed.

I’ve appreciated being given the opportunity to learn new skills and support the company in different aspects such as in Information Security.

My favorite thing about this job was learning how to work with a team. The last two out of three years at my retail job Montmartre, pre Morgan Stanley, I worked alone managing the entire store.

I was mostly needed to be sitting at my desk as not to miss a single phone call from any client of any of the brokers that I assisted.  I do miss that corporate environment.  The downside was that in order to be able to fax anything or make any changes on an account, a supervisor was needed to sign off on everything which made every process take more time.   There is a big difference between a small company and a large corporate office."
