rating,review
bad,"No work/life balance. Low pay. Constant layoffs. Supervisors show favoritism. Lots of gossip. Toxic environment. No training. You can be the hardest worker there but if they don’t like you, your job will never be fulfilling"
bad,"The overall culture is not inclusive.  There is no transparency and often times it feels like you're uncertain of the future of your role. There are so many dedicated employees who want to see the company succeed, but there needs to be more cohesiveness."
bad,Very poor management. No future in radio. Coworkers with extremely bad attitudes. Poor work environment. No one willing to train or assist. Do not recommend.
bad,manque d'humanisme et aucune compréhension du travail niveau team leader...
bad,"This is honestly the worst company I ever worked for. The company does not promote a positive culture, provides a toxic work environment, and does its best to kill any dreams of advancement you may have."
bad,"Do not value employees- do not give raises, for employees who have worked there for decades, do not have enough or any advancement opportunities, poor management styles. Do not invest in training for employees. Company structure is a mess- no clear direction- Employees are under-valued. Straight commission- sink or swim. Because of bankruptcy, do not have enough supplies or up-to-date equipment. No training what so ever."
bad,Well at this present time they're looking for excuses to sack the old timers so they can getting new ones in and tie them down to digital call out on their contracts.
bad,Multiple people broke down in this office due to commision only. A manager had to loan a rep her rent money. Use the company CRM for contacts and dip.
bad,"Awful work culture, no structure to help you succeed. Most people that come in without having any prior knowledge will not make it. Managers play favorites, most managers will favor men over women unless you are a veteran of the industry forget about a long term career with this company. People hear the name and think it's glitzy because of the events but its a joke. Managers do not train you, certain managers will put the burden of blame on reps doing their job while allowing reps that are failing to get away with murder and handing them deals, meanwhile you are doing the actual work and struggling to get deals done. Even if you are sucessful when goals aren't met you will watch as ""male"" reps who are handed everything are lifted up as though they have been closing deals left and right when they and management are really on the road going to lunches and skating by on deals. Male managers are allowed to verbaly abuse you and get away with it."
bad,"The company culture is the complete opposite of what you think when you see ""iHeartMedia"" award shows or radio performances. Sales operations are 20 years outdated and illogical for 2018. The sales team is completely unorganized with too many meetings and nothing ever gets done or is improved. No Account Executive is under 34 years old. They seldom hire recent college grads to pick up new accounts, then terminate them while handing the commission and account off to a veteran Account Executive. Turnover is high and they are inflicting it on themselves."
bad,"It is all about management no coordination, instead of focusing on the company they rather mix personal feeling with works. "
bad,"Worthless company courts did not approve reorganization "
bad,I really dont think i worked for this company. i did work in the industry for several years but not with i heart radio. this is an unusual request from indeed
bad,"This company is a mirage. On the outside everything looks great. Once you're inside you see another picture. Women are overlooked, verbally abused and underpaid. Man who are abusive are protected and glorified. They do not care about their employees."
bad,Great place to learn outside sales on your own if you are able to endure a low paying commission only job. The company is deeply in debt and does not care about the low pay of the workers.
bad,"Worked here for 6 years and got worse over the years finally got a New job last year,  I have had a few jobs in my life time and this has got to be worst one Not the job itself its the management, team leaders, and the work load and the very high standard they expect from you in the 40 hours you are paid for No one could do the job has  required in the time given to do it . You had to cut corners or you will  have been working extra hours for free it was  normal for me to work 50 or 60 hours per week only getting paid for 40 hours. You was given you round on a Monday over the phone doing posters then come Wednesday or Thursday they will have sold more poster space so you will be going back out again to the same sites to post again but in you own time. You are given 19 minutes to clean a bus stop regardless of how dirty its was in that 19 minutes you had to put out your man at work signs clean the floor from weeds clean the inside  top of the roof and then all fours sides of the bus stop, Then get you signs back into the van. I could spend 40 minutes on just one bus stop I was then told by my Team leader that I must be doing it wrong . One day I was given 25 jobs to do cleaning bus stop so when I ask the team leader to work it out for me has 25 * 19 minutes is 475 that give me 5 minutes traveling time to get to 25 jobs he could not explain it to me and told me to get out and get on with it and if I did not like it then the company has got a stack load  of CV with people waiting to take my Job that was my last day. I went on my two weeks holiday and never went back the turn over"
bad,The environment was very cut throat and anyone could get fired at a moments notice. Everyone is on edge. My manager did not train me or help in anyway so it was very hard to catch up to such a grueling position. No work life balance if you want to be in a sales position. Lack of communication between departments and getting anything done is extremely difficult even when you put the time and energy into it.
bad,Being an intern was really boring. They never gave me any real work to do and so I didn't learn anything. It's fine if you just need credits to graduate but don't bother if you actually want to learn skills.
bad,Working at this company I was faced with a few challenges. The culture was not as inviting as I thought it would be. I did not feel that I was being supported by my department. I did not feel that there was opportunity for growth.
bad,"Don't be like me and not do your research on IHeartMedia was desperate at the time,  but wait or be ready for a company that is so  unorganized and they don't even know how to handle the 21st century. That's evident with constant with them being broke. Or least wait to work there when a Tech Giant buys them out. 20th century ideas in a 21st century work environment. Needs a shot of YOUTH and not the silly iheart festivals that's so 80's"
bad,"Putting together events for radio clients and setting up at the events."
bad,"Do not work here. The higher up management will play favorites, and throw you under the bus. All the while you will receive no real world training, and you will be made to look stupid by management, while they pretend as if you should know better."
bad,"Clear Channel Brasil"
bad,Not the best working environment for entry-level candidates. Your superiors treat workers differently based on rank. The top superior was often pompous and arrogant. Seemed like the sales team cared more about making money than they did about the well-being of their employees. There was no structure or direction in some of the newer positions so at times it seemed like you were doing nothing. Many of the meetings consisted of workers talking about each other and going off topic.
bad,"Targets are out of this world.you will be run 40h work based on 3 jobs per hour.it is impossible to maintain in daylight so are forced to work at night,or face diciplinary action.Travel time to next job is not included and if you do not complete work in 40 hours,you must work in own time,for free.Lunch is 30 mins of your own time,so your day is 8 hours 30 mins,plus all travel time,10 hours +.Too much work is why turnover is 80 + in 2 years.When an issue is raised,it is kept within site as not to bother the C.E.O. shhhhhh."
bad,"you will be given 40h work cleaning street furniture.you will not be able to complete work in 40h.you will be expected to work in own time for free to complete work or you will be under investigation.you will prove,with 7 collegues,that it is impossible to achieve.you will leave due to pressure.the job is hard but when you look at the result,you feel proud.made upsetting by a supervisor checking it saying 'you missed a bit,go back and clean it again.turnover of staff is 80+ in 2 years.motto of company is ironic?"
bad,"Worked here for 10 years and got worse over the years cut the work in half doubled the work you are expected to do about 10 hrs a week for free in your own time collecting stock/posters and meetings "
bad,"If you are new to media or are a recent graduate, you will have an opportunity to work 70 hours a week in order to rise through the ranks making very little money and creating not very good content. "
bad,"If you are looking to work your butt off and get taken advantage of, then IHeartMedia is for you.  The management is absolutely ridiculous.  The whole company, over all, is absolutely ridiculous.  They are all for themselves, and don't care one bit about ANY of their customers, clients, and listeners.  They just care about money.  It is awful that with this billion dollar company, they have such awful benefits for their employees, and their management (and all employees) only care for themselves.  It was over all an awful experience and I will NEVER support any IHeartMedia or IHeartRadio stations EVER."
bad,"You hear that raises ""might happen"" sometime in the future or that you like what you do so much you don't need one. If you are salary you work your tail"
bad,"They are a very horrible company to work for: Benefits suck and the managers are very immature, not trusting and you cannot succeed unless you suck up to them.  "
bad,They do not pay very well. They expect you to work 12 hours in the office and than an hour or two when you get home. However it is a very large company and it has a lot to do with what team you end up on. That will determine how much you enjoy your stay at the company.
bad,I loved it would do more of it if i could i learned a lot would love to learn more.
bad,"This company is only about the bottom line..REVENUE. There is a huge turnover problem with the Philadelphia market. The managers are not trustworthy. The older reps continue to make the most amount of money from advertising agencies. However, the new people come and go. There is a lot of favor shown among the older reps. The best thing about the company is the training module and resources that are available for the account executives."
bad,Atmosphere was average at best.  They worked you to death without raises.  The building always stunk.
bad,My advice is to Stay away from this company. Not a good company at all
bad,"fast paced enviroment, you get a hour lunch, paid vacation, paid sick time."
bad,"Too much turnover, no long term job security, writing, producing reports, commercial work, promos, scheduling, on air work, etc. "
bad,"This would be a great job for anyone who has YEARS of SUCCESSFUL previous radio sales experience. If you're green in the radio advertising industry, I can't recommend it."
bad,I honestly wasn't there long enough to know. The hours were the reason I left along with a manager who was constantly looking over your shoulder. I was told when I got there after explicitly telling them the only reason I wanted to leave Fox was to get off the overnight. My schedule ranged from mornings to evenings to overnights all in the span of the same week.
bad,They are not good people. They ignore your phone calls and emails. Very unprofessional.
bad,"Perks were amazing. if you were not in the in crowd you didn't get anything. management are the worst. you do their dirty work while they go on their boat."
bad,"This is for my local office: I worked in Sales. It was pushy and stressful. The manager was never pleased. She would push out other AE's commercials for her clients. Corporate pushed down mandatory sales packages constantly all while they were going through bankruptcy. I was brought on with an agreed upon salary then it was switched on me because the person before me got paid that much (even though they were a recent college grad and I had multiple years of work experience on them...).  I needed the job so I accepted but I wish I just pushed back. The Manager berated people in meetings, refused to give out raises, and cared very little about your families needs (i.e.: sick child etc)."
bad,I worked for 3 years and never got a raise as well as my co workers  I was top of my team in meeting goals  excuse for not giving me a raise was because of bankruptcy management is very unfair and a lot of favoritism going on there. I highly do not recommend working there you will never advance and never get get raises. Awful and unfair place to work your good work will not be acknowledged.
bad,"iHeart doesn't value their employees one bit. It's a culture here. I've heard from multiple employees in multiple positions, high and low, that they feel unappreciated and underpaid, in addition to my personal experience. Upper management is the absolute worst. They come and go as they please, yet hold others to a strict standard. I recently hit my 1 year anniversary of working here and barely got a lukewarm email. No recognition whatsoever. Upper management doesn't listen to any complaints from supporting positions. Everything is thrown back on you to resolve, no support. No bonuses for assistants, yet they're constantly on your back to prospect for sales executives and provide them with highly lucrative leads. Cultural insensitivity from the top down. Favoritism is rampant. They see you as a number rather than a person.Your workload will have you working through lunch breaks, and then they hassle you about overtime. Meanwhile, the executives you support goof off on social media and have social hour with others in the office while you slave away. Don't say I didn't warn you."
bad,"iHeart/Clear Channel Outdoor is not a place where you can advance. They do a horrible job treating people fairly across the board. If you can brown nose, or if you can keep your mouth shut of no complaints, this is the perfect company for you. If you need money, this should only be a temporary place to be. Once you get in, don’t be fooled by all the tvs with iHeart Radio or Music Awards showing. This is just the twilight zone to get you to think it’s a cool place to work. Their going through a lot of restructuring and are moving people out and in. The radio side is not looking to good with their profit since the CEO announced during a meeting that they currently in litigation of Bankruptcy (To him that was good news. I think not) and the Clear Channel Side, their turnover rate is horrible. Billing can’t keep people to stay because they have brown nose women who run it and have so many frustrating changes. Collections/Cash/AP can NEVER  keep people because all the great people leave and see all the bull, and the RFP dept (Run! Fast! Please!) it stands for request for proposal but they only hires young people who get out of college so they can scare them into staying or believing they will be flexible when all the while you really agree to work crazy shifts as if you have no life or a family: pretty much all of Clear Channel side is not in a good spot. Apply to this place with caution."
bad,"Commissioned based sales positions are stressful! No job security, you would probably have to have a second job in order to make ends meet. You also have to use your own transportation, and there isn't any reimbursements on anything."
bad,"STAY AWAY! This company is run by incompetent children. The turnover of employees speaks volumes about the company. You won't get paid for your work and when they fire you or you quit, they keep your pay."
bad,"I don't feel as though I'm fairly compensated for the work that I do. Pay and benefits aren't up to snuff, and I believe that that is a reflection of corporate policies outside of the control of anybody I work with directly. I believe the company values profit over people, and profit over product--as many of our stations carry nationally syndicated programming that moves away from the strength of radio. Staff in all departments is spread too thin, and more responsibilities are heaped onto individuals with no increase in pay."
bad,"Upper Management is aloof and allows mid level management to micromanage department heads.  Very cut throat environment, If you're not part of the ""Mean Girls"" you will never succeed.  Managers show favoritism.  100 commission so they have a great group of hard working sales people."
bad,"Corporate Channel is a miserable place to work. Long hours, LOW pay, terrible benefits, and high school like popularity contests make this one of the worst places to work. Lower management forces you to drink the kool-aid, middle management takes zero responsibility for anything, and upper management thinks they know everything and refuse to listen to anyone in the field."
bad,"Nothing was ever what was sold to me in the beginning, never felt like my position was secure or valued, solid work ethic and quality did nothing for my chances of advancement. Wouldn't recommend it."
bad,I was lured away from a stable position at a prominent university and then fired for following my managers directives to the letter. There was a wealth of evidence that my manager had a personal issue and that he was sabotaging me. And I am not the only one of his victims.
bad,"I was a Sr VP of sales,  made to handle a second market for a $48 a week raise. Hit budget consistently yet was treated poorly. Benefits terrible. Upper management for the most part a joke. My direct supervisor only cared for himself. Took credit for everything and contributed very little. Got fired after I left and now took his act  to Cumulus in Erie PA. Kissing the proper tail is an art form"
bad,"Clear Channel St Helens has got to be the worst company to work for The turn over of staff speaks for it self. I worked for the company for six months has CPO and 12 people come and went some was let go the rest just walk out,  The Job is very good its the work load they give you and the standard they required from you in the time they say you can do it. In the six months I was working for Clear Channel I never done 40 hours in a week its was always over, one week its was over 70 hours and in that week I worked a  20 hour shift went out at 5am and got home at 1 am the next day, only getting paid for 40 hours a week. You need to drive your van like a formula one driver to do your work. The Management is Very Very Poor you could not say anything to them any concerns about the Job on H & S or the work load they was not interested The manager at the time was ex army they way he spoke to people was disgusting had NO people skills I ask him once for some more blue paper roll you would have thought I had ask him for one of is kidneys  the way he carry on. The team leaders are not team leaders they are just puppets for the management has they was not all allowed to make  any decision on anything. The sad thing about the place is they have got some very good staff working  for them but they do not look after them. 70%  of the staff was looking for a new Job when I was there. it could be a very good Job if they was a bit more realistic with the targets Its not a hard Job but at less than £19000 P/Year they should be paying a lot more for working  50 / 60 hours a week. I kept a log of"
bad,Since Interpace Airports advertising was bought out by Clear Channel the work atmosphere has continued to go down hill.  It is way to corporate at this point.
bad,"Hard work with little to no recognition. It is great experience because you're paying your dues, but overall the job is terrible with no benefits and barely any pay."
bad,"I worked here through a temporary agency and was promised"
bad,"The good part of the job was getting to meet the artists and enjoy the shows, the rest of the job was awful. There is no chance for advancement in this company, when a position DOES open up, instead of hiring from their branch, they pull in somebody from another branch of Clear Channel. You get treated as an inferior by all of management, and they don't follow protocol with their operations. My biggest complaint is their poor treatment of employees, they'll act like they care when they need you to do something extra, then turn completely 2-faced when you need something. They give no raises, and have pocketed ""additional fees"" that are supposed to go directly to the people working the event. Awful company to work for, I DO NOT recommend. Go work at CBS or AOL Radio instead."
bad,great to call on agencies and build relationships. loved selling for kiss fm.
bad,"They make it almost impossible for you to make money. With commission changes happening 3 times within one year (End of Jan 2012- Jan 2013) and other means which are too ridiculous to even explain. The environment is very cliquey between managers and managers and certain account executives. CC is about growth and development for them, not you. 100% Commission, no car, phone or lunch allowance. Plus they are in debt. Good luck"
bad,"There was some training, about 1-2 times per year.  Management was always harsh and punitive. No creative solutions offered. public humiliation at sales meetings is the common practice. whatever you achieve is never enough. lots of criticism from nonsales staff because of income jealousy. Management likes to take credit and delegate blame to others. A toxic place with no path to advancement at all."
bad,They are a very forward thinking company but if you work in a smaller market you are constantly faced with the strain of the bigger markets. They have basically have no bonus plan anymore. If you are considering this as a future I would say this is a job that will give you sales experience but it’s not a career.
bad,My discussion to leave iHeart was due to a Hostile work environment. Lack of management support. No room for advancement. Company in constant financial crisis.
bad,"I've never worked somewhere like this in my life.  The managers are clique-y, rude, and look down their noses at you.  Goals were not shared with us as far as numbers to meet, etc.  Once a year they just tell you rather you hit your numbers or not, no elaboration.  All four of the female AP managers are horrible, and I feel bad for the people that still work there.  They expect you to come in, like a robot, sit down, shut up, work, and leave.  Don't dare come in or leave a minute late, you'll get written up for it!  They never thanked us or told us we were doing a good job.  This company has a reputation because of this department, and within the company, everyone knows that the AP department is the worst department to work for.  During Christmas, because it's not only month end but also year end, expect to work 2-3 weeks in a row with no lunches and staying late.  Also, for every month's end, expect to work through lunches and stay late.  They don't give out the opportunity to volunteer for people who might want these hours, it's mandatory across the board.  Worst place I've ever worked!"
bad,"Quotas are not realistic they are made for you to fail and make very little money. There are many pay structure traps , managers push you so they can make their goals and sit behind a desk since they make salary no matter what. You are not properly incentivized and the moral is at its lowest I have ever seen. No one is valued so people are in and out before you get to know their last name."
bad,The department moved to Tampa where they celebrate sales by walking laps around an indoor track and wearing fitbits. I am not sure I would recommend this department to a friend.
bad,"Poor culture, horrible management from the top down.  Multiple layers of management and adding and each has to justify their existence by adding to the micromanagement."
bad,"iHeartMedia has a great platform to reach consumers! The internal management and operations are the issues. In terms of sales, there is not a lot of sales support to keep sellers on the front line selling. Sellers spend time developing new business while managing current business while also handling billing and a lot of campaign execution. If sellers could spend most of their time prospecting and developing new business, iHeart would win."
bad,Senior management lacks leadership qualities and insight needed for continued growth. Poor interpersonal skills. Poor outlook for this company long term. Huge turnover.
bad,"The management is very poor.  Some of the leaders are very disrespectful and rude, not to mention gossipy.  The favorites are protected, but fair treatment is not consistent for all employees within some departments."
bad,"The job is very boring and tedious and although the hours are flexible if you don't start very early in the morning or do night shift which can be dangerous as there's no one to contact if you incounter any trouble then you will struggle to get your work done in the 40 hours. They give you 13 min to wash a shelter and that's to weed it, get ride of moss and sweep it out as well as wash and dry it and you will have to do between 140 and 150 a week  and you come across smashed shelters or really dirty shelters none of this is taken in to account there for you are rushing about all week to get your work done. They will also come out and check your work and if they find any dirt on it even in the most ridiculous places they will chin you for it. High turn over of staff because the job is bad never worked in a place where most of the cleaning and posting operatives want a new job. You also have to fill your van with water everyday so if you don't have a outdoor tap at your house your in trouble."
bad,"I was on the Radio, I had a cool program director but the main morning guys had a huge ego and didn't like that I got attention and came up with good stuff."
bad,"I must like it. Because I worked there  theee times"
bad,"It’s not as creative as everyone expects it to be , it’s a typical commercial building filled with people working non fulfilling 9-5 jobs, the on air talent are the only ones who are treated like human beings, your not allowed to walk on certain floors so if your hoping to get in the mix or meet your favorite celebrity forget about it , it will take years of working and moving up before you’d get your credentials to get involved to that aspect"
bad,This company is good for people who are coming out of school and looking to get some experience under their belt.  Do your time and move on as soon as you can.
bad,"I was working long hours without overtime.  My managers would never appreciate the hard work I was putting in.  At first I thought my job was amazing, but due to new management, it went bad pretty quickly.  I would not recommend working for a place like iHeartMedia."
bad,This is a cutting edge company that is always evolving.  Its great to be in the entertainment industry.
bad,I would monitor traffic accidents and report it to a central reporting system to be broadcasted on air.
bad,"Met with the news director daily to go over schedules, anything currently pressing and new hires. "
bad,I love the group of people I work with.  Friendly and happy group.  Understanding when it comes to family emergencies.  Trusted to do my job with little oversight
bad,sense I've worked here I only got one promotion and one raise.  upper management is only looking out for themselves and lots of people are not happy and are looking for jobs.
bad,"over worked under payed"
bad,I enjoyed working there for the most part. Every day was a little different which was the fun challenging part. Communication could be better. They had fun games to give away tickets to different events which was fun.
bad,"Very little opportunity to progress."
bad,Low pay.  Not much advancement opportunity.  No different than any other radio station.  All about who you know and being in right place at right time.
bad,After working there for many years i was not treated fairly when i made a complaint and i do not recommend working for this company
bad,Worst company I ever worked for.  Horrible managers and lots of favoritism.  Huge pay gaps among talent.  No promotion from within.  Managers keep adding additional duties with no additional pay.  No reviews.
bad,"Radio is dead, and this company is not fixing it. Clear channel is losing so much money right now and instead of making a product people want, they're making everything worse. No one loves their job here anymore."
bad,"IHeart Radio is a serious business. My experience there showed that the bottom line is their top priority, sadly, even at the expense of Human Resources."
bad,"Music play lists formatted by off-site music consultants without allowing for much ""local"" flavorinput, at the time.  Working conditions were great, co-workers were like a real family."
bad,"You'd think radio would be fun and it can be but it's not with iHeart. Yes they have great events on a national scale but that doesn't make up for the lack of training, terrible management and low morale. If you're looking to break into the radio biz, go with a local company - better pay and I can guarantee they will care more about their employees."
bad,"The management only pays attention to friends (other managers, 'boys club') and relatives in the company and treats assistants and coordinators with no respect and give them no recognition for their hard work. This is shown in how quick the turnaround is in those positions.  Hardest part is doing the work of four people in an 8 hour day, and no overtime - extremely overworked for an hourly employee. Learned different programs, which taught self mostly since training was not officially provided. Enjoyable part was meeting singers/performers, but that is all.  Compensation was extremely low."
bad,"Mass firings"
bad,"Radio is dying, and they are trying to squeeze more and more work out of less people for less pay.  Nothing good can come out of that equation.  You give and give to a massive corp, and they never invest back in the people."
bad,"I was mislead in the interview. I guess I can take part of that blame as I was fresh out of college. I was a seller and was told everything was non-negotiable, take it or leave it. I found out later everything was in fact negotiable. "
bad,"Working at Clear Channel used to be a pretty good experience. But since Bain Capital purchased the company in 2008 the overall work environment has slowly been going down and has finally hit rock bottom. Not sure about the rest of the markets, but the overall morale in Miami is probably very similar to that of a sweatshop. Extremely high employee turnover, no training to new hires, very low pay and commissions, bad management practices, long hours with zero incentives, poor benefits, short-staffed and over worked, extremely low morale.The job requires lots of driving but the company doesn't provide any vehicle or gas expenses.They expect their employees to produce a lot with the bare minimum."
bad,"The job function itself was fun, exciting and always new."
bad,Was not adequately informed of the complexity of the job. Cooperation from management was a definite drawback. Would set appointments as directed by the Sales Manager for the two of us and he would not be on time or ask to change the appointment.
bad,"If you are looking for advancement look somewhere else, the company is billions of dollars in dept. Based on your market is how well you are treated don't trust managers they will lie too you to keep you around then out of nowhere you will be let go regardless of your work history or the amount of revenue you bring to the business. The dept that the company has is tremendous."
bad,I was employed with iHeart Media and the favoritisms was like none I ever experienced in my life. The job duties were alit the company is currently going through a chapter 11 bankruptcy so no over after a mintue after your shift you have to communicate why you stayed over ! I had several encounter that I felt my co workers were basis towards me and it was fine with upper Manager! Upper management does not treat entry level positions fairly! The hours were flexible and no point system at first but if they don’t like you slot of rules will be place upon you so they can get you out the door
bad,"As the title explains, you will be treated like scum, spoken down to and belittled at every chance. I have worked for a lot of big companies. But this one takes first place on its treatment of staff, It is downright disgusting how they talk and treat you. To them you are nothing more than a commodity than can easily replaced. The moment i joined the company i started instantly regretted it. If i didn't have a family to look after i would of quit a long time ago, like every other member of staff. This company has one very high staff turn over for a reason."
bad,"Their employee manual stated  that a employee working 35 hours or more a week was considered full-time and would receive full-time benefits. "
bad,"The pay is not very good and haven't had a raise in several years.  My co-workers are great, but the management is lousy.  It can be fun at times, however overall, there is no opportunity for advancement unless you are buds with the management."
bad,"My work day starts at 3 a.m. I have learned to stay focused on the job at hand despite an extremely hectic environment. I'm self motivated, so the hands-off management style suits me well. The workplace culture is that of one team working together. The hardest part of the job is getting all my tasks done in the very limited time afforded me, the most enjoyable aspect of the job is the feeling of freedom."
bad,A good company to work for if you can accept low pay with very little room for advancement if you are over the ago of 40.  This company promotes from within and appears to go after the 25- 35 year olds for most of their in house promotions.
bad,"not the worst job, but training was terrible, scheduling was late and conflicting, for a communications business, they were seriously lacking"
bad,"I had a good time at work because of the friends I made there, but recommend working there to no one."
bad,This was a school internship to try to  gain computer experience for school
bad,After nine years I was laid off for no reason and no warning. Go in knowing that this is only a stepping stool to get you to a better place. Have an exit strategy
bad,"It's an inconsistent place to work. The pay is not great, and you're scheduled on the fly two weeks in advance. It's a good place to get your foot in the door as far as media goes, but I wouldn't recommend it for someone really looking to boost their career in any way. The management is inconsistent and petty and you're never right. You have benefits once you join the union, which admittedly is a cool perk."
bad,"CCOA has the potential to be an outstanding company but lacks development for entry-mid level positions in sales. They focus so much attention on the VPs, they lose sight of grooming younger employees. Everyone is replaceable and it's sad to see this happen!  The company understands there are high turnover jobs and is not willing to make a change. Instead they focus on the VPs without recognizing the people who put in the grunt work for these managers to be successful."
bad,"I’ve been working here for 6 months. Training you are thrown to the wolves. If somebody quits you get more work, but they don’t like giving OT. You are encouraged to take charge, but not everybody listens or even will respond to emails. Communication can be difficult if you are out of market. In the end anything that goes wrong is the traffic managers responsibility even though we may have no caused the issue. Compensation was fine at the beginning, but I received more responsibilities and compensation was not raised. Sales assistants make more than traffic managers and we are suppose to solve their issues."
bad,"My typical day consisted of calling on local businesses and selling them advertising.  I also wrote commercials and proposals."
bad,"- log in check emails for any updates or new protocols, start calling clients on delinquency list we are giving for the month"
bad,"they just keep firing people and then  dump all their work on you expect you to do that job an  your job within your 40 hour a week all while not wanting to pay overtime  so your micro managed on your hours.  go figure,, very stressful"
bad,"The promotional management at iHeart Media shows constant favoritism which include giving his favorite employees constant trips, more events with higher pay and sends them out with another person. If you are not his favorite, you get sent out on your own for hourly gigs only and your hours are cut to the extreme."
bad,"Skill, experience and job performance do not seem to be a gauge as to job security with an atmosphere of tenseness that you could be next to lose your job."
bad,"We Went bowling once in 2011 as a team building exercise."
bad,"Not a good place to work.  Not a good place to work.  Do not work here.  Management does not recognize talent or good efforts,"
bad,Reliability of job was inconsistent and management chose favorites as to who the hired on as permanent employees no matter how long the individual had been there.
bad,"I have learned a great deal, grown within myself and have gained a many positive experiences from working at Clear Channel. My co-workers are great people to work with and the brand of Clear Channel is almost fool proof. However, the executive team at Clear Channel has shown they are really only concerned about the bottom line. The turn over-rate has been unnecessarily high. The main complaint seems to be lack of training, lack of advancement and lack of raises in compensation. Clear Channel has not given a cost of living raise in over five years. They do offer benefit packages which is a plus, but it only goes so far when your sales assistants do not make enough to cover the insurance rate. I gave the company 2 stars because of how they treat their employees. They have the potential to be a great company to work for but they need a lot of work to get there. They need to understand that human capital is a very important thing and should probably invest some of their time and money into keeping the very talented people they have, at their company."
bad,"A poorly managed company that only cares about ""Increasing stockholder value"" and of course all the upper management are big stockholders. Employees are disposable and the fewer the better."
bad,"They laid off too many people so that the people that are left are ridiculously over worked. Very difficult to maintain family/personal life with the workload. Also, no sense of job security. You're always walking around thinking, ""Who's next to get laid off? Will it be me?"""
bad,You either have a list or you will be looking for a job in 6 to 8 months; no matter how good you are.
bad,"If you want to get your feet wet in radio/media, this is a good experience.  "
bad,"I was disappointed in the lack of compensation this company provides to its employees, especially the creative staff. I was barely making enough to survive working here. To their credit, they were good about sending you out for computer classes to keep pace with the industry minimum standard as long as you put it in writing with management. There was good work life balance from the standpoint that the hours I worked there were bankers hours from 8am-4:30pm give or take. Management was awful, doors to their offices were closed most the time. Benefits were major medical and didn't cover a basic office visit. There was little if any chance for advancement and they didn't provide relocation assistance if you took a better position in another market office. Sales and marketing staff were often times demanding and rude to the creative staff. Keep in mind we made a fraction of compensation compared to the marketing people. Quite a disparity actually, very sad. Especially considering what we do is drive the ideas and image of your organization."
bad,"Felt like it was a negative work atmosphere and never felt appreciated as an employee and felt like the office was quite toxic.. however, it all depends on how you handle your own experience at this company."
bad,"No jobs are full time, the pay is atrocious and raises are non existent. They treat all their employees like they’re expendable. Manager’s rarely meet with part time employees."
bad,"Cold calling 24/7, expect lots of cancellations from clients who claim ""radio doesn't work "", sales management is a joke. Very cut-throat. They use you when you are new and naive to cold call, with the promise that you will make big money.  However, that never happens, they dangle a carrot that you will never get.  The only people who make big money are the ones who have been around since the beginning of time because they have all of the big accounts. iHeart needs to invest in their newer employees, they do not value them  at all.  They are forced to leave the company after their draw runs out (which is a disgustingly low amount), due to their lack of accounts.  This is  because sales management doesn't care and gives no support or direction. I met some great people, but overall the company  is the shadiest one I have ever worked for in my life.  After working there for a year and a half I saw a huge turnover in new sales people. Oh and pray that no one in your family dies, because they don't pay salespeople for bereavement.  There is a reason why this company is always involved with lawsuits and is bankrupt. Hey iHeart, learn to treat your employees better and take the time to care about newer ones. Maybe you'll actually have some good sales people after your dinosaurs finally decide to retire."
bad,Company is having financial struggles and is likely to file Ch11 in the next year.  CEO hasn't made an appearance in the San Antonio office in a number of years.  San Antonio is considered the corporate office along with New York.
bad,"It was very tough working for this company. No one was ever on the same page and only cared about sales and adds. No team building exercises were ever offered,."
bad,"Certain managers are too much into gossip than being a manager. "
bad,"Unethical, severely dysfunctional, highly problematic. And that's just senior management. On Fridays, they pregame Happy Hour in the office by rolling out coolers full of beer at 3 PM."
bad,"Over the years, the company has restructured several times. When i first started, there was always a chance for advancement, raises ect. That's not the case now for most. You are pigeon holed into your position. There's very little chance to move up or even around within the company. There are multiple levels of managers to answer to and most of them are not in the market. Employees are micromanaged to death, mostly by those outside the market. "
bad,It has been quite some time since I worked at Iheart.  The people there were nice and I enjoyed my time there.  I just needed to find something more stable with benefits and had to move on.
bad,Loved working with most of the staff.  Upper Management is not respected and not trustworthy.  Broken promises and no follow through.  No sense of security.
bad,"I would not recommend this company as a good place to work. Staff, salary and benefit cuts are constant in every market. Management changes at every level occur frequently. Company wages/salaries are below industry standard in most markets. Employees spend a large portion of their day complaining about their jobs and/or looking for jobs outside the company. As a manager I found it very difficult to attract and/or retain quality employees."
bad,This is a tough position with no designated territory and 100% commission. There are constant commission changes in an unstable environment
bad,"There is no room for growth, by the time there is, if you aren't a favorite you are overlooked. No incentives given for hard work, you do double the work for half the pay, the pay is horrible it is barely able to help make ends meet."
bad,"This company has gone downhill SO much over the years.  Worked there for many years."
bad,This company is great for people who don't mind answering emails at 2am and on weekends. The benefits package is terrible. The amount of vacation time given is scant. There is no work/life balance and the company culture tries to be fun and casual but is not. Pays very well and offers job security and advancement but expect to be working 24/7.
bad,I answered phones for contestant winners and did not have much to do to us my experience.
bad,"My experience at Clear Channel started out well, but due to a lot of organizational changes in order to cut budget during the down economy, has turned the company sour and the employees bitter."
bad,"This company worked well with schooling, and had a program where you received credits for schooling through internship programs."
bad,"Their pay is usually the lowest of any local television stations in every market. The benefits are generally quite good, other than their pay. The upper management at the local level usually has a Sales background which gives them absolutely no working knowledge of any of the technical aspects of operating a television station."
bad,"iHeartMedia does afford you a lot of freedom to explore numerous facets of entertainment and marketing. Certainly their focus is on their radio products, but there are plenty of roles available in IT, engineering, social media, project management, promotions and sales to be had. If you're self-driven, and don't mind working yourself ragged while wearing a lot of hats, you could take away a lot of great experience."
bad,"Difficult hours, but a lot of fun. Radio is difficult to get into. If you're fortunate enough to have that opportunity make the best of it. The staff is close and always there for each other."
bad,Fun work environment and supportive management within office.  Hard to achieve change and make your concerns hard with upper level management.
bad,"iHeartMedia specializes in creating integrated marketing solutions for companies and brands using radio, digital, social media, and event marketing assets."
bad,I was looking for something a little different where I didn't feel like a number and Radio Disney came calling.
bad,"As someone who worked late evenings and overnights most of the time, people did not even know that I worked there that worked at the company itself.  It was nice to do something with my degree but, as I was warned, there's no money in radio.  Management actually asked me if I was republican/conservative when I was interviewed.  The overnights were the toughest but I know they're fully automated now so I was one of the last suckers doing it.  The coworkers I did know were pretty awesome and it was fun producing some of the shows with the more lively topics."
bad,If you're willing to work really hard this job can be rewarding. Stick with it. This might be something you love. If not leave.
bad,Overall my time I Clear Channel has been good. I've learned a lot over the past ten years about marketing and about myself. I've met some really great people who are great at their jobs and who help make my job rewarding. The hardest part of the job is accomplishing as much as we do with the limited resources that we have. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people i work with.
bad,"With certain bankruptcy in its future, it is in my best interest to leave my position at iHeartMedia.  I no longer feel I am working towards a common, positive goal."
bad,"The company often does pay changes, the management changes so you must get everything in writing, Lack of focus on management."
bad,"Working here has been an experience both positive and negative. Your co-workers are always fun to be with and very helpful, management doesn't have your back."
bad,"Great learning experience for cross-platform media. Opens a lot of doors to enhance various skill sets for events, radio, digital, marketing, etc."
bad,This company is in the midst of going through a plethora of financial challenges but overall it is a great way to get your feet wet in a lot of great experiences. A lot of office politics and selfish natures.
bad,"To simply explain the above ratings: It appeared to me that the vast majority of employees were fairly satisfied with their situation, save in the department I was in. The first-level managers themselves were actually quite good and made an effort to be so, when possible, but the overall approach was quite bad. Micromanagement was rife and oppressive to the point of being overbearing and a distraction from work. It was most often a place you dreaded going each morning."
bad,Company has changed dramatically over the last 2-3 years.
bad,Would have been a decent job had management been better. You know not to stick around when 2 people quit your first week and everyone else only complains about staying there.
bad,Clear Channel Media + Entertainment is a fun place to work. You can succeed if you work hard and stay focused. Highs and lows. 
bad,"Managing a team of Business Development Managers who specialise in working with the SME market in the London & the South to grow businesses through targeted, cost effective out-of-home advertising campaigns."
bad,There is very little room for growth. Creative content has too many departments giving input which leads to voice of the creative being drowned out result in a very standardize safe content creation. Results in a lot of template-based video content that has very inflexible and stunts any possibility of creative expression.
bad,Never fully sure if what I directly was doing was in any way a contribution to the company.  With the past 12 years of continued staff attrition the atmosphere for those who remain was always tension.  My decision making and priorities as a mid line manager was not what I felt was most important but what we felt our superiors wanted.
bad,"Really? Those requirements sound like three people worth of work, and far to expansion for one time part timer Get real!"
bad,Radio is a cutthroat business with an uncertain future. Learned almost all my computer skills there. Learned a lot. No job security though.
good,Sales Manager is the ultimate micro-manager. Very difficult to work with and loves to get in your face. The culture is tense and morale when I left was very low. The most enjoyable part on this job was working out of the office and staying away from the pressure.
good,"Clear Channel provided me a place to have six of the coolest years of my career. I learned a lot about a lot while working in radio. I miss the medium. Unfortunately, Clear Channel was instrumental in making radio less tangible for the listener, therefore less about the product and more about stuffing ads onto the air. Clear Channel didn't kill the radio star, but it maimed it with voice tracking and miserable salaries."
good,"Great company to begin engineering career with challenges and career experience. However, if you decide to work with iheart, make sure the company's culture and management align with your values and expectations of the job and others"
good,"If you want to begin a career, then it was fine. If you want to grow your career, then it's a cliquish, impersonal, and overbearing monster of a company that forgot(if they ever cared) that their primary audience is comprised of the same people they employ. Very short-sighted and always looking for a cheap way to save a buck instead of investing in human resources that could help generate greater revenue."
good,"In the mornings I did my daily rounds which included replenishing the items in the kitchen, mail room and bathroom. During the day I would answer calls and report them to the current employee. I would also gather all the deliveries and contact each individual. In the afternoon, I would do some more rounds to make sure everything is stocked at all times. I also work closely with the Accounting and the VP of Business Affairs with billing. Every Monday I would do the consolidated reports for the other locations, using excel. I enjoy working here I just wish I didn't have to temp anymore, the workplace is so much fun and I meet a lot of nice people. The managers are really nice and so are my co-workers. The one thing I learned working here; there are a lot of different people in this world with different personalities and its up to you to get to know everyone and accept them to make a workplace enjoyable.Teamwork is key."
good,"A typical day at work was very similar to that of Media General and my current job with Impak Marketing. I focused on growing my business through cold calling, prospecting, and networking.I learned that my strengths were again communicating with small businesses and helping them develop plan and strategies to market themselves effectively. I absolutely enjoyed the co-workers here. They were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was keeping business. Due to the climate of radio sales, there is a large amount of client turnover especially when you are dealing with local direct clients who can not afford radio campaigns consistently enough for them to be effective."
good,You get overworked and no compensation or advancement for your hardwork. You are the low end of the totem pole but very important to the company. Jocks dont do anything unless they are paid big. So they rely on the street team to work events. I loved the people you meet but not the office politics or poor wage.
good,Wonderful experience as an intern. Although it was challenging I managed to balance the internship and school. I recommend such an experience
good,"Typical day at work is help run contests, screen calls, and maybe help book guests. Sometimes dependent on others who are not necessarily reliable. You have the company's license in your hands... and they pay you like you have the companies dirty towels in your hands. If you kiss the right behinds you might be part of the blessed ones who are on the ""in"" with management."
good,"Over worked and under paid, that's the lifestyle. There is room for movement around the company, but it comes at a cost. As people are laid off your responsibilities seem to become several peoples jobs."
good,"Why is this job never filled?"
good,"Being an account executive 5 years ago was better than it is now. Too much micromanaging. Not enough space. Not enough time to sell, constantly tracking every move"
good,"old radio is missed, new radio is too predictable, too many blaming on each other and never taking blame.  they need to boost morale more, like picnic in the park thing"
good,iHeart/clear channel has a history of huge layoffs. It's a fun company and the management change that happened in Austin recently seems to be positive. But it's a constant rotating door of employees and management. Don't get too comfortable with the staff because it'll change in a day. Uneven pay structure also.
good,Stuff runs down hill.  You don't want to be at the bottom of this hill!
good,The company allow you to be well trained and grow. I believe it's a great place to start your career or take on major challenges to grow.
good,"exciting and fun job, always changing, something new everyday"
good,There are a lot of pluses to working for iHeart but it's scary with how often they let go of their employees and on a regular basis. But it's fun while it lasts
good,"Told “your position has been eliminated” on November 1st, 2019, a new market "
good,i dont like working here. management only care about money. people quit all the time and shove as much of the other peoples work on to the remaining people so they dont have to hire anyone new. ive worked here for a year and a half and have never been able to take a lunch break. i jave to pack a lunch and eat at my desk while working
good,"Love my work: challenging, always keep me busy, always new projects. We work in an agile environment, which is fast paced and a  great learning experience. Not the best culture, management, or benefits. No vacation for the first 6 months and only 1 sick day. No work from home."
good,"Overall the staff and people you work with are great, however management in the corporate office often make bad choices and only after complete failure do they reverse course."
good,"This company doesn't believe in family, customers, employees at all.  They are only interested in making money and they don't care about listeners.  Can't wait till the ship sinks completely!"
good,"Workplace culture was not encouraging to anyone with ambition.  Once you were in a  job, good luck getting advancement."
good,"iHeart Nashville market is highly sensitive atmosphere, lots of changes (negative, per both new and seasoned employees) last ~4 months. Sales Managers care but upper management indifferent. Digital and Auto managers set up for great difficulty/failure"
good,Chaotic work environment.  Life work balance is problematic and the leadership is very inexperienced and antagonistic.
good,"Transitioned from traditional radio commercials to digital marketing. Went to an automated system that excluded outside sales to a web-based system that lowered comission, customer experience and focus."
good,"The work as an on-air personality was fun, enlightening and helps one stay connected with the community; I learned to be more independent and developed in leadership through this being my first corporate experience. Management was not helpful in training and developing employees; Some co-workers were helpful and friendly, others were too competitive and closed off from working together; Hardest part was the compensation received; Most enjoyable: connecting with the community."
good,Clear Channel is a high energy workplace. There is a strong focus on radio advertising. They are looking to hire people with musical interest.
good,"This job was very fun at times, but no job security.  I made it through many layoffs and then finally get let go along with my entire department.  I was a traffice reporter/producer as well as in marketing.  I worked a full time and part time job just to be able to afford to work there.  This was my first full time job out of college and I enjoyed the experience."
good,Company is deeply in debt and can not survive. Upper Management very self centered protecting their own job by chopping others. Direct Management Supervisors very good try to care for their employees
good,They expect total devotion for little pay. Morale is low but they tell you it's high. Do yourself a favor and stay away.
good,"Marknadsavdelningen var underbemannad. Hjälpte till att ta fram en positinering och en marknadsplan för 2015/16. Dessutom coachade jag en junior marknadsmedarbetare. "
good,"Superior vision and foresight at the corporate level. Balanced risk taking with strong research to bolster direction. The 30,000 foot vision is ground breaking in an industry sorely lacking visionaries. However, the private equity style of management at the local market level is sorely lacking and short sighted. Great vision cannot be implemented by spreadsheets and algorithmic processes. The lack of value placed on the people (the few that remain) who work to implement the vision of the company is saddening. Great ideas stacked upon great ideas topped with broad sweeping statements of accountability fall of deaf ears at the front line of the local markets. The workload of those activating at the local level is unfathomable. The stress level at the local level is unbearable. There is no work / life balance. Sixty hour work weeks are the ""reward for being employed""."
good,I get into work and reach out to my coworkers in other markets to figure out what we are missing and make sure we get it sent to me and placed in the system. I enjoy my fellow coworkers because we all know what need to be done and we are all on the same team and get it done with smile on our faces. Hardest part is not being able to get something done because one person isn't communicating with the rest of us.
good,"The big negative is if you don't kiss up to the upper management, no matter well you produce, you don't move up.  The environment does not give the freedom of creativity."
good,"iHeart has some great employees. However, management can sometimes be purposefully secretive when their is no need to be. There is not as much ability to move to different divisions as there would seem to be for a company that size. It is secretly frowned upon."
good,It was a good job to get your feet wet.  I had a good time working as a Radio DJ.  Received some training but not as much as I wanted.  Wish the pay was a little higher wages.
good,"I loved working here but I must say the job security is bad. I  was lucky and dodged bullets for 38 years (!) but I was a rarity. That place had a revolving door! I miss it greatly as I sincerely loved my job. Too bad that a corporate decision eliminated my position in Richmond,"
good,"No bonuses, no raises, no morale. The company used to be much better, but they have taken all the perks away, including the company picnics, the Easter egg hunts for the kids on the lawn, and everything that made this a family. It is no longer that, it is now a corporation. We are expendable."
good,Same as previous.  Only different department. Great co-workers but poor management staff.  My typical day was same as before.  Only product change from radio advertisement to billboard advertisement.
good,"Success and opportunity and the amount of support you get really depends on your management team.  There are drastic differences between local market, national, and corporate management teams."
good,"As far as broadcast entertainment / marketing companies go, iHeartMedia Portland is as forward thinking as you'd hope. A creative, stimulating environment for the content creators / personalities and lots of incentives for the marketing staff.  The facilities are well maintained and equipment is modern. "
good,"very laid back atmosphere,  interesting to see the behind the scenes in the radio industry.  Pay and opportunity for advancement is low."
good,"Being a part of the sales team was a great experience, wonderful co-workers and helpful upper management. However, compensation is 100% commission after a short pre-determined time frame and management has too much control over the assignment/re-assignment of accounts, thereby giving them the ability to decide which reps will make more money than others. Difficult to make good money and local management isn't trained well enough to lead their respective teams in the most effective manner."
good,Very interesting place to work. Great staff and lots of diversity.
good,"the most fun i ever had at a radio station, too bad it couldn't last. top level management couldn't leave well enough alone."
good,"Being with iHeartMedia for 12 years I find working in the corporate world as iHeart continues to expand is very ""cookie cutter"".  Advancement is not always based on performance and hard work, more about a ""good 'ole boy"" mentality.  "
good,"Treating others with fairness, respect and empathy – always"
good,"The people here are great, good vibes, but the pay is horrible! Also, depending on where you work, they will lay you off in a second. There is no job security."
good,it's a radio company with about 8 radio stations and about 75 employees.  Big corporate company but feels like a mom & pop local business. i Heart Media
good,"Although they mean well the folks at iHeart have gotten themselves into a difficult position. Radio seems to be late to the party when it comes to evolving media and how the population consumes it. With that being said iHeart was in money saving mode when I worked there as opposed to money spending mode. Salaries are low and raises do not occur in ""money saving mode."" I would suggest looking for work at a more cutting edge and future-savvy media company."
good,When I used to work there it was a fun place to work and learn more about the industry as I had no media experience. Co-workers at the time were happy to answer my questions.
good,"The job is not what you hope that it would be when working with the biggest media company in the world. The is more micromanaging done than needed and there are favorites in the company.  If you aren't in the cliche, you won't get the accounts."
good,The work/life balance and outside sales regimen allowed for a lot of autonomy. The creative process and sales cycle with each client requires a high amount of needs based analysis and a proficiency in project management skills.
good,"One would be hard pressed to find a more fun place to work than a cluster of bustling radio stations full of colorful characters and attractive people. However, if you don't make your sales quota, don't expect to be given much leeway. Hirings and firings were commonplace during my short tenure."
good,"I was with this company for ten years,  When I started it was long hours but the payoff was what made it worth it.  Towards the end, a different management team was in place that wanted to clean house.  The culture has always been irreverent and not politically correct, but I guess that's the thing I liked the most."
good,"It didn't matter how much I worked my butt off and did everything the bosses ever asked.  No matter what I did, I was prohibited from achieving my goals."
good,"laid back environment, flexible work schedule, casual attire."
good,"At times it seemed that working in promotions could be a little slow and sort of a drag at times, but it is definitely a position that allows one to do things most people wouldn't get to do. Working the street always gives an opportunity to experience a new event with new people and new clients."
good,"Administration in the office in the morning then travelling all over having meetings with my team, auditing and carrying out training. I have learned how to manage challenging people and how to work in a very reactive job. The hardest part of the job is trying to plan for things that you have to react to so i have to be very resouceful and able to work when i am out on the road when i have limited access to information. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing a new starter flourish or seeing someone who has done the job in a certain way for over 20 years change their ways for the best."
good,Many of the people that work in the Boston office have been in the radio industry for years.  I've learned a great deal from the people in the office.
good,A lot of opportunities to learn but not many to advance. Management changes a bit too often. No clear direction.
good,"Cold call daily up to 3-4 hours of calling"
good,"I worked for the company for many years with one raise. In fact, they stopped quarterly bonuses, so I never made as much as I did the first 2 years during any of the following 7.  The bottom line is all that matters.  You can bust your rump or put forth the bare minimum effort. Doesn't much matter, as long as sales goals are met.  You do get a celebrity sighting in the halls every now and again. That is somewhat exciting."
good,"The corporate structure was terrible but, that being said, the team I got to work with was amazing."
good,Entreprise en perpetuelle adapatation et reorganisation face a son marche tres concurrentiel
good,Clear Channel has amazing people working there. Just compensation and advancement is almost null for my position
good,"Assist multiple Account Executive and Managers, transferred calls to corresponding departments. Performed administration tasks such as filing, sending log times. Running reports, expense reports, etc..."
good,At the time of working here was great til corporate got involved. Then would eliminate jobs just for a number and stock values.
good,"Typical day at work: Correlating presentations, consumer needs analysis, and increasing Marketing to expose and increase traffic for Business Owners. In addition, I provided my expertise in new business prospecting, excellent customer service skills, development and execution of marketing and promotions plans for new and existing advertisers, following through and follow up with clients during and after campaigns, collected any balances owed and manage their accounts with an eye toward producing creative results for advertisers while enhancing radio station revenues and profitability."
good,"Learned great skills, fun experience, enjoyed the commercial writing, traveling, remotes, live broadcasts, working with new businesses, great sales manager who went on a lot of calls with his employees. Very long hours, hard work, lots of traveling. Not enough compensation due to the hours of work and all the tasks we were responsible for. Needed an assistant to help with developing the ad campaigns and commercial writing. I did enjoy staying busy and multi-tasking. There was no compensation for wear and tear on your personal vehicle, gas, mileage was not a part of the salary. The salary was not sufficient enough to make a decent living off of. The system was set up in a way where the employees did not make a decent living."
good,"CC is a good company but it turns over employees at a very high rate. There is a ton of political pressure here and the management plays favorites with new account assignments. The management in the Dayton, Ohio office is lazy, and out of touch with reality. If there was a strong management team here this would be a diamond in the rough."
good,"I worked for this company making $7.00 an hour (lower than what minimum wage was raised above immediately after I left) The job was SO fun for someone who is as social as me! As long as you see it as I did as a ""paid social life"" it's a great job. I worked here part time because I could not afford to pay my bills living in the DC area on $7.00 an hour. My boss here, who was full time, made A LOT less than I did at my full time job alone ($14.00 an hour) and she worked about 60-70 hours per week. Good old salary for ""upper level"" positions."
good,"In the ever changing corporate world of radio, iHeartMedia is at the foreground of that change. Their new focus is regional hubs that utilize A.I. to program all of the local markets. Dislocating all of their local talent."
good,"Positives: The people and culture overall are very fun and tight knit (but not cliquey), you get to go to a lot of really cool events, free tickets, exposure to artists and events, good location just outside the city (with free garage parking!), cool office space"
good,"I wanted to chip in. I was kind of grandfathered in through a tech company they acquired. The pay was actually quite good for this area. The problem is that I'm terrible at setting boundaries so I lived at work. This was not a problem for anyone in my office, and it was pretty common. "
good,"A typical day at work is non-stop workflow from many sources. Sales requests, management requests, training others. There is no respite in sight and no raises either."
good,"Don't stay long. It is a good job to get in, connect with entertainment leaders, and then get out. They pay horrible and their benefits are even worse. You get close with colleagues but that is about it."
good,"This is not the fun radio job everyone thinks it is. This i hard work. 100% commission based. High stress job. This job is not for everyone. In fact, it is for the very few!"
good,"Pros"
good,It was intense at times. And was a position that did challenge and sharpen my edges however though. Working for media you will be exposed to a lot of great events and opportunities so embrace that.
good,It is usually a place where people can laugh and tell jokes to one another. I don't mind being there because the time flies by and sometimes people bring in free food for the staff.
good,"Cool company to work for, lots of free mini concerts and entertainment perks. Can learn a lot because there's always so much work to do. But can be extremely hard to advance. No real opportunity unless you're with the in crowd."
good,"A typical day consisted of basically running your own sales business utilizing the products that iHeartMedia had to offer.  Networking, cold calling and using referrals were part of how I obtained new customers. Managing existing clients was also a major part of the job.  The issue at iHeart was the ineffective managerial team.  Each manager had their own agenda based on their bonuses.  This dictated what products they wanted you sell.  We had many products including radio broadcast of Indians baseball, 7 radio stations, CAVS Basketball broadcasts, iHeartRadio in-app products, digital radio, event marketing, etc.. Also with so many managers there was apparently not enough money to maintain an effective support staff for helping to write proposals, input orders, create sales pieces, etc.. I could go on and on but I think I'll stop there."
good,"iHeart is undergoing massive amounts of change.  Lots of opportunity to re-do old systems, so might be for you if you like hard challenges.  There are many good people still there so there is lots of potential for good things to happen."
good,"I love the people I work with, but the lack of career advancement is a problem with this company.  Also, the financial stability seems to dictate bonus payouts, performance pay and promotions w/compensation commensurate with experience and market."
good,"The overall atmosphere is very relaxed, but since it became IHM instead of Clear Channel the level of employee/family experience has reduced dramatically.  They dont really care about the employees now."
good,Lots of opportunities at one of the most progressive radio companies. Lots of great perks. Understaffed local office with high demands. Tons of chances to learn and try new things.
good,Un buen lugar para trabajar teniendo en cuenta que el salario es ajustado y no existe promoción interna
good,You do get to meet a great deal of cool people while working in this field. The sales team works well together.  The hardest part of the job would be finding the prospects to sell the product to.
good,"Truly interesting company with a real niche product to be sold. There are a number of experienced people within the business who can be a good help when it comes to learning the ropes. There are however too many decision makers and not enough people with their head in the ""process"" itself."
good,"Used to be one of the best jobs a person could have. I enjoyed this job more than any other job. Allowed creativity, as well as being around very creative people"
good,I have worked for iHeartMedia for almost 7 years. I have been able to grow my marketing skills and experience a lot of different challenges.
good,Good way to get your foot in the door and learn about radio. You get to learn from your mistakes. Hardest part of working here are the hours and schedule.
good,"A great group of people to work with, but little tolerance for issues that may be beyond your control. Having holidays off is a rare thing in this business so that was nice. Advancement is difficult as there is limited room for growth in your field unless you want to move to a different city or state."
good,"•	Executed on site radio promotions; set up and breakdown promo displays"
good,Must be adaptable to constant change. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting out in the community
good,"Clear Channel Entertainment might still exist but the concert group was eventually spun off and became Live Nation. It was a fun and challenging environment working with the sponsorship and marketing team, but being in the live events/music industry at the time meant that compensation was low. Career advancement was also not available. The most enjoyable part was working with a wide variety of brands and coming to know their marketing goals and then attending a large majority of the concerts we promoted. It was a great opportunity to learn how to work with diverse marketing plans, clients, and temperaments. Our sales cycle was long - about 8 months - but resulting contracts were typically big."
good,Some days I would go to work and say to myself they are really going to pay me to work here! It was alot of fun and a enjoyable learning experience. My co-workers and management were alot of help and patient. This was my first job in media and it really got me hooked!
good,the people that work there are great people.. great attitude.. just didn't like the management style
good,"In recent months, management prioritized company standards above employee moral. Lack of support and guidance. Judgement before solution process. Company investors trump employee happiness."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company. The culture was positive, the opportunities to progress were good, but they fell short of salary and overall benefits."
good,Job was intense but Managers were fair and encouraging. Workplace culture was enjoyable.  The hardest part of the job was the workload. The most enjoyable part of the job was the support from Management.
good,"I generally enjoy working at iHeart Media.  In a typical day, I arrive in the morning, plan my day and then spend most of the afternoon out on sales calls before arriving back at the office in the afternoon.  I like that my schedule is flexible and that I am the one who decides on what I do that day.  Sales in this market are unstable.  Sometimes they are great and other times they are not.  There is little help from management when in a ""rut."" I get along well with my coworkers but there is a lot of resistance to change and negativity and uncertainty about the future.  The unstable sales commission as well as the negativity of coworkers are ultimately my reasons for leaving."
good,I worked for WLAC radio for nearly 20 years until I was let go due to budget cuts in 2017. I always enjoyed my role at iHeartMedia and was given the chance to “wear many different hats.” I had hoped to retire there but now need to look for my next career.
good,"I would like to see a stronger effort put into more full-time opportunities. The people are still the driving force for success when it comes to the on-air product. If there is no room for advancement, then why would a person continue or care about doing their job well? Also, the amount of work we do does not warrant 8.10 and hour. It is worth at least $10 to $12 an hour."
good,This job is good for getting into events and adding experience to your resume.  The pay is sub-par and not many move up within the company.  It was fun while it lasted so I'd say learn and grow where you can and move on.
good,"The people in my office were fantastic, but after 5 years of no raises and only one bonus, it was nice to move on. I did enjoy support in terms of software and hardware, for what I did."
good,You are just a cog in the machine. The salary and working conditions leave a lot to be desired. The opportunities to progress are limited unless you stay there for a very long time.
good,Something strange about this company is that the IT management team changes every 2-3 years...and each time a new CIO comes they get rid of all the pre-existing management team..and bring their one people. again in 3 years it is a repeat. I wish the CEO of this companies provides some stability by bringing qualified professionals to this IT department.
good,"I prefer to be challenged by my work but management has not allowed me the opportunity to expand my accounting knowledge. Also, taking on more responsibility should equate to more pay."
good,"If you enjoy change, this is a good place for you. The people who work here are awesome, and the office is an open concept with pool/ping pong tables. However, the requirements and rules change almost weekly, leading it to be a very stressful environment and making it hard to get your job done. Commission is uncapped, so if you can manage sales and stick out the changes, you'll be able to make a lot of money."
good,Changing Culture - The importance of multi media advertising has become clear. Solid company with lots of opportunity to help business owners. Strong in market.
good,I like to work with the other employees because we can tell jokes to each other and there is sometimes free food in the kitchen and I love to eat it all.
good,"I did not work there long, but good company and ambitious.  Really looking for top talent I n the on-air industry.  They are focused on the overall prize in relation to which market segment they are in."
good,"If you arent willing to voice track multiple locations, or arent given the chance to do it, your time will be numbered there. You have to wear many hats, and do things that normal clusters would have 2 other people doing. You may be the only local person at your station as well."
good,"Typically would be in the office by 730am, go over any orders and emails that were urgent. After any morning meetings I would plan the rest of my day out. "
good,"Not a lot of down time and when there is, something is going to be wrong."
good,"A typical day was always a challenge and interesting because you never knew who was going to call or what kind of issue would come up during a phone call.  I enjoyed staying in contact with my customers to make sure they had everything they needed to pay their bills promptly.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who were habitually past due, but always enjoyed finding a new creative way to get them to pay."
good,"I loved the managers that I reported to, felt great about my work output most days, but the sales staff had no respect for the company procedure and were often empowered to push the support staff around to meet the unrealistic demands of the customers that they managed to hook."
good,"Pay and benefits are terrible compared to market average, management is very disconnected."
good,"180 total baseball games covered (including spring training)."
good,Clear Channel media and Entertainment is a great company. Fast pace work environment. the managers provide good incentives for reaching goals and budgets.
good,"après 20 ans dans cette société , seul regret de l'avoir quitté"
good,"Propected local businesses to purchase radio adverstisment. Handled my clients billing. Made schedules to run said clients commercials. Wrote, edited and voiced commercials."
good,"Easy jobs, no security.  Radio has been in trouble and their layoffs are a reflection of that."
good,A very fast paced environment and a great group of people to work with.
good,"A typical day at work is very evenly paced.  I have deadlines to meet but, as long as my co-workers do their part I can easily meet these deadlines.  I have learned a lot at my job.  I had never worked in radio until I started here 8 years ago.  Working in radio has been fun and I have met a lot of great people.  I work with some great people but, it's just like anywhere you have to take the bad with the good.  We have had some recent Upper Management changes and I don't feel like the changes made are best for the company or our Market."
good,"Management really wanted you to do everything. From finding new client, setting up appointments, closing deals, making commercial script, designing scheduling, collecting money, all while you had to search for new clients. Work load could become very heavy."
good,"Gestion des entreprises en génie civile. "
good,Empresa com ambiente de trabalho muito boa. Nunca atrasou salários e benefícios
good,"The hours are long and the pay is so low. Each week has different events and promotions so your schedule is never consistent. It is a very relaxed environment in the office and workers can wear jeans and sneakers if they want. The events are a lot of fun, especially if its a big concert but the cell phone stores and car dealership promos get boring."
good,"very hard place to work, 9 out 10 do not stay."
good,The hardest part of the job was there were too many people making decisions and not enough doing the work.
good,Fewer and fewer employees means loads of work for those who are left. Automation and imported content are the norm but that is more an industry standard required to remain competitive.
good,"Corporate with a lot of employees, you can get lost in the pool of people.  sometimes you can be creative, but mostly just need to adhere to the corporate template."
good,"Outdated as far as systems and technology. They are focusing more on events at this point, but management is okay and you get summer Fridays if you’re an assistant"
good,"Work for yourself environment with great upper staff support. You are as successful as the work you put in! It is nice to be trusted to ""run your own business."" Show up, do the work and you will be prosperous."
good,Working in media means things take time and you have to wait for your turn. The best example of accepting pay difficult to live off of for quite a long time for certain departments.
good,"The work of generating business, researching companies and creating presentations was not a problem. I was conflicted about getting small business owners to spend their marketing dollars ineffectively."
good,Learned a lot regarding digital media and multi-platform media. Limited opportunity for financial and career growth due to employees who grandfathered revenue .
good,This was a perfect example of how NOT to take a job.  I was lured away from my previous employer (of 17 years) and put into a position BEFORE my supervisor was hired.  BAD DECISION to take the job on my part.
good,"They love hiring younger cheaper labor who don't question authority. So if you are young, willing to work for peanuts with minimal opinions, this is your company!"
good,"I enjoyed the actual work at iheart, however, there was always so much push back with new ideas or methods of trying to get a good end result. They would claim you were trained in something then when you would have anything to say back about it was terms for termination."
good,My time at on the digital team has been really great because of the people. Great collaboration and everyone is friendly. The other teams are not as lucky as the group in the downtown office. The rest of the company seems a bit scattered on business priorities and are not willing to put resources behind their goals which trickles into the downtown team and expectations. This makes getting things done very difficult.
good,"I had my best manager of my life at this company, and also had my worst.  The good one was invested in my personal fulfillment and always checked in to see if I was happy.  This made me very loyal to her and the company."
good,"Not really the greatest place for someone from this side of the river to try and find work in the production side of radio. The company tends to hire Canadian residents for the broadcasting side of the business and ship promotions this side of the border."
good,"Team and goal oriented, however, you are allowed to work independently to achieve your individual goal.  Each media department  (i.e., radio, TV,  outdoor) is managed separately ,therefore, the workplace atmosphere may vary."
good,"like any job you get out of it what you put into it.  you must be dedicated to the lifestyle because the job doesn't end at 5pm, its 365 24/7 - no holidays."
good,The company was poorly managed.  When I was there management was terrible. They did not train you because they didn't know what was going on half of the time.  The work life balance was great.  I loved my co-workers I just wish they had better management.
good,"Work hard and make great money but don't intend to have any personal time. This is a 24/7 job, i've even taken client calls as late as 11pm on New Years Eve."
good,It is very difficult to get more than the limited 29 hrs per week. Advancement takes years. You pretty much have to devote all available free time often working for free. Most interns have been stuck in an intern role for years before they are hired in a part time position they want.
good,"I was paid a pittance to do the work of two positions. Old technology was still being used and would constantly fail, causing audits to fail as well. Used as a scapegoat due to commercials not airing."
good,"I was on 2 stations, 101.5 WIBA fm and 96.3 Star Country. I was privileged to have the ability to be an on air personality and enjoy the honor of meeting a multitude of artists."
good,"You are really competing for hours at this job. It depends how many events there happen to be and you have to be available no matter what day or time or it will bee given to someone else. It truly is a job on the side, don't depend on it."
good,"i could work for them again under contract, sales or production/announcer. still in touch today with friends that still work there.. 10 hour days- client liaison- copy right or voice production. final studio production- schedule for air. work place culture is relaxed spotted with deadline crunches- enjoyed my fellow employees"
good,iHeart Media is a fast paced cutting edge radio group.  Management is really good to work with.  A lot of initiatives implemented to help increase sales.
good,"Poor management, obvious favoritism, and poor office place ethics. However, with new management it would be a really fun job. "
good,Fun place to intern. Met a lot of cool people including celebrities while working events. Got to see how NY radio stations operate day to day. Sometimes long days for promotional events due to location.
good,"Company perks were great"
good,"I was in charge of facilitating classes in all aspects of training in advertising, and founded The Tennessean Advertising Academy.  My husband and I had to relocate for his job so I was unable to continue my career with this company."
good,Started as an Account Executive and worked into management to assist in running an entire Local and National Sales Department(s); as well as helping to develop NEW Broadcast/Marketing platforms.
good,"Fast paced, corporate driven climate. A lot of work, no raises.  Some advancement opportuinity, mainly for men. Exciting for people who are interested in technology and advancements. That is the focus of the company. And sales.  Everything is money driven."
good,"I worked as a Coordinator when the company was Clear Channel. This was my 1st career after graduating college. I started out a Sales Assistant.  The AE's were veterans and coached the newbies very well. The training provided was very thorough. I moved up quickly, however the  poor compensation and medical benefits were not enough incentive to convince me to stay. I loved working as a team. I loved the company outings, community involvement with volunteer projects such as The United Way of New York and many networking opportunities."
good,"The job was fantastic when I was working with a specific morning team. However, when the team was split up they brought in another host who was very difficult to work with it showed on air. Very challenging environment for producing quality content."
good,"It was a fun atmosphere and experience.  Everyone shows up to talk about sports, but there is a lot more detail involved than you would think.  It showed me that the separation is in the preparation if you to have a good show  and that can be applied to any career."
good,"This was a fun place to work at first, but became stressful do to cut backs.  Media can be a very difficult place to work, but also a very competitive place to work."
good,"I have over 20 years of working experience with iHeartMedia.  My job is fun, exciting and financially rewarding, but I feel I have reached my ceiling, without having to relocate to New York.  I prefer to remain within the Memphis area for family and personal reasons."
good,"Clear Channel Radio was a nice place to work. It allowed further training and growth potential within the company and advancement was easily obtained with hard work, dedication and job performance evaluations."
good,No question one of the better work environments in metro Atlanta. Radio is a tough industry right now but they have a generous compensation plan especially for those who can close new local clients and owner operators.
good,"Fun place to work, but if your an AE, you live with day to day stress. Constantly worrying about accounts canceling or not renewing. Company needs to get their digital and social media strategy up to speed."
good,"High volume communications and emails. Dealing with a lot of agencies and advertisers. Nice work space to work in. Every working day, is a busy day."
good,"The Morning Show starts the day for listeners.  Get's the overnight headlines, traffic updates and weather, latest music on the air early.  A pleasant way to start the day.  I've learned to edit audio with the latest Adobe software.  There is nothing hard about it.  I have enjoyed working in Radio for over 30 years."
good,Highly competitive atmosphere.  Upper management always seemed to be in constant turmoil.  No consistent clear direction.
good,It was a great place for a start to the radio industry.  They are cutting edge when it comes to new ways to adapt to media.
good,I produced commercials for a handful of radio stations and was allowed a certain level of creativity in how I went about it.
good,"Enjoyed it, learned a lot about the industry. However realized from this I do not want to do radio."
good,I really enjoyed the news aspect of the position. I liked being able to be out all day gathering sound and photos for the news
good,"It was a great experience, always thankful for work experience"
good,Fun Place to work if you love music. Free breakfast on Thursdays!
good,Get to go to free concerts and meet artists. Free Rudy's breakfast tacos on Thursdays!
good,"Performed P&L/GL and Balance Sheet accounts analysis"
good,helping clients with their advertising.  Entering in orders and answering phone calls.
good,"I was part of a great small team with phenomenal leadership. "
good,"	Develop new advertising client, database, Establish client needs, consistent client follow up for advertising needs"
good,"Really enjoyed pursuing one of my passions which is sports. Unfortunately, the time came when I had to move on to bigger things but it was an excellent experience!"
good,great company with lots of room to grow. Team atmosphere. Management willing to help in any way they can
good,"A mostly entertaining environment in the radio industry. "
good,"Clear Channel is a large ship changing its course of direction and with that comes the growing pains of reduction in force and also the fact that the company is wanting to expand. "
good,"Door-to-door sales, B2B on air advertising. Fun, yet high pressure, high stress, fast-paced atmosphere."
good,There are a ton of advantages to working for a company like Clear Channel. The resources they have are second to none! The problem is it's like a lot of big companies where politics comes into play for management positions. There are a number of managers in the company that aren't qualified for their positions.
good,"Radio is a sales organization and selling is the number one focus all day everyday.  I learned how to multi-task and prioritize and keep an up attitude in the most stressful of situations.  Learn your managers style and how to work with their personality.  Respect your co-workers and make them your team, not your competition and everyone wins. Working internally in the office is as important as how you handle clients and managers.  Working with people and creating exciting plans and implementing the plan for maximum results is fulfilling....working with the intent to make money ethically and to help a non profit makes me smile.  Creating marketing plans that made my clients money and grew their business was the best satisfaction of all."
good,A typical day is spent keying approximately 70-90 invoices per day to the market to ensure prompt payment to our vendors.
good,"My responsibilities were to set up and break down the promotion equipment for live events.  This also included a radio personality to be there to meet and greet listeners.  I also was responsible for prize give-aways, transporting equipment to the remote locations and making sure the work space is clean."
good,Has its ups and downs great people but often off track. can get to full potential with more organization
good,Overall people are friendly and management is flexible.  Job Security maybe another issue.  Management has a moderate turn over rate.
good,"Stock, Cashier, Clean up, Dressing room, returns"
good,"In a typical day I work out then head to work for a full day of sales, marketing, PR, HR and marketing."
good,I learned a lot as a young adult out of college starting with Clear Channel.  I gained a ton of vital work experience while discovering that I have amazing work ethic.
good,"This job allowed me to hire, train and manage a team of highly motivated sales reps who were able to implement integrated marketing campaigns for potential and key account clients."
good,Corporate America out of Texas is not fun to deal with. They are not interested in local public affairs. The  bottom line is work a very people to the  maximum with little pay.
good,"Great Training is available and you'll be taught the ropes in an organized, well-thought-out fashion.  Media Sales can be lucrative, but it's also stressful.  This is a 100% Commission compensation position, so one needs to be highly organized.  "
good,"Really good company to begin your sales career! The perks are nice too! (free tickets, free meals, meeting celebrities, etc.)"
good,"Over 5 years at Clear Channel, you get to meet some really amazing people along the way and I think that working in broadcasting and making life-long friendships is something that can only be looked upon as successful."
good,"I typically spend the day at my desk or in meetings, BUT I am lucky to work with 30 markets across the globe, as well as with different partner agencies and I am also surrounded by a great and enthusiastic team."
good,You will work with people from all walks of life here. There is great diversity in the work place and fun atmosphere. A great place to express your creativity.
good,Media and Entertainment is an exciting field that offers potentially huge rewards for high achievement. You work in a diverse environment that affords you the opportunity to learn about numerous industries.
good,Good people to work with. Hard to move up within the company.
good,Working at Clear Channel was an introduction into the work I love to do.
good,Good exposure to current marketing trends. Hiring SVP was very good.
good,Still a good company and leader in the field. Leads the industry in ratings and involvment in thecommunity. Has a good balance in terms of types of stations offrered.
good,Very busy and hectic environment in newsroom. Learned to multi task and prioritize. Learned how to work with different personalities and managing styles. Working through holidays and inclement weather was a challenge. Great experience.
good,"Time goes by quickly; great coworkers,  Many opportunities to learn.  Great benefits; fun working in broadcasting.  It is a worldwide company, so there is room for growth."
good,"iHeartMedia is a great company to work for, until it isn't. I learned something new everyday. It's a company that is innovative, creative and offers clients a wealth of marketing and branding opportunities. However, I was terminated after a 3 month medical leave of absence.  Although I really enjoyed working for the company, I can't say anything positive about job security or compassion for an employee that gets sick."
good,"As long as you are disciplined with your time, you have all of the freedom you want. There really is no job culture at iHeart because everyone is on their own. They do not want you in the office and as they would put it ""9-4 you're out the door."""
good,"Day starts with meetings"
good,Not much pay but it's a good place to gain experience and learn more about the media business and there are a lot of nice people that work in the company.
good,"Plenty of company parties and events with alcohol. My position had a quarterly bonus, provided we pulled the numbers. I was drastically underpaid for what was done for the company. Culture is competitive to a cut-throat degree, and no secret is safe amongst the gossipers. Gross mishandling of funds among the executives."
good,iHeart Media has a great corporate culture and as well as compensation. I would recommend it to a friend if they were looking for a career. I enjoyed my time while working there.
good,"Go to work,. "
good,company debt starting to affect daily operatins.  benefits declining.  manager is awesome department great to work in  no advancement potential.  flex time to care for elderly parent
good,Management was good to work for but asked to much from anyone person on the billing teams.   and they were just started bringing the billing from the stations. I enjoyed the people there.
good,"For me, the best part of the job was my managers gave me the freedom to work and create how I saw fit for each project.  "
good,Amazing people and culture. Perfect work-life balance. There is limited growth opportunity though. I enjoy working here but not the right place for growth
good,The job is fun with lots of flexibilty.   The product is hard to sell though.   Creative thinkers will do well here.   There are a lot of perks like tickets and trade that come with this.   Ability to overcome rejection is a must.
good,"Great work environment but pay is lacking. No dress code which is great staff is friendly, if they paid you for what you actually do it would be one of the if not best company."
good,"As my background is in retail and insurance, it was a refreshing change to learn something new, advertising.  At my previous companies I did accounts receivable, accounts payable, some purchasing, and some security, which was good to have in all aspects of what I am currently doing at iHeart.  Clear Channel, or iHeart, as it is known now, is a multimedia, multiplatform company that is nationwide, selling advertising spots on Radio and TV, as well as billboards, and of course is the home of iHeart Radio and iHeart Music Festivals."
good,"I learned a lot about radio sales"
good,"My manager is a ""prince"" of a human being.  He is fair and realistic and flexible in ways that are important to me in the work place."
good,Many times there are no answers to a lot of questions about why things are done certain ways. Advancement seems intangible. Other than that it's fun work and fun people.
good,"This is a big company that had a fairly expansive on-boarding processes, then mediocre support, training and career development."
good,I get here and my day starts right away.  No coffee for this girl needed.  I have learned that you cannot finish everything that you need to do in one day and you must find a stopping point at the end of the day unless of course it was a task that had to be completed on a date and time. I like my coworkers but as a manager you learn when you need to be a boss or a friend. With all the layoffs like everywhere else it's hard to not have a backup.  At the end of the day I am proud to say that I did my best and results happened.
good,It is intense and competitive with fair hours and compensation. Great   relationships with coworkers and managers.
good,"Job consisted of cold calling and meeting in market at airports with businesses marketing representatives or owners. Learned valuable sales skills such as lead generation, cold calling, contract negotiation and closing skills. Also developed both in person and phone/email sales communication skills."
good,"Radio is fun even though it's a corporate environment.  The people are eclectic and interesting, never dull."
good,Managed all aspects of a 24 hour 7 day a week Traffic & News gathering division of Clear Channel.
good,It was a great learning and growth experience as i was able to manage in a multi station platform. Employees were great as was support staff. I will be maintaining relationships with all.
good,"Enjoyed co-workers and respectful upper management. However, top down management from corporate allowed very little local input based on our own knowledge of the market place."
good,"Like most companies they are constanly down sizing. While working there we have health insurance, 401K and vision. Working condition were good"
good,"great to have on your resume, but do not pay their employees enough especially the ones not making commission. The management and people are awesome to work with."
good,"The job was a 2-parter for me.  The broadcast part was par excellence for me and I enjoyed 99% of it.  However, the office side produced lack of interest for the station in which I worked."
good,The company had some financial issues that they are working thru via Bankruptcy that caused employees some concerns...employees needs to feel that they job is not in jeopardy and they have a career
good,"Fun place and great people with a workplace that felt like family.  Interesting work and good tools, processes, and work location flexibility."
good,"The job is a good starting point for a news anchor, but unfortunately opportunities to advance are not there, because of downsizing. Everyone is overworked because they are doing the jobs of 1.5 to 2 people. Despite this, we all try to help each other and it is a loving environment. However, I work in solitude for most of my shift so I don't see that."
good,I wrote news and was usually given assignments.  I learned to write quality work under quick and constant deadlines.  Management was fair and the culture was relaxed.  The hardest part of the job was working the overnight shift.  The most enjoyable part is that I love to write.
good,"always sitting"
good,"iHeart radio, formally Clear Channel Radio has some of the best people in the business to work with and the most talent individuals to learn from. Really glad I got my experience from such great management."
good,"Got to know all lot of listeners meet & greet bands, artist ,team players from the Chicago Fire ,White Sox. Its fun to be out in the streets giving away free give aways. Interact with the clients , customers."
good,I worked for this company when it was still Clear Channel Communications. It was a wonderful learning experience and working in radio was very fulfilling. Each day was different and even though I wasn't compensated very heavily monetarily there were still a lot of fun and exciting benefits that kept me loving my job.
good,A workplace for growth and opportunity provides encouragement and learning.  Building relationships are important for growth.  I have developed a professional interaction with others.
good,Wonderful people and amazing group to work with. Extremely busy but really fun work. There was a wet blanket thrown on us because we knew that bankruptcy was looming.
good,"Relaxed and comfortable environment, Enjoy the team I work with and the relationship I have developed with my team members."
good,Handle live production responsibilities for AM talk radio. Operating multiple computer systems. Interacting with callers and show hosts. Pre/Post production editing and planning. Coordinating satellite broadcasts and planning weekend programing.
good,"I was very fortunate to work at the radio station.   I was able to be creative in my skits, was able to interview many important people, and had several opportunities to travel.  The hardest part of the job was staying there for 6 years and only getting a few hours a week at minimum wage."
good,"I am an Account Executive at Clear Channel Media & Entertainment. My position entails primarily Radio advertising but also taps into Digital, Streaming, Promotions, and Events. Because of this, it is an exciting work environment that changes daily with duties. I handle a list of clients/accounts that range from small to large in terms of advertising spending."
good,"It was an amazing and fun learning experience. The team is a great one, but corporate has a lot of red tape to circle around things. Corporate expects a lot more than a small market can provide and loves to micromanage. You’ll only make a few cents more taking on an extra work load by trying to “make it to the top” in this company. The room for growth isn’t there. iHeartRadio gives you an amazing set of skills to use in other areas of employment. Once you established your skills and put in a few years, look for another job willing to pay you double!"
good,I love the environment and employees but the pay isn’t competitive. People are friendly and inviting. Occasionally you get to meet a cool comedian or artist
good,"Many perks unique experiences, an acceptable amount of freedom from such a large company. Many changing positions and additional responsibilities that give you unique opportunities."
good,"Loved this job. Production, promotions, copywriting and so on, for this radio giant. Lots of in house competition and access to the best radio computer software in the business at the time."
good,"Very competitive place to work, very fast paced job. A typical day is selling and analizing reports"
good,I only worked here for about a year and I was only the receptionist. My experience with this company is very limited. What I would/could say about it is relatively negative regarding what I witnessed in the treatment of the local program directors and personalities.
good,The job seems like it would be a dream job but the company is not what it seems.  The demand will destroy several employees and the time the employers demand of you is too much to bear.
good,Made calls all day and answered customers questions. I learned all the ins and outs of the mortgage loan business. Management was very good. Open minded and helpful when needed. My co-workers were helpful and good people as well. The hardest part was hearing no so much but overtime the Yes's would feel great! The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay checks at the end of them month! Great commissions.
good,"L'écoute, le donnant-donnant sont les clefs de ma réussite."
good,"The company I worked for in 1983 (Taft) became Great American (1997) and was sold to Jacor in 1996, eventually becoming Clear Channel, the largest media company in the world.  Utilizing the latest technology the company began consolidating and eliminating staff and positions.  While some were unfortunate to be downsized, many have gone on to success."
good,"This building is cut throat. Play sucks but perks make it worth it. You can easily make life long friends but also be aware that some people have that ""what can you do for me"" mentality. It was one of the most funs years of my life but as I look back I am glad I no longer work there."
good,"Friendly environment however it tends to get segregated, not much room for growth, easy to get stuck in a position, would rather hire many part timers than full time"
good,This job is great at times but it has it's challenges. I wold recommend this job to anyone as long as you know what you're getting into. You need to have patience to build success. It won't come without a lot of hardwork and time. There is $ there though. Your manager makes a BIG difference. Make sure you find one you like.
good,"IHeartmedia is a really great place to work."
good,"indeed is making me do this.  So I'm just going to continue to type words until it meets the minimum criteria to move forward.  Working in radio is super fun when you're the on-air talent, or in digital marketing."
good,iHeart is a great company to work for.  I would like to relocate for personal reasons and that is why I am applying for positions in other markets.  iHeart offers many opportunites but none are available currently where I want to be.
good,"Intern for radio morning show, ""AJ in the Morning"" on Star 94.1 as well as the promotions department. Made a lot of amazing memories with the morning show crew, it was the same show that I grew up listening to during middle school and high school, an amazing experience!"
good,"Long hours, poor leadership, uncompetitive pay.  This is a tough place to work, there is a lot of turn over here.  People are expendable to leadership."
good,"A very competitive company, Radio is fast paced fun atmosphere. People of iHeart are wonderful and bond like a second family. "
good,"The atmosphere was stressful with the management. The rest of the people were fun to work with, They downsized to the point that people were doing 3 peoples jobs with no monetary compensation."
good,"fun, entertaining, stressful place, never enough hours in the day to complete workload, workload heavy, no time to really enjoy the benefits like the ping pong table."
good,"Amazing things happened in that building and it felt like sometimes it was in spite of the surroundings. Everyone is on edge waiting for something bad to happen, usually it never does. I had to work 60+ hour weeks to keep my head above water."
good,"I was contracted through a temp agency to work for Clear Channel Outdoor.  It was hard work and understaffed. I loved it. I stayed busy and most of the time the day flew by. People had their clicks, just like any job. The parts I wasn't crazy about, if the supervisor or team lead did not like you, you were not going to last there. Even with doing a great job and surprising everyone with how fast you catch on, this did not matter if you were not liked. Things were done or forgot to be done if you were that person.  I was really not liked because when I caught onto what was happening I started emailing my request so I may have a paper trail. Well, they got me. The weekend before I was let go my infant daughter was hospitalized from Friday night to Sunday evening (this was during my days off). I went back to work during my normal shift on Monday with no issues. Tuesday, while at work, I was called saying my daughter was running a temperature and needed to get picked up. I informed the proper people of the situation. I was told that was fine but to make sure I set my away message on my email until Monday. I was told this is standard to set it up like that. It didn't sound right but I did as I was told and had to go pick up my child. Due to my child being hospitalized just a few days earlier,  I had to take her into her doctors to be checked. I informed the proper parties about the soonest appointment was the next day and I had to go due to paperwork that had to be signed. I was told that was fine and they will see me the next day. The evening of the next day I was called by the"
good,I loved working at Clear Channel. Promotions is an exciting field and being able to go to a music festival and call it work was absolutely thrilling. I couldn't have asked for a better experience or a better mentor.
good,*Set up the radio stations display while promotional materials at events were organized to attract public attention to the company’s message.
good,The radio culture was vibrant and exciting to be apart of and learning a lot of engineering tasks was a plus. IT support for various devices in the server room and end users in the building was rewarding and challenging.
good,"good sense of corporate culture at the top, but unrealistic expectations of sales process at the client level; tough with all commission structure especially with seasonal fluctuations"
good,"If you want to connect with celebrities, make a difference to your customers and listeners and make a fat stack of commissioned sales cash, this could be a great fit for you. "
good,"I work side by side with the kindest and most respected man in our Market.  We are a great team, we represent the company very well.  I lend myself to charitable organization, the business community and above all our listeners, our families in the Hudson Valley.  To provide information and entertainment on a daily basis."
good,"If I could change a few things at iHeart, they would be: "
good,As is often the case with daily top 40 radio shows the hours are long so you better love radio if you want to work on a show. The best part is creating content that allows you to get instant feedback from the audience.
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was the high level of energy and the many friendly and creative personality that I had the pleasure of working with.
good,The local office was ran poorly the last 3-4 years I was there.  Eventually a larger market started overseeing this market and it was painfully bad.   A lot of good people were let go.    I left ahead of me being let go
good,"Must adapt quickly if you want to work at iHeart, be self taught and fast learner with go to attitude. Must be able to execute many different skills at once to survive."
good,I really enjoy the people who work there. The events are fun and the job is not too difficult. The hardest part is setting up the tent/taking down tent.
good,"As a part-time worker my hours vary from week to week. I usually work between 18-30 hours. Depending on the demand, I may work as many as 40 hours in a single week. I have met a lot of people that I have enjoyed working with. However, the chances offered for people to advance and be prompted to grow as individuals and professionals is lacking."
good,"I loved the job, meeting business owners and helping them with their advertising needs.  Most of the staff was wonderful, but there were a couple of people who behaved inappropriately.  Their language and actions made it uncomfortable at times.  I liked the fast pace of radio, scheduling spots, having clients record their ads and the promotions were always fun."
good,Good place to start but always be looking to move up. If you are there as a board operator great in and then get out. Do not stay in the position for too long.
good,"Great group of folks in Denver, debt load on the company has a big cloud looming. Team is solid but restricted on what they can do because of budget concerns. Company is more then likely headed towards bankruptcy and the mood in the office is starting to reflect this"
good,Very Fun workplace. People are great and office culture is always upbeat and positive. Lots of interaction with many different businesses's throughout the twin cities.
good,"Great coworkers, flexible work schedule. High turn over rate with employees. Some Managers micromanage. Very easy to move forward if you are friends with the managers."
good,"I learned many things about the radio business during my time at Clear Channel.  I learned how to run a sound board and screen calls for on-air purposes."
good,"I ran a station on the am side called, WHNZ.  It was pay for the hour time.  After 6 months I filled the station for 2 years out.  After I sold myself out of the position, Clear Channel added more of an advertising role on the websites.  I sold pay per clicks, banner ads and interactive media."
good,"I have nothing negative to say about Clear Channel. They treat and pay me fairly. The job I have is demanding, but it's what I signed up for. They have been very open and upfront with me about not only their goals and expectations, but mine as well."
good,"Cold calling, business to business selling. account management, meet monthly and quarterly sales goals. "
good,"This would probably be my most favorite job other than being a supervisor at an inbound call center. I was the administrative coordinator which entailed filing, typing letters, responsible for the monthly radio auction by ensuring all certificates were processed and ready for pick up, ordering office supplies, my voice was used several times for commercials. The most enjoyable part of the job was greeting the celebriities that would be invited to the station for different reasons. Assisting the sales reps with purchase orders and accounting. The hardest part was leaving to move to South Carolina."
good,A typical day in the Promotions Department consist of anything from calling listeners and informing them of when to pick up there prizes to working an event at various locations.
good,"Having the opportunity to meet a lot of different artists, such as Mary j. Blige, Puffy, Frankie J, Jennifer lopez, LL Cool J etc. Being able to travel to different venues and enjoy the summer jams and festivals in the summer."
good,Fun work environment that uses a lot of the latest and greatest technologies. There is a surplus of management but there is a lot of flexibility and the work/life balance is fairly decent.
good,Fun open enviroment....however very cooperate not allowing skill set to shine. Not much clear direction...ever changing.  Mixed reviews. culture is open however can be intimidating.  One minute you're the hero...the next you're a failure.  In some cases you can be the expert...however if it doesn't work you are criticized.
good,Very high paced and enjoyable environment. Learned lots about working in the radio business. The hardest part of the job is the sometimes long days and weekend hours.
good,"Since all of the departments from On-Air, sales, talent, digital team works together on most projects. There is a lot of communications on what each department had to do for the execution."
good,Easy going place to work great for beginner experience in corporate environment and setting. Very little room for advancement because seasoned employees don't leave. Great learning opportunity and career experience.
good,My experience with the company had its ups and downs. The structure seemed to change from year to year. It is a great industry to work in. I would go back to work for them again if the opportunity came up.
good,"If you have a passion for music and radio, iHeartMedia is a great place for you. It's a fun environment full of employees that have been there for years."
good,"Bonne entreprise, aidant ses collaborateurs au travers de formation ou accompagnement pour leurs développements professionnels."
good,Working with iHeartMedia has been a much different experience than working for any other company. You are given much more freedom but still expected to meet your deadlines. It is a fun and upbeat work atmosphere.
good,Productive and fun workplace with many opportunities. Great environment with many helpful coworkers. Fun employee outings like Hooks games and pool parties.
good,We have a great staff and it's a good place to work. My co-workers' are great and everyone is really reliable. The work environment is really laid back for being the corporate office.
good,I had three positions in a short amount of time over 10 years ago when we were still under Clear Channel Radio. It was a great environment to work in with great people. I was not prepared for the challenges this early in my career. I chose to leave the company.
good,"Overall this was a good place to work, however when the company was sold things just weren't the same. There are many positions and opportunity for growth, but you really have to want it."
good,Clear Channel is a nice place to work at I actually enjoyed working there because it always had a positive environment. Management was great and they will help you with what you need.
good,"When I started, I was concerned about benefits, but the company was very helpful with the getting started process. It seemed like they treated all of their employees with the same level of credibility."
good,"I started as an intern so iHeart really gave me room to grow. There's also plenty of work perks. Great first job out of college. In the years that I've been here, I've met many people who I will consider life-long friends and gotten to be hands on with my community as well."
good,"Interesting environment! The staff was energetic and humorous. Discovered some of the intricacies of radio and its operation. Overall, a very enjoyable experience!"
good,"I come from hard collections and as far as collections go, working here is a breeze. However, the goals set in place are very unrealistic. No pay raises."
good,"I worked in NYC.  It was fast paced, competitive and stressful.  Hard work equaled big money though, so if you can handle the stress you can do really well here.  Plan on 60+ hours per week."
good,"Interesting job. Spent most of my time as a newbie searching for new clients to turn into advertisers."
good,"I came to iHeart Media as an intern. From that I was hired as a part-time promotions assistant. The team at iHeart Media is like a family. A regular shift in promotions can be labor intensive at times, but generally laid back. This was a perfect job for me to be my extroverted self and build relationships with people."
good,"Love iHeartMedia Charlotte. The people are great, and the work is not easy, but fun nonetheless. I only give it 4/5 stars rather than 5/5 due to the fact that there is not much room for climbing the ladder."
good,"Good place to learn a lot/great stepping stone."
good,"The company gets a bad rap but it's pretty good. Outside of cost cutting measures which occur on a regular basis, you can do pretty good and be very creative."
good,A very close relationship with co-workers. Fun work environment with many chances to expand and collaborate knowledge of music.
good,Great job working with great people. I have really enjoyed working with iHeartMedia. I would recommend anybody trying to get in the business to go through them and start with an internship.
good,"Working for this company gave me the opportunity to rise and shine into the best communicator I could ever be, the skills I acquired and achieved under the director of Vince Thomas & Maria Lake were the key to the success in the many years I worked there."
good,"I loved working at iHeartMedia. In my entry-level position, I learned everything i needed to know to become a competent administrative professional. My coworkers were great and I made some fantastic professional connections. However, I and many of my other coworkers were passed over for advancement opportunities time and time again in favor of outside hires, which was a struggle."
good,A good company to work for. They really helped me develop my skills in customer service and sales. They also helped learn the importance of product knowledge.
good,"answered phones, put on the ""Cinderella Project"".  I had to cold call stores to donate for high school dances...dresses, flowers, all products for a prom.  It was to help people who couldn't afford the items for their dream prom but deserved it just as anyone else did."
good,"es una empresa con una gran trayectoria donde tu tienes la posibilidad de proyectarte y crecer dentro de ella, los beneficios que otorga son bastante buenos."
good,"I enjoy working at iHeartMedia and the potential to make money and be successful is definitely there. If you can put in the hours and sometimes forget about a work/life balance, this is a great place to work."
good,Healthy work environment. Everyone helps everyone. Needs a better Director of Operations. One with a backbone who sets a goal instead of changing his mind everyday
good,"A great place to build experience and learn complex things you've never thought you'd be able to learn. I enjoyed the small amount of time I was able to be there, although I wish there were additional job opportunities."
good,Wonderful positon to learn or extend your career in radio. Must be able to Multi ask and complete projects with  pressing deadlines.
good,"No two days were alike.  I would spend some days in the office making cold calls to potential clients.  Other days, I would spend out in the field making physical connections with clients.  The overall experience was great.  I learned a lot, and really enhanced my ability to communicate ideas and sell products.  The hardest part of the job was the pressure to close deals.  The pressure was also the best part of the job, because it motivated me to work hard every day, and helped me to develop a strong work ethic."
good,The best environment anyone could be around. Fun and creative folks. Am looking forward to returning and joining these great group of talented folks again.
good,100% commission after 6 months.  Good place to meet local business owners and increase your cold-calling skills
good,The best part of working at CC Seattle was the friends and relationships I have made through work and the experiences I was lucky to be a part of.  Never a dull moment and many great memories made during my time at Clear Channel.
good,"Pertenezco al área Comercial dirigida por una gerencia, bajo ella jefe de ventas y yo jefe de marketing. En marketing conformamos un equipo de 6 personas, creativo senior, 2 asistentes de marketing, diseñador gráfico y fotógrafo. Mantenemos un grato ambiente de trabajo, apoyándonos en equipo y bien determinadas nuestras funciones laborales. Contamos con un calendario de actividades y mantenemos una sinergia con el área de ventas con el mismo objetivo de lograr ventas exitosas, creativas y recordadas en el medio OOH a nivel nacional."
good,"Great sales team"
good,"I interned with Clear Channel in their promotions department. I had to set-up, break down, and host station events.  I also had to work in the office and do things like contact prize winners, update the event website, and answer ay questions people had.  The people there were great."
good,"Clear Channel has provided a demanding yet fulfilling employer. Given the opportunity I would continue to work for them, but in a different city. "
good,"This is a great place for a first job. Lots of fun and a great environment. Great job, especially if you love baseball!"
good,The job experience was a great one for me up until a new level of management came in and carried out the down sizing of the company. No one likes to lose a job due to down sizing of a company.
good,"I started off as an intern and worked my way up to a board operator, to on air personality. It's a great place to learn. The employees are willing to teach whoever is willing to stay."
good,Overall i had a good time interning with my time at clear channel great people and great atmosphere.
good,Selling traffic reports are great as you're providing a service that people really need....but it leaves the creative side out of sight!
good,"•	Oversaw a total of 6 cluster station events, interacted with listeners from all demographics, and assisted the sponsor with promotion of product"
good,"Great company, treats employees fairly with a great work environment"
good,Very fun place to work if you are into all forms of entertainment.  Lots of weekends and nights though.
good,During my time at Clear Channel I learned how the promotion side of radio works.  I worked behind the scenes to set up the remotes as well as working the events/remotes themselves.  I learned a great deal about this side of the radio business which I had never worked with before.
good,I looked forward to going to work everyday. My team was very communicative with higher ups and every event was different. Can be difficult to move up in the company.
good,Great place to learn about radio. Although it is hard to hired as full time.
good,"The broadcast industry is more corporate these days than it is broadcast. This local regional office of CCC has undergone MAJOR changes during my time in it's employ, and as a result was eventually laid off as a duplicate of another position."
good,"*Responsible for selling general advertising and sponsorships for the Pittsburgh Steelers Radio Network, the Pittsburgh Penguins Radio Network, 970 ESPN Radio, NewsTalk 104.7"
good,everyone was very friendly and willing to help teach you more
good,"This job was very challenging and was a great learning experience.  It allowed me to be creative, and create advertising campaigns from scratch.  While very rewarding and a great learning experience, there is no base salary which can make for some very frustrating months.  My coworkers were great, most of management was very helpful, and overall this was a very rewarding experience."
good,"Fun enviroment to work in, but the ball must never be dropped or you might be dropped. Great place to start off at and learn."
good,Clear Channel Media and Entertainment provides some of the best tools in the media and advertising business.
good,a typical day is to operate a board and keep the radio station on the air with produced live and recorded shows; along with produced elements.
good,A lot of grunt work but rewarding in the end. You gain valuable broadcasting experience.
good,"This is an entry-level position, so it's not difficult. Management is great, and very clear about what they need from you. Stable workplace."
good,I enjoyed my work at Clear Channel i used my inisiative when working on my own an was a trusted member of the work force and a team player. I was always keen to learn new skills and enjoyed the challenges that the job gave me.
good,Loved being in Radio advertisement sales!! Always had a passion for marketing as well!!
good,"I was just an intern, but as an intern I was given responsibilities that made me feel like an employee. It is THE PERFECT place to go if you're interested in radio broadcasting, digital and online radio, online content, social media marketing, ect. because you definitely learn a lot. The building includes all of Clear Channel's New York radio stations, so on my down time I'd walk around and meet some of the DJs, execs, and radio personalities. Everyone is nice and willing to offer you advice and answer any of your questions. Some have even exchanged contact information with me to follow up with post-internship or post-graduation talk. My favorite part of my position was coordinating some of the events and performances. Celebrities came by all the time to do interviews and run liners with iHeartRadio. Some of the lesser known celebs would even do performances for the staff. When that happened, my boss and I would help set everything up, greet the guest when they come, and make sure the area where the performance took place was packed with staff (I always thought it'd be really embarrassing for the lesser known celeb if no one showed for a his/her performance, but everyone always did). All in all it was a great experience and I'd recommend it to anyone."
good,Great staff and professional environment. Clearly defined roles for employees.
good,Loved my time here and loved all the staff and the friendly culture.
good,I learned all about event planning and marketing at Clear Channel. I was able to receive a hands on experience and plan events from start to finish. Seeing the finish product of events where hundreds of people attend is a rewarding experience.
good,Multi media company. Home to 850 radio/integrated media outlets nationwide. Also parent of the iHeart Music festival. Great company culture... but be ready to give up a proper work/life balance - and dedicate yourself to ClearChannel's cause.
good,"As an intern, you get passed around the station. Making cold calls for promotions in the morning, staffing a remote broadcast in the afternoon. Hard to find a mix of people like you find in radio."
good,Assisted VP of sales and staff of 12-15 people
good,I learned a lot about radio and how to connect to your listening audience. I had the opportunity to work under the best talent and managers in Chicago.
good,"The company was professional and provided the engineers with the latitude to do the jobs necessary to keep the stations operating, providing technical support (if needed) and needed test equipment and opportunities for schooling. I enjoyed my time there, inspite of the hardships faced during and following Hurricane Rita!!"
good,"Always exciting and challenging sales setting inside one of the largest and most innovative companies in the industry. Leading in the broadcast, digital, event and content marketing space allowed for account executives to offer a myriad of solutions to marketing challenge clients brought to the table. iHeart is always adapting and innovating to stay ahead of the competition in the fluid marketing industry space. The challenge became balancing too many solutions with corporate expectations as it pertains to what is best for client's needs. Overall, a positive company culture with some individual personality challenges with management, which is par for the course in competitive corporate setting."
good,"Depending on your department, but as for myself, this is a fun laid back company to work for. They truly let you self manage. And the training tools are awesome."
good,Though there isn't much room to advance the individuals there are willing to show you some new things that may help you in the future if you wish to stay in the radio broadcasting business.
good,"Flexible scheduling, however pay is not great, and management at times lacks communication. Everything can and should be improved with meetings and better communication."
good,"My primary roles were that of a talk show producer and voice talent.  As a talk show producer it was my job to screen phone calls from listeners to go on the air, keep the host on time, and keep a commercial log.  As a voice talent I would cut and record commercials to be aired.  I also filled in on the air at several of our radio stations."
good,"I was able to learn much about radio promotions, of which I had previously no experience in."
good,"iHeart is an amazing company to work for. It's on of those company that constantly keeps you on your toes!"
good,"Fun yet challenging atmosphere"
good,"Fun company in a fun business, media and entertainment.  Lots of young and creative types working at the organization and in support of the several annual music festivals"
good,"iHeartMedia is a fantastic company to start out at and grow. You can explore different job interests, and most likely you'll find a career path you'll enjoy!"
good,"Creative spirit, very open to new ideas. The office is very modern with multiple coworking stations and meeting rooms. Music is part of everything that they do."
good,"The work I do impacts many facets of iHM. Cooperation and teamwork are stressed. I have had the pleasure of meeting friendly professionals with many levels of work knowledge and experience. The work-day can be stressful, but we succeed."
good,Overall iHeartMedia is a decent place to work at but it doesn't have a very united feeling at all. Bigger markets are taken more seriously while any market below 50 is ignored and considered to be on their own. They also do not do a great job and cheering on their employees and expect you do just work as usual... Working in Sales is monotous and boring over all
good,"Working at IheardMedia I had legitamate responsibilities which made me feel confident and want to work harder and prove myself. I learned to balance my personal, school and work life. I was treated like an equal which allowed me to learn the politics of a work environment. The hardest part of my job was learning the new software that I hadn't used before in order to produce the show, however I was able to pick it up very fast thanks to the help of my supervisor. I enjoyed being treated like a professional, and learning new skills."
good,"The experience was exciting and provided great variety. However, often times the overall culture of the business undermined the integrity of the product."
good,"A typical day includes researching market trends and occurrences relevant to clients and their respective radio/digital campaigns, producing script copy for client campaigns, and prospecting new local, regional, and national business targets with marketing or sales needs that can be achieved through the development and execution of an integrated iHeartMedia marketing campaign."
good,A typical day at work is scheduling commercial ads to run on the station daily.  Some management personnel were not as personable as I would like. Co-workers were friendly. I am still friends with some of them now.
good,"A typical day could be eventful!  Of course you have your assigned tasks to do such as producing and editing spots and music to be uploaded into the system to be played on-air.  Also, you have your researching and locating each individual commercial that needs to be edited and uploaded into system to be played on-air.  And, sometimes you have certain unseen events like having to upload a commercial or spot into the system at the last minute.  Some days include recording live readings done by talents for the purpose of imaging."
good,"Peu de possibilités d'évolution"
good,"Clear Channel on whole was a budget driven, revenue focused company. This trickled down to local markets creating a very numbers oriented atmosphere. It certainly allowed me to learn better budgeting and forecasting."
good,"I wish the financial situation was better with the company. Other than that a good place to work for. The company allowed family time which is important to me. Co-workers were great and again enjoyed going to concerts, sporting events, etc."
good,This company has a lot of neat toys and knows how to dominate in certain markets. They like to have many layers of management which can make things complicated when you're trying to complete simple tasks or projects.
good,"Media advertising and marketing rep. Sold mainly for 99.1 The Eagle radio and internet advertising, but other stations include ESPN and 1690 Talk radio. Market and promote events dealing with all Clear Channel Stations. Managed and networked a client list and budget ranging from 8,000 to 20,000 a month"
good,"Total Traffic, which used to be Metro Traffic, is on life support.  It needs vision and direction to grow. "
good,"I took this job to be closer to family. I was producing the morning show on the flagship country radio station for Clear Channel. I was brought in to create systems, organize our show, help show hosts stay organized, manage issues, create advertising and manage social media. This was a great transition job to prepare me for what was next"

good,"iHeartMEDIA is a media giant. However, they do not rest on their laurels- and are constantly striving to stay on the cutting edge of new technologies and platforms to deliver the most value to their advertisers and ensure consistent ROI for their partners."
good,great team that I managed.  disappointed in the final outcome and dismissal.  Going from 53 employees to the current 6 employees is a bit concerning about the future of the industry.
good,Really great place to work but no job security due to financial issues. Job is very fun and always trying to improve and stay up to date with media technology.
good,"Great internship that not only teaches about radio but also helps you grow with the company. "
good,"iHeart Radio or Clear Channel Radio as it was once called when dinosaurs roamed the earth and I was still employed with the company in discussion, was one of the best experiences of my life. And being the largest radio broadcast company in the US there's plenty of room for career advancement."
good,"I had a certain amount of autonomy in doing my job. Most of my colleagues became true friends. I truly loved my job and my time with the company."
good,On a typical day I would go to the station and get whatever station vehicle I am driving for the day. Then we would go out to a event and interact with listeners and do giveaways.
good,"iHeartMedia is not your typical company. Being in the radio industry you have perks in the entertainment World and access to concerts, events and more! The environment is fast-paced and ever changing. Always something fun going on!"

good,"Friendly Staff"
good,"I learned a lot at my time at Clear Channel, and advanced my career there."
good,"Its interesting handling Information Technology for iHeart Media Denver because I get to be around radio personalities all day long.  They are some of the most comical, interesting, entertaining people to support technically.  I hear music, jokes and laughter all day, which makes this gig incredibly fun.  Things get serious when there are technical issues and it requires blocking out hysterical panic attacks when things go sideways.  Still, I love this group, including the sales people, my red headed step children.  Managing and maintaining just over 250 Audio, Software and Administrative servers, as well as network, wi-fi, printers, conference rooms, streaming kiosks, news, weather and sports for a few hundred people is no joke."
good,"Great stations to sell, did single station sales as well as cluster wide sales at various points.  At first awesome place to work but when the company went public the pressure, meetings, budgets and pressure increased dramatically over the years."
good,Day to Day enjoyable place to work.  Experience new technology in radio industry.  Experience multiple aspects of accounting.  The Market Controller has his/her hands in multiple accounting procedure.
good,"As a promotions intern I would have to do some data entry daily, answer phone calls for the promotions coordinators and give people the prizes they won from the radio. I learned about how the radio world works and that there is many cool aspects that go along with it. My managers were pretty cool and were helpful. The office was in general a cool place to work and there was always something going on there. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude contestants and prize hoarders. The most enjoyable part of the job was the atmosphere of the place and the occasional celebrity sighting."
good,Good place to work.  I have been here several years have learned an enormous amount in my years and have grown both personally and professionally because of my time here.
good,JNI was a great place to work for the work that was done. Creating promotional products is a very interesting industry and I learned a lot every day. Awesome showroom.
good,Its a media based company using new technologies like cloud AWS. Its very dynamic to work here as there are multiple projects running in parallel. I will recommend this company.
good,"Quickly evolving organizational structured. Global leader in weekly reach. Hundreds of locations to work at, including corporate. Rapid advancement available. Voice respected."
good,There is much flexibility here in regards to what you get to do every day and how you do it. For a driven employee you can grow within the company and make a great salary.
good,"Typical day would be project managing clients campaigns and making sure everything was running accordingly, while also supporting the sales team staff. Once the sales team begins to trust you, you are able to help in making pitches to clients while creating proposals and brainstorming ideas for the client to market their brand."
good,"A typical day of work was cold-calling, scheduling appointments, developing ad campaigns, presenting proposals and following through with campaigns."
good,A day at Clear Channel was different everyday. I learned how to talk to listeners of different backgrounds and also work at major events with on air radio hosts. My fellow interns and I got a long really well. The hardest part of the position was long days in the summer heat. Most enjoyable part was networking many different people in the entertainment and sports world.
good,"You have all the problems a normal place has: poor equipment, meetings lead by the sales department, etc. but the people are great. Honestly, the overall atmosphere is cool."
good,"I was very fortunately to work on this station as I was placed from our FM to the AM after our merger.  They needed a more experienced traffic manager since it was the number one AM in Los Angeles."
good,"Every day at my job is something different. Things just pop up out of no where that need to be added to our contest pages from sales associates who are working withs specific clients. I have a co-contensting partner who I work closely with and we work well together. "
good,100% commission And your advancement depends on your manager.
good,Upbeat working environment. Very close knit group of coworkers.

good,"I loved being a traffic Manager! I loved working in radio and being in a fun loving atmosphere. Each day at Clear Channel was exciting, challenging, and sometimes stressful. As a traffic Manager I was responsible for making sure all of the commercials fit in a block of time. "
good,"invested in the station .Left us alone for the most part and we took it all the way to top station, they sold out and everything went to hell ."
good,"A typical day at works starts with organizing my week and setting up my meetings with potential clients. Once I do that, I start all proposals that need to be done that week and make sure I have everything ready for each and every client. Prospecting is always part of my job everyday in order to make sure I am constantly meeting new clients and continuing to grow my potential. "
good,CC was an excellent learning experience. If you're a female it may take a long time to climb any ladder.
good,"A typical day for me would start at 9am and run until 6pm. Various client copy to voice and produce. Worked with Air Talent producing their spots, Clients as well. Consulted with Account Execs on writing copy."
good,"From a sales management perspective, Clear Channel provides a good work environment for those who love media and leveraging Clear Channel's many assets to increase clients' business. Clear Channel is at the forefront of creating new digital assets, as well as expanding its media platform in other areas."
good,"Gained knowledge on how a radio station is run and how they do things. My co-workers were fun to be around too, always knowledgeable when I had questions and were always energetic about the assigned job for that day."
good,I enjoy the staff I work with because it's a team spirit in the work place. The environment is very relaxed. There's no one micro managing and you're allowed to work the needed hours to get the job done.
good,The people are great to work with. Management is hands off and shows no direction. Self motivators are the ones who succeed. Was forced to learn a lot!
good,Great company to work for when it comes to learning media the right way . Great hands on experience in the field. Great management team. The most enjoyable job I’ve ever had.
good,The people I worked with at iHeart Media were wonderful! We were all family and everyone had eachothers back. Work life balance was great. The main complaint that I had was that there was a ton of extra work for no extra pay.
good,"You will average about 4-6 hours per week. Slightly more hours during the warmer months. But the experience is helpful when applying for full time jobs in a related field. Typical week during the summer and fall months consists of 1 day assisting with production. Then the rest of your hours come from working promotional events, Operating the sound board for high school football (when in season), and basically just making sure the broadcast runs smoothly for Redskins football and live music events. As the live music events are typically on the west coast, be prepared to be at the station on your own at early morning hours. During the winter, hours are hard to come by. You will mainly just do production and high school basketball. A little disorganized when it comes to scheduling. Always make sure to clarify times and dates on your schedule."
good,"Love the perks, love the people. Only downside is that the pay is not great, but if you can make it work for you somehow and juggle another jobs schedule in between time definitely worth it."
good,iHeartMedia was a dream job and it allowed to meet people I thought I would’ve never met. I’m thankful for time would go back to work for them in the right place.
good,I have worked for the company for almost 7 years. Started right out of college. I was thrown out there after six months and I made it! Only a few will make it.
good,"Jaycor/ClearChannel at the time when I joined the company was great! Didn't have the opportunity to work there after the iHeart conversion. But if given the opportunity, would go back in a heartbeat."
good,"This is a fun and laid back place to work so long as you are not expecting to make over 30,000 a year. The people you work with are more than willing to help, answer questions and mentor. People in all departments work well together and a team-based environment makes the work day fun and fast."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time working at iHeart Media, until the last 6 months.  I ran one of the companies most successful heritage rock stations, in a great market, with great local people, and a desire to win.  I was allowed to tele-commute when a family issue required me to move, and was given an opportunity to continue working in Tallahassee from our Pensacola offices and studios, while the company searched for my replacement after I tendered my resignation so I could move."
good,"Really fun job and I learned a lot. I definitely grew from being there. If you love music and a fun, loose environment, then this is the company for you."
good,"Had greater expectations with the position... Was really hoping the role evolved  into a full-time one however, It was still a fun experience and I'm glad I did it!"
good,"A very high energy fun environment to work in but very cut throat and a ""What have you done for me today"" type attitude. Hardest part of the job was the constant fire drill from regional management with the latest and great sales that devalued our products and services to our clients."
good,"I was suggested for the job of on air radio talk show host by the outgoing host of the show. Upon starting, I was part of a rebranded launch under my name, and hosted a 3 hours a day, 5 days a week live talk show. "
good,"Senior sellers tend to be happier in their jobs, it's difficult to get to the point where you only have to maintain accounts. There's only real money in a few business categories."
good,Good place to wok with opportunities to grow. Workplace culture is great. Casual dress code. Annual drawing of free Las Vegas festival tickets is great!
good,"As a Promotions Assistant working part time, I felt this was a great job! The work varied day to day and the pay was great for what I was doing. I had the chance to work closely with Promotion Managers and Account Executives which helped define my career path moving forward."
good,"high pace liked job but long commute."
good,"iHeartMedia has great brand recognition but in order to succeed in this company you have to belong to one of the hip ""cliques"" and there so many politics to get approvals & career advancements."
good,"Good people! "
good,"Clear Channel Radio, was a better company than I Heart Radio, over all, benefits, salaries and job culture was much better ."
good,"iHeart Media is a fun cool place to work, but the sales department can be stressfull. The payment method is on a drawer method. You negotiate a monthly rate, and from that rate you will be paid every month; however, the money being paid is a ""loan"". Your drawer gets paid back ot he company when you make sales."
good,"Fair wages, good benefits, and steady work.  Management was ok, didn't really interact with staff much.  Company offered many incentives, annual company picnic, Christmas party, thanksgiving luncheon, annual bonus.  I left because of the commute.  Would definitely work there again."
good,"I spent a year working with iHeartMedia and loved a lot of my job. So many cool perks, amazing culture and awesome people. However, this is a job that is 24/7 (depending on the role you work) and is very demanding."
good,"Muy positiva. "
good,"Truly enjoyed working for this company. The station manager was phenomenal and cared for his staff. Very supportive. Radio advertising is a difficult career to begin with but can be very lucrative. Be prepared to call, call, call on clients (sales 101)."
good,everyone is intelligent and passionate about the work they do. There is lots of room to learn and grow within the company. Everyone is friendly and approachable.
good,Working for a corporate radio group is very different from a local radio station.  The amount of paperwork took a lot of time away from what I do best...work with clients and fulfill their needs as a marketing professional.
good,"Can't really tell you much about iHeart. I was with the old Clear Channel and it was a great, fun, profitable place to be. They were a great media company before the accountants ab bean counters took over"
good,"A typical day is very relaxing, management is great. Many employees are easy to get along with. Mostly all employees are from  different walks of life so its easy to learn many different things"

good,"Very productive and always something new to accomplish here."
good,Excellent place to work.  Great people and working environment. Loved coming to work everyday! Great  co-workers...very friendly.
good,"When I worked for this company, it was owned by Clear Channel Communications. I worked mostly alone on Sundays and nights operating the sound board for football games. It was a great way to confirm that I wanted to get into media while in high school. I fit in with most of the radio personalities, so that made it more enjoyable. I was laid off in 2008 when Clear Channel laid off most of their part time employees throughout the country."
good,It is a lot of fun working at different events for the radio stations. Not that hard if you are a people person and very outgoing.
good,"It is one of the most fun jobs a person can have. As an intern, no money to be had. But the photography was a good boost from there plus the culture of it all is the best part of the job, doing what you love."
good,"I had a wonderful ride on a tremendously popular show. We interviewed"
good,A typical workday 8:30am to 5:30pm.  A lot of fun extra activities planned through out the year.  A good group of coworkers but lots of turnover.
good,This internship taught me a lot about ad sales. I would have preferred better opportunity for advancement. But radio is a fun industry to work in. I would recommend.
good,"A typical work day in the office is one that includes constant excel sheet work, translations and production. It is a great environment."
good,Over the past 8 years I've learned so much as part of this company. My managers and co-works have been extremely supportive and incredible to work with.
good,work in teams and learned how marketing with the right message can give great results
good,"I can say that working @ Clear Channel has helped me learn more about the radio sales industry, and built industry connections."
good,"It was a little difficult at first and bureaucratic, but in the end I'd have to say it was the best place I've ever worked. The work culture is second to none and the management was great."
good,"This was the perfect job for me I thought I love going to work, I enjoy my all my co workers I had my own office I learn so much there about broadcasting the most enjoyable part was I learn something new each and every day the hardest part is when my position was faded out."
good,I enjoy working so I make the best of any situation. Great co-workers and beautiful office and surroundings
good,"Working on the programming and digital level is great as it requires an employee to be creative however, the real last minute deadline jobs can be very stressful when there isn't good communication."
good,Second level support & supervisor for help desk personnel. Used IM to answer user complaints. Design and update testcases for new releases of a yield management system.  Used SCRUM for project management activities. Documented problems with application using TEST TRACK.  Train new students on application and help desk procedures. Conducted usability test with sales managers before new releases.
good,I really thought that in my time as an intern I was taught a lot about the radio media field. Saw several people take advancement opportunity when it came along. If I had been offered a position I would have definitely taken it.
good,Great work environment. Awesome perks. My radio school. My day included working on the imaging of the station and assist the PD with everything else that had to do with programing.
good,"J'ai passé 9 mois dans cette société"
good,"My experience at Clear Channel was an amazing experience and unforgettable, my co-workers there became my second family, it was always a great environment."
good,"•	Gathered and compiled raw data by researching Nielsen rating books and computer databases to conduct surveys and reports referencing trends and/or statistics."
good,I enjoyed every part of my job. Would have liked to have learned a lot more.
good,"As a whole Clear Channel is a great company, however it would be great to know that my career is going somewhere. This building has a great family like feel to it although from time to time it can be very challenging to keep a positive outlook."
good,"Very fast paced, intense at times and performance driven. We service numerous radio stations in the tri-state area offering, traffic for both television and radio. Management is accessable and fair, co-workers are professional in a very busy work environment. Challenges inclued volatility of the ever changing broadcast market and the most enjoyable part of the job is being on New York radio with high level professionals."
good,I loved working in radio with Clear Channel. That's pretty much all I have to say.
good,Enjoyed the San Diego area and the opportunities it opened for me to return to the east coast.
good,In advertising sales this position had its challenges. However it drove us to succeed even more. The team rapport was amazing and building cliental relationships was very rewarding. This was a great learning experience for me at a public speaking level to a competitive perspective as well.
good,I had a nice time interning there. I just wish I could have been hired.
good,"I love working at Clearchannel. The people are friendly and although it can get really busy, organization is pretty good."
good,"Although I did not get the chance to work very long with this radio station, the experience I had was very positive. I remember always having a fun and new task to do for the day."
good,New sales structure with Account Executives tied to their customers in protected territories has increased customer service and shows a commitment to satisfying loyal customers. This has increased the scope of work for sales people and enables the company to attract and hire more experienced reps in the future.
good,"Good management and strong chances of promotion. Management are fair and encouraging. "
good,"The media business attracts interesting people. My interactions with business owners have been remarkable and educational. The company holds concerts, supports charities and puts on events throughout the year.  Everyone has to learn a little bit about everything in order for all of this to happen. Teamwork drives the train."
good,"A typical day at iHeart is wide ranging. With over 9 station properties, and multiple targeted digital platforms to offer, iHeart has marketing solutions for nearly any business. Account executives are responsible for the full sales cycle with their respective clients; prospecting, needs analysis, customized marketing recommendations, close of business, campaign reviews, agency negotiations for certain clients, even creative work such as script writing. The staff is very professional, from management to support, promotions to on-air talent. Due to the number of stations, there needs to be a significant amount of communication between managers, sales reps, promotions and traffic. Account churn is a constant reality."
good,iHeart Media is a a top leader in multimedia marketing and a place I am very happy to currently work for.  I am an Account Executive with a core list of accounts that I work and help build awareness with the goal of increasing bottom line sales and profits.  At the same time I am responsible for bringing in new business and help them develop marketing plans to help build a successful marketing campaign/strategy.
good,"You get to see a ton of shows and free tickets are a plus. It is a sales and marketing firm, but because I was salary, I didn’t have to fight to get paid."
good,"Great company to work for. There is a lot of opportunities to make $$$. Depending on which division you work in, opportunity for growth is limited. Company prefers to promote internally."
good,"I enjoyed calling on new businesses and creating new radio spots to help promote their business."
good,"Great place, culture, and people but have to go extra mile if you want to stay or advance. Avoid the 405 and La Cienega on the drive if possible construction and bus stops can make it hard commute."
good,"As a marketing consultant for Clear Channel, I was part of a fast paced, exciting company. I had the privileged of traveling around the world, selling airport advertising."
good,Enjoyable company to work for. Holidays and time off is very generous. Management tries to keep communication open. Employees work together as a team. Managers work alongside employees to get things done.
good,"Very good work life balance and accessible management"
good,Working at iHeartMedia was a fun experience for me as I was able to gain vast broadcasting knowledge from great radio programers. Absolutely would work for the company again.
good,Enjoyed my time there but high turnover from within company leads to employee feeling a lack of company stability.  Also training for the position was subpar to none.
good,"Empresa oferece um bom salário e bons benefícios, porém é gerenciada por funcionários desapropriados."
good,I am grateful to have worked at Clear Channel as and adverting executive. This job opened up doors to help me launch my next business venture at Vegas VIP.
good,"This internship is what led me to my career in media and my job in NYC. Mainly internship work day to day, but overall great exposure and great opportunity."
good,Sports radio is super important to everyone who loves sports and wants to hear about it on their commute or while at their desk.  Great way to connect with the local community
good,Great place to work for people pursuing a career in radio. Fun work environment. Lots of events to work and attend. Great radio personalities and staff.
good,"I learned a lot there. My co-workers are extremely helpful. I started my career in software testing from Deutsche Bank. My training time was extremely useful for me."
good,"In this role I am the first point of contact for orders to build/remove/maintain bus shelters in London and the South East.  My duties vary from dealing with planning applications and appeals to creating traffic management maps.  All of which involve regular communication with people both internally and externally, arranging Permits for Contractors (NRSWA)."
good,"Although the benefits aren't as great as you'd expect from a big company like this I can attest that the people I worked with and sales managers were amazing to work with. Cared about the customers needs in while still keeping corporate happy with whatever they were wanting us to push that particular month."
good,Fun work environment. Involves lots of cold calling. Great management. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with new people.
good,Great working environment which creates a happy place to work. They support extra study and look to develop each employee
good,"friendly, laid back work environment. You get to enjoy free lunch Thursdays and Bagel Fridays along with mid day performances from up and comning artists.  You also have access to the performance theatre which is located within the building and you are able to attend listening parties. It's a very creative work environment where everyone works hard and is passionate about what they do."
good,"Working in the radio business is fast paced, fun, and can be stressful.  Clear Channel offered great benefits, and a fun work environment."
good,"College Internship"
good,"I loved working at Clear Channel, there were so many different things I learned. Typically, if we had an event, I would make sure I came prepared and loaded up all the equipment for the event. I had to coordinate with others as well to make sure the event was in place. If I was running the board, I had to make sure my tech was at the event so we could put on the broadcast."
good,Working within Clear Channel Communications was a fun and adventurous time in moving IT and supporting infrastructure components into the next century.  The employees and business owners are fun group to work with.
good,"I enjoyed my time at 620 WDAE on ""The Sports Page"" & ""Ron & Ian Show,"" I learned a lot more about the inner workings on the broadcasting & new media industry. It afforded me the opportunity to met and get to know new and interesting people and professionals."
good,"Great money earning potential , great training.  Good company over all vey strict goals"
good,"Un día normal comenzaba temprano, tomando desayuno en la empresa, saludos cordiales con todos los compañeros de trabajo y oficina. Aprendí un nuevo rubro muy distinto al que acostumbraba, el mundo publicitario, un ambiente muy poco estructurado, pero a la vez exigente en cuanto a los trabajos y sobre todo los tiempos en los cuales se deben entregar. Aporte conocimientos a las distintas empresas publicitarias con las que trabajábamos, así como a nuestros vendedores sobre el valor de los documentos con los cuales trabajamos, entiéndase por facturas, notas de crédito, cheques, etc."
good,Small company with great family values! They work hard to help the employees balance their work and home life! Small office settings make it easy to get to know your coworkers and become like family!
good,"great place and great people! Fun, fast paced and exciting place to work. Most difficult part of the job would be the demand on your time. It is a 24 hour, 7 day a week business!"
good,"Everyday in radio is different, which is why I love it."
good,"Wonderful bosses and many that take time to teach skills when you ask. I learned a lot about production, sound levels, voice-overs and audio software. Had the great pleasure of working with the great Kitty O'Neal- a true professional. A great place to work."
good,"It is extremely fun to work with fun radio station brands on a daily basis. There is creative freedom to do your job and it is a friendly team environment. There is a flexible schedule as long as your work is getting done, and there are frequent fun perks like live music performances in the building."
good,I was the Program Director for a populat radio station. I had to schedule music daily do research on music. Wrote weekly reports 
good,Not bad for a first job. 100% commission. No expense money. A lot of managerial turnover. Be aware the 2 out of 3 reps that are hired wind up quitting or being terminated.
good,"In my role, I'm blessed with the freedom to manage my own schedule and work based on the needs and demands of others. Some days I show up to the office around 10a and leave at 4p. Other days I start working at 3am and work all the way through the workday. Still, it's a balance and I'm good with balance."
good,"A typical work day is following up with current Clients and possible New Clients in person or over the phone. Making sure that their Goals are matching the proper way to market their ideas and products to specific audiences that Clear Channel Radio had to offer. I had great co-workers to learn from and to get help, if needed. The hardest part of the job, was to get companies to spend a decent amount of their budgets to make sure that their advertising schedules would work. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the happy faces on the owners when you had put together an effective markeing campaign."
good,As a promotions intern my duties included assisting on air talent at live remotes. Setting up and breaking down stations remote media equipment and engaging clients as well as listening audience during events.
good,Challenging and fast paced work environment that is different every day.
good,"Best job ever , nice people,fun enviroment.Nice pay and good hours."
good,This is a great place to work if you are looking to gain job experience and networking contacts in the media field. There is always something new and exciting going on and it is a great company. Great co-workers from the managers to the other associates.
good,"iHeart Media was a good company to work for. I learned so much about managing my time. Being a Program Director for 3 radio stations took alot of time, learning to multi-task and make sure all my duties everyday was my main priority."
good,"My time at iHeartMedia was great. When it comes to branding and marketing, iHeartMedia is tops. Brand identity is key and they do an excellent job with that. They will work you hard, but you will find that you will be rewarded for doing so."
good,"Lots of employee drama with some immature females.  Managers don't care, won't address it. "
good,"There was no ""typical"" day for my role, as I worked sporadically during iHeart events around the seacoast, whether handing out posters before a concert or selling raffle tickets during a festival, my role involved helping as needed. I learned about customer service and being ready to help with different tasks in a short span of time. I also learned about the different types of events the company runs and works on. The management shifted somewhat while I worked there, but they were all about the same: friendly people who remained friendly as long as you were able to take direction. The workplace culture was fun and lighthearted, enthusiastic and warm, despite the sometimes cold weather. The hardest part of the job is the shifting schedule - sometimes events are first thing in the morning and others are late at night. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with radio personalities and their fans."
good,"A good job. Long hours but no advancement. Much of the job and traffic department was moved from local to regional with the elimination of several local positions. Overall, a good fiscal move for the company but loses a lot to local sales and service."
good,"Plenty of interesting challenges to work on and solve at scale.  Move fast and iterate.  Diverse set of technologies, ASP.net, c#, AWS Azure react/redux"
good,There's some good people that do good work for this company. Some of us may feel like we get looked over but that's gonna happen with a company this big.
good,I truly learned a lot during my time at iHeart. Things that I will not learn anywhere else but know that they will help me to achieve my future goals.
good,Needed to leave do to having to take care of ill family member so i couldn't put in the required time to make my goals so we came to an agreement to leave
good,"iHeartMedia has one of the most fun work environments you could ask for - the coworkers here are AWESOME! However, as an assistant we work our butts off, and in my opinion are not compensated as well as we should be."
good,"typical day was never typical always started off normal and then ended up crazy"
good,"As an intern here, I have had a pretty positive experience. I work almost exclusively alongside the Promotions Director to record and edit radio spots, which is truly a very fun thing to do! I am able to apply what I've learned in school using Adobe Audition. Also, as an intern, I am given the ability to get as little or as much as I want out of my internship experience. My boss said that if I want to learn more about production, I can shadow more producers. If I want to learn more about promotions, I can shadow the entire promotions team during their meetings. It really comes down to whatever I want to learn more about. Although my title is officially a ""Sales Intern"" I am learning much more than the sales aspect of this company, which is a nice opportunity. There is also not much emphasis on being entirely professional in dress code and self-expression. In other words, I can have my arm tattoos exposed and no one really cares. For me, that's definitely a plus."
good,"They took great care of their employees, family first,honest and professional. Nothing bad to say other than thank you, I would go back if they had  a position open"
good,I enjoyed my 12 years at IHeart/ Clear Channel Communications. Had the pleasure of working with some very talented personalities. Top notch facilities.
good,"Worked with great people and deilivered prizes and gift packages to the winners that came to the front lobby to retrieve.  Put prize packages together for golf tournaments.  Scheduled songs to be played on the radio.  Taking winners backstage for meet & greets at concerts.  "
good,Employee eccentric and really support work/life balance. Committed to the communities they operate in and give back in meaningful ways. They are a team that works well across all disciplines to support customers and employees.
good,This was a great place to work and I was able to learn a lot about the radio business. The people there were very friendly and accommodating and it was an all around good job.
good,"Team work was amazing!  Competitive yet supportive, very healthy environment.  Excellent products, and training,  excellent management and really fun market"
good,"This branch actually closed down and these jobs were outsourced to India or Mexico.  Too bad, there were lots of good workers here and we all worked as a team.  We helped one another out and Seniors, like myself, would explain best methods and /or practices for doing the job well."
good,"I had a lot fun at work...everyone does, Being on Music Row was a treat as well. The hours can sometimes be long as the entertainment business never sleeps but I never minded it."

good,"iHeart Media is a good company to work for, i thuroughly enjoyed my time there and now its time to find my next adventure in the great world of media/marketing and sales."
good,Good place to work however no effort to keeping employees happy.Other departments gain bonuses each year and the main department always gets over looked.
good,Your day is split between finding new customers and working with established clients. You will find both new and seasoned account reps in this position.  Finding new client is always going to be a difficult part of the job but  if you are going to make any money at this position you have to be good at the hunt. The culture is supportive and interactive.  The most enjoyable part of the business is helping small business grow their market share.

good,"iHeartMedia had a very talented group of people. Unfortunately, our office is getting shut down here in Aliso. It's a shame. The people here are fantastic. Unfortunately the company is now headed by people who don't seem to understand what everyone did. I really enjoyed working there while it lasted."
good,"Aside from the paychecks, this is a great place to work....especially if you're fresh out of college and wanting to work in the media. It's great if you're part time but if you're full time, it can DEFINITELY take a toll on your personal life."
good,"iHeartMedia is an amazing place to work for a young college student who has minimal bills and is working on advancing his/her career.

good,Loved working here but ventured out to buy my own business.  It was a great place to work and I did very well there.  I wish I had stayed and not opened my won business
good,"iHeartMedia is slowly moving from a broadcast only company to a multichannel entertainment powerhouse.  While it has a bit of overlap departmental functions and employee roles due to the local and now national sales and marketing efforts, the essential idea of a broadcast company with 850 radio stations to create a companion online platform and concert/event series is a brilliant one.  I'm sure they'll get through the growing pains famously."
good,I would work for iHeartRadio again and again. Just WATCH what market you work in. Some are MUCH better than others...
good,"Fun, laid back place to work"
good,Casual dress code and casual working atmosphere added to the pleasure of working here.

good,Very strong analytics.  Not a lot of opportunity to use them at times.
good,Management level opportunities afforded learning resources that were the best in the industry.  Afforded the opportunity to launch two different radio stations from inception with two different listener formats.  Each station I worked for had direct format competition in its market.  Resources and Brand Manager support provided the necessary environment for the success we experienced in each opportunity.
good,"Great company to work for. Employees were easy to get along with."
good,"Has a strong hold on the advertising and media market, learned a lot about the demanding and fluctuating world of media broadcasting and advertising."
good,"A typical workday would consist of research and communicating with  insurance companies, management, staff and patients. I learned how to multi task, properly research accounts and excel in my position. My management was very supportive as well as my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was balancing reports to ensure accuracy. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to do so and receiving recognition for it also."

good,"Clear Channel is a great place to work. It gives you the tools to succeed, so at the end of the day it's all about you and the talents that you bring. Management is always there keeping you on the right path, but I've never been at a place where they also help get your ideas off the ground like they do at Clear Channel. My Co-workers are all great, mainly because they're happy and enjoy their jobs. If you know what you've signed up for, there really is no hard part to the job, just the expected parts. The most enjoyable is feeling like you have made a difference in your career, which I have at Clear Channel Media and Entertainment."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Clear Channel. While busy and challenging, I have never worked with more talented and creative people. The upper management at CC Orlando created a fun and productive work place that people actually look forward to being a part of each day. I would highly recommend a position within their organization."
good,"This was the ideal job for me. I was the receptionist at the Front Desk, but I did many other assorted office jobs- filing, mail, reports, managed a 100+ phone system, planned events, booked travel. I love to work with people and I did that all day long! I loved my co-workers and developed many friendships. The phones are very busy there and answering them, directing the calls, kept my day pretty filled. My job was stressful at times, but as I love to work at a fast pace, I enjoyed the pace!"
good,"Radio advertising sales is a detail oriented job. Research, cold-calling, lots of driving, talking to everyone. Making the sale is only part of the process. Copywriting, production, order entry, credit terms,presentations, promotions and collections are all part of the job."

good, Supervisor to Clear Channel Media+Entertainment Promotions Interns.
good,"Worked in the Business Office/Accounting Office for the radio group in the Sacramento market. Learned a lot about the radio industry in a short period of time. Enjoyed working with Management, even in a work under pressure environment, Management still was very helpful and always wanted you to succeed. Hardest part of the job was identifying all the radio spots that ran during the month that the talent/on-air staff was to be paid for. Most enjoyable part of the job was going to as many concerts and promotional events in order to learn all the staff who worked for the radio stations. Doing so help get me introduced to everyone in a short period of time. Best work experience I have had so far."
good,"Fast paced, hard working, fun people."
good,"A typical work day for Clear Channel was always an adventure because one never knew what to expect. When working in television and radio, this is normal because news may change from moment to moment without warning. This type of work environment teaches one to work well under pressure while maintaining efficiency. Management was always willing to offer opportunities to advance and this made the jobs most enjoyable because one was never confined to a specific task. The co-workers were always amicable and this made the work day enjoyable. The long hours seemed to be the most challenging part of the job."
good,"Answered phone, greeted visitors direct as needed. Inventory and distribution of prizes for radio winners. All mail-room duties. Petty cash. Plan and execute monthly luncheons for staff recognition. Assist all staff as needed."

good,"Loved my coworkers and the job itself, but I cost more to drive to work than what I was getting paid. It's a great part time job for some extra cash on top of existing income."
good,"I've never worked for IHeartMedia. I'm assuming that this section concerns to Clear Channel, where I was reponsible for all operation, dealing to municipality departments, as our contract there, was part of a public bid, to install and do the maintenance over 8,500 equipment, with and without publicity, all over the city."
good,"Azienda molto sfidante, buona scuola, alto livello di stress"
good,Very informative and productive acquired great interpersonal skills while employed with iheartmedia. It was like a family atmosphere. I worked there for 3 years starting off is an intern.
good,"Everyday is a different day in radio.  I love the industry itself, but it can be very challenging, and can take a tole on your personal life.  Depending on the market you work for, it can be stressful at times, but I believe any job is like that.  The hardest part of the job is trying to figure out what makes listener's like your station more then the competition.  The best part is you are around music all day long."
good,"In office by 8am Monday through Friday.  Leave by 10am to visit current clients and cold call on new clients.  Back in office by 4pm.  Usually leave office between 5:30p- 6pm.

Most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with clients and their companies.  Being part of the solution to help them grow, brand and provide marketing solutions."
good,"iHeartMedia is full of a good amount of young professionals who are fun to work with. The feel at this place is pretty serious for such a non-serious radio provider. If you don't prove that you deserve to be there, you're out."
good,"iHeart Media Denver is one of a kind when it comes to its stations, programming, on-air talent, and account executives. The work environment is challenging but fun and always a different routine day to day."

good,iHM has been a great place to work.  Its fast paced & ever changing!  Sales & promotions are always coming down the pipe-line and there is plenty of work to be done!  Management locally has been great.  They do care about their staff and work-life balance is great.
good,"Working as an intern at Clear Channel Communications was a very educational experience, and I learned a lot about the radio business. The employees who worked there were all very kind and inviting. However, they would rarely give the inexperienced interns like myself any challenging jobs, instead relying on interns who had been there for a longer time or other employees. Most of the tasks I was asked to do were simply office work. While I had no issue doing them, I felt as though it would have been more rewarding if I had been given the chance to at least watch the audio editing. That being said I did learn a lot about the radio business and I have many fond memories working there. The most enjoyable part of the job would have been the song segueing, which is simply making the time between songs going on air as short as possible. I needed to listen to the beginning and end of each song and decide when the best time would be for me to transition to the next song. Many of the other employees there thought it was a tedious task, but to me it was the task that made me feel like I was working for a big radio station the most."

good,"This was a lot of fun when I was there.  The relaxed atmosphere and perks that came with this job were great.  At times I was very busy, at times I was not.  Co-workers for the most part were friendly although I was in a management position and had to keep a distance at times.  We would do things as a group, had fantastic holiday parties, and I got to meet a lot of industry artists."
good,Working for iHeartMedia is truly a wonderful and fun experience. It is a very creative and innovative company to work for. If Sales is your thing you will succeed as they truly care about your professional growth and will give you all the tools you need.

good,"iHeartMedia is a wonderful and exciting place to work. The employees are driven, creative and fun loving individuals. I love its postive and relaxing atmosphere."
good,"Producing traffic in a roomful of broadcasters can be a lot of fun, but it is also important to note that you must be able to gather info quickly and make it available to many different types of people/personalities/platforms in a high-pressure/fast-paced environment.  The people you work with/for are terrific individuals who want you to succeed."
good,Start the day screening calls for one of DMV's top radio stations The Kane Show. I've learned how to edit the show for website podcast and also work the boards during the show.

So i sat back and observered. i gave valiable imput at the times i felt like it was needed but besides that i wanted to learn from my older peers. The next year of the internship i took the lead being that everyone one else was pretty much new. i showed how somethings went but also listened to the new ideas. A great leader is a great follower. But what i took from the internship was the importance of being apart of a team, and how cool it was to see all the hard work you put in. it made me realize how important your name is. I had a since of pride. Something i still use as something that helped defined me. "

The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the reaction on someone's face when they won tickets or a prize on the prize wheel. As well as when listeners would tell us how much they enjoyed listening to our station."

good,I love the job that I do but would like to be challenged more and would love more room for advancement.  Would stay here if management opportunity were available.
good,"I absolutely loved my job at iHeart, but the pay was not enough to care of my family. If not for the compensation and hours available to work being so low, I would still work there. Fun atmosphere, great people to work with, lots of exciting events to be apart of."
good,"I like this job environment, everyone is very friendly. I love helping people and at this job I do a lot of that. At times it can get very busy but it's nothing I cant handle.

good,oved working for CC...would work for them again. The 2009 layoffs is what got me but it did not discourage me one bit from radio or even going back to CC. Great memories and good times there.
good,Upper management gave plenty of opportunity to learn and advance.
good,"Although my team was small, IHM provided the tools and support needed to achieve our goals.  My job loss was not by my choice, but was a decision by upper management company wide to eliminate mine and other markets similar positions."
good,My time with IHeartMedia was a great one. It gave me opportunities to DJ at high profile events. I also learned about radio programming being part of the programming department at Z100 and 103.5 KTU in New York City which eventually helped my career as a Radio Programmer.

good,"Great place to work, nothing too terrible.  "
good,"Typically I would check in with the Human Resource Manager to see what her assignments were for me today. Normally I would be in the traffic department clearing affidavits, Accounts Payable clearing invoices or switchboard operator. What I learned from this experience was how to multi task and work in a balloon company that hosts many others. My co workers were great in teaching me the ins and outs of the company. The hardest part of the job was when I worked on recording commercials for the radio stations and talking without an accent. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning everything about radio."
good,I liked working here and had no complaints.  Would work here again with not problem.  Allowed breaks and other perks were offered from time to time and I have no complaints.

good,Great company to work for.  Managed front office team and all sales commissions payable.  Best part of all was being involved with major event planning for the radio stations.
good,"Typical day is visiting potential clients to sale radio advertisement to help the client reach its goals."
good,I learned quite a bit in my 2 year career at Clear Channel.  The management team was a very knowledgeable team that challenged us on a daily basis.  The most enjoyable part of my day would have been working with my clients and coworkers.
good,"This is radio, so there are not very many typical days; there are a lot of moving parts between on-air, promotions, sales and digital. It can be an interesting and fun challenge. If the day starts out slow, it can very easily turn into an all hands on deck event because we will be launching something big."
good,"A normal day in Clear Channel can change. We work for artists so they can decide to be on time or to be late. I had the expierence to work with many different people and numerous events from top 40 music to country music as well. I always had to make sure that all on air personality had the prizes and the different promotions that we work with during the certain time. I always had to make sure listiners were always happy and they all got the prizes that they won as well. The hardest part of the job it was a never ending day, my day could start early if there was any questions because all email does go to our phone. I loved it because it kept me busy all the time and I got to do many different jobs and taks that I had never thought I would do."
good,"A great place to learn, and move up in the company."
good,"In my current role at 850 KOA, I write, produce, and interview subjects for the news updates I report on air at the top and bottom of the hour. I cover anything from national news, to sports and events happening in the Denver/Metro area. My audience is not only local, but nationally too as I report for iHeartRadio as well. While I love my current position, I am looking to get back into Television Broadcasting. My true passion is developing stories, capturing the video, writing the piece, and editing the story to be aired. With radio, I don't have as much flexibility to do the type of writing I would like, as I only report hard news. I would say being confined to a certain way of telling news is the hardest part about my current job. I am not able to be as creative as I would like, nor am I able to do cover stories. I can only present the facts, not tell a story. And while this is not a bad thing, I feel that I want to have a broader way of sharing my skills and passion for news with the audience."
good,"Clear Channel provided B2B advertising solutions to commercial clients. Designed marketing plans with a strong customer-focused message and effective content strategy. Collaborated with clients to develop cost effective promotions with stand-out branding. Wrote advertising copy, managed each client’s budget, and partnered with sister stations"
good,"A typical day would be taking one of the station vehicles to the promotion site and setting up the tent and tables. I learned a lot more about the radio industry and working with people. The management and co-workers were amazing, everyone was friendly and down to earth. The hardest part of the job was the lifting of the tent and speakers. I enjoyed every part of the job from interacting with radio listeners to setting up and driving the vehicles."
good,"Very good learning Experience and Fun to work."
good,"Up at 3am, at station by 4 then two hours of show prep, reading and picking entertainment for the day's show. Then it's four hours of live talk with music and callers. It's a rush. Riding the board as it is called, doing ten things at once and having it all come out perfectly, that's the best. Knowing that you're there to entertain and inform and that your listeners depend on you, relate with you, count on you, that's the most rewarding part. Hardest part was the hours, low pay, lack of security. I learned more and more software and tech as radio changed over the years. It's an amazing career."
good,"Two days a week, flexible hours. Met a lot of cool people. Didn't do the same thing every day."
good,Our station manager and the other managers that I worked with were very supportive. I was allowed to take on additional responsibilities very quickly like e-news alerts and FM updates. The staff was fun to work around and really cared about the news.
good,"A typical day at work would be going into the office then meeting with the general manager and some of the radio personalities, to discuss promotions, contests, signage needed and up and coming events."
good,"I learned better communication skills, I learned how to do production the correct way. I learned the business side of radio."
good,"I would still work with Clear Channel if I could. I was laid off from their radio division in 2009, but with no hard feelings. The operation runs smoothly. Everyone is treated with respect and there is a relaxed, friendly atmosphere (not to mention nonstop free coffee!)."
good,Environment is almost always positive. Able to adjust priorities when unexpected situations occur. Strong multi-tasking and time management skills. Work well in a team environment or remotely while under strict deadlines. Daily management of commercial inventory to maximize revenue.
good,"If your looking for a job to manage your own hours with trustworthy supervision this is a company for you. Very supportive atmosphere, low turnover of staff says it all. The grass is not greener!! Excellent  management"
good,There is not a lot of opportunity to advance within the company other than trying to be a radio DJ. They do not seriously consider hiring a promotional assistant for a sales or higher position usually.
good,"Long Hours"
good,"iHeartMedia was one of the coolest internships I did. There was a lot of accessibility to executives and people who were high up in the company; we had weekly intern meetings with guest speakers and fun field trips. I wish I'd gotten to experience other areas rather than just my specific intern specialty, but overall a great internship."

good,I learned you had to stand out from competition. great support staff.  main job to sale....
good,"i enjoyed interning for them and would love to work in that field because I feel that it is my niche. I've learned the ins and outs of the boradcasting industry and what it takes to make events happen, It was hard work but it was fun because I loved doing it most of all it was informative and eye opening."
good,"Learned about what happens behind the scenes of a News station. Management & co-workers were great to work with! We got our job done, and had fun doing it. Hardest part of the job was purging the spots. Most enjoyed the fun holiday parties, and team get togethers."
good,"Good benefits, great co workers. It's radio, what's not to like?"
good,"*Worked as an Artist, not paid employee for iHeartradio."
good,"Learned a lot and was a productive work environment.  Management treated you with respect and understood work/life balance issues and helped with both when needed.  Co-workers enjoyed there jobs so were nice and happy.   The best part of my job was that I was allowed to do my job, they gave me the tools, training and trust to allow me to do the best job for my employers.E"

You are trusted to get on with your role and it is a relaxed environment. Management are completely approachable right across the company. There are tough times like with any job but you overcome it and move on to the next challenge. "
good,Great management team and excellent culture.  Constantly changing platforms for public consumption.  Creativity is a key with new and existing clients. Work hard play hard atmosphere.
good,"This growing company started as Clear channel, and developed into the largest broadcast and media company in the company. This company has a great work environment with the opportunity to grow within the company. I learned great team building skills and it was a good competitive environment within the region and entire company. The most enjoyable part of the job is growing your passion for music and entertaining millions on the streaming platforms."
good,"Typical day is - there is no typical day.  Radio sales account executives are used to a fast-paced ever-changing landscape. Each day can include tasks from CRM management, copywriting, creative brainstorming for clients, learning new software, learning about a new prospective clients' industry through research and contacts, presentation building, campaign planning, through to events and appearances organized through station promotions."
good,Started as a privately owned company and went through 5 different owners before Clear Channel took over.  Once Clear channel took over had bad management in place

Everyone there is friendly for the most part, helpful and understands how to help new employees who are looking to build their careers. easily the most genuine place I have ever worked for, let alone in the radio business. From managers to co-workers, it is a healthy environment who engages and uplifts its employees."

good,"iHeart is one of the largest radio stations in the country and a great place to work. However I feel that the Board Op position should get paid more than what it currently does with the amount of expectations, knowledge, and duties. Overall great company to work for."
good,It was difficult since i would only sold air time. This took hard work since and trust  from customers  because they did not  know if it would give them results.
good,"Everyone is so nice and friendly. They treat everyone with respect, value your opinions and always give you the opportunity to do what your career goal is. Love it here."
good,"My day typically starts at 5am and doesn't end until 7pm.  I play a crucial role in morning and afternoon commutes by reporting Traffic, News and Weather on the radio for multiple stations and markets. My day is split into two parts; 5am-10am and 3pm-7pm.  When originally hired with the company it was in sales.  I quickly moved up the chain until I was ready for on-air experience. This was a huge benefit to me as I learned the ins and outs of the company and how to properly brand their name.  Management team is wonderful and co-workers have become family.  The hardest part of my job are the unconventional hours but the most enjoyable is having the freedom to be creative and think outside the box."
good,"I collaborated with developers, advertisers and production managers to market products and services. Part of my errands was to maintain a central database of key contacts, risk ratings and analyzing competition on markets in most of the US states. I also analyzed and reported on customer activity, business and market trends."
good,Company is engaging in events as a national revenue driver.  Local markets will continue to experience the benefits of one of a kind promotions.  The broadcast industry is undergoing rapid change as a result of technology.

good,Great people and a great place to be for a fun and fast paced job. The employees are fun and kind-hearted people who keep you smiling all day long.
good,I had the pleasure of working with Clear Channel for many Years and I loved it. I always felt room for growth. i always had a great time. The only thing at the time was the pay was not as great as the other stations.

Discussing credits and billing subject matter with the account executive.  Created commercial logs to merge with music production to credit a production log for each station. "
good,"Never a dull moment at the forever thriving atmosphere that was home to many creative, intelligent people. Ability to up-sell clients if they wanted multi platform opportunities in addition to branding with radio personalities."
good,It's fun fast-paced but there aren't many opportunities to move up unless you have the credentials or you'd just have to wait it out. This meaning that management doesn't promote you based on your performance alone.
good,I loved working at Clear Channel. I was used in three different departments and enjoyed them all. It was a face paced yet team oriented place to work.  I love the challenges in each position I was needed in.  Had a chance to use my previous experience there along with learning some new duties.
good,"Working internally at iHeartRadio allotted me the opportunity to get into the weeds of an organization and understand the business purpose behind certain decisions. I learned a tremendous amount from a team of senior recruiters from diverse sourcing methods to interacting with c-suite executives and hiring managers. "
good,My time at iHeart was a very positive one. I was challenged to do new things that I never thought I would get to! I loved the people I worked with and miss them dearly. I would recommend the company.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of arriving at the station about an hour to an hour and a half before our event (gig)  to receive directions and prizes and other necessities that are needed for that specific event. Once at the event location we would call our contact to know where we were to set up. Depending on the time for the event, we would play music, play games for prizes, register to win boxes were available. The hardest part of the job was dealing impatient customers, people were never satisfied with the prize they won, and they didn't like to hear no, one per person. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to make so many new connections and be able to see you make a person day better by giving them a pair of paw sox tickets."
good,"Nice Job Culture "
good,"I loved working for Clear Channel Media + Entertainment. I learned a lot on the job training that I have been able to use in a number of other fields.

good,"A typical day at work would include phone calls, meeting with clients and winners, traveling and promoting events within the city and state."
good,"Loved working for this company. The only downside was the compensation. There is not much raises given for this position, and so I needed to consider other options to be able to support my financial life balance."
good,I worked there over 9 years.  Great supervisor.  Lots of opportunities to earn more money.  The people were professional for the most part.  Outstanding sales department.
good,"A typical day at work we stand at a kiosk along, with labtops to convince customers to sign up for a miles credit card. I learned that this sales environment helps you learn a lot about people along with yourself, you must be very confident & self motivated. Management is very helpful on assisting yourself improvement, that is if you are teachable. For the most part my co-workers & I are a small sales team, that is packed with a punch. We learn from each other to better each others craft. The hards part about the job is just getting over the ""No's"" that customers may say. Being able to overcome the no & understanding it is a numbers game. Will make your day a lot smoother. The most enjoyable part of this job is the people. I love talking to people, everyone has their own story."

The most enjoyable part of the job is the job within itself is just beyond an awesome experience."
good,"I have been employed over 10+ years and have enjoyed working for Clear Channel. I have truly learned what is required to successfullly deliver SLAs in a multi-level critical enterprise IT core infrastructure on a very large scale both domestic and internationally. I believe that a large scale NOC requires attention to detail, understanding of all business systems critical and non critical, technical aptitude, and have the ability to attain the cofidence of your peers to keep so many aspects on point at any given time 24/7. Clear Channel has a true understanding of work life balance and understands the importance of an employee's needs. Its always nice to be appreciated and rewarded financially."

In general, the office is a laid back environment, but at the same time everyone in the office seems to be energetic and diligent. My boss is excellent, he is very hands on and trustworthy as well as trusting. My co-workers are funky and smart and very respectable. The hardest part of the job is that I am often alone in my office, and speak to nobody, which can be lonely. The most enjoyable part of the job is finding solutions to complex problems and also interacting with my awesome co-workers whenever I can do so without distracting from my own or their own productivity."

good,Liked meeting new people and working with companies large and small. My experience with management of companies helped me with relating to clients. Each day was different working with local companies one day and corp out of state the next. Co-workers where great to work and yet at times it was like owning your own business. The hardest part of the job was that there where just so many places to present and choosing which one to call first. I love working on my own and knowing I was the key to my success.
good,"As each day is different, every challenge will bring new rewards. As I enter each day of employment with Clear Channel I start with a new program from my director. From there I will take all the companies advertisements which not only makes Clear Channel money but also our advertisers money."
