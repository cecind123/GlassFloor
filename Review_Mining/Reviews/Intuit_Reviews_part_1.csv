rating,review
bad,"If your manager is an Indian and you are not, you will be excluded from the circle by default. Run away from this company if possible. It’s pay peanut but expect hero."
bad,"The worst part if the job at Intuit was that EVERYONE has to play a part like they are acting and ""pretend"" that they like everyone or you get a verbal warning. If you aren't smiling and saying hi to people like you are their friend, you can get fired. Also, the managers make you leave your desk to go to events and meeting ALL the time and you cant6get your work done. The managers are the rudest people there."
bad,"Opportunities (that would support advancement) handed out in two ways:"
bad,"This company constantly disrupts their own workers by systematically replacing workforce with temp from worldwide workforce.  Temps come in willing to work the ridiculous hours the management comes to expect.  Long-term employees are sacrificed in the process.  in 2007 company lived up to it's values, but by 2018, not so much.  No work-life balance."
bad,"I would never work for this company again.  They never paid me.  They sent a laptop that did not work so I could not enter time.  They suck.  I also think they discriminate against older workers.  They made me get a second monitor, a landline, computer cord, and a new cell phone.  They made training impossible.  Tech companies like this discriminate against older workers.  They do not care.  I used to use Turbo Tax.  I will not.  They are going to replace attorneys and accountants with AI."
bad,Not a good place to for contractors. Good quality projects are given only to FTE. Tedious and repetitive work is  assigned to contractors.  Contracts extentions are not done till last day of previous contract which creates ambiguity.
bad,"This is a corporate company that chews you up and spits you out. I was a customer service agent working for the Arise platform. Between the QAPF's and management, this was my worse experience ever. They allow employees to be spoken to like they are garbage. Customer's would curse, degrade, belittle the representatives and of course we were not able to defend ourselves and be treated like dirt. I spoke up for myself to a customer and then fired because they said ""it was unprofessional"". If you are ever thinking to work for them, please give it a second thought."
bad,"Designed a wide range of print applications for local businesses and events: "
bad,I was part of a mass layoff they do not care about their employees and just move on to making more money in a less expensive state. felt under appreciated
bad,Call center environment.  Cant use the restroom unless its on your scheduled break.  They hire 100 people and only have openings for 50.  Everyone is trying to get a Full time position.
bad,"Here's your chance to go back to high school and play silly games with clicks and incompetent ego managers."
bad,"I never got past the self guided training, It was so badly written no one could understand it, Their tech support wasn't helpful and took forever to get through to, It was supposed to be 40 hours of paid training, The first part was a months worth of many hours a day setting up the computer, They called it technical issues, I never got through that part, They hired me as a tax expert and gave me a month of pain and suffering and frustration computer tech work, They should have warned us about this before we were hired, I am just so angry and frustrated,"
bad,What i didn't like about Teletech is that they don't take the time out to listen to how the temp people are getting treated by the ones who have been there for months or years.
bad,"Management was not helpful and always playing on their cellphones, though it was a no electronics devices area. We weren't even allowed pencil and paper."
bad,"Weird people, co-workers no respective to customers at all.  Lots of discrimination between permanent employees and contractors.  Terrible NO  dress code, people could be in pajamas or gym clothes, Not train managers."
bad,This company is very Unorganized. Take an issue to Human Resources you will never get the issue resolved. The security is rude and useless.
bad,"Payments division was an acquisition, the Intuit mindset isn't practiced nor does it exist in the building. Management doesn't allow for true growth. Managers have call center mentality with all staff even those who aren't in the call center."
bad,Intuit is a one trick pony with no future and the have the worst of worst values i have ever seen.
bad,"Horrible working conditions.  Self centered.  I wouldn't work there ever again.  Too many ""clicks"""
bad,stressful days inadequate training terrible managers calls routed to the wrong people 
bad,"I worked for Intuit on Contract. The position was advertised as a contract to hire, but after two months, I found out Inuit only ever wanted 3 permanent employees and the rest of the positions are temporary. Needless to say, if I would have known that I would have never taken the position in the first place."
bad,"I enjoyed staying home and making good money! depending on which client you choose, is what you'll get paid. the worst part about is, is that its not super concrete"
bad,"We are NOT Tax Accounts, Tax Advisors, They pay of $9.00 per hr is horrible for all the work and responsibilities this company expects of you. The training program is less than desirable as it does not prepare  you for real life calls, as they are much more complex call that are all Tax related of course."
bad,Management is terrible at least. No diversity at all here in management . Management works to their own best while expecting the employees to do what they are supposed to do. No understanding for parent work life unless your in management. Management often leaves for drinking and social events or what ever needs their family may have . Something that they frown at the employees for . They can take your job at any moment based on whatever they choose to come up with. Often times choosing what they themselves are doing
bad,its great for entry level or for people who wish to be cogs in an endless machine. There's bias and the requirements for performance are inconsistent.
bad,"Empresa em si é boa para se trabalhar , porém haviam muitos atrasos no pagamento do salário , vale - transporte e o vale - alimentação era de apenas R$100,00. Os atrasos constantes nos pagamentos do salário e benefícios acabavam gerando rotatividade de funcionários na empresa. O que ocorre até hoje."
bad,"As a recruiter it is allways the same no matter where you work."
bad,"No real coaching and development. "
bad,"company is not stable, had three major layoffs in three years. Promised advancement, worked with other offices and received good reviews but management selected less qualified due to favortism"
bad,"it is a ok place to work , but they need to change some rules regarding numbers and surveys, i liked working there but sometimes it could get a bit over whelmed but nothing i couldnt handle"
bad,Only accept this job if you have no alternatives. The work consists of never ending cycle of calls regarding mundane tax questions. Using callers ask why the software does not work. The pay is low--about 15-20/hr with a bonus of 2-8K at the end.
bad,"Middle management heavy. They don't promote employees. Instead they tend to hire from outside. Each business unit is different, but the IT (Technology) side is very bad."
bad,"The new focus for agents is metrics, not customer service. Managers do not inspire, they micro-manage agents in order to meet metrics. They are superficial in their friendliness while undermining agents and creating a hostile work environment. Simply not enough pros to outweigh the cons to make going to work for them every day feel good."
bad,Simply overworked- poor mgt - large turnover - little or no support- no onboarding - impossible deadlines - you never know when someone leaves or is fired...until you are landed with their work!
bad,"Intuit in Reno is a phenomenal workplace but only if you are a white woman. The people are friendly. The work is very challenging, yet rewarding both financially and intrinsically. Unfortunately it's not a career position for males or minorities. Reno only has a 34% white female population but 97% of Intuit's workforce in Reno is white and female. The organization is exclusively focused on the retention, recruitment and development of its female workforce. Men and minorities, ETHNIC MINORITIES (not white women professing same sex affinity) are merely there to stave off EEOC audits. If you're seeking employment and you are hired it is a good job. Be aware that there is no place for you to build a career if you are not white and female even if your qualifications surpass those of 98% of their workforce."
bad,"Workplace culture may look good from outside but its not true from inside. Bad management of teams. Very stressful sometimes."
bad,"Due to a reorganization, a newly promoted manager with less than 3 years of people leadership experience became a group manager - ZERO people skills, unable to communicate effectively and a liar on top of it all. Do not recommend this company at all."
bad,"Typical day at work, answer phones. Some calls last several hours. "
bad,This company has no work life balance.  Everyone in the department was sick and that is because the expectation is way to high and unrealistic.  The team is horrible no one to answer questions.They provide you no training and I would never recommend anyone to work here.  I have worked allot of places and have never been treated so poorly/
bad,"Great place to work at 8 years ago, however after 9 years there the culture and management has changed significantly"
bad,"great company loved helping people with their tax returns, best part of it was that you got a free download for TurboTax each year of working with TurboTax"
bad,"The pay is great but the job security sucks ! You start working there and every day questioning if you will have a job there the  next time around . This is a job where they hire you while they need you and lay off their employees way too much . I wouldn’t recommend this company at all. They aren’t the type of job where they can re assign you to other departments, instead they lay you off."
bad,"Horrible work environment, Bullying all the time by peers"
bad,I worked as a volunteer and I enjoyed testing their new products. remotely. Once I was even given a small bonus for my testing ability from Intuit which kept me motivated into volunteering for more test jobs on their new products.
bad,"When you begin working for Intuit, there is an immediate sense of excessive control or attention to the most minute details. This excessive control stems into your mind as well, mind games if you will."
bad,Intuit HR could better handle contingent workers. Limited growth and lots of put downs by Full time staff. Ideas to help the process only hold weight when a full time hire mentions then.. No room to grow on that..
bad,a typical day at work is troubleshooting clients computers assisting clients with their quickbooks. I learned how to train employees with quickbooks. I loved working with my co-workers everyone worked as a team. The hardest part of my job was working with clients who were unable to use the quickbooks system correctly. I enjoyed working with this company I got free lunches and received bonuses.
bad,"Intuit is a great company with lots of great perks.  However, if you are a contractor you are treated as a second class citizen.  The Full Time Employees have on-site parties and events, while the contractors are expected to stay back at their desks working away.  "
bad,"Head down, do the job based on a time frame which was impractical."
bad,Never worked for a company before this one where management tells you one thing does another and then blames you for their mistakes. Then writes you up instead of being a good leader.
bad,"No meetings, no communication, manager is awful. If you don't brown nose, you will not progress. The management and leads do not know what is being done in the data center, and rely on bias info from employees to make any decisions."
bad,The goals and compensation are set to advantage the company.  The managers show bias and favoritism.  The sales teams are staffed with experienced people.
bad,Very big corporate culture. Slow to make changes. Pretty standard sales position. A typical day of work has you fielding about 20 calls. Calls tend to last about half an hour.
bad,This is a call center that has many rules and expectations regarding everything. If you are not used to tracking every second of your day this will be a new experience
bad,The day to day functions of my current position vary. I'm responsible for technicians routes as well as accounting duties. Customer service is a part of my daily routine as well.
bad,"Intuit's values has changed over the years which has affected the culture. The employee is no longer considered a valuable asset and the priority is completely focused on up selling customers. They continue to raise prices on their products without adding any new features or benefits. Favoritism is very high and it's impossible to get ahead unless you agree with everything but maintaining a position is another challenge. Teams and groups are consistently shut down or relocated and most new hires are contractors because full time employees cost more with benefits. I do not recommend for anyone to work a job at the Fredericksburg location. If you are considering working for Intuit, work at the Mt. View headquarters which is a much more positive environment and facilities compared to the Fredericksburg site. About 6-7 years ago, the culture was completely different."
bad,"En el área de los diseñadores se tenia claridad en las tareas pero poca colaboración en el equipo de trabajo, a resaltar que los proyectos que manejan son con empresas de renombre y nutren  el portafolio del diseñador, se requiere experiencia para abordar los proyectos, muy mala remuneración económica para una persona con titulo profesional, ademas no ofrecen estabilidad laboral todo se trabaja por cuentas de cobro mensualmente, relación con superiores normal como en cualquier empresa."
bad,"Lots of perks, great gym and basketball court. Management was cut throat.  HR was cut throat.  They talk about innovation, but are slow to move.  Upper management expressions do not flow downward."
bad,"Management is very ""up with people"", but that's not the reality of this meat-grinder workplace.  Outsourcing is rampant.  If you love a fun workplace with no job security, this is the place for you.  For corporate types only."
bad,Thankful for the experiences and the knowledge I have set to obtain through the last 13 years.
bad,"Lunch & BOOZE brought in during tax sales season. Penalized for breaks. Sales quotas randomly adjust for those in the ""special mgrs"" club. Pressure to sell, sell, sell even if client doesn't need it. Provided with easy ways to not really tell the customer what the are buying just to make sale. About 50% of the team were contractors so benefits weren't offered. Also we had contractors working alongside those of us who were direct hires. Contractors didn't get the commissions the hires, even though they were held to same requirements."
bad,"Working with Intuit and QuickBooks was a rewarding job, I learned a lot about payroll and customer service. Working for an outsourced company for intuit was not as fun. It has become a toxic work environment."
bad,The staff are extremely relaxed and do not have a sense of urgency when it comes to training. I spent 6 weeks in training learning about something I was not going to used when performing the essential functions of my job. The company benefits and perks will keep you entertained until you have to do your job.
bad,You are expected to work 10-11 hour days and often times not appreciated. Management is always changing with reorganizations and higher turnover rate in the accounting groups.  The one thing that is nice is the facility and location.
bad,I worked with intuit for literally a total of 3 weeks. The trainer I had literally rushed through the training and hardly gave us any time to take notes to actually use on our performance while working. When production started they gave me an assigned schedule for 1 week. After that never heard form them again. Even after I contacted multiple people about it. The managing of things at this company in my opinion was extremely unprofessional and unorganized. Not enough training was provided to be able to have a good knowledge of what we are working with.
bad,"Very cutthroat place to work you have to be ""in"" with management to get ahead.  Very exhausting work and you have to retain a ton of info in a short time"
bad,"Intuit is not the company it talks about being.  Very heavy on politics and slow moving on decision making.  They have a lot of technical debt that they need to clean up in order to be more agile.  The CEO has a strategy, but once you get past the CEO directs, strategy is non-existent."
bad,A company in constant change with little value given to employees
bad,Has all the travel and entertainment benefits that come with a technology company. Great gym.  Questionable culture. Feels like everybody has an agenda.   Be cautious.  
bad,very little done for mental health. big driver of depression and anxiety. training team is incredible but they are given and told how to train by people who have never worked in a call centre.
bad,"Dynamic and fast paced work setting, however has kinks in employee relations and management expectations."
bad,"worked very hard, produced top numbers yet had terrible reviews, unfair given my highly productive numbers, and excellent QA reviews, customer satisfaction and praise.  was laid off the day high season ended.  experienced terrible injustice there."
bad,"Overall work culture revolves around poor management, resulting in no structure or guidance for  employee for growth. There is no team work ethic. Pros peers are friendly, and there is lunch and a fitness center on site for personal health benefits."
bad,"each year as a remote tax advisor has gotten worse. Less pay, harder to get bonuses, and benefits taken away. Several years ago, we got 401k with matching contributions; now it's gone. Used to get up to 25% of pay at bonus time. Now it's more like a buck an hour.  Rules are changed daily, weekly, and monthly.  Managers are nice, but they too are at the mercy of unrelenting senior management. "
bad,Lacerte was the department i worked at it was very unpromising of what advancements would be available in the future. The staff was fun but out of 50 people only 1 was chosen to stay full time.
bad,"Highly political environment to work in. Please your boss and you can stay else be ready to be kicked out. I have never seen a work environment be rotten to such an extent. Intuit will loose more talents and trustworthy individuals who mean only their business."
bad,Not very involved with the representatives movement or success. Mainly concerned about meeting goals that were in excess.
bad,"A company that wants to deliver the easiest to use product. The company does not have a strong culture,although it is close enough at company event."
bad,"This company was once an enjoyable job however once they started to cut costs at the employee's expense it really went downhill. "
bad,It was a new customer relations company for intuit. A starter up with outbound sales
bad,Afni was poorly run when I worked their. Some times there were not enough seats for every one working and hot seating gets old very quick. The east side call center was dirty and poorly laid out. Managment had no clue as to what was going on. The call floor was loud.
bad,"Hand picking sometimes, interviews others.  Internal practices are secretive and frankly frustrating.  Management by feelings not results.  Was not informed of not being invited to return.  Have the guts to actually inform someone who has been working there for years.  Shows a disdain for relationships.  Employees are simply a means to and end.  When no longer needed, they are a nuisance."
bad,"Intuit required 10 plus hours during the months of January to May."
bad,"This company makes you work long hours required to work and 2 Saturdays a month leaving no time for your family. Its a lot of pressure to hit your mpnthy quota or your job cant be up for grabs,"
bad,"During my time at Intuit, it seemed that as if the management and/leaders were somewhat lost in terms of actually managing projects and job assignments. About half of my co-workers did not even have the necessary backgrounds needed to properly perform in their current role at Intuit. "
bad,My time at Intuit was the shortest time at any job for me.  The only thing good about this company was the dress code.  Other than that I did not feel that the training was specific to the job duties and the staff was not friendly.
bad,"The company itself was a great company, but the individuals that lead teams were pretty unprofessional. A typical work day was very stressful, but not with the customers with the management. Adults being talked to like their children, favoritism, and discrimination, as this was all swept under the rug. The hardest part is commuting to have to be humiliated. People have walked out and retired because of it."
bad,"When you talk to recruiters, they paint a picture of innovation and growth while, in reality, it is anything but the truth. There are too many layers of management and politics involved, which leaves no room for growth or recognition. Often, there are too many meetings and noise around decision making which is a big waste of time since it helps hardly in achieving the results. Lack of mentorship and team building."
bad,"Unable to accommodate bookkeeper and accountant needs with the software. Companies communication amongst staff and management is terrible and minimal. Software updates and changes occur without Intuit notifying staff. "
bad,"- lazy life"
bad,"There were good benefits and a good salary. But when Intuit acquired Demandforce, there was micromanagement. Overall, I would recommend the company to somebody else."
bad,"Great place for retirement. "
bad,"Great tech company with an egomaniacal coxswain at the helm."
bad,"Be prepared to work late into the night with no notice. Not good if you your childcare closes at 6pm. Seasonal positions are of course on an as needed basis, so be prepared to be unemployed with 2 weeks notice. A lot of time spent applying, interviewing, & training for one month of work."
bad,I can't say what other teams are like but the finance culture at Intuit is very political. Managers are not looking out for the growth of the team but rather for their own individual gain. Work life balance and comp is great but if you are looking to grow at a fast paced this is not the place to go.
bad,The saddest part of the company is that they are a multi-billion dollar company but cut costs everywhere they can. Give strict budgets for departments that are necessary which leads to large lay-offs and only hiring contractors. Barely any full-time positions there.
bad,Don't want to leave a review. There is no reason for me to have to do this to look for a job that better fits the needs of myself and my family. So I'm not putting anything here.
bad,"Great pay for first-job off college. Learnt a lot, obviously. Difficult to advance in career, without political connections. Not surprised on what happened with the company's leaders."
bad,Intuit purchased the company in Woodland Hills and the Intuit culture never really caught on. Co-workers are friendly. Benefits are great. Pay keeps up with trends but no more than that.
bad,"I went out on a leave of absence due to illness, and during that leave, the human resources sent me a polite letter letting me know that they were not willing to accommodate me in job hours, or time off any longer and that they were not going to continue my LOA. This was done after 1 month of a 3-month loa. They followed the law, but just barely. So they present themselves as a great company, but in all actuality, they were not."
bad,"Lack of alignment between senior leaders makes it difficult to get anything done. Constant talent turnover, resulting in 10+ year veterans who can't handle change. Lack of diversity in management."
bad,"Company knowingly makes money off fraud. See the SEC and various state AG investigations. Dishonest company. Nice gym, good cafeteria, great perks. You just work for evil people. Pick your poison I guess."
bad,I loved the intuit company i just did not like the vendor that i went through i felt as if the company did not have internal communication. therefore things could not get done properly.
bad,"Most incompetent team members got a promotion this year. The smart, hard working ones leave regularly. Top-bottom culture, where managers like to micromanage and engineers obey the hierarchy more than anything."
bad,"They form new teams to see what they can do, then let you go. They are doing test runs to find out ways to save customers.I learned about this company how they bring you in and let you go just as fast."
bad,This has been good experience for me but the company is out of money and the owner is shutting down operations.
bad,"I liked the job, and the clients and the problem solving.  I did not like the low pay and only one week a year PTO. I also did not like the management not following through on changes that were to take place."
bad,"Good place while you have employment.  However, every 6 months in Tucson they clean house."
good,"Very stressful no advancement and the pay is very low.I have learned about taxes"
good,"Management is allowed to treat workers poorly and nothing is done by HR. HR works for Intuit not the employee, so its a no win situation. Hardest part of the job is dealing with an incompetent manager."
good,"Used to be a great culture but has deteriorated in recent years."
good,"Providing customer service to the public processing of credit cards, reconciling, trouble shooting real time FDR, statements. Learned how to work with co-workers one on one and assisting in resolving issues and meeting of deadlines. The hardest part of my job would be facing the challenges head one and over coming the obstacles. The most enjoyable part of the job was resolving customer issues and as a end result the customer's/merchant was satisfied and gained a loyal customer."
good,"The saying goes we don't leave jobs we leave poor managers.  I enjoyed my position and would have loved to have continued working at Intuit, if not for my manager threatening my work group that we all would be fired if her annual staff review of her was not given better marks the founding year.  Blatant favoritism and with that a very hostile work environment"
good,Everything depends on the project and team we work. I heard other teams are happy with the work life. Small management decisions makes us feel bad.
good,"good culture, overall benefits but sometime you wouldn't get to do challenging and innovative work."
good,"The training was scattered,  long and unhelpful. So,  it made the job both more interesting and difficult. I did like the culture though. The pay was ok. The scheduling was choas."
good,"Good starter job, although it's not a place you would want as a career. Supervisors do not teach you much in training. Experience is gained by personal learning. Unfortunately Customer are very irate"
good,"Great company and workplace and good benefits. free food free cab service."
good,"I worked for Intuit for a long time. The longer you work there the less likely it is to keep your job. I swear they get rid if seasoned agents so they can bring in new agents to save money. It used to be a great job, but recently, they want you to do more and work constantly for the same pay. There is no work-life balance anymore. It's highly stressful, and you will work 50 or more hours a week during tax season, overtime is mandatory. There was no room for advancement, even if they stated there would be.  They assign extra stuff for you to learn and do, but it never amounts to transitioning into a new role."
good,"Rate this company*required"
good,"Very shady environment, management is there to cut people off. Concentrix has a high turn-over rate. Pay is never right or done on time. Work environment was too chilled for a work environment."
good,"Remote location - working from home, however difficult to build /feel like you are working for company/team"
good,"Make 80+ phone calls a day. I learned how to communicate with different types of people. My manager was great, but collectively the entire sales management team needs improvement in communication and structure. Hardest part is energy, making sure you have the energy to keep pace and deliver the same level of focus and concentration per call was the hardest. Best part about it was making money off the deals we closed and helping others on the team succeed as well."
good,"Intuit use to be great company to work till 2012. After that some changes took place and a new management came in. After that lot of employees were let go silently on regular basis,"
good,"Management lacked communication with employees and there was always significant issues with clarity on strategic goals due to lack of guidance."
good,"People that I worked with were great, it was a diverse culture and a good experience, it was not to bad working there, just didn't work out for me because I lived to far."
good,"Great place to learn new skills, but constant re-orgs are tiring and you could end up in a bad business group as a result. Also very political, but in my time there I would say the first 75% was good."
good,"Answer inbound calls from customers that are having issues with their QuickBooks Online account. I have learned a lot about working with bank transactions, invoices, payroll, reconciling accounts. It is a laid back work environment where we can wear jeans but some people take it to the extreme. The people working there are great. Management need to be seen more. We have 3 minutes or less to document the call which can be difficult. I really love helping new customers and showing them how the product works."
good,too much micro managing and turnover rate was high except for management enjoyed working with great people just couldn't handle the managers not knowing as much as the techs
good,"I worked for 2 tax seasons doing phone support from home.  The pay was good, more than I was making with H&R Block.  Also the convenience of working from home.  And you can just about always put in overtime.  "
good,"esmpresa dinamica , atua na area de atendimento muito bem"
good,Once again Intuit is a company that can be better in excepting more culture. There are a lot of things that go on in the office that goes under the rug. Far as discrimination and how they perceive certain people Ive experienced this hands on wit my last manager. Far as benefits it is a good company.
good,"8 hours plus of taking calls from tax program customers. Worked quickly with them using several tools to discover their problem and then fix it. Loved my coworkers and still am friends with many of them now. Management is where this job lacked, they showed favoritism to a handful of people and not much room to advance despite posting some of the best numbers on my team. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking with new people and being able to work in a relaxed work environment with great coworkers. The hardest part was long hours on the phones all day every day. During tax time it would be pushed to a minimum of 9 hours a day or more."
good,"Strategic vision for my division was to maximize revenue by either driving competition out of business or purchasing them then increasing prices because there was no competition. Profitability was maximized by reducing costs by reducing service to the minimum acceptable level. "
good,it was just a contract job and theres is little room for getting something full time.
good,Lot of learnings in my previous and  want to share my knowledge in my next level  of career.
good,"Contractors at Intuit are treated like second-class workers. Less time is put in by management for the contractor to succeed than full-time, permanent workers."
good,"Great place for entry level sales and analyst positions but not a great place to develop professionally unless you’re in the US. The senior leaders in Canada are inexperienced and unfortunately, more managers than leaders."
good,"Great benefits and work-life balance"
good,"Great people, smart and genuinely care about their customers.  They also care a great deal about the small business customer and find innovative ways in which to encourage and help them grow their businesses."
good,Was a great to work from home. Intuit gave great bonuses but you worked hard for them. Let you go with no explanation. Management was not organized. Worked for 2 years and called back every year and all of sudden no explanation no call back.
good,Intuit is a place where the work environment is quite average and the management especially does not pay much attention to feedback and pay little attention to improving the things
good,"Intuit was a employment which was challenging due to not understanding when a lot of the rules were being changed. Other than this, Intuit may have worked out."
good,"Enjoyed helping customers with problems using Turbo Tax but had a poor manager this year (last year manager was supportive and great), had difficulty researching answers for customer problems because of Intuit documentation disorganized, and frequently struggled with computer=related issues."
good,"The day begins at 8:30am with a remote team meeting with the main office sales staff, followed by a day of calling existing customers, who are CPAs, Accountants and Tax preparers. Selling consists of finding out about the culture of each firm, usage of company software, finding out about client staffing and needs for products produced by Intuit. Then, recommending software to fit the updated profile of the firm."
good,"There is no consistency with the company TeleTech that host the client (Turbo Tax) , so it makes the client's company look bad. The work environment needs vast improvements."
good,Constant reorgs and shuffling of leaders makes it difficult for the company to execute on a strategy for more than 6 months at a time. Great co-workers makes up for some of the deficiencies of leadership weaknesses.
good,The people there are what make the difference. Management at the Reno site is poor at best. Still I miss the every day people that worked there.
good,New position. Management and training not well organized. Poor leadership.
good,Too many contractors & not enough full time.  I've seen great employees (contractors) come & go when they should have been kept!
good,"This company has (had?) an ""integrity"" policy applicable to some employees, but not all. Sort of a 'do as I say, not as I do' attitude."
good,"I thought I would always work there.  But they did a massive layoff (238) in July 2012.   Many great employees were let go.  They had no loyalty to those people we built the company.  Many of us we were let go and worked there for 15 or more years.  "
good,Great place to work. All is good excpt they to have layoffs from time to time.
good,Campus and facilities are beautiful but beauty is only skin deep.
good,Intuit is an amazing place to work and grow your career if you are in one of the CA offices. The other parts of the country do not reflect the culture promoted from headquarters. This is frustrating and deflating for those who get to watch their peers from afar enjoy the company they thought they were working for while they are ground down and spit out.
good,"Remote Worker doing TurboTax Support. Flexible work hours, good pay, great technology and talented Front-line Managers.  However, cowardly HR Office that will not give a fair and open answer when dealing with all employee issues. If you are not PC and get crossways on a call, even if you are polite and apologetic, forget it, you are toast. You can be hung out to dry with no answers."
good,I mean the pay is good and some of the managers are helpful. But you have seldom room for growth as a contractor. They don't really see effort. More like if you're a favorite to one of the managers in my humblest opinion. I did love the company though.
good,"Intuit hires contractors during the busy season. After the busy season they hire from the contractor pool to fill open positions. Contractors are not entitles to the benefits and bonuses that Intuit employees get, despite doing the same work. The culture is changing quickly at Intuit. From a company that put employees first, then customers and then share holders, it has been moving to shareholders first, which means that sales goals are more important than the environment. It creates a culture of micro management across the board quickly, with a demoralizing effect on all."
good,"In a typical day you could see anywhere between 10/25 calls.  They did not have a set handle time goal, as payroll and QuickBooks specific issues could take a lot of time to resolve.  Clients were small businesses, with anywhere from 5 to 150 employees.  You will learn how to enter in payroll information into QuickBooks.  You will learn the ins and outs of garnishments.  Coworkers were great, always willing to help.  Some managers were good, for the most part they left a lot to be desired.  Micromanaging, clique-ish behavior."
good,"Everyone is very nice and the atmosphere is great. The training doesnt actually prepare you for the job at hand, just the tools you use. The learning curve is 3 months after training for you to actually understand how to do your job and they say youll have plenty of help until that point. However, once on the floor, help is scarce and time consuming."
good,"Demanding mgt, poor culture, unhappy co-workers, large turnover which leaves you carrying the workload of unfilled roles. Watching deserving people passed over for promotion, depressing overall and senior mgt are oblivious or at the worst uncaring about the company moral ."
good,"This was a seasonal job for the tax season. It was a short-term contract and once tax season ended, the job ended."
good,"Intuit pays you very well, but when you leave, it's a harsh reality that they pay you higher than most in the area, setting you up for failure if you dont budget well.. the work is good, but the ""culture of lay-off's' is something that will have you shaking in your boots your entire employment"
good,"You cant get help like you used to with all the new policy changes, management doesn't seem to care about you as an individual. The turnover rate is terrible and the pay/bennefits are even worse even for an experience CSR"
good,"There were a lot of metrics to keep up, most where based off the customer not your work ethic."
good,"Very stressful, hard to keep up at times. The training isn't very helpful at all.You never really know what each call is going to be about.Its like a continuous guessing game."
good,"Need to work on developing management at all levels. Leadership needs to take chances and be more bold, people are afraid to make decisions. CEO is good."
good,Pay was much too low for my liking. No benefits because of seasonal work. Training was rushed and improper but do to schedule could live with.
good,Management ignores many things that occur. Supervisors lack knowledge and only promote friends. Knowledge is ignored. Managers ignore employees that want to expand their knowledge for the benefit of the company.
good,The work is interesting and the benefits and pay are generous.  The office and people are friendly. It's not clear what management intends to do in the future.
good,Intuit is a social place to work. There are many different department opportunities but the management turnover is unsettling.
good,The CEO truly cares about his people!  And continues to look for ways for the Company to succeed.  I was a contracted employee so I can not speak on the benefits of being a Full Time Employee.  However; I learned a lot and enjoyed my co-workers.
good,Training is very extensive to ensure employees can give customers the best service possible. Most floor managers are very upbeat and supportive. Enjoy the variety of personality types.
good,Great place to start a career with much to learn and a steady pace.
good,Intuit was a great company as far as pay and benefits were concerned. But management is very poor and communication was for the most part non existent. However again the pay was good and they always had very good benefits. Hardest part of the job was having customers curse at you and belittle you. Answering phone call after phone call you learn discipline and patience.
good,"Interesting ""tech"" company in silicon valley. This is specifically for marketing function at Intuit - if you have CPG background - you may enjoy - everyone else (tech company background) Intuit is painful to be at from marketing perspective."
good,"Work was always busy and no day was ever the same, which kept it exciting. I learned a lot about project management, communication and organizational skills."
good,"Great place to work, but if you get on someone's bad side... thats it"
good,"Worked with some amazing family oriented co-workers, but management is cold and not consistent with their word and constant changes make it difficult to receive high marks on reviews and to increase wages. Company events are fun and help bring joy and unity back into a gloomy atmosphere."
good,"This is an ok job, but it is difficult to believe that the company expects to attract CPA's and attorneys to work for a little over $20 per hour. Also, employees are extremely micromanaged, which is stressful."
good,Management turns over constantly. They are more concerned about looking good for upper management then helping developers to become more productive. There often feels like a big disconnect between supervisors and upper management.
good,"Great seasonal job that kept you on your toes.  Upper management was out of touch with the front line managers and agents.  As a manager, it became more about making sure that everyone was at work on a given day than ensuring customer service."
good,"Your base pay is $12.00 (sound nice right?) plus your bonuses for hitting production markers. The check isn't too bad but they constantly threaten your job if you don't hit this marker or that marker. They change how you get paid all the time, meaning your bonuses you worked so hard for this week, may be swept away next week and they bring in a new chart to go by. "
good,"Helped Tier 1 agents with customer issues. "
good,Great tech company that truly lives by in its mission and values. Promotes startup culture and really a career enriching experience for design techies. Great branded company for your early career. For other BUs there is still guesswork going on how to run the business. Some functions get dumped with too much responsibilities and work criminally long hours with the same pay & benefits while many others just get away doing nothing and get even heavier paychecks. Heavy meeting culture where people love to host unproductive meetings throughout the week leaving those with actual job to do with very little time to get things done. I hope this all changes one day and Intuit starts addressing their internal problems.
good,Intuit pays better and offers better benefits than most employers in the area. Those are only as good as long as you have a job though and the company is known for their unexpected lay offs and reorgs. Opportunity to advance is rather limited unless you want to move to California.
good,"Typical call center duties. Training,phone calls, walking customers through use of software. Resolving customers issues. learning about Turbotax software and tax info."
good,"Cool teams, and work. The company is constantly innovating and there is a ton of new initiatives in the works. Employees move laterally in the organization as and when needed which means promotions for new employees are not easy to come by."
good,"This Job is ok. It Does provide you information on quickbooks, but I didn't care for the switching of the schedule every 5 mins, and throwing you into a program i which you didn't sign up for. After that I stopped enjoying the place I worked. Then the schedules are not consistent. If your not a veteran than you work all the holidays and it's just not fair to me."
good,"I was a contractor in Intuit, so I did not have any benefit from it. The project that I was working on changed a lot during my time working there. I was sometimes confused."
good,"High staff turnover due to stressful environment. While the money was better than most support centers, it was not enough to make up for the stress experienced on a daily basis. I was part of a layoff of 800 people, an entire division."
good,"Working at Intuit was not very interesting, but it was otherwise reasonable.  Nice working conditions and fairly reasonable management.  If anything, the management at the company is technically unsophisticated.  Explaining things to them could be frustrating."
good,It was a good experience to learn about tax products. It was mind boggling sometimes. It was also stressful as not enough people were there to finish the work
good,Assist customers with product support calls if needed but primarily addressing security concerns and audit of account activity based off alerts. support tax questions
good,I don't feel the need for these reviews.  I enjoyed working there and what I gained in skills.  I made great relationships with support staff and worked well with all colleagues
good,"Felt like the company pulls you in with all the California perks, with inhouse gyms, etc. It is nice but the work environment is not as great as one might think."
good,"The people are almost uniformly smart and caring but the organization is a bit chaotic.  The hardest working people don't get rewarded but caucasian, tall men do very well at this firm."
good,"Hired as tax support instead of tax advisor because I lacked  specific credentials, however a substantial portion of the work performed was that of a tax adviser."
good,Coffee was good in the support center office all the flavors had me cracked out during training. overall have grown bored of 3rd party software of an un-freeware
good,Good culture and focus on diversity and inclusion. Several changes in management made it challenging to grow. Great opportunities to learn new skills and expand resoonsibiltities.
good,"Has potential but still a lot of bugs need to be worked out. Training, payroll problems and some morale issues to name a few. I think if the company were to invest a bit more into it's people and offer a more competitive salary, it would fare much better."
good,"I worked for intuit through an outsourced company called Sutherland Global. I was trained to do what intuit direct hires do by intuit employees/trainers that flew out to my location. I performed all the required task to and upheld to the intuit standard. But, because I was outsourced I was paid less than half the salary of intuit direct employees to do the same stressful, extensive job."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed working on few online applications.  My managers changed.. Company also had few lay offs, but overall it was OK."
good,Great company. I got to work with several great technicians who I learned a lot from. Management team wasn't the best to work with.
good,"Same job just a different department with Quickbooks. I am now proficient in Quickbooks Online and Quickbooks payroll."
good,I absolutely love working for Quickbooks Online. It is a very fast past job and things change on the daily. I learned how to multitask even more than ever. Working on More multiple books at a time can be challenging yet fun and time passing. I am very self motivated so my managers would rarely coach me as to I would find and fix my own problem areas. I am not perfect and would take constructive criticism with ease that is how you improve!
good,"7th No.company in employee benefit,"
good,This company has a wonderful program set up for their employees. Supervisors are on hand to help with any problem that might come up. Training and team work is a huge plus with this company.
good,"A typical day at work included, but not limited to, data entry, filing, return calls, contact existing and potential clients, schedule and attend vendor lunches and business meeting."
good,Great company to work with. Team is really talented. Working with the great talent helps to build individual confident and technical expertise.
good,One of the industry leaders in Tax and accounting software. As product support specialist assisted customer with navigating the TurboTax website and software. I learned how to enter certain tax information and how to navigate the TurboTax system itself. Great co-workers and management was very helpful when requesting information. Hardest part of the job was discerning what part of the tax process the customer needed help with. Most enjoyable part of the job was getting to learn new software and technology.
good,This was a temporary position that ended due to lay offs. A good company to work for.
good,I worked in the refinance department. Very high call volume. Great training. I really didnt know many of my coworkers because it was all about work. There were different shifts. Good Management.
good,"Great co-workers. The campus was a nice place to come to work everyday. The hardest part of the job was dealing with different and or new management on a regular basis, due to many re-orgs."
good,a great job for anyone who loves to interact with people and problem solve
good,"I loved working for Intuit Turbo Tax. I've learned alot about taxes, and the IRS. The job paid well, and my coworkers were friendly towards me. I also enjoyed my manager/coach. She was very helpful, calm, and easy to work with."
good,"Intuit is known as a good company to work for and until the last month I would agree. Intuit sold our group to another company. We were all given subpar offers from the company we were sold to, and we were given a 3 day deadline to sign. We lost all our RSUs, ESPP, and vested 401k from Intuit. All totally legal but not a good experiance for a company that doesn't pay as well as some of the other top companies and brags about ""Always trying to do the right thing."
good,"Employee Friendly, Open Door Policy encouraged. During my employment I was encouraged to continue my education."
good,You can't help but learn about tax law and the socioeconomic aspect of people filing taxes.
good,I love the fact that you can be who you are. Fun environment and very busy which is great. Always something new to learn.
good,"Good company to work for that pays well but offers ZERO job security. 90% of employees are contract hires  Gets very busy during tax season, and drops off after that."
good,For the most part my experience at Intuit consisted of discontinuity at all levels. When deciding at which point to contact Enrolled Agents and Accountants there is no cohesion. You will get different answers of when and how you should contact them for further assistance. With my manager she was new at managing and had a lot to prove. She was always right even when she was not.
good,"Having been in the field of taxation for 3 decades, this position brought my career full circle by learning how tax preparation software is created.  I learned programming skills as well as how to test how their software programs.  Was responsible for testing all federal individual forms, making sure product worked for the consumer.  More flexible workplace - allowed me to work from home for most of the week.  Downside was high turnover of staff on my project from year to year as well as significant changes year to year on how software was created. Management seemed interested in employee feedback."
good,The hardest part of the job was receiving inbound calls from upset customers because of their electronic payment being process and our system held the transaction.
good,"In my role as an instructional designer, I found myself being laid off and rehired depending on how well TurboTax did that year. I worked for them for 5 different times--3 as a permanent employee and 2 as a contractor. I loved the company and the culture the first time I worked there in 2005 but as time went on, the company and culture changed, they got leaner and a little meaner and eventually, I decided I was chasing a vision that I had and not what the company actually was today. "
good,Slow paced work environment. Lagging promotions - job advancement is slower since promotions are lagging i.e. employee needs to demonstrate the skills for a long period of time before actually getting promoted.
good,"call center inbound sales"
good,Worked there for the season it was a great place to work and learn new ways to interact with different customer situations. At first things were a little unorganized and I had A few Issues with my pay but things were handled in a professional and quick manner.
good,"Great benefits, work hard in tax season then relax. Lay-offs every year after season. "
good,"Very rarely do this hire you after seasonal. They have also had a lot of layoffs in the last year. Long, long hours and it's exhausting... the paychecks are pretty nice, and my bonus was about a paycheck and a half at the end of the season."
good,"There is  little to no advancement in position inside the company."
good,The company is going through growing pains and outsourcing departments to lower the costs and scale the business. Very generous with benefits and salary.
good,"Intuit, Inc. as a whole is a wonderful company with great values, and wonderful leadership on the CEO, President and VP level. The pay is excellent for the area, and the benefits are exceptional. Matter of Fact, you probably wont find benefits like theirs ANYWHERE unless your government, or a state employee. "
good,"Hey, a job is a job; especially a sales gig.  Typical sales job.  No room for advancement just sell sell sell.  I was very successful here, not because of anything they did to make me successful."
good,"Overall good job and work environment, great training, but a seasonal only position."
good,I don't have the option to skip this review.  I don't want to do this.
good,"Intuit was a great place to work and flourish, and I hope to carry on values and lessons learned."
good,"A typical day at work involves customer/agent interaction via inbound phone calls to help resolve either simple or complex issues related to data entry within two tax softwares. I've learned how to improve my troubleshooting and reverse-engineering skills. I've learned how to adapt and interact in a corporate setting. I've seen many different types of management styles by both the supervisor which I would report to, and those that are above them. My co-workers are a fun and interesting bunch. They remind me of my time in the military, as they are all from different walks of life. The hardest part of the job was being unable to resolve issues, or provide more information to issues being created as a result of defects, or state that it is product limitation and is not supported. The most enjoyable part is when I get to interact with a customer in a manner that makes the whole experience enjoyable for both parties involved, and to know that I was able to assist in resolving the issue."
good,"Working here will teach you how to navigate large organizations and influence at different levels. "
good,"Managers at Intuit are indestructible wastes of space that often take credit for their team's accomplishments while similarly blaming their team when goals are not met. They enjoy asking for your feedback and then either disregard it, or criticize you for the feedback you have given. They have a tendency to run experiments and then they simply ignore the data that doesn't support their goals until (much like G.W.) they can declare ""Mission Accomplished"" without solving anything."
good,"I worked at Intuit for 6 seasons and what was constant was that each year when I returned I would need to learn the new way of doing the same job. A different process, different software tools, different Managers, ect. Sometimes the changes were good sometimes not so much, sometimes the change was in the job itself such as the final year I worked they changed my group from Intuit seasonal employees to Temp service contract workers and changed the work contract to include the entire tax season. A huge problem considering most of us worked in tax offices full time during tax season. They also changed our benefit package from some to none which didn’t go over very well either. (Whew, rant over) On the positive side the people and culture is extremely friendly. The pay and benefits seem very reasonable IF you actually work for the company. The work load is reasonable, the company sponsors quite a few fun social events each year, has an awesome cafeteria, large gym and a beautifully landscaped campus. Despite a couple negatives I would recommend the company as an employer. Just expect changes to everything and have a backup plan in case of outsourcing or a reorg."
good,"I started my Intuit employment as a tax analyst programmer with the understanding that I would be formally trained to program. I was hired to bring my tax expertise and work alongside a programmer while I formally learned programming on the job and through formal education. Ended up finding out the hard way that I was expected to learn complex programming within a year from watching someone else only. And no support from management to pay for formal professional classes/training. Quite the challenge! Essentially, the job was really two big jobs in one - tax pro and programmer. Another challenge: Intuit has a strange culture of reorganizing each business unit each year. Once you were getting used to your manager, a reorg would occur and another new manager came into the picture. The fact that we all work on a tax program didn't seem that important when most managers came in with varied other backgrounds and no tax experience. While I was there, I saw many great and talented individuals come and go because of management. Compensation was good for San Diego, CA wages, work/life balance was good also. Culture/Values are great but management seemed to spin them for their benefit at times. I can definitely say that the people I worked with, outside of management, were incredibly knowledgeable, committed, dedicated, and all around wonderful to work with each day. If you plan to work at Intuit, get the most out of your peers and work well as a team member. Regardless of what goes on with management, the benefit is within the work you do with your co-workers! I salute each and every"
good,The low salary devalues all the other company virtues.  If the salary is indicative of the value given to the corporation then it seriously undervalues the employees who have professional school and  training and experience.
good,"Enjoyed my position but it was very unstable and varied season to season. No security to count on. Great second job or for someone who has a second income/spouse, etc."
good,"I was an intern at Intuit for a little over half a year. While the benefits for being an intern were great, I found that the structure around my team wasn't great, and the feedback I received was sub-par, especially with it being my first industry experience. My team saw our manager on average about once a week, and did the tasks assigned to us, but there wasn't really a great code review process, as we didn't do pull requests to have our code looked at before merging it in, and did a sort of overall code review maybe once every two weeks with an engineer that wasn't on our team. "
good,"Intuit has a lot of focus on strong leadership and values its employees first. It flows all the way from the CEO."
good,"+ Interview process was simple and fairly easy to complete. "
good,"Job Work/Life Balance is too poor"
good,I drove one of the largest programs at Intuit over a year that I was a consultant there. I had a chance to work with really smart people. The downside of working atIntuit was that the management system over there is very inefficient. A lot of time wasted in meeting rooms and directors really don't know wich direction to move forward.
good,"Not a bad place to work, overall, the benefits were good.  The employe culture was great.  However, Intuit lied to it's entire telesales team.  "
good,I spend my day taking care of customers and issues that allows my team to be successful. I am a true believer that what you put into work is what you will get out of it.
good,Each day brings something different. Some days are slow and some are very fast paced.
good,My position was a contract employment. The staffs were very helpful in training me on all of the phases of my assignments. I was there only for year end closing corporate accounting taxes submission for all 1099. I enjoyed my time working with the CFO and the accounting dept. staffs.
good,"First, this is a call center. Call centers are not for everyone. This call center is not for anyone who wants compensation and raises to keep up with their responsibilities. It's a great set of products that you support, but this company wants super agents, with no raises for the difference.  It's great when you're supporting one or two products, but when you're getting paid the same amount as Joe, who supports one product, and you support five, it starts to dawn on you that you are not important. Bonuses are based on survey ratings that are arbitrary and the questions mostly don't even apply to you, and dealing with the internationally outsourced employees is such a headache that it's actually easier, faster, and better customer service to just look it up yourself and help them fix the problem. So, not only do you end up doing five jobs at once because you're supposed to, you're doing someone else's jobs too. This was all fine when I started working here, the perks were nice and the expectations and trainings were reasonable and effective, but the expectations changed in a way that took the satisfaction out of the job. All that aside, the people that I worked with were amazing, and I still consider myself to be friends with several of them."
good,"Intuit was ok for temp work. The work environment and culture was great. If the pay was better I would have stayed."
good,"Going in each day was fun. I enjoyed the campus and the friendly atmosphere. However, as part of reception, we had to be the front line for angry customer phone calls."
good,"Small teams, everyone helps each other out. Management always around to help with any issues. Good collaborative culture but the industry itself not fast paced enough"
good,"Engineering Management - Leading Full stack test automation, setting up the CI/CD pipelines for rapid releases, Team Building and Mentorship"
good,"Intuit is an excellent company to work for as long as you don't need permanence. The casual environment is ever changing and very progressive. Permanent jobs are tough to get due to limited availability and fierce competition. That said, those that are permanent receive great benefits. Seasonal employees still benefit from paid sick time and 401k matching. Dress code is casual, there is free coffee and sometimes free snacks. Pleasant work environment even during stressful times of the year."
good,"The day at Intuit as an Intern is just like a full time employee. "
good,"call center experiance a big plus with this job, co workers helpful, good schedule, good pay"
good,The environment working at Intuit was fun but management didn't really know what was going on half the time. The times we had to ask over and over what the next thing going on was going to be they had no idea.
good,Excellent atmosphere and benefits. Everyone gets along like family. Excellent facilities on site such as a gym and cafeteria with an amazing chef! Love it.
good,"A typical day working for Intuit is fun and a family like environment, great to place to work. Company caterers to the need of employee and their family. Very active in the community assisting those in need and those who are seeking employment."
good,"great place to work, however, it has it's ups and downs. would be a lot better if they kept the right people around, however, the focus should always be on any and all customers."
good,"This was a great place to work.  The culture, was good, team was great, work / life balance was wonderful but the problems were uninteresting and better suited for somebody who wants to put in a 9-5 with little stress and very little creative room.  The hardest part was staying motivated when such little new code was being injected into the application.  The most enjoyable part was the camaraderie with the other staff members."
good,"Even though the account is really stressful because we are Quickbooks expert and that application is used by businessmen/women in creating a paycheck, doing payroll to their employees. It will really took 2-3hrs to talk with the customer over the phone. But, after work, we really make sure that we have time to unwind. So we do have a team building every 3months."
good,"Even though we started out with a larger work force and was reduced to an even smaller one, the working team still was able to complete and accomplish all required/desired tasks/assignments requested by the host employer."
good,"The basic training team was excellent, however when being trained by specific department manager, course was very poor. Our Trainer/department lead was rude, condescending, arrogant and very poorly prepared to teach motivated, willing agents. She preferred instead to eat her breakfast at head of class, weakly covering highly important tasks that instead had to be learned in a trial by fire atmosphere. Her style was so haphazard and jumped from subject to subject without regard to cohesive presentation of he material. Many of us were surprised they kept us taking calls as we knew so little about payroll we seem incompetent to clients."
good,I loved working with Intuit until the changes in business plan. I did not agree with the changes in which they wanted to bring in businesses. It put business owners in difficult positions.
good,Great company culture but some of the employees have clicks and are very childish. Intuit does right by the employees with the benefits.
good,"Training was great. They never hire anyone permanently. The manager I had targeted specific employees which led to their terminations. You will get written up for days out of work even if you were sick, they prioritize being present at work over not spreading diseases/bacteria/viruses. Tardiness is never acceptable. Metrics falling is unacceptable also."
good,Management wasn't great. They cared more about metrics than about people working. The pay wasn't even close to what you should earn based on the knowledge and experience needed for the position. The only way to survive on the pay they give is to work tons and tons of overtime. I worked about 80 hours a week just to survive on the pay.
good,Great company run on concensus management and it takes too long for decisions to be made.
good,I have also get a chance to work with such a gaint in SaaS revenue like INTUIT but some how it is for just 2 + yrs . But if talk about personal growth then it is slow.
good,"A typical work day is coming in and greeting my agents, ask them how they're doing. I listen to agents calls to see if they need improving in any areas. Document the calls and coached agents in areas of opportunities (let them listen to the call). Taking supervisor calls throughout the day as needed. Hardest part of the job is getting people to show up to work. Documented it per write up or verbal. Easiest part of the job is talking with the agents."
good,"This is a work from home position. It was not bad. Good managers and always understood if you needed to take time off. However, no time off for the peak periods.x"
good,"This was a great place to work, but I was laid off because the CEO decided to send a lot of our work overseas. I ended up training the team in India that eventually took over my job. The severance pay was okay, but it was disillusioning to be laid off of a job that you've had for over 6 years."
good,"The place was great to work when it used to be in the old building. The benefits were awesome and so were the people. Not a fan of the management though, they were a bit clueless and sneaky with their hiring practices."
good,"Most days were cookie cutter with very little in deviation, however the work environment was calm and relaxed when not on the phone with a customer. There were very few times when you had little problems to fix most issues needed the employee to have vast knowledge of the product and background systems to achieve the goal of the call. Resources were readily available to those who needed it, both online and in person. Family environment where your co-workers were your family."
good,Great Products. But the company has a revolving door - there is no job security there. They have outsourced all their jobs to India.
good,"I worked for Intuit during the 2006 tax season, and the training seemed to be sub par and couldn't really hold to what we experienced on the phones. They seem to obsess on their employees working overtime and would often call when you were off or gone to try to get you in to come work overtime."
good,After my retail jobs this was my first job to start work with it. I worked at this place for only 6 months but I feel like I been working there since long that much attachment you can get there with Friendly nature of people and atmosphere. I enjoyed working there and in future will look forward to go back to Intuit.
good,Not having to get up and go anywhere was nice at first but I prefer going to an office. When issues arised there was no supervisor to really help. You got dinged for the smallest things
good,Fast paced and multi tasking is a must. Learned so much from customers since they are mostly accountants and business owners. Learn mostly about different businesses.
good,"good place to work, good benefits, awesome work culture, some bad managers making it hard to work, overall a great place to work, but very fast paced work"
good,"Not bad. They really need to fix their product though. This is an accounting company and they cannot even figure out how to successfully pay their sales staff."
good,"Being bilingual was a huge asset."
good,"stay away from taking a position on their Mississauga Care team."
good,I loved everything about intuit.
good,Nothing but repetitiveness of walking around the building every half hour and writing it down.
good,seasonal work only
good,"Extensive experience in Technical Product and Program Management on Billing, payment, ERP, Compliance platforms and various SaaS applications. I have successfully run many company vide critical projects and got accolades for it."
good,"First year working there. Seems like a great company. Good people, good opportunities to continue to learn and grow. Possibilities for advancement is there."
good,"There was lots of employee recognition and incentives. Enjoyed meeting and working with new clients, and setting up their payroll to make it easier for them to pay their employees."
good,"Annual depart restructures clean out tenured employees for cheaper hires.  "
good,"Well, it was a long time ago. We started together as a team and then as we got deployed individually, it got more complicated. We were waiting for a management decision."
good,This position was fast paced when it was busy thru tax season after that it dropped off to next to no work. The managers wanted you to do your best in all situation with little guidelines
good,"Company values all employees.  There is a lot of praise and perks if you do a good job.  Coaches are helpful and professional. Tax season can be hectic but the company tries to make things run as smoothly as possible."
good,"I was scheduled a specific shift 4 10 hr+ days.  During tax season, overtime was mandatory, but they would provide lunch and a 5-10 min massage while on the phone with customers doing technical support (it was a little odd because it's hard to truly appreciate the massage while trying to focus on the customer.)  If you were not on the phones, it's a great company to work for, but difficult management in the technical support phones."
good,Good company to work for.. Culture is good.. management is good... consistent phone calling.. can get overwhelming... quotas a large but a stretch attainable
good,"Contract employee for Intuit/TurboTax at Sutherland Global Services.  It was a fun and exciting place to work, and company to work for!"
good,"Great place to work with a lot of ability to move around. Wonderful culture, benefits, co-workers, overall great place. I would recommend this company to anyone."
good,"Only left because they relocated, pretty good place to work. now that Left I miss it. Would work here again, management good except for those on site."
good,"Canadian org leaves much to be desired. The US is the place to be for any growth opportunities. Socials are frequent and perks are better than most (snacks, outings, etc). Pay is top of the line. Tax season is brutal."
good,Great work-life balance with good pay and benefits.  Get to work closely with customers and grow your career.  Definitely recommend  especially if you are interested in going above and beyond your day job.
good,This was a large call center at the time but has since become a much smaller operation. Attempts at using Six Sigma to improve call times backfired and customer satisfaction declined. Eventually most of the support was outsourced to India.
good,"I was part of a ""blitz"" team in which we did not get the full amount of training. However, they did make sure we knew our skills well before putting us on the floor. The particular management at my location was a bit hectic. I ended up doing work above my pay grade because those in charge didn't fully know what they were doing and made communication between employees and supervisors a bit strained. Overall the company itself cares about its workers."
good,The culture of Intuit is upbeat and very healthy to be in! I love the benefits that Intuit has to offer and the relationships that I have built!
good,"Intuit is an incredibly great workplace. Every day was different and staff worked as part of a team and autonomously. We had the opportunity to work from home, come into the office dressed casually and every day was about hard work and having fun! The company is extremely innovative and up to date with the latest technology."
good,"Excellent training, seasonal employment with 401k benefits.  Supervisors and other team members can be any state yet productive"
good,Great company with many opportunities for career development. Team culture is strong and positive. Management needs to be more transparent and accessible to its team so that job performance can be achieved not only by people with seniority.
good,The  hurdles  which  i  have  faced  here were  really  challenging   the  manager under  i worked was  really supportive and office environment was very jovial.
good,"company keep hiring and cut endless, which really impact the moral. Each employee has its own office, which is awesome."
good,"Great place to work fresh out of college to get experience from a company that still feels and acts like a start-up. Constantly changing and growing, but career development is lacking."
good,SaaS division backed up by a national financial software organization. QuickBase is easily recognized by the Intuit name and invests heavily in its employees
good,We have a flexible timing here.We have an option o work from home.I got good exposure while working with this company.Co-Workers are helpful and we will get all kinds of supports needed to perform better.
good,"Intuit really takes care of their employees. They offer good benefit package and great culture."
good,"good work life balance. "
good,"Inbound sales call center.  Good support, training and development within teams."
good,"Early morning start to prepare and organize daily tasks to be completed by others and myself.  Attend meetings, answer questions for the cross functional team.  Report out daily stats for issues found/resolved."
good,"•	Assisted customer in troubleshooting their problem with their financial software and also help them installing the software for their own convenience.                                                              "
good,Turbo tax is a wonderful company to work for.This Company pushes me to be all i can be and more.  I love working for Turbo Tax. I work from home with Turbo Tax and it is great.
good,I was a contractor there and the learning experience was good. I am a skilled Administrative Assistant who got the chance to learn a new position.
good,"As a seasonal employee, one does not expect the environment and team building attitude that came from Intuit. They were always looking for ways to make things challenging and enjoyable."
good,"open Work culture"
good,"Intuit has a very fun culture, yet each and every day I am continually challenged at a healthy level."
good,I worked for Intuit for over 3 years until they decided to eliminate a bunch of position at the local office. I'd still be working there otherwise. 
good,Good people and easy to work with.  Company is always looking for ways to improve processes and make things better for employees.  Benefits are also great.
good,It was ok. I had to drive really far to get there.The people were nice. 
good,"This was a semester long project I worked on through my MBA program. The company staff is great and open to new, innovative ideas."
good,"Intuit Turbo Tax was just a seasonal position working as a ""Working on my return"" agent. I helped both private individuals and small business people to complete and e-file their taxes. I learned how to work under pressure how to find the answers to peoples questions and on the most difficult problems how to get the help I needed to help the customer from the higher level management teams."
good,"Very bright people who work hard and play hard. Excellent campus w/ Gym, good cafateria, and other amenities."
good,"Always learning a new skill, in a fast-paced, exciting environment."
good,"One of the better jobs I've had. My supervisor is great and easy to talk to which makes the job a great place to be everyday. Unfortunately, I'm a temp and they only keep their temps for a short number of months. Which is why I'm seeking new employment."
good,I originally went to work for Intuit simply because I fell in love with their QuickBooks product working at another employer. Intuit continues to have successes with their software and I still maintain relationships with employees I met while working there.
good,The Company as a whole is very forward thinking and they are interested in the customer satisfaction experience.
good,"Unfortunately the office culture was too saturated with senior personal and old habits so it was difficult for them to control the new hires positive experience. Yet I loved the company, its vision and the position!"
good,Too many meetings to make a difference. Overall benefits are a plus. Executive leadership plays favorites. There are lots of learning opportunities but little advancement.
good,"Great company to work for; very relaxed environment. As long as you do what you are suppose, the job is very easy. I just wanted a higher salary for my growing family."
good,Intuit was an highly competitive corporation where all the staff back you up and helped you succeed to higher levels. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I help customers by solving their issues and putting smiles on their face.
good,"Great product and environment. Your Manager will either make or break your experience at Intuit. There is a wide range of middle manager skills from ""right on it"" to "" having no clue"". Each manager/director has a lot of influence on how the group is treated and the overall Intuit experience."
good,"It's a great place to work if you're on the payroll of the organization. Since the company does not extend contracts beyond a period of 2 years, you don't feel secure in the job."
good,"My work with Intuit was positive, for the most part. I enjoyed the people and the challenges I was given, and was able to both improve my own professional skills as well as help others to improve theirs. I can say without a doubt that I left there better for the experience, and left people there better for my presence."
good,"Intuit overall has great benefits, great salary.  The culture is changing.  Manegement talks about work life balance  but what it really means is balance your life you work a lot. The job is stressful especially during tax season (Dec-June).  The hardest part of the job is actually work instead of being in meetings about work.  The best part of work is the people."
good,I loved the fact that learning was a part of Intuit.  I enjoyed helping people with their payroll problems.  I also enjoyed working with government groups.
good,"Fun place to work, I have enjoyed my time at Intuit.  The sales teams are made up of individuals that have known each other for many years.  Most of the workers are from the surrounding Fredricksburg, VA community."
good,"Great place to grow your career."
good,"A typical day for TurboTax required logging into your systems 5-10 minutes early before your shift. Assisting  Customers with any problems they may have  with installing a cd. Helping customers find errors in tax returns and submit the return."
good,Working at Intuit was a fun and productive experience that allowed me to take on a contract job testing tax software program results. My co-workers were awesome and taught me how to utilize their system of proofing and checking tax forms submitted to Intuit for filing.
good,Love it! Great hours and training.  The trainers and staff are very professional.  Management is great and it is very busy during tax season.
good,"The project was Agile with Scrum Master leading the project. The RALLYE tool was define sprint cycle, user  story, task. Daily standup reporting cross functionally with SME, Infra, dev Team."
good,"a typical day includes handling around 75-90 inbound calls from customers for various products and services offered by intuit"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Intuit.  Most people work pretty hard - those who don't are shuffled aside and are eventually pushed out.  This place is hugely political, but division and team performance in delivering solutions with transparency buys the most political goodwill.  The frauds and cheats don't last very long.  "
good,"Great place to work. Great Benefits."
good,Management does whatever it takes for the bottom line regardless of business practicality.  Intuit does not nurture it's employees to advance.  Politics and nepotism are the norm.
good,"Took and made calls to the customer helping them set up appointments to learn how to use their new product more efficiently. Learned how to deal with criticisms from customers about problems they are experiencing with their product. Co-workers were helpful when questions came up that didn't have a clear answer, they were able to clarify. Making sure that the required number of daily appointments were set. Talking and assisting customers was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"I was a 'working on my return' customer care agent. I helped both small business and individuals to file their taxes using Turbo Tax. I learned quite a bit on doing tax returns, although I was a bookkeeper and did Quarterly taxes for a small business (Grand Finishes, Inc.) for over 10 years. I worked from home as I have been disabled since 2001. Hardest part of the job was finding the answers to customers questions using a Mosaic system that didn't work properly most times. I enjoyed helping people and had many happy satisfied clients who gave me great reviews."
good,Intuit put an impressive amount of effort in keeping an inviting and vibrant work space that was consistently full of positive energy.
good,"Intuit provides amazing benefits. Depending on which division you work, the company as a whole is pretty incredible."
good,"Overall a great company to work for, but dont plan on retiring from there. Stay too long and you then become replaceable...no matter what.Great benefits and 401k plans."
good,It was great working with customers and problem solving.I enjoyed helping people with their technical issues i get a great satisfaction knowing i did my best tro please this customer.
good,Transition mgmt too often and modify job duty’s to accommodate their infrastructure changes.  Expect long hours when assigned a project and with less support in IT.
good,Good place to work. Could spend more time mentoring Junior hires. Might have just been my experience and not a reflection of all teams and organizations at Intuit.
good,Taking inbound calls is fine but the wage is comparable to McDonald's. So living off of it kind of sucks. Management is great and very accommodating. In fact it is probably the best set of managers I have ever had.
good,Company has strong core values set forth by its CEO and founder. Cares for employees and customers. Strives to reinvent itself. Has stayed relevant with changing technological landscapes.
good,"The overall trainings were very good, intense, but very good.Management was helpful, organized. Breaks were fair. Compensation was very good. Schedule was flexible. r"
good,"I worked in the risk management department and while it was very stressful dealing with merchants and their funds, it was very educational because you got to learn all the different ways consumers and merchants alike can commit fraud."
good,Intuit was a great place to work.  I had learned not only work experience but  personal growth for 15  years working with Intuit. My typical day was to work with Business Units  such as data analytics and database changes to keep up with the Business changes. I enjoyed my work when it helped my Business Unit successful and meeting their deadlines.
good,The contract experience was a very positive one. The company allows the flexibility of work from home even for contractors. All individuals I worked with were very helpful and welcoming.
good,I've been here 5 years and the management is not good at all. They hire no experience managers who don't care about their agents. The commissions is not that good when it's run on RPC and there's no way to move up on this type of platform.
good,"This was a good company to work for as they trained us in QuickBooks Online for the U.S. and Canada, yet there was little opportunity for advancement."
good,"If you work for TurboTax or Quickbooks, you are in good shape.  working for the tax divisions in Plano is like going back in time.  They are definitely a step-child of the master brands."
good,"For the most part the company is great, however the support tend to get pretty tedious at times, since Tier II agents are misinformed about new updates and preferences with the software"
good,"Enjoyed the continued learning and value of new skills.  Benefits and the people made it a great place to work.  My co-workers were like a family team, helping each other get it all accomplished."
good,The work from home position is great. The 3 week training can be a little frustrating but if you follow along and don't have any computer issues everything should go smoothly.
good,"Truly a work hard and play hard place to work. The employees were energized and goal oriented. It was not just get the job done, but get it down right."
good,Intuit was a great place to work. However things re very slow and management is poor. Too many middle managers with constant change seem to distort company objectives and goals. Not so concerned about employees as they portray themselves to be. Benefits are great! Some of the best that I have ever had. It seems like people who work there enjoy it and want to work there. I wish there was more of a unique and distinct culture that would set it apart in a better way - a livelier way.
good,"Great place to work, awsome people,great benifits, tons of perks, very good enviroment. Always feel welcome."
good,I found myself continually challenged and encouraged to develop and improve during my time at Intuit. Eventually I felt my career had stagnated a little and found it time to move on.
good,"While core values are constantly espoused, sadly, not often executed well."
good,"•          Managed a high-volume workload within a deadline-driven environment. Resolved an average of 200 inquiries in any given week and consistently met performance benchmarks in all areas (speed, accuracy, volume)."
good,"Was technical support, great company to work for but dept was horrible. Hours changed at a whim, no job security."
good,"Since this was my Company at IBM - Intuit. It was a great platform to learn the corporate culture."
good,"Management good, work not so bad. Focus on customer satisfaction."
good,A very good company to work for. Good benefits and good people.
good,It seemed like a great company to work for.  Unfortunately I entered under the false pretense of moving into a different department  based on performance.  My manager was new and was poorly informed on the products and services we were dealing with.  Other managers and peers were by far more educated and helpful while with this company.
good,"Working at Intuit was a very good experience - the people were fanastic, and the work environment was very unique."
good,Great place to work however I was laid off due to a reorg change. Management very supported for the most part.
good,"I loved this job! I sold credit card processing services to businesses via chat and phone. I learned how to ask open-ended questions to best determine customer needs, and tailor sales pitches to best fit the customer's business. During my time at Intuit, I was made a mentor, which meant that I trained the new employees about the products we sold and how to sell them. I developed a reputation as being the one to go to when there were any questions about a product or service we sold. Even supervisors came to me with questions! I loved to help."
good,Answer tax calls from clients for input questions and solutions as quickly as possible.
good,"pro: stable company, good brand, focus on innovation."
good,"Intuit is a great company if you're looking for work life balance and steady work. However, if you're looking for a company with innovation in its blood I would recommend looking elsewhere - this is a large, old company and despite its best efforts it shows."
good,Good work life balance and compensation. Not too many opportunities for advancement of career. Overall job culture is good compared to other similar companies
good,"I was consulting there for 9 months till the money runs out."
good,Learnt a lot  working there. Good colleagues. Every day goes well with minor challenges. Management is friendly. Hardest part of job will be work load in some seasons.
good,"My favorite part about working for Intuit is obviously working from home. I am able to balance work and life better this way. I started out working full-time, but as tax season dwindled out, my hours did, too. The pay is fair, but I need more than the hours I am working at Intuit. As for management, I do not have an actual manager. I have someone who I reach out to, via email, when I have questions, or need help. I would like better communication with supervisors. I receive cool discounts on software and financial tools like Turbo Tax, Mint, and QuickBooks, which is pretty rad! So, overall, it is a pretty cool job, but I do not recommend, if you are looking for super steady hours, or a set schedule."
good,"Hard to move within the company. Some managers are hard to work with. But the overall quality of engineers great. Strong emphasis in work/life balance, ability to work from home."
good,"I answer phone calls from 8 am to 5 pm. I really love that"
good,"Learned to amend payroll taxes."
good,it was a great experience and i learnt a lot not only for my career but also personally through the amazing people that work for intuit. it is about business but the people part does not fall short.
good,"It is a great Company, wonderful benefits. "
good,"Was a good place to work. When they had their own building, they had the nap rooms, cafeteria and lots of events for the staff. Were always offering chances to work with other groups and opportunities for advancement."
good,"Nice place to work, great work-life balance. "
good,"In general, Intuit has pretty good pay and benefits. How you can advance where depend on which department you are in and where physical location where you are."
good,"Great place to do meaningful work helping fuel small business success"
good,"It is difficult to write a review about a great organization with one super-horrible manager. "
good,"Pros :"
good,"I worked for QBO in the Customer Care department. Great company and they treat their employees pretty well overall. Sometimes they can act a little too corporate for a software company, but they are huge so it is expected."
good,"Employees are very helping and good workplace. use of in-house tools which are creative and tailored for the company's purpose."
good,Management is the best although compensation is not good. They provide good bonuses and incentives. Not an easy account but you'll find it somewhat educating to work here.
good,"As far as call centers go, it's the best one I've worked at. Good pay, good benefits, and a fun environment. There is on onsite cafeteria. They do a lot of activities like an awesome Christmas party. They feed you lunch or other treats on a regular basis. Cool place; wish I hadn't left."
good,"The people are great and the culture is terrific for go-getters.  This is not an organization for those looking for a just day-to-day job.  Very performance oriented.  Unfortunately, there is a lot of clique-like behavior, even at the management levels.  Decisions are frequently not based on objective points, but rather on gut-feeling then finding the data to back that viewpoint up.  "
good,Fun atmosphere with catered lunches almost 80% of the time. I learned the ins and outs of how to target and market D3 software to small to medium size businesses.
good,"The people were very nice and the office is very productive; however, the onboarding experience left a lot to be desired. For someone with little experience, it proved to be a challenge learning the role. Some of the companies products are given far higher priority than other products."
good,"Good new college graduate job, good people, and decent work life balance.  Management enjoyment is dependent on your manager like any other role"
good,Intuit has good work culture and an egaged employee force. It is trying to become fast paced and more technology focused. There is focus on developing the products the right way.
good,A typical day at work will include helping customers place their orders for their small businesses. Working at Intuit is a very rewarding career.
good,Intuit is a great place to work but has a lot of different divisions that they buy and sell which can make job stability rough.
good,Great company to work for.  Great leaders. Easy going. Unfortunately I am a contractor and Intuit is on a hiring freeze at  this time I will need to end my career with Intuit.
good,"Intuit is a great place to learn and grow. The culture supports education and questions without ego. Every level of designer, developer and engineer work to elevate each other. It is both fun and challenging work that has exposure to many users each year."
good,"Intuit was a great place to work, great people, great benefits and perks. The work was interesting and challenging; you learned a lot in a fast paced environment."
good,"Intuit always try to use latest technology and give training to their employees to work on these technologies."
good,"Intuit has great pay and great benefits, but it is the people that make your truly want to stay. The hardest part of the job is struggling to meet the excessive goals you are given with bad leads."
good,"they lay off alot of employees, great culture and great benefits. I made friendships that will last a lifetime here. GREAT culture! Benefits were awesome when i worked there (ski pass) but they quickly took that perk away."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was that i had to a new goal for me everyday because everyday we had different targets and different accounts that provided us enough opportunity to think about new ideas to contribute in order to achieve personal as well as business targets,"
good,"Really enjoyed coming into work everyday for this company, but there was always a stress factor and it affected every employee."
good,I loved the customer service aspect and how you can finish an interaction having legitimately helped someone enough to make a difference but sometimes the leadership fell short of the standards i have come to expect from large companies and things fell through the cracks.
good,"Intuit acquired the merchant processing company I was working for. I learned about their flag ship products Quicken, QuickBooks, and Turbo Tax. I was part of the technical team that integrated our e-commerce payment gateway into the above products to accept payments for Intuit and their customers who use their business accounting software. The most enjoyable part of the job was the company culture and willingness of anyone that worked there from the CEO to the most entry level position to share ideas and teach. Teaching best practices went in any direction. The hardest part of the job was being laid off due to the economy at the time."
good,"Firstly was employed on contract and my Manager had stepped back to his old role was asked to leave."
good,"Did not have the support I would have expected for this type of company.  I was mostly told to ""Google"" questions and ideas while learning JAVA rather than an on-hands training and coaching."
good,"I began working for Lacerte Software in 1989.  In 1998, Intuit acquired Lacerte Software.   As a result, I had experience working for a privately held company as well as a large corporation.  I obtained valuable experience at both companies.  Both organizations were well run and took very good care of their employees.   I worked long hours but the overall compensation was excellent."
good,Intuit India is great place to work for and but if you are really looking to learn then it would disappoint you.
good,"It is a great place to work. Great pay and the benefits are amazing. However, the downfall is the layoffs every year and even people who do not work at intuit know about the layoffs and how frequent they are."
good,"Intuit has a great professional environment, benefits, and understanding of work life balance.  However, depending on the department, advancement can be difficult and budgets are tight."
good,"Intuit has a very laid back culture. From the security staff that actually takes the time out to remember you by name to the personal trainers in the fitness center, I never witnessed such a liberal job culture. My position at Intuit required me to speak to accountants and troubleshoot issues they are having with their software such as QuickBooks, EasyACCT, etc. In some case it is required to remotely control their computer and go into the coding of the program itself."
good,"Typical day involves fixing production issues, patching and maintenance activities. Best place to work."
good,"Intuit is a great company with competitive benefits.  Managers respect the work life balance, encourage a healthy life through gym memberships, exercise classes and more.  Moreover, Intuit stays on the cutting edge of technology, inspires innovation and gives great opportunities for continuing education."
good,Great place to flex your technology muscles. Hard driving professionals and an excellent company culture.
good,"Was able to learn more than I expected to. Company is motivated to know what drives their customers to purchase their products. Many locations. Staff and management teams were very helpful and positive. Major downfall is alot of positions are contract only which actually causes alot of turmoil and inner anxieties within employees. Not many permanent positions offered to contractors. However, contractors are given the opportunity to enter into an additional contract after 90 days from original contract end date."
good,"It is a great place to work, except for the fact that it is constantly changing - meaning the technologies have been changing, a lot of new people being hired and a lot of old employees have been leaving."
good,Work hours were great. I learned I need more skills to keep that job.
good,Intuit is a great place to work.Was laid of due to projections.
good,"Intuit has an amazingly focused culture on innovation and growth. Innovative thinking is encouraged and rewarded! The leadership works to provide vision and allows for teams to bring new ideas and strategies into that view. In an operational role it can be challenging to balance new strategies with effective processes. Operations are judged based on availability and innovation can often introduce risk into that equation. In order to drive the innovative culture of the company, operations teams often have to double their work load to support multiple experiments while maintaining revenue generating businesses."
good,Developed and delivered on Strategy for Security Operations Service Migration including IPS and IDS architecture and deployment to align with a new operationally efficient strategy
good,"Intuit is the leader in almost all of their products. No one comes close to TurboTax or Quickbooks, yet."
good,"Analysed/tested data. Trouble shooted issues, attended meetings, created documentation. Not having enough resources. Worked long hours, throughout the years not always being appreciated for the work that was done. The people are awesome!  The office is amazing campus. Some groups allow to to work from home."
good,"Benefits are truly bar none with Intuit (Exceptional Benefits).   Company does not clearly take the time to understand the value some of their employees bring before laying off their workers (They need to take a serious look at how they are reviewing who stays and who goes).  Management is hit or miss (Don't get me wrong I have worked with some amazing leaders in the company)...   Overall, great benefits, but some work needs to be done behind the scenes to ensure the right people stay and the wrong ones move on to a different line of work...."
good,"The Tax Expert role is great in that it can be done remotely.  The flexibility is not exactly as advertised, and the pay is just barely adequate.  If you are retiring or just starting, this might be a great gig for you.  If you have your own book of clients, this might be a little more trouble than it's worth.  The culture is pretty nice, and management was responsive and helpful in my experience."
good,"Even though the core values expressed in the 6 solid statements in the past have blurred into infographic buzzspeak to spur the hivemind towards innovation and production, there are still life signs showing among the people. In fact, that was one of the core values - ""It's the People"". It seems to have been forgotten by the upper management primarily because the people in those roles change and the roles shift periodically in a few years. Besides the first core value ""Integrity without Compromise"", ""It's the People"" was the most dynamic by presenting an ecosystem of balanced importance of the employees, customers, and shareholders. Satisfied employees lead to satisfied customers, leading to satisfied shareholders, which leads back to satisfied employees. But,  over time, the balance seemed to shift greatly with emphasis on the shareholders a.k.a. The Bottom Line, and that effected the employees.  Full timers were culled out and returned as contractors or replaced with newer contractors for lesser compensation. Customers began noticing on the service side of the business that familiar veterans of the trade were replaced by newer people trained differently and not quite getting the same service as before. It appeared to be similar on the production side as well. Yes, tax and financial software can fluctuate seasonally, yearly, and during election cycles. And, yes, Intuit is on the front line of innovation and change that shifts with the market. But, wouldn't it be more productive to maintain a stable core of people in the development, production, and customer care that are on"
good,The job was satisfactory. I chose my own hours of work. But the salaries was not enough. There is no job security because the work was seasonal. Management was good and understanding.
good,"I loved the company, the campus, the perks (gym, cafe) but I was an unfortunate victim of being partnered with a coworker who created a hostile wok environment from day 1. It did not matter that I did what was expected of me and more, she was ambiguous and nasty in her communications and it led to my departure. I’ve heard this from others: it all depends on your team at Intuit."
good,"Data Entry.  Processed incoming order for Turbo Tax.  Seasonal job and I really wish I could have continued working there.  VERY Security conscious, my first experience with that.  I only worked a seasonal position, way too short to have more data.  My first data entry position.  Everything was new to me, but I really enjoyed it.  I was able to work at a couple of different positions.  Hardest part of the job was leaving when time was up.  Great people to work for and with."
good,Intuit is a well run company and provides a performance based culture where you are provided opportunities to own and improve your work product or output.  The seamingly constant reorganizations can be disruptive to teams and department silos also tend to create duplicate efforts.
good,I have been a contractor in many places. Intuit is my favorite thus far. There are amenities and opportunities for everyone all around campus. The technology and progressive culture are a great draw for Intuit.
good,"This was a wonderful place  to work if management were on one accord.I love the team members, and the work, I always hit my goal even went to Cancun, Mexico."
good,"Overall - a great company with an inspirational CEO."
good,"Intuit is a good company, and healthy financially.  Not much room for advancement, or growth.  Very limited opportunites.  The culture overall is good."
good,I enjoyed working for Intuit but the commute was killing me.  I'd have to leave my house at 5am to be there by 8 and wouldn't get home until after 8pm
good,"flexible work hours"
good,"The culture at Intuit and the pay is ok.  If you are flexible about the hours you're available to work then it can be a great fit as a way to supplement a private practice or retirement income. However, if you are looking for a long term job opportunity with career advancement potential, consider yourself warned. There is very little potential of advancement in the Tax Support division for remote employee's and virtually no chance of full time employment. Also their pay structure makes little sense so be prepared for pay disparities for equal work."
good,I was only a temp but they made me feel like a ft employee. the managers and supervisors gave me training and education that has help my advancement in my current field and cannot be replaced
good,"It's a tax software company, so it's a pretty seasonal position. The people and managers I worked with were great and I still have friends from there."
good,Intuit is a fun place to work. It is modern work place that encourages innovation. I would recommend Intuit for everyone that loves a work life balance.
good,This was a good place to work because of the work life balance.  There is a gym on site and a beautiful walking path.  There is a competitive atmosphere and people are often stressed as a result.
good,Great Company stressful customers i loved this job after tax season gets very hectic and most customers arent computer savvy leads to frustration on program
good,"Intuit has a good work-life balance for its employees and has a warm working atmosphere with good perks for fitness and healthy lunches. Management is good for most part except for the fact that they have lot of reorganizations happening now and then.Because of the changes that keep taking place, it sometimes gets hard to adjust to the transitions."
good,"-Compliance auditor, data scrubbing and escalating defaulters found guilty on the grounds of Compliance/ethics was done on daily basis post as a quality analyst"
good,"It's a great place to work, however the call center environment at Intuit is very busy, very fast-paced, very detailed and very demanding. From the moment you log on, you will be answering calls until the end of your shift or beyond depending on the call. The opportunity to advance is hard to come by because many people don't leave once they are in a position that they like."
good,"Intuit has a good culture of employee care and great products for the customers. Overall a good place to work."
good,"Intuit has a great facility and very good benefits. There's game tables on each floor and a good gym and a good cafeteria. Ample parking is to be had, too."
good,"Intuit was a wonderful place to work. Everyone was very supportive and encouraging. Management always pushed everyone to do their best to give employees their best shot advancing."
good,"Intuit was a great place to work. They were very encouraging when it came to getting their employees to the next steps in their career."
good,Call center location with multiple business units allows flexibility to move around and work on different projects. Good work life balance and benefits.
good,"In my current role, I support 6 Engineers and 23 Sales Consultants in addition to providing guidance, feedback and innovation to peer leaders and executives.

good,"Culture is amazing within work team and the office as a whole."
good,"I enjoyed what Inuit offered me and training and skill sets. Great work staff. Management was on top of many different aspects of their business and clients needs."
good,Good company to work for if you need to make a lot of money in a short time. Great job culture. Everyone was up beat and they made sure that you were well taken care of. The only thing that i didn't like was there is no job security. Once tax season was over we were all laid off.
good,Working at Intuit for Concentrix was a challenge. I was working 60+ hours a week without stop. The culture of people was quality but the management left a lot to be desired.
good,"productive and fun work place , great employee management , and engagement , we care and give back engagement , great managers , awesome colleagues"
good,"For a large financial services company, Intuit is very innovative with its products and company culture. Its a great place to work and build a career. Management is transparent and easy to get along with."
good,Interactive flexible place to work. Worked well in a team environment. Learn much more than I expected
good,"This company has its own gym, and cafeteria. There is a full kitchen on all floors with some kind of game in each and 2 tv's with chairs and couches. The serve fresh fruit every Tue. morning (free) and they are alway having appreciation parties. My management was very understanding and were always willing to listen. I really enjoyed working here and would have loved to stay but due to the economy they are just not able to hire permanent employees just yet. My year here is up so I must move on."
good,"Lot of perks and good salary"
good,"Awesome Work Environment!!"
good,"Employees consistently rank Intuit among the best of the best in a very competitive marketplace. Together, Intuit and it's employees are creating more than awesome products that improve our customers’ lives, they are creating an awesome work environment where our employees can do the best work of their lives."
good,"I have worked for this company since 2002"
good,"Leadership Values are emphasized at Intuit, even for non-management employees"
good,"Excellent employer, however job security and advancement are less than desirable. Major shifts and changes in company structure every few years means massive lay-offs and loss of vesting benefits though they may just hire you back under the new structure. Benefits are among the best most healthcare professionals have seen. Pay is average but excellent if your performance is in the top 10 % through variable compensation."
good,Can be more rewarding if Strategy is clear and followed through...
good,"Great people, very conservative culture.. great benefits...good engineering workplace"
good,"On a typical day, I provide timely tax advice on a variety of complex tax issues for individuals and businesses nationwide. I also resolve tax software technical issues for clients while providing excellent customer service. I have increased my federal and state tax knowledge, tax research skills and refined my customer service skills. My co-workers comprise of a great team ready to help out when needed and very supportive. Management is very supportive and knowledgeable about tax and technical software issues. The hardest part of the job is to completely satisfy every customer I come in contacts. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you are able to resolve a problem or issue for a client and the feeling of joy and satisfaction that comes from helping them."
good,Great benefits/compensation and work/life balance. The worst lower mangament of any company I have ever worked for.
good,While supporting your product you were expected to sell related products or upsell the existing product.
good,"We had 2 weeks training, then right into answering customer calls either by phone or chat. Kept busy during peak times."
good,"good corporate america job, little advancement opportunities"
good,I enjoyed working here! It was one of the best companies I've worked for. I genuinely enjoyed my work and wish they didn't do layoffs in the Denver office. Benefits are great!
good,"Although this job was only seasonal, it was a great place to work.  Fun and caring supervisors who want you to succeed.  Very fun atmosphere and work environment."
good,"My most enjoyable part of the day is when I'm able to assist a customer who when calls is initially frustrated, but at the end of the call feels empowered based on my patience and method of helping."
good,Extremely innovative and challenging workplace with excellent employee benefits. Support a lot of social causes and believe in giving back to the society.
good,"I enjoyed working for intuit.  Work life balance is generally good, and the work reasonably challenging.  The major drawback is that Intuit does periodically lay  people off as a way of reorganizing the workforce."
good,"Great company, can get a little stressful at time, however great company to work for. The hardest part of the job was when you had customers cursing at you, however; you have to learn to be mild tempter and self control."
good,"Exciting place to work, where the scenery is changing with the outside forces. Call  meter atmosphere with big planning happening behind the scenes. Integrity without compromise"
good,Company provided training sessions and huddles every week to advance employee knowledge and skills. Great place to work even if it's only a temporary position.
good,"Gained much experience during my tenure at Intuit and it is great place to work . I loved to work in Intuit, good environment, good atmosphere and good people"
good,"If you come to work each day prepared to give your best work efforts, then you will find this work opportunity fulfilling.  They have great training and supporting staff.  This is also an ideal location for me."
good,"I worked from home so it was pretty straight forward. All you had to do was keep up with the minimum hours required to work a week and you keep the job. Answering customer calls and solving their problems was simple also, all the tools you need are right in front of you."
good,Job is great overall however Management has been the biggest challenge at Intuit. I have had some level of management every year I have been an employee here.
good,Intuit is very fast paced. Inbound calls regarding the turbo tax product. Customers seem to be very patient and eager to learn about the Turbo Tax program.
good,"I was hired as a contractor and the pay is MUCH, MUCH less than what their permanent full time employees are making per hour, and contractors make no commissions. It also seemed like they primarily like to keep people as contractors too."
good,"Competitive but slow paced. Good work culture, Work life balance. A lot of slackers, due to lack of Management taking interest in fixing the problem. Hope it improves. Overall a good company."
good,"Great work environment. Support provided by management. Great team cohesion on projects. Culture is great. Most employees are happy. Intuit tends to layoff too often, though."
good,I enjoyed working for Intuit. They gave me great training and helped build my skills in order to move on to a higher position at the company I worked for.
good,"If you come in with no experience I wouldn't recommend this place for work, it isn't the training program but its the work that needs to be done that sometimes can be a bit pressing"
good,I worked remotely from home which was great. During tax season the work is intense and hours can be very long but it comes with this type of work. The bonuses were great although they have recently reduced them
good,"In my position as a content manager for Intuit I felt intuit genuinely cared about their employees. they constantly had round tables and meetings that got the ball rolling for not only changes for employee work and process, but also changes to the actual products we supported."
good,"Productive and fun place to work for"
good,Working from home @ Intuit was great. Training was paid and was provided with accurate information to complete job. Research is a major aspects to doing a great job and also best way to provide great service to customers.
good,"It was a great company that was fast paced and competitive. The hours were great and the pay was exceptional. Working as an independent contractor, there was a lot of flexibilty."
good,Inuit was probably the number one place to work. socials every friday was the best. Managers is cool. As long as you do your work you should be ok no worries.
good,Simple work. No previous experience really needed. Requires patience and must pay attention to  detail. Just as many other customer service jobs. Good luck.
good,itDuzzit was really ahead of its time with its platform and position in the api economy.   They were a fine example of the new scalability of companies that leverage other assets not owned by them.
good,Often making short term budget cuts to make quarterly financial goals for the shareholders.  employees worry about layoff at the end of each quarter.  High compensation and strong benefits
good,"When the leadership of your team/business unit is stable all is well. During a great upheaval of leadership across multiple business units at the same time too much went by the wayside. "
good,It was a great place to work and they allow employees chance to exercise their talent.Management were also great they tend to give you room to learn daily.
good,Intuit values the employee and provides great benefits.  Management as a whole is great but other lower management could use some coaching on how to motivate and appreciate employee/team.
good,"I enjoyed working for Intuit TurboTax. Money was correct, and the workplace was pretty cool. Team leaders were there to assist us when needed. Hours were descent."
good,"No problems, it was only a short financial exceptions clean-up project and it was fine. Would have liked to worked there longer but they weren't doing any direct hiring at this time."
good,"great company to work for, works well with your schedule. have great bonuses. managers are pretty cool and very understanding of situations that you may come across."
good,Great smart people and company culture. Intuit provides above average benefits. Certain groups are doing fairly well while others have OK type routine work.
good,Very busy during busy season but time passes very quickly and employees are recognized for hard work. Over time is always available during busy season.
good,"Pros"
good,"I loved working here. I did have a set work schedule and it was remote (from home). They team you have online were helpful and kind. If you ran into problems or had questions, they made time for you. They offered huge incentives and bonuses."

good,benefits and people mak ethe job such a good place to work as well as managements willingness to help you succeed at your goals
good,"Intuit is great work place and very good culture."
good,"Due to the nature of payroll, job was very intense at times.  Handling upset clients and problem solving were paramount."
good,Awesome company to work for. During the duration of working here the clients were always willing to work with employees to make working conditions better.
good,"One of the best work place for freshers."
good,Hard work and it pays good.  Must be in good shape to move peoples belongings. you will be working with a crew of 2 to 15 people depending on the job.
good,"Intuit is a place where you can learn a lot and do your best work."
good,"Intuit, one of the top 100 BEST COMPANIES TO WORK FOR"
good,"This was a seasonal position ONLY! We learned a lot in the short time we were there. Co-workers were nice, professional and hard working. We would answer incoming calls from customer, and CPA's that purchased the Lacerte, or Quick books software."
good,"Good work/life balance, compensation and opportunities to innovate. The challenge is the long cycles of execution and adoption of product ideas."
good,"ummm so i had this job once and talked to people about taxes woooow those were some fun conversations. 'hey person, you're basically an accountant. can you tell me what do to with my monies? and I'm all 'yeah dude!'"
good,Great Place to Work if you can handle restructure every year which could impact your job. Best employees to work with. Strong values and community outreach.
good,Intuit is a great place to work however the goals can be a little hard to meet because you had so many. I did like the people that I worked with my manager was good to me and would do anything she could to help you. The did end up letting a lot of people go and it was becoming more frequent so job security was scary.
good,Very team oriented and meeting are about 1/3 of the work day. A beautiful San DIego campus.
good,People are friendly and so much encouragement to learn new skills.
good,Intuit is one company whereby its words of taking care of its employees is very true.  Very collaboratively company whereby it tries to listen to the voice of their employees and do right by us.
good,"Great environment for developing a supportive relationship between employees.  The company has a strong sense of community and gives back to the community where they are located.  Many opportunities to develop a strong understanding of income tax law, product development, and communications."
good,"This is a great place to work, got to me on your toes and smart but you'll love the perks."
good,"Intuit is a great place to work! Employees delivered the best in them, willing to help each other when needed. It's about accomplishing goals and working closely as a team in getting the work done!"
good,"The job was fairly easy, Something I enjoyed doing, I got to learn so much about taxes and handling on call customer service skill."
good,"Intuit has a great culture. This is a company where you could state with conviction what makes the company great. ""It is the people that I work with"""
good,"Great management but tough place to move anywhere but lateral. Management is great, you are given tools to truly succeed. The main issue is the shifts of the call center. Open 8am to 9pm."
good,Good company. Leaned a lot. The commercial internet age was in it's infancy the tech world was very different then.
good,"Intuit believes in the advancement of all its employees as well as the company and stock price.  Lots of opportunity to grow your career in a friendly environment.  Struggling a little to adapt its culture to that of a growing, global company, but a lot of potential."
good,I have completed 3 years in Intuit and its very employee friendly company.There are so many opportunities to learn new technology. It provides a very innovative culture for employee.
good,"In my almost 5 years at Intuit, I've seen one thing that is consistent across all business units, all sites, and all leaders - employees are considered to the be the most valued asset of the company."
good,"Intuit is like many other American companies, it is not immune to outsourcing many services which would be best performed by my fellow citizenry.  So, the culture attracts and allows for the acceptance of every conceivable personality type, in order to attain, short-term contract employees who are intelligent, computer savvy, and not afraid to ""scavenge"" for work.  By that, I mean than the market for employees is way, over-inflated, and the ""crème of the crop"" end up not necessarily coming to the forefront and attention of management.  This is their corporate culture.  So far it has worked for them, but the overall morale, after time -- even though they ""woo us"" with free meals and a liberal and tolerant atmosphere -- does not lend itself to an atmosphere of job security or sense of self-worth.  I see the lack of security expressed through the mood of the permanent employees who are always working to maintain a virtually ""happy"" composure, while being constantly pressured to perform quickly and with zero-defect, and who obviously carry with them, the unspoken mantra of: ""Don't get too complacent, this too can end -- at any time, to anyone."""
good,I was a customer service representative in their credit card processing call center. I was trained on the software of Intuit's products. The management worked with me to succeed and I was a member of a large team. There was no hard part and I enjoyed solving for the customers problems.
good,"A great place to work"
good,"Very busy call center for quickbooks merchant services ."
good,"Intuit is a great company that has a great culture and great set of values. Projects are complex and challenging but most importantly always provide you with a lot learning opportunities. Because Intuit is always implementing new technologies and application, IT teams are always learning."
good,Days were always productive and fun when on break. Break room was big enough for everyone to use comfortably. The Kitchen shop was always fully stocked.
good,Enjoyed my time at Intuit. I was able to advance my career and skills while working at Intuit. I worked with a lot of team oriented and collaborative coworkers. Upper management assisted with my career goals and objectives.
good,"Fun place to work, some work from home options. "
good,"A typical day at work was fun! Always an opportunity to learn and experience something new. A work environment that's  relaxed,creative and self expressive."
good,"Very good place to work. good work life balance, Better advancement on learning new technologies and tools. Good place for career growth. Good team environment."
good,"Wonderful people to work with - like family. Excellent benefits. Pay is better than average for a sales based call center. Several starting times to choose from. The location I worked at had little advancement opportunities, however, plenty of advancement opportunities in other departments at other Intuit locations. I worked in the call center, the focus was to sell, cross sell, speed thru the call, which becomes boring and monotonous after awhile - like a broken record repeating the same thing over and over.  Frequent sales contests to help keep everyone motivated. Management is inconsistent on guide lines but overall approachable and easy to get along with."
good,I am a big fan of Intuit and the user-friendliness of their multiple products. I work remotely for TurboTax on a part-time seasonal basis and it is really great. If it was for the full year it would be perfect!
good,"A great collection of talent and leadership, with a bit of a log jam limiting growth opportunities. Effective operating mechanisms driving transparency and growth, as well as strong and ethical business practices."
good,I will give them a 10 for the first five yrs but the last three I would rate them a 6 but overall it was a great company to work for but I need a change
good,"Intuit promotes work life balance but in reality, it is usually not the case as the expectations are that you get the work complete at any costs.  "
good,"Great people, Nice work life balance, great benefits. I have switched companies one every 2 years primarily for growth and no vision to work towards. I have been here three years and every year there is something challenging to work on."
good,Great place to work and you can tell upon entering the building that people are really excited to be there and be part of the team. Beautiful facility with tons of perks.
good,It is a good company to work for. They should focus more or the product rather than marketing and sometimes it feels like they hire alot of contractors.
good,"I enjoyed the job but I need something with benefits. Flexible hours seasonal contracting job. Pay is exceptional, training is 4 weeks, a lot of information."
good,"Productive and Fun workplace. Opportunity to innovate with multiple Hackathons and Coding competitions throughout the year. On an average, good work life balance."
good,"good place for employment would not like to work there again."
good,"For the most part this is a good work environment. The pace can be chaotic at times as Intuit tries to move in multiple directions at once. Senior management is pretty solid with some weak links, pretty much the same as any large corporation. Middle management is the same way. Front line is really solid. Day to day perks are above average and atmosphere is pretty casual."
good,"From my first day I felt at ease as a consultant with Intuit. I was given a very easy first month to learn the various technologies used in my group and could freely shadow anyone I needed too in order to acquaint myself with the work they were doing."
good,"It's a great company with fantastic benefits. They really try to make you live Intuit, rather than it just being a place to work. The co-workers are supportive and friendly. Though, it is still a call center, so if that isn't something you're up for, then it may not be the place for you. There'a a lot of information when it comes to finances, payroll, taxes, and etc. that isn't fully covered in Training. You're labeled with a ""brand"", which is essentially the type of person that others deem you to be. That determines whether they think you're qualifies to advance into higher positions or not."
good,A great place to work. You work hard & get compensated for your hard work. Management didnt want to take irate merchant calls most of the time. Management wanted to take the least calls when Irate customers demanded a Manager.
good,Intuit is a relatively old company and very successful. The biggest challenges Intuit faces are overcoming it's own organizational inertia to adapt to a changing market. The benefits and compensation are above and beyond the average tech company.
good,"Nice place to work for  and supportive management they are employee orientated .Work culture is good best part is there no shifts"
good,"It is a great company to work for with a fun culture, good benefits, and rewards for hard work.  I enjoyed all of the interesting and engaging people that I worked with."
good,I enjoyed my time at Intuit.  Great benefits and management team.  I worked with a great group of peers and greatly enjoyed my time there.
good,"Intuit hires very intelligent people, who know how to work with each other to achieve their professional goals.  There is a myriad of backoffice applications to get involved with, which can add some challenges due the complex nature of getting those systems to work with each other.  Some departments allow people to work from home, which is both ""green"" and adds to life/work balance.  There are some challenges of working with programming resources in India due to time and work culture differences, but these are not insurmountable.  The Intuit facility in San Diego has many amenities for employees to enjoy (onsite gym, basketball courts, sand volleyball court, great cafeteria).  Some projects require long hours at times, but this is not uncommon when supporting backoffice systems projects."
good,"For 10 years every day has been different.  The company has been on a journey from a boxed software producer to the creator of a cloud-based ecosystem of solutions for small businesses and tax payers.  "
good,"Amazing people, awesome work environment, great money, but they are shutting down the site to outsource sales.  With any large company you have to worry about job security.  In this case it was cheaper to get rid of us all."
good,"Intuit is a strong company with an outstanding culture. Pay is good, benefits are fantastic, and the company is in good health with high profit margins. However, unless you work in CA, or NV, you're job is in question every summer between June and August with reorganizations."
good,"I loved working for Intuit. The compensated us very and the annual bonuses were great.  I miss working for a high-tech company.  Mgmt was great!  The culture was definitely work, life, balance."
good,"lovely job. great pay, the phone calls are a bit stressful but overall I enjoyed working there."
good,"As far as Pro-Advisor tech support..... the job is horrible. the company is great. the leaders are new and dont know the product. lots of ""meetings about meetings"" and such. other departments have an awesome atmosphere, but the pro advisor dept is trying too hard to be something its not and its ruining the department. im trying to find a new job just because of all the changes."
good,"intuit has lot of great products. while their adoption to change is slow, they focus heavily on their employee. ( it doesn't fit the rest of bay area culture, but employee can really nourish both their work and personal life)."
good,"Friendly co-workers"
good,"There is no 'typical' day at Intuit NOC due to the nature of production environments. With over 800 applications to support, days are spent triaging outages, addressing monitoring alarms, and performing configuration changes as part of maintenance events. Managing the workload can be a challenge at times, and the team does a great job of sharing and collaborating to expedite resolution."
good,Working with various people in various departments was a huge accomplishment. Being able to multi-task to get projects done and getting recognized was a positive experience.
good,A typical day at work included answering incoming calls regarding processing errors or account inquires. During my time there I was able to strengthen my people and problem resolutions skills. i was also invited to lead the beta email support team along with learning facilitation and class development.
good,"Great place to work. If you are willing to bring the best version of yourself to work every day, have an open mind and work hard, there is room for advancement. They do a great job with internal training on an ongoing basis"
good,"I work seasonal and remote so I don't get all the benefits of a regular employee. "
good,"-Work life balance,"
good,"I've worked as a Remote Tax Support Rep seasonally the past couple years, will likely join the season next year. You will be busy during the season, but they make up for it with the pay, bonus, and other perks. You will have lots of support to do your job. If you feel like you don't, just let them know, and they will make sure you get help. Some team leads and managers are much more easy-going and understanding than others, but they are pretty flexible overall."
good,It was fun working in Intuit. Good work culture and friendly environment. Balanced work life and no stressful behavior. I'm enjoying working here and mainly with my current team which is awesome
good,really good training lots of room for advancement. You do not have to be there long at all to get promoted. You use to be able to bonus but that is not the case anymore.
good,"I spend 8 hours on the phone with customers who call in for support. It's a shame that our call center can't handle the volume of the calls.It's a great place to work, if you are able to work in a call center."
good,Great company to work for.  The best benefits I've ever seen and the most amazing people you will ever meet. Voted Best Place to Work in multiple locations over the years.
good,"The CEO was very outgoing and the lines of communication open. My manager was very laid back, courteous, but gave us goals to accomplish."
good,En typisk dag börjar med ett check-in möte med mitt team. Sedan lite individuellt jobb vid datorn. Möte med en ny intern kund. Lunch i Intuit's kafeteria. äter antingen tillsammans med kollegor ute på pation eller tar med maten tillbaka till min kub. Mer individuellt arbete på eftermiddagen. Många deadlines att möta. Planerar själv min arbetsbörda. Lämnar kontoret vid 16:30. Kollar email hemma på kvuallen. Om något är brådskande så tar jag hand om det med en gång annars kan det vänta till följande dag. Normalt arbetstempo för det mesta. Stora event ca 4-5 gånger per år då det blir mycket arbete helgar och kvällar. Bra lön och förmåner.
good,"Worked for director of accounting software design. Wonderful place to work, acknowledged, respected, and compensated. Best job ever"
good,"Even though Intuit sold closed and sold off my division, I have nothing but fond memories of working and succeeding there.  The management was always looking for ways to change and grow as a company and I always felt like I was a part of something."
good,It was what was excepted. There was no work life balance. It was all about doing the job and no care for family. It was ok though because I was young and exactly what I needed.
good,"Work life is good, bonuses and 401K are okay.  direct supervisors are pretty good, and working from home is really nice. day  to day jobs are rewarding.   Allow you to speak with clients and interact with customer on a day to day basis."
good,"Intuit values employees and you see that in day-to-day actions. Company that pays well and offers fantastic ""total rewards"" including fitness reimbursement, discounted healthy lunches, and generous bonus packages."
good,"Intuit wants to be a small startup, but it is a growing company. There are lots of perks, the benefits are the best I've seen and they really want  you to feel like you have good control over work/life balance. The company encourages innovation and provides many ways for management to recognize employees in meaningful ways. "
good,"Intuit is the place to learn new technologies , we get lot of trainings to up-skill ourselves, managers are very cooperative. Work culture is awesome."
good,Work at home.  Great leadership and support contact.  Training and tons of resource information available.  Have schedule options - part time or full time.  Lots of overtime available.

good,"call call call and call some more. Great training, "
good,Intuit has a knack for choosing employees with outstanding values and work ethic. Benefits are amazing and free learning tools provided are great for personal and professional growth.
good,"Overall, it is a great place to work. Managers have KPIs to keep their team happy and engaged."
good,Very good company to work for. The hardest part of the job was trying to log off the phones for breaks. Management was very friendly and focused on improving performance without micromanaging. The most enjoyable part of the job was the free food provided by the company from very reputable clean restaurants.
good,we are so lucky to work on that place cuz management was very good with employee and no work pressure we used to have very fun with colleagues and good with my Team lead
good,No comments. Very good culture. Very good people to work with.
good,"As a employee at Intuit was the place to be great place great or I would definitely say that you look forward into coming to work everyday.  The only setback was that I was hired for seasonal work TAX SEASON ONLY so really was no opportunity for advancement in the company.  I troubleshoot Turbo Tax Software on the phone for the customer or online, tech support."
good,"very flexible hours to work,great team,lots of support.I got to learn a lot about taxes, differences of taxes in different provinces, very user friendly software."
good,"great job, good environment , amazing culture. Happy people. Fun days at work ! a lot of great benefits . healthy activities. supportive work activites"
good,"Answer 5 cues"
good,"Productive and fun workplace , however too many changes by managers coming and going with new ideas that dont work.No consistency of messaging,power struggle from the inside."
good,"the pay is ok. you work from home, so that a very great thing, you are surrounding by your dog or cat while working. no need to go outside. not enough hours so you need to be quick picking your hours"
good,"Answered incomming calls, analized questions, advised of possible solutions, researched knowledge base articles, resolved more than 80 percent of all issues consistently."
good,Intuit is a great place to work. The company really cares about its employees. Its also a good place to work along with some amazing engineers. I would recommend Intuit as a great option.
good,"""I’ve had a lot of great jobs over the years … None have compared to my years at Arise, simply because of the amazing people I get to work with every single day; they make it the best job I’ve ever had.”"

good,"Intuit is a great company to work for. They reward and motivate their employees and have great tools.  I worked from home during tax season. They provided the laptop and headphone and software, basically everything I need.  The best part about this job are the other tax experts that are available 24/7 to answer any questions.  Very smart group of people.  I learned a ton."
good,A great business to work for ! They genuinely care about their folks and there is so many perks for working for intuit. I loved this place. Great company!
good,"The company has the critical functions measured and that is what determines your overall success. It is laid out for every employee so you know how to meet the goals to provide the best in client support, but also to do your best to be asked back. This to me is the most important part of remote work, have guidelines and the correct training along with management to exceed expectations."
good,I recommend starting your career at Intuit. Great place to grow quickly. Great opportunities to work with small business customers. Challenging and rewarding!
good,Nothing special. During peak season they dont offer good incintives. They may make it look and sound good but really its nothing compared to other companies ive been at. The training really isnt helpful. They throw you to the wolves and you learn as you go.
good,Had a chance to apply most of my theoretical knowledge to practical cases. Management is very flexible. Good benefit provided. I would be happy to work all year
good,"Leadership is great and always on task for what is coming next.  My managers have always been understanding and caring and as accommodating as possible for DR appointments, etc.  I have always strived to do my best and emulate them as well;  great people."
good,enjoyed working there. really enjoyed the culture and people. great location. great people to work with. i really liked the people a lot. and the gym. that was the best part.
good,Intuit provides a well developed training program for new and experienced tax advisors. The managers are very supportive and their goal is to assist their team members quickly and efficiently.
good,"There is no such thing as a typical day. Spend your whole shift answering calls and helping solve the technical and tax problems that tax professionals have. No two calls are the same, and no two problems are the same. Learn a lot about how systems work and also learn a lot about taxes."
good,amazing place great leadership and leadership culture would work there again in a heartbeat amazing facilities and amenities lots of opportunities to grow
good,I do not really  have much to say about this. Good place. Good and healthy environment. Great culture. Friendly environment. Good gym. Good people. Good food.
good,"Hard to get promoted, great place to start a career. They pretty much hire anyone who's tech savvy. Looks great on my resume too! Don't expect to ge promoted without a BA or at least some certs."
good,great company.sometimes need to travel to CA. The Oracle DBA team has high expectation and requirement on both Oracle RAC and Golden Gate with two way replication.
good,"-Typical day:  Spend day on computer working work tickets"
good,"Produced daily bill runs, payment runs, remedied tax/gateway errors, provided monthly/quarterly and fiscal year trend analysis."
good,"Good company to work for. Worked as a seasonal tax support agent. Breaks are sufficient, pay and bonus are good. Training was thorough however, the team are very large so it is difficult to get help from the team lead. You need to be good at researching the information you need."
good,Intuit is by far the best company I have ever worked for! They treat there employees as if they have value. With there various community programs and every building company. I personally would recommend anyone to work for Intuit if ever the opportunity presents itself.
good,"Here on a contract position and was originally only supposed to be here for eight days, but kept getting extended. Training was great and supervisors were very friendly and helpful."
good,"Typically, I would come on Saturdays since it was a volunteer position at a temple. On Saturday morning at 9am is when I usually go and I sit in front of the computer and talk to customers either in person or on the phone and answer their questions. If a customer wants to purchase something I take the purchase using QuickBooks. The management style is laid back, the hardest part is probably managing the crowd when it gets bigger during the peak times."
good,"If you want to work from home and have great computer and customer service skills, then this is the position for you. Work as many hours as you want, or, not."
good,The management sets lofty goals but provides the environment and incentives to attain those goals.  The people are great without exception.  I was always treated fairly and with respect.
good,Absolutely love working here. Intuit allowed me to synthesize my skills and knowledge and apply that to accomplishing strong work goals. Only problem is the job is temporary (4 months) out of the year for the tax season.
good,"The company really cares about their employees, the customers love the products, the Tucson site has a great facility. Overall the managers are supportive and encouraging. The pay is great. All the roles are competitive, and you learn alot. I enjoy the fact that you can never stop learning here."
good,"One of the Great place to work, good culture and supporting managers, good place to learn new stuff. Over all good. Free food and cab, lots of tranning to opt for."
good,I have stayed in Intuit for almost 10 years because of the flexible work environment that encourages me to be dad to my children and at the same time function high performing workforce environment  .
good,"A company that truly cares about their employees, their customers and their products. Innovative and relevant. Small business will never be the same."
good,"The work culture is great. People are smart, passionate and innovative. The environment fosters growth and development with great benefits. Lots of growth opportunities"
good,"fun job, very fast paced, and a awesome learning experience for taxes. Kept me sharp and on my toes with a great staff that was awesome when it came to assisting."
good,"This company, is hands down one of the best out there. They really care about their employees. I basically just answered calls and helped people out with their Quickbooks, but it was relatively easy and paid very well."
good,Great work environment. Great co workers. Great place to work. Great learning experience. Great company to work for. Great company values.
good,"This company was going through some changes in the management department, at this time so I will be fair and say that they were weeding out the bad seeds but my review is not a pleasant review. "
good,"A customer focused and articulate individual who possesses a friendly and personable approach along with strong time management skills and the ability to listen carefully to client requirements. I have a real thirst to succeed and boasts a demonstrated track record of initiative, creativity and motivation. I have the entrepreneurial spirit required to work in highly flexible, rapidly changing, ambiguous work environments. Having insatiable energy to produce results and being able to quickly build outstanding customer relationships, I would be a valuable addition to any ambitious company. Right now I wants to join a rapidly growing dynamic company that has plans for ambitious growth"
good,"Manage all high severity incidents, recommend new solutions for monitoring and ensure all processes are updated for triage for the NOC."
good,"Experience in JIRA to capture,capture organize and prioritize issues "
good,"Excellent colleagues! Great personal growth, and an awesome compensation package."
good,It was the best place to work. The staff were some of the best people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. It was fun and did not mind getting up to go to work everyday.
good,Very technical aspects which I learned from this company and team one of the best software development company in San Diego
good,They cared how much you care about your job. They made work fun.
good,I loved working for this company they had great benefits and took care of their employees.
good,"Fun environment."
good,"A typical day involved taking inbound phone calls or Livechat requests from customers who are enrolled in the Intuit Online Payroll service."
good,Really laid back company which puts employees first. I had an awesome time with the team and they helped me to learn a lot of cool stuff related to Scrum Project Management. I got to work on tools such as JIRA and Rally.
good,"I worked in the call center, we were extremely busy 90% of the time.  When we had down time there were plenty of projects to work on with coaching other agents and learning new changes to the products.  The most difficult part of the job is always changing features of products that are updated often.  The most enjoyable part is definitely the culture of Intuit, the people, the benefits, and the experience."
good,"The people you work with everyday makes this job so much easier, because the customers can drive you crazy even if you're a zen master with patience."
good,"It was a very fun environment. When I worked at Intuit, they were located in Calabasas and then moved to Woodland Hills. The company was down sizing so I left before I could be one of them to be let go."
good,Excellent people with a great customer centered focus. Responsive management and great co-workers.
good,Intuit is the best for its products and services. Absolutely the VERY BEST in customer satisfaction. Love this Company!
good,Nice team with good management. Used to work as an onsite team leader
good,I like this company but no room for growth. Eliminated my dept.
good,The Company has a great niche in the software market. The people were friendly and really knew their job. The benefits were excellent.
good,My time with Intuit was great. The only reason I am leaving is because our jobs were fazed out to a 3rd party vendor. A typical day at work consisted of reviewing account where funds are held by our team for review. The customer feedback we received either by phone or electronically regarding our processes took a special psychology to digest.
good,Intuit est une entreprise américaine qui est venu s'installer en France afin de partager leur logiciel de gestion comptable nommé QuickBooks. Ce logiciel a pour but de faciliter les experts comptables afin qu'ils puissent voir en temps et en heures le cours des dépenses et des recettes des clients ainsi que les mouvements de la banque.Je pense que ce logiciel permettra l’évolution du travail  de l'expert comptable et le faite d'avoir eu l'opportunité de le découvrir pourrait m'être avantageux.
good,"This was a great position which helped me focus on customer service. The management was fantastic. My supervisor was very helpful and full of great ideas. My coworkers were personable and easy to talk to. The hardest part of this job were the angry customers upset because of system errors or identity theft."
good,learned that you need to improve yourself to get somewhere in life and workplace
good,I enjoyed working for Intuit and would recommend this company to any tax professional or programmer.
good,"Intuit was a great work environment and my coworkers were wonderful, I still keep in touch with several of them today. It was a challenge mentally to determine what was wrong and be able to fix an issue solely over the phone. It was a lot of fun and I miss that mental challenge a great deal. I learned about the software, known issues and fixes and how to navigate the data base to resolve a lot of the questions. I was one the phone for my full shift answering technically related questions regarding the payroll software and fixing any mistakes done by their payroll department. My least favorite part of the job was probably the restrictiveness involved in being tied to a headset. I took on extra tasks to elevate some of that and in the process helped head up the creation of an incentive program that was eventually used over three of our companies. Unfortunately our company went through a series of lay offs over 4 years but I was able to stay till they closed our area completely on the 4th year."
good,"I love this company. While I had my differences with my direct supervisor, this company is a true model. I've worked there several times and I'd be honored to work there again."
good,I loved working there but its hard to get a permanent spot. Company fires and ends contracts whenever they want. Little room for advancement or progress. Less commision
good,"The position requires that the candidate be either an Enrolled Agent, CPA or Attorney. As an attorney, I felt unqualified to field so many customer calls regarding software issues and front end tax prep and I was highly stressed before every call. My experience and expertise is practicing law and dealing directly with the IRS on behalf of clients. I think enrolled agents and CPA's are generally more in their comfort zone. Candidate must really be dedicated to learning the software platform. I was truly miserable but only because the position a bad fit. It was a disappointment because Intuit is a great company."
good,Excellent place to work. Home based and very convenient. The pay is good for the type of work and they give us bonuses when you work extra. I have worked there for several years and I really enjoy it.
good,"Great place to work, too bad all they do is 6mth contracts. Companies now do this so that they don't have to spend on benefits, etc. But all in all a great place to work."
good,"Planning, Managing, performing installs and break-fit for Compute, Network and Storage operations in the Data Center. Performing installs and decommissions. Managing inventory of equipment and FRUs. Communicating with internal/external customers and vendors."
good,I loved working there. The first tax season I worked there it was great the manger was great. She was nice treated you with respect. The second tax season the new mangers were terrible. They treated everyone like they were stupid and if you weren't one of their favorites well it sucked for you. They had all these rules that intuit themselves don't have and it made the work environment horrible. The leads that the mangers hired had either no experience with TurboTax or no experience being supervisors. I love the program but if intuit keeps it ran by those two it's going to fail.
good,all in all this was a good place to work just not long enough.  It was a seasonal job. Great co-workers had a lot of fun with the team i would with
good,"Good team to work with. enjoy the time at work, good quality work."
good,Worked in call center for one season only. Not much interaction with anyone other than 30 minutes lunch.
good,"I liked working at Intuit, not as stressful as other jobs i have held. But i did not get hired on after working contract, so that was disappointing.  The values the company holds are good to see."
good,"Intuit is fairly relaxed cozy atmosphere. Diverse, fun, and fulfillful. That is about all I have to say right now. Maybe later I'll add more words. Bye"
good,Tremendous place to start and further a career.  Strong focus on learning and growing (a bit dependent on the business unit one works in).  Good values and solid moral compass in my experience.
good,"The company, values, mission, benefits, etc. are all wonderful.  It's a great place to work and contribute to your community and environment.  The IT dept on the other hand, due to the business requirements of IT, was difficult to embrace the values and benefits that other depts enjoyed.  "
good,"irrelevant its subcontracted out"
good,"I loved working for Intuit so much, that I went to work for them a second time and I'd likely go back a third time, position fitting. The products stand for themselves and the company empowers their employees to care for the client in the best manner they see fit."
good,"Intuit was consistent in respect to the fact that you always had a place to work and you were treated rather fairly.  Seems though, that when a decision was made to move people around, it had a major negative impact at times on the workplace environment"
good,"Its been going good experience working  as contractor. Like management, company environment is friendly. would love to work here as full timer if they have any full time job opportunity."
good,The company had a culture that was more company family oriented.  It felt as if you were working with your closest friends.  Leadership was always there and were all very supportive.
good,"They offer a lot of resources in order to do your job effectively and are understanding of life circumstances. They have a nice cafeteria on site as well as fun things to attempt to reduce the stress from out busy tax season. The hardest part of the job can be working extended hours and 6 to 7 days a week during tax season- It can make a work life balance very difficult, but that is only during tax season. They offer inspiration and help you create goals to make you the best you can be while employed here."
good,"I enjoyed the culture of the company. The feeling of being appreciated and comfortable was a new experience for me. "
good,This was the most intense position I have ever had.  I learned how to do payroll in a short 6 week course.  The only thing I would change is the job security.  They hire over 200 people as a temporary employees and keep maybe 20 when the busy season is over.  If I would have been a direct hire I would still be working with them.
good,"Daily requirements were to answer customer inquiries, via telephone, email and chat, regarding the use of QuickBooks Online and Intuit Online Payroll program. "
good,"Company has a great culture, encourages employee events. Great for starting a career in the Healthcare Information Technology field."
good,Answered inbound calls from customers regarding their payroll services
good,Intuit has strategically implemented practices to help provide a more work life balance. This helps build morale and increase productivity among employees.
good,"Intuit is a GREAT company to work for. Depending on which part of the organization you are in, you might have opportunity to contribute based on your skills and experience. Middle management sometimes lacks experience and clarity to recognize great talent; sometimes there are so focused on their own agenda, that development of their staff is not a priority. You will do good as long as your immediate managers likes you. If not, might as well look for another job"
good,"I loved working for and with Intuit. "
good,This company is amazing! They truly take care of their employees.  The employee benefits are extremely competitive and there are opportunities to advance within the company.  Highly recommend working here.
good,"Intuit is a good place to work, but you really need to be a certain type of person to fit in.  You won't get a warm welcome, people either stay within their clicks or they are loners. I have never really seen anything like it."
good,"Great company to work for, with the latest software and technology available. Very flexible in scheduling work hours according to your family life including working from home."
good,"A seasonal position that allows me to work remotely, which is one of the major benefits of this job."
good,"Love the work from home option and the pay is very competitive.  I am still getting the hang of things and I'm almost 3 months into it.  The leads are very helpful and really want you to succeed.  I wish we had more management feedback as to how we are doing. Also, some processes are brand new that the training is pretty inefficient.  You are left to find a lot of things oit on your own."
good,"Intuit had the best people and was a great place to work in terms of stability.  Where it failed was that there was a manager that I did not work well under, and it unfortunately led to my looking for opportunities elsewhere.  Intuit has great amenities and great perks in terms of insurance and benefits."
good,"love it here great company to work for, everyone is friendly and they do what they can to make the job the set it can be. recommend more nap areas as there are only 2 now that are used for breast feeding"
good,I had a memorable work with Intuit since I gained a lot of knowledge when it comes to planning tasks. the culture was very friendly and our clients are very much involved when it comes to planning/hiring customer service agents.
good,"Intuit is an awesome company. Even as a seasonal worker we are included in all corporate events / meetings etc.  However, we cannot participate in Share purchases or receive any benefits or pension/rrsps."
good,"This company is an amazing place to work. Though the KPI's are hard to hit at times, the peole that you work with become family. The skills and abilities that you learn here set you up amazingly to grow with in or outside of the company."
good,I wish this job was more than seasonal. I enjoyed my time working here. The management team was fantastic. I have been an Intuit customer for years and I am even more impressed after working for them. I hope I get invited back next season.
good,"Still Employed by Intuit and looking for opportunities elsewhere due to limitations imposed upon my business group. I love the company, it's philosophy, and it truly takes care of its employees."
good,Overall great company to work for was hired immediately.  Great incentives to work for. Unfortunately no job security.
good,"Great life and work balance.mm,Great training a wonderful experience into the inner operations of the tax enviornment."
good,"Took inbound phone calls from Intuit clientele when they needed technical support with one of the Intuit programs. (i.e., QuickBooks, Quicken, Turbo Tax)"
good,"Although I felt advancement was difficult to obtain, I enjoyed my work here and always felt I was a productive wanted member of a team."
good,Intuit has one of the best work life balance. I work as an iPhone developer for mint.com and i totally love the team.
good,I used to love to get up every day and go to work. I was never late and I sold a lot of stuff. I got to work in Piracy and loved that job. If they ever called me to work for them again I would jump all over that! #stillahugefanofintuitlife
good,"Great place to work "
good,"Regular risk base review of merchant accounts setup for payment processing and invoices for small -medium sized business.  Analyze and validate business and personal information and ensure it meets both our compliance and internal policies, adhering to regulatory guidelines.  Updates reviewed in timely manner and decision made on supporting documentation.  Any accounts out of compliance are either escalated or closed based by us. "
good,"Great job, but its seasonal. You really see that there is a level of care to feed you but there’s no care as to their customer. The level of responsibility isn’t there for their employees"
good,"Productive"
good,Offering Tax Advice taking calls remotely is a great way for CPAs in private practice to fill in their down times and learn hands-on the hot topics for taxpayers.
good,I became an Intuit employee in 2010 and my life changed. They really do believe in a culture of customer success and attempt to achieve that by remaining agile and quick to accept change.
good,"Intuit is a great company with a great CEO. I loved the culture there and enjoyed working there for many years. Intuit is always looking to evolve and improve their product. If you are not comfortable with change, I would not recommend working for Intuit."
good,"Intuit is a generous company with smart people who are generally easy to work with. They're pursuing some of the latest technologies to keep on the cutting edge. The CEO is terrific. Corporate culture is great. There's an excellent work/life balance. The company offers great benefits, charitable work opportunities, snacks, celebrations, is design-centric, customer focused, and is interested in innovation. Bottom line, if you can get a job there, go for it."
good,Seasonal position.  Great pay and in a laid back atmosphere.  Managers are extremely helpful and understanding.  It is a call center which can be stressful at times.  Overall - great place to work.
good,Enjoyed my time working there. Would still be there if my position had not been eliminated. Great people and great place to work! Found my passion for QA while working here.
good,Great place  to build call center skills. Staff and management  were friendly and helpful.  Also has paid training  and  go break times. They want you to advance within the company.
good,"I loved working here and if there was a salary available, I would choose Intuit for my corporate and career advancement. It's worth it, there are not many companies that are like this one. Even the corporate politics and gossip are respectful and bearable. You are totally responsible for your success and what you do here."
good,I LOVED WORKING THERE! from the people to the environment.  Best place to work hands down. I loved helping clients with their taxes and also being able to give feedback to the company regarding procedures and them implementing my feedback. I would recommend you work there if given the opportunity!
good,I worked here for a period of 3 months during the 2016 tax season. I received ample training for the tasks I was to perform and ample support with which to accomplish these tasks.
good,"Loved my internship with Intuit, likely to return for another internship. Great culture, amazing work-life balance, fun social events and big focus on delighting customers and improving the world."
good,I built many successful working relationships with both internal and external customers! Working at Intuit helped me grow my passion for solving customer problems.
good,I loved working there.  It was a temp position and I was so disappointed when my groups assignment ended. The work place was fun and innovated. The employees were relaxed and helpful. The leadership was great.
good,"Intuit has amazing work culture, not busy as such but get messy during tax season."
good,"A typical day would include answering phone calls, interacting with customers and a lot of troubleshooting requiring intimate knowledge of the product. Very laid back but stressful at times during the busy season."
good,"I really enjoyed working there, It was a place that I liked to go to on a daily basis. I liked working with all of the employers that I was in contact with on a regular basis."
good,"Technology Company with great growth prospects"
good,"Great company, good vision. USA based, so there were lots of cutbacks in Edmonton due to economy. "
good,"Flexible timings,good engineers in team, excellent health benefits, good bonus and good people!"
good,Good company to work for. Had very good benefits and was able to have the perfect work schedule Very comfortable working area
good,Company has a good balance between Work like and Family life.  Company has numerous social events to help keep employees engaged
good,"Creates an environment where the world’s top talent can do the best work of their lives"
good,Intuit is very entrepreneurial and offers a flexible work schedule (for consultants).
good,Intuit is a great place to work.  They care about their employees and in my experience provide opportunities for mobility
good,We get a chance to work on all the phases of project along with customer interaction.
good,One of the best company to work for. Provide opportunity to learn and explore new things on every day basis. Highly motivated and focus employees.
good,I loved working for this company. I wish it was not a seasonal position or I would still be working here!
good,"A typical day involves fielding calls from professional tax preparers in regards to the operation, calculation, performance, and availability of forms and features for tax preparation software. I field between 30 and 40 phone calls a day depending upon need, ranging from fielding questions concerning input in the software to examining the intricacies of preparing tax forms for federal and state/city income tax returns. Management monitors metrics concerning employee productivity with this information being available to me by the next day, but their coaching focuses primarily on Voice of Customer surveys that our organization utilizes to determine our Net Promotor Score. The hardest part of the job is regulating customer expectations when faced with bad news. The best part of the job is being able to help a great group of customers who are passionate about their work and appreciative of our efforts to help them."
good,I loved working at Intuit. I felt like the company care about me as an employee. I was taken care of. Anything that was asked for we got it...even though there wasn't much to ask for. I gave 1 star for job security because the only time that I have had the opportunity to work there was for temporary placement. It has been difficult for me to be hired as a permanent employee. I would definitely work there again no matter what the position is! Minus one star for having no benefits as well.
good,"I am responsible for coordinating with close to ~250 on ground people over phone, maintain relationship with the Intuit business partners, to accomplish/complete the ask within the time frame as per the Intuit’s requirement. Ensuring that the business partners, sends the correct data at the right time to the Intuit system and analyzing and evaluating the business partners report on daily and weekly basis. Investigating the customer issues and offering them the best solution and remain aware, should proactively identify and resolve any operational issues within a time frame and coordinating and building good relationship with all the Intuit folks. I.e, Product team, customer acquisition team, Sales team, Customer service team & Operations team and assisting the operations lead in driving the overall operations. Should perform additional functions as directed or assumed on personal initiative."
good,- Full of smart people who work efficiently because most have responsibilities outside of work.
good,"Intuit has been the best place I have worked at so far. They pretty much have all the benefits that you can think of! To share one, I was able to take a whole year off - PAID - to bond with my newborn child. And this is only with 2 years of being an active employee. Intuit TAKES CARE of their employees."
good,Intuit is a fun place to work.. it had really good employee benefits.Work-life balance was good. Some people in the management were not competent. Rest everything was good
good,"Management and work culture really amuses me to go to work everyday......."
good,Positions vary greatly but in the Accounting department it was fun.  You pretty much need to be self-directed to thrive there.  Atmosphere can be varied as layoffs are a part of life there.
good,"I would love to stay working here."
good,"Intuit is among the greatest companies in the world to work for and I had the experience of a lifetime during my eight years there.  I advanced rapidly with hard work and a positive, professional attitude. Pay grows as you work your way up but the benefits are the best I've had at any company.  If there was a site in Las Vegas I'd start at any position to get my foot back in the door.  Unfortunately I had to relocate to LV and there were no opportunities in the area for Intuit."
good,"I've worked for them as senior tax expert since January 2018. It's a nice place to work and oddly enough even though I work remote I feel more connected to my team than I did when I worked in a traditional office environment. "
good,Working at intuit was so much fun!!  The people are great and they fed us alot!!  The pay was awesome for being a seasonal employee.  Even though I gained 10 pounds I would like to come back for the upcoming tax season!
good,"Great company to work for with wonderful benefits. Has a high demand for quick turnarounds on work and projects. Always thinking forward to stay ahead of the curve and making sure they don't get to comfortable, stretches the boundaries with a what could we do mentality. Change is inevitable and the jobs require extreme flexibility."
good,"Intuit was a great place to work. There are aspects of the job that can be frustrating, especially for those of us working the phones on the front line. However, it's a place with extraordinary culture, excellent front line leaders, and they provide first class treatment for the employees. "
good,Great company to work for with great culture and benefits and work life balance in most departments. Management needs some work due to their struggles with integrity.
good,"Made something like $250m for Intuit via the TurboTax Live! offering."
good,"You can expect quality support from your Leads, peers and management.  Great environment, very professional, yet relaxed."
good,The work culture at Intuit was pretty flexible and working from home option is also available sometimes. The enjoyable part of the work is good co-workers and good learning curve
good,"Overall good work/life balance and management. Some leadership issues (not the CEO but other top leadership) were the only problems. Now that the CEO and other senior staff are changing, unclear how that will play out"
good,"A typical day of work for me consisted off answering phone calls throughout the day, addressing various customer service issues such as: problems with card reader, assistance with troubleshooting credit card processing software, and spotting fraud. While working at Intuit, I learned to minimize my call times by thoroughly learning the system and processes to quickly and efficiently serve the customer. The most enjoyable part of my job was the regular training classes, as well as the spirit of diversity and inclusion."
good,I loved my time here with this company but it was also very stressful. They were a wonderful company with great benefits for employees but they also have a habit of laying off lots of their employees.
good,Great environment and co-workers. Intuit places employees first and really cares about it's people and helping others. Overall great company to work for. It has it's politics but what company doesn't.
good,"Great Company very busy loved working from home the hardest was the calls had to be taken up to the very end of your shift, and if you had to leave that call needed to be addressed and closed out before you shift out"
good,"Hands down best place you will ever work! I joined intuit expecting 'just another call center', it is not just a call center it is so much more, you will tell the difference right away when you realize the management is here FOR you not against you, which is a huge step above every other contact center in Tucson. Not to mention the best part... THEY ACTUALLY CLEAN THE WORKPLACE!!!!"
good,"Would recommend working there.  I was able to use my attitude to be teachable on new processes, sales methods.  I exceeded all goals meet and was compensated very well. I was able to articulate my methods to success. And was recognized as a top performer with many different rewards."
good,"Great place to work if you get brought on full time. Down fall is you start seasonal but if you get full time, it's fantastic. Their benefits are the best I have ever experienced"
good,"It's a call center. Generally back to back calls, especially Fall through Spring. At times can be several minutes between calls. Overall the job is to sell, cross sell, and upgrade on every call - no matter what the customer called for. Sales goals must be reached"
good,I loved working for Intuit. My manager was always available when she was needed also your co-workers was always willing to assist you when you needed them too
good,"In a remote position working for Intuit, I assisted customers by phone to help answer questions about their taxes and the TurboTax program. I was able to develop a good understanding of taxes for many situations including those that I do not encounter in my area. The management is knowledgeable, understanding and fun to work with and the team setting in an online environment is an awesome experience.

The hardest part of this job was learning everything all at once with no prior experience in job field. Getting the chance to learn all this is something i could keep for ever and enjoy knowing it."
good,"Intuit is a great place to work. The managers supported the professionals, so that we could do a great job for Intuit."

good,Best benefits at a place I ever worked for. Needs work on promoting tenured employees and offering roles for appropriate skills but environment is great.
good,Nice place to work I would go back. Its just not geographiclly desirable for me at this time. They have good Managers and employees adn pay fairly. Intuit and medical and dental packages as well.
good,Great culture. Great cohesion. Great benefits. This company has a great approach to building your skills needed to deliver for our customers and the new technology needed to stay competitive within the market of SaaS.
good,Great company to work for with awesome work and life balance. Would definitely recommend working here to other individuals looking for work. The benefits are good and there is definitely room to grow.
good,Very fair in all dealings with employees.  The company does have a lot of integrity.  The compensation was competitive and the benefits are excellent.
good,Intuit over the years changed as new management locally and corporately implemented new ideas and direction. Initially Intuit was fun and productive then it became more just down to business and the bottom line was all that was looked at as goals were raised to unattainable levels.
good,"Intuit truly competes with Google, Microsoft, and Facebook as far as making sure their employees are well compensated and happy. Regular free food, company events, and great amenities at all of their branches."
good,"compensation good, able to work  from home, room for advancement, during tax season does get stressful which I enjoyed.  Need good tax background for lead or manager position."
good,It's an amazing company and I wish I still worked for them and wasn't only seasonal the pay is awesome and they actually appreciate their employees also the benefits are amazing

good,"I love the customers and the job that I do!"
good,"If you're in your 20's or 30's it's a great work environment that focuses on developing professionally. I was hired through a temp agency so I wasn't able to make a career out of it. Given the oppurtunity, I would have never left."
good,Intuit is an awesome place to work. They really take care of their employees an are really concerned about your well being and your surroundings. There are always constant room to learn more and advancement
good,"Great management, pay and culture but job security does not exist.  Lots of little layoffs throughout the year and big layoffs at the end of every fiscal year (varies by division)."
good,"Good management, poor hour options (3-midnight or 11-7:30 EST). The hours aren't great because the company is set in the Pacific Time Zone. I liked working for Intuit. It was difficult to get set up and started but once you start, all is well. They train you very well and the training is thorough."
good,Intuit is a fair and rewarding workplace. The compensation is very competitive and the bonuses are more than appropriate if you perform. The only drawback is the seasonality of the job.
good,"Intuit was a seasonal job. The work enviornment was incredible. I wanted to come back for another season this year, but unfortunetly, they disbanded the department I was working for. This is the first place I have worked where the managers treat people like the adults they are, and not highschool students. Great enviornment, friendly faces evey day, onsite cafeteria, walking trail and free fitness room, multiple catered events, and game room. All availible to you during one of your 2 15 min breaks or your 1 hour long lunch."
good,It was for me a place where we helped accounting people get them where they needed to be to help their clients the best they could. Management there is great. Nice work environment.

good,"Great focus on Employees, Customer and Innovation."
good,"Being in CA, Intuit decided it would be more cost effective to move the Support section to a more financially viable location. Being born and raised in California I wasn't willing to relocate to Colorado or Virginia where I would be given a lateral move (i.e no increase in pay raise)."
good,"I loved Intuit.  I had the best boss.  The corporate culture was great.  It was so pro-technology.  I would work there again.  "
good,Loved Intuit culture. The We care give back value was very important to me as an individual.My team was a part time mobile team and I enjoyed the flexible schedule.
good,"Great company to work for, benefits are great when you are a full time agent. Even seasonal's were treated with the same respect. The management was not the best within training, and you were led on about advancement opportunities. Training was not enough for the type of job you were doing But overall the company is great and so are the managers, just needs to learn to manage time better and to be more direct with advancement opportunities instead of lying just to keep people on board,"
good,"7 year employee, moved out of state, would still be there if I could! Awesome benefits & high base $$ plus commission, great people, in depth training, good support from trainers & supervisors."
good,"This was my first year working for Intuit.  My manager was a very pleasant and encouraging person. The work wasn't too hard because I have been doing taxes for years.  Training lasts for 2 weeks and is paid. The pay was awesome; I worked part-time and made $20/hr.  Overtime was encouraged, in fact, the more you work, the larger your end-of-year bonus will be.  , the better.  Also, the more positive evaluations you get from customers, the better.  I got gift cards from Applebee's and Amazon.  There are no benefits but they do have 401k which they match 2 to 1."
good,"It's a great place to work. It's a good fit for me and the skill sets I have.  The culture/environment of this company is a good one. "
good,Intuit knows how to treat employees. Also makes the work environment fun! Benefits were great. Such great attitudes and always a good vibe in the building
good,Great place to work and camaraderie within the team was fun. Quarterly events were a plus and optional holidays were great
good,"There were many things that I loved about Intuit.  They had a great work/life balance program. The only downside was that in the call center, at the time, things were complex and that aspect was somewhat overlooked.  Like any organization, some management aspects left much to be desired.  Unfortunately, like many organizations, a poor correlation between success and successful leadership were drawn.  7 years have gone by since I left Intuit, and I would still recommend this company to any prospective candidates."
good,"Intuit is one of the most considerate companies I've ever had the pleasure to work for.  They are very employee focused and very caring,"
good,"Intuit allows you to be innovative in the workplace, they allow you to be comfortable while you work rather it be sitting in a break/lounge  area in one of their comfy chairs or a couch or going to play a game of ping pong while you create new ideas. The company caters to the employees by providing a laid back atmosphere. There is also a gym onsite for your convenience. I would say if you want to be a part of and recognized for the work you do and the new ideas you create to help move this company forward to greater success then Intuit Inc. is the place for you."
good,"A company that treats their employees with respect, provides a balance between work and life. A fun place to work with top notch benefits."

good,really loved working here. loved the hour and my co-workers.
good,"I loved working here.  My day would start with being on the phone, helping small business owners with their financial management issues in QuickBooks Online.

good,Always busy! Never the same. Great place to work. Pay and Bonuses are good.
good,Wonderful. Best place I have ever worked. People were forth coming with their advice and always willing to lend a hand and give you helpful information
good,"I appreciated all of the opportunities for professional growth that was provided, such as workshops and seminars on-site."
good,great products and good leadership. benefits are best in class and worth a move in and of itself. a high reliance on powerpoint and presentation skills for meetings.
good,"This position offers alot of flex time, and good benefits, not medial, as we are seasonal employees."
good,"I enjoy and actually feel like I'm helping my clients achieve there goals "
good,Good mix of easy going and high standards as far as engineering goes. Silicon valley operations. Learned agile scrum and great colleagues and managers.
good,"Intuit is a multi-faceted company with many opportunities for almost anyone who dives into the company, products and culture.  You will work your back-end off, but you will be paid for it.  You will learn more about customer experience than you ever expected, and you will be richer for it.  You will be part of completely obsessed and driven teams, but you will learn so much.  No company is perfect, but if you are going to work for someone else, Intuit is by far one of the best places to work.  Some of the highest quality people work here with incredible values, ethics, and integrity.  The product teams are continuously striving to build higher quality, more flexible solutions for small business, consumers, and their partners."
good,Good work interaction but emphasis fell on automation hurting the quality of the tax knowledge/tech combination that created the original successfl model.
good,I loved every minute of it. The pay was excellent and I met a lot of great customers. That was the easiest support job that I have had. Go for it! They also provide bonuses!
good,"Great benefits for you and your family, great vacation accrual.  The bonus structure can be changed at the company's convenience, the annual review with salary increase is not the best."
good,"I really enjoy guiding others to do their own taxes. They are usually curious and intelligent -- just the kind of people I enjoy talking to. The administrative burden is minimal, and the training is really good and thorough."
good,I loved working there. Only 1 downside. Seasonal position. I wish I could work there permantly. Fast paced during tax season but all the OTyou can handle. Lot of room for adavancement
good,"great campus, great managers, the only minus is that its a seasonal job, most jobs are 9 months and off 3 months, but its a great place to work and grow at."
good,Loved It! Great client to work for. Great company. Very fast paced with high call volume. Must be comfortable being on webcam and using multiple software programs and be able to toggle between multiple screens/pages.
good,Intuit is an amazing company to work for.  The work/life balance is great as is the pay and support.  I feel very fortunate to have called Intuit my home for many years.  It really is about the people.  The truly walk the walk.  Company values stand true on a daily basis.

good,"It was a professional and well-managed company, with co-workers and managements that took the time to engage new employees. Through this, not only did I learn the technical skills but I also learnt how to build my management skills."
good,"Intuit is a fabulous company to work for. They have the best benefits that I have personally encountered at any place of business, other than the government. The employees all work together for the common good of the three stakeholders."
good,"Work as customer service is pretty intense. Calls come in all the time. However, there was no pressure as to how long you spend with client, as long as you give good service. Even though time per client is estimate,  managers are very understanding when you spend longer than average time per client. Work is not easy considering that 50 states are calling and all states have there own tax laws and regulations. Would be really beneficial if tax experts will have locations assigned to cover. There is virtual back office available for help in case you can not solve the problem, but not always helpful. I think back office professionals has to be chosen with higher expertise and experience. basically you are the last person to be reached and you have all the stress to ""fix it"". "
good,"Intuit was a God send! The culture pushes its employees to become the best versions of themselves, all while providing them the means to do so.  The facilities are top notch, and everyone always has a smile on their face.  The mangers (For the most part) take incredibly good care of their teams.  They want to help you succeed.  This isn't the place where ""Johnny million dollars"" gets promoted just because he is a good salesmen.  They promote for the right reasons.  For the most part, everyone I know is in a position they love. If they aren't than management is helping them get their. You done feel like your being pitted against one another, its more of a brotherly competition, and everyone is there to help, lead and succeed. Oh and my health care was 100% free! (after heath screening)"
good,Intuit is a very innovative and dynamic place to work and you are expected to perform at the top of your game. They have the best benefits that a company can offer and they hire the best talent out there. This company will take good care of you once you are in. They have adopted the philosophy that a healthy employee is a happy employee and a happy employee is a productive employee. They have a robust wellness program with gyms on site and lots of classes and training. Also an on-site cafeteria. Can’t say enough about the perks!
good,"It's ranked as one of the top workplaces in Canada, and it really is great. They treat their employees incredibly well and genuinely care a lot about them. People are very friendly and pleasant to work with."
good,Its all about team work and working together at Intuit. Everyone helps each other towards the goal of advancement of the companies growth and success. Team work is what its all about.
good,"I worked as a seasonal tax expert from home with TurboTax. The job was very rewarding helping customers via video with problems in their tax returns. Customers were always very thankful and appreciated my help with the program and with my tax knowledge. I felt this was a very rewarding position, but wish they had more opportunities to stay on year-long with the company. I was given many spotlight awards and recognition, as well as a fantastic season end bonus! The company also offers employees fantastic discounts on various products and services, not just through Intuit, but for other purchases as well. If you're looking for season tax work, this was a fun job and a great company to work for."
good,Intuit has a vast resource to draw upon with knowledgeable management to help  you.  I always felt supported and valued even though I worked from home.

good,Intuit maintains a fantastic work-life balance. Their values are great & they put their employees first. They are passionate about their customers and go above and beyond for them.
good,"I was, and still am, a remote, seasonal tax advice agent.  This means that I work from home, from January through April. No commute, no traffic, no expense for lunches out, gas, tolls, parking, etc.  You can live where you WANT, as opposed to where you HAVE to live, to be close to work. Management is very supportive, coworkers very helpful.  Lots of internal resources and tools. Great training. Great cutting-edge technology.  Opportunity to contribute to a 401(k), with some company matching. Overall, great experience. The only negatives are that there is no health insurance, very limited sick time off - but this is expected for a seasonal job."
good,"Intuit was a great company to work for. My favorite by far. The culture in the work place was very professional yet friendly, and fun-loving. Group lunches and team building lunches created an awesome work environment. My manager was the best. Very supportive, gave clear directives, took time to learn about you and your family, and had great communication and management skills."
good,"Intuit makes you feel like you are truly part of their team. They are transparent with their employees. Excellent place to work. Only issue I had is that I had to end my contract early and due to that, I fell through the cracks when it came time to hire for the next season. This was confirmed by a recruiter who said she would be in touch but did not call back. Still love the company and would jump on the opportunity to work there again."
good,"Loved working here.  We had goals and a lot of pressure.  But they made sure you knew your stuff.  After hours university for learning other programs that you used everyday.  Very much involved in the community and had a lot of activities for employees.  Advancement was available if you wanted it.  Lots of employee recognition.  If it was peak time, they bought your lunch and had snacks.  Onsite cafeteria, game room, lounge.  It was great!  Unfortunately, they closed this facility and moved back to Arizona."
good,I enjoyed working for the company third party. They could've given more warning before doing company cutbacks. I wish the training was more through for everyone. We have an exceptional trainer but it was changed for all other parties.
good,"It's a work from home job; and you have the help of experienced team members as well as supervisors to assist you with answering"
good,"Intuit is an excellent company with terrific values. It's filled with smart, thoughtful, and friendly people who work collaboratively to build top notch products.  The biggest challenge is lack of clarity around roles."
good,Fun environment to work in.  Had a good balance of working hard and having fun at the same time.   I worked with a great team and had an awesome manager.
good,"Great growth opportunities, compensation packages, facilities, perks; cafeteria, gym, volleyball, and weekly company functions. Great environment and people."
good,"Friendly fun atmosphere, great incentive programs.Great management and awesome team leads they will help you exceed to the next level. Very easy to grow within the company. They may start you off as a seasonal worker but if they feel you have a positive determined attitude they wont have a problem hiring you on permanently. Attendance plays a big role make sure you show up on time not a minute late."
good,"Great company to work for and I loved the flexiblity to pick your own hours from the times that they give you. I truly love Intuit, very great company."
good,"typical day, on phones, problem solving for customer who are having problems with tax software. "
good,"Intuit is a great company"
good,It had it ups and downs. overall great place to work. Job at the time had a lot of stress when having to hit quota on monthly basis. not recommended for someone who is not into sales.
good,"Intuit is a fortune 500 company to work for, good pay and great benefits.  Within the 15 years of service, I learned about the business from end to end.  What happens with customer's payroll, to finances and payroll tax payments and filings.  Workplace culture is worklife balance.  I love all my positions held with Intuit.  The hardest part I would say was leaving."
good,"Intuit is a good place to work.  They value their employees and really gives back to the community. The workplace culture is good, everyone is respectable and get along nicely.  The facility has an on-site gym, basketball court and volleyball area.  Overall good place to work."
good,"This was a wonderful new experience for me and my first time working in a security job environment. My only downside to the job was the constant change in rules, switching security company contracts, and management changes. Other than that I loved everything else about this job and all the new skills I learned from working at this establishment."
good,Its great place to work but little risky for contractual employees.There is no policy to get them on board on Intuit's payroll.Overall great company to work for.
good,"I worked seasonal for intuit"
good,"good work culture.... and cool work place"
good,I loved working here...great company. There are folks that have been there for more than 20 years. Its inspirational to be around the company's decision makers and have a direct effect on the company.
good,"Was very fortunate to work for Intuit for many years.  Employees are treated with respect and are allowed flexible work hours and can often work from home. I was lucky to work with smart, talented and fun people.  The work was hard and demanding but worth it because we had a great team and leadership."
good,I liked working at Intuit. Very innovative and customer focused. Co workers are very friendly and warm. technology investment is of utmost importance.
good,"There are many tasks and challenges to manage working at Intuit.  The company and culture is one of the best I have ever worked at.  No only does your direct team have the ability to work with each other to work on a requirement, team members from other divisions are also willing if called upon.  "
good,"They made sure everybody gained the knowledge on how to properly deal with customers on the phone ,send upgrades and train successfully. They also worked with us individually to make sure we would work professionally with angry customers as they call in about there products."
good,Good benefits but the pay is not so great.  For the size and value of the company the pay sucks they could pay associates way more and should.
good,This company have been just Amazing. Very fast paced company with an Abundance room for growth within the Company. I couldn't possibly explain how proud I am to say it's been a complete pleasure being Employed with this Awesome Company.

good,"Intuit was a job that you love coming to everyday. It was a very care-free office, that allowed you to be you as long as you get your work done."
good,"Intuit makes sure that you are ready to succeed daily. With onsite training available to sending you across country to learn, Intuit never stops caring for their own. The environment is low pressure, having more than enough people to handle the work load. Family atmosphere and a great schedule make working here more than ideal."
good,enjoyed working with business professionals to determine the accounting software they needed to run their business well.
good,"Intuit is a great place to work! There I learned the importance of ""Brand"".  There was ongoing training on communication & leadership. The amenities were awesome."
good,"Great management team in place.  Quota driven on sales side, but numbers were certainly achievable (I hit 105-120% to goal every year).  Growth and development via collaboration with other departments to achieve customer satisfaction goals was encouraged.  Most enjoyable part of the job was working directly with customers to find the right solution for their business.  Unfortunately, after 11 years here, Intuit has moved our team of 20 sales positions to other locations and I don't want to relocate to AZ or VA."

good,"I've had an excellent experience working with Intuit and Quickbooks.  A typical day of work consists of apps, detecting bugs, and creating spreadsheets to track evertying.  I've been an account manager for several difference projects and an enthused quality assurance analyst.  The most enjoyable part of my job is definitely the environment.  Excellent coworkers and awesome perks of having a fully stocked kitchen and multiple weekly catered meals.  Additionally ""Fun Fridays"" where we get out and do something fun as an office.  The hardest part of the job is when someone doesn't pull their own weight or won't be open to critical criticism, we're all in this together and that's the hardest when someone decides to be a one-man team."
good,"Every scheduled day, I would sign in and take calls. Most of the calls lasted over and hour due to they needed more help with the product then normal. We were able to share screens and walk through the process a whole lot faster that way. I was able to see what the customer was seeing. "
