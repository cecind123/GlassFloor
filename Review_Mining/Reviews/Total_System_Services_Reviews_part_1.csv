bad,Management management management. Straight out of high school. Wages not fair. No advancement unless you're friends with them. High turn over rate. STAY OUT OF THERE!!!
bad,"I have been with this company just over 2 years, no matter how hard you work there’s no progression no support unless they like you! "
bad,Terrible place to work. You can do better. They don't care about you or anything about your life. They pay is terrible for what you're dealing with. Rare chances to move up. Don't even bother with this place.
bad,this company profits off its employees but treat the employees like the bottom of a trash can  . Tsys corporate ridge services several banks customer services they allow there employees to be called racial slurs and when you ask is the client aware they make excuses to try to keep docile if they feel like you are a potential threat they not pick and try to do everything to get you fired
bad,Do not work here they suck seriously. They really don’t care about temporary workers and they will work you to death then be like we dint need you no more
bad,"I have been at this Place over 3 years and its awful. I'm only here to pay my bills. I once thought the benefits were amazing but at this point, those are not even worth the stress. No job security. Micro manage, stuck to a cube all day w/ 3 short breaks, NO way to reach your family if emergency arises. If you have a family, forget about it, They don't care. Child sick? Tuff! Im very easy to please, but this is not it, I promise. It was an ok Job a few years ago, Now Its just a cold building no communication with back to back calls. EVERYONE hate it"
bad,"Long hours, poor pay, one of the worst company I have worked for, not much variety, very boring job."
bad,"Theres a 4 week training, which is good you do learn quite a lot, you get given tests you get 3 attempts if you don't pass they sack you. What you learn in training is different to what you learn when you get on your teams because they don't train you on everything. When you call listen it does help but does not help as much. When you go onto your teams management and supervisiors will only help you for 3 months approx then after you will be on your own. You would have to call through to a different line even though you have called a millions of times there response will be ""have you checked but have you checked though just follow the process"" even if you follow the process it is still not going to help because customers want a full explanation you can't expect someone to check then not find there answer by checking millions of time like you serious? only 5 will go out of there way in helping you find the answer the rest of them won't which is bad because you end up getting feedback but thats there fault for not helping you were not robots at the end of the day we are all human were going to make mistakes. You get put on a PIP (performance improvement plan) if you make mistakes and if you get lots of feedback because they think that if you have been there longer you should already know and should not constantly make mistakes but at the end of the day they need to realise that we gonna make mistakes reguardless everybody learns. if you get a PIP then eventually leads to a dismissal goes to HR management and HR back chat about you then they sack you in some cases I have seen it"
bad,"Training is for 4 weeks if on the job description it has 5 they are lying it is actually 4 weeks. training you learn quiet a lot and you have to do tests, you get 3 attempts if you fail all 3 they SACK you. which is unfair on others. you then call listen on week 2 and one of the grad bay leads is very sly and very dishonest. you then go back in to train for the 3rd week and they put you on the phone. they seem helpful to begin with but then once you join your team it is completely a new world. managers will help you for 3 months and then totally single you out. youl start to notice alot of favouritism amongsts managers TL and colleagues. some of the agents are fake theyl be nice to you but then bad mouth you behind your backs. it is very unprofessional they dont even follow ACAS guidelines. if your ill they wont send you home and your expected to work and even if its excruciating you wont get to go home. they go against GDPR rules in a workplace. so if your on sick for more than 4 days and go back into work you get put on AIP (Attendance Improvement Plan). managers back chat about you to other managers. only 3 managers are genuine rest are not. they brain wash you into thinking that it is a great place to work but when you settle in for over a year you start to realise that it is not all what it seems. it feels like your back at school. you get blamed for another agents error. you can not trust anyone but yourself. they nit pick at the smallest things. you dont get rewarded if your not managers faviroute and they will bully you. you suffer from lack of confidence and self-esteem"
bad,This work place treats workers unfairly. Training is good however when you do your tests you get 3 attempts if you fail 3 times they sack you which is unfair. once you join your teams its completely different its alot different from what you learnt in training like you start learning new things that you didn't know. They put you on  ( attendence improvement plan) if you go on sick and then when you come back they will then put you on the attendance improvement plan. Also if you are in pain or are in any excruciating life threating pain they will not send you home your expected to work and they don't care.  when asking for help you have to call somone to help there is only 4 that will help the rest of them are like have you checked. even though you have checked it millions of times they do not help what so ever. even if you do not know how to advise a customer they say that we should already know. there the expert so they should know and actually help but they don't. theres only few that will go out of there way in helping. there is only few decent managers in that place the rest of them are all fake. when it comes to management they have lots of favourites and they will help them so if you want to progress you can't really progress unless your there favourite and if your not there favourite then when you try an apply internal into a different department the chances of you getting there is 0 unless your there favourite but you have to do a lot to be there favourite which is unfair. some managers puts you on disciplinary unecessarily it can be avoided but some people in that place
bad,"Horrible management,"
bad,"I enjoyed my seven years there at TSYS."
bad,"Very bad management, stay away from this company. Management is biased and no room what-so-ever for learning. Micromanagement is rampant. Team cohesion is no existent. Stay away."
bad,"No work life balance, poor management and leadership, no room for progression. Seniority does not mean you are doing the best job. Pay sucks! Not flexible. Childcare faculty sucks. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!!! VERY UNORGANIZED AND RETALIATION IF OPINION IS VOICED"
bad,"Management is poor. Policies and procedures are poor. The company as a whole is horrible. Too many chiefs, not enough Indians. Too much favoritism. Manager did whatever they wanted. Didn’t care to help you. Only want to bash you for what you do."
bad,"Honestly the worst employer ever!! They promise a lot of benefits but actually give  none! Also, management is awfully miserable and you get customers swearing and shouting at you all day & you wonder if it's really worth it for how much you get paid. "
bad,"Over worked and underpaid, with constant shouting to get back on the phone at the agents. The management give no motivations and they are worn out from the constant stress from the operations managers. Poor attention to the mental well  being of the agents and the pressure they get put under to meet the targets. If the targets aren't met your put in the 'refresher zone' with no actual support to help you improve from the mistakes you have made. Pay is awful especially with the recent decision to cancel overtime rate from time and a half to standard rate, leaving a lot of people now struggling financially. Not offering progression to any of their staff as they would rather higher people that they have previously worked with then the people with the knowledge of the floor and the brand. Bad quality work life that trickles outside, if you want to stay happy and have a social life then avoid at all costs!!!"
bad,"I temped there and they do everything to destroy your creativity and push you down. Their entire culture is based on finding errors and having you do something over and over and over again. They tell you to use this or that template, then find errors on the template that you didn't even touch. They must get paid for every issue they find. Only work there as a designer if you really hate yourself and want to feel worse about yourself every day."
bad,"I was set up to fail at this location because the person who was in charge of helping me understand the operations, failed to do so , then he left for another location. the person in charge of instructing me on the paperwork and operations, kept telling me he would show me soon."
bad,Place was horrendous as they didn't have no balance and social life was out the window. They slate you for anything and will say progression is key but it is not and just a total waste of time
bad,"Poor wages, many issues to try and tackle as a manager, no support or training, majority of the staff are young and unprofessional. They expect you to do the job of 6 for the pay of not even one"
bad,"Not a job worth taking!"
bad,"Too many changes, not enough communication and lack of leadership. Industry is interesting and from that perspective you can learn a lot which is fun."
bad,"Working is very stressful environment with the calls and ques, but the hardest and most stressful part is knowing that management doesn't value the work you are doing and see you as a robot that can easily be replaced if a concern or point is expressed."
bad,To start with you have to do around 5 weeks training the Male trainer I had was very set in his ways and didn't like to answer and question and when he did most of the time it would be I don't no and then it wasn't needed. He had the whole class not ask any question but then got annoyed because he would finish quicker. There are a few tests to do but once again if you finish really quick he gets really angry and same if you go to slow he wasnt a good trainer and made the whole experience horrible for everybody. It is a case if your face fits you will do fine of not don't bother stay long a lot of people do leave that's why they are always have jobs going here. The only good thing I found was the lunch they have some really good food and the location.
bad,I worked for TSYS for a few years and it is the worst job I ever worked for. The way they manage that place is disgusting as well as how they treat you. I tried to stay and work within the company however if you are not their favourite then don't even bother because the managers and ops managers won't even look at you for progression or new opportunities that they'll be offering. The atmosphere is so toxic and the shifts are horrible. I just couldn't handle it anymore and had to leave. BEST DECISION I MADE!!!!!
bad,This place is a h*** hole with HORRIBLE management and no pay for the work you do. The pay is so low you can’t even make bills most people here have more than one job!
bad,I never had to write a review before but this time this company screwed me over. The managers don’t care about the customers and want us to screw over the clients. It was disgusting. You could hear them being sexist and racists. Would never work here again. I’m now looking for a new job.
bad,"This company has a lot of great things, that which i cannot take away from it. Great benefits, health insurance, etc. However, please beware if you are applying for Periodic Review department. It is not bad in and of itself, and is actually great experience. However, the most learned/advanced employee recently left, leaving a vacuum not only in management, but also in job and skill-set knowledge. The management is very hands-off and training takes a back seat to the other team members' wants and needs. You will not feel like you know what you are doing for many months into the job, not because you can't learn, but because they have little desire to train. "
bad,I set up the new accounts for the company along with pricing. I learned that very large companies like TransFirst do not care about their employee's. The work place culture was every man/woman for them selves. There was no team work. The best part about TransFirst was going home.
bad,I would rather not comment on this as everyone will have their own experiences. I suggest people give it a shot and make up their own minds. The pay used to be good for agents prior to the purchase by TSYS.
bad,the employees were great to work with and very helpful. not everyone was treated the same some were put on above others and treated better. very laid back
bad,"Not a great company to work for. They over work you and under pay you, stay away. I wish I would’ve known how bad management is, only get promotions if you are the directors favorite not based on your skills."
bad,"This Company is all about Office Politics if you're not apart of their click or not really friends with Management then you will be overlooked for any internal jobs opportunities or promotions. Half the time they don't publicly post the opportunities and if they do they go to certain people to apply because they already know they will give it to that person. As far a Raises or Merit increases, good luck if you ever got on their bad side or went to HR regarding unfair treatment, you will then have a target on your back until they push you out or get rid of you for whatever reason they come up with. I don't recommend this company to work for at all or if you just need something in the mean time."
bad,"When you apply for the job you are promised £18,000 salary which actually means £15,700 . You're promised training and progression which never happened. They promise 1-2-1 meetings monthly, in my whole 10 months being there I didn't have a single meeting. They don't even tell you if or when you pass probation, no formal contract either. There are many changes within the company and there is a lack of communication, no one will tell you whats going on what team you've been moved too. Managers have their favourites so there isnt a fair system in place, it doesnt matter how hard you work or what you do you will not get recognition."
bad,Customer Service was not professional and supervisor is very messy  and very rude i would not recommend this job to no one if you are thinking about working here look another way
bad,commission only and are on a draw. Leads are old and used than passed around even after you have disqualified them. No benefits unless you opt to pay for them.
bad,"Absolutely terrible place to work, turnover rate is outrageous, management is garbage, pay REALLY REALLY is terrible, there is no real compensation for the work being done."
bad,This company is completely ridiculous. Charging people for no reason for items that were returned to them. And they did it mutltiple times! They will never get a good review from me!
bad,"Travel to various cities and towns as well as local retail establishments to attempt to get them to switch their credit card reading systems to that at supported by Central Payment Systems."
bad,"Bad Management - commodity product"
bad,People came through a revolving door as staff are treated terrible in fact cattle are treated better. The higher management have no idea how to treat staff and any excuse to sack someone they will. Operation managers are equally as blind as i was told to sack someone as the had 5 days off sick. attrition is the highest i have ever known in a company. The wages are minimal and expected to work 7 days a week until 8pm. Knnowledge experts are terrible and have no experience.
bad,"My whole team was laid off after a brief 6 months of employment. The people that work there were nice, the work was a bit boring. Overall not the worse place to be."
bad,"Bad place to work. They don't accept doctor notes. So when you or your kids sick your screwed. They also do schedule bids. With that being said depending on your adherance you'll get stuck working weekends.When its time for days off this is done by seniority. Someone whose been there longer than you always bids before you and most likely get all of the holidays off.The supervisors are messy and nosey. But at the same time can't help you when your sick or something going on with your family. The only reason they ask about you is to be nosey. Also, the old man security guard will harrass you to the end about a badge. They change company policies, but don't enforce policies throughout all departments. Work at your own risk"
bad,awful it is like being in high school taunting worst job ever. I was there one month went through 2 mangers which both had no experience of the company. They like to play favorites.
bad,terrible company to work for feel like a robot plugged into a machine every day not enough training given either don't bother working there its terrible
bad,"underpay employees, would not recommend working here. hard to move up even though you work hard and pass all the requirements. they show favoritism and do not care about the employees"
bad,"I think this is one of the worst companies you could work for! It is a very cheap and stingy company that pays their customer service reps(agents) very low wages, and pays managers much higher salaries. The customer service reps have to struggle over pennies on the dollar and overtime pay. At Tsys, you will start at $10.00 per hour as a temp, and when you go permanent, you will earn $11.00 per hour. The only way to make more money, with Tsys, is you have to work a lot of overtime. They make employees fight over the best work schedules, by awarding the so-called best performers with a 7am to 4pm, or an 8am to 5pm shift, Monday thru Friday, as they are open 24/7, and are open on all major holidays.  If they don't like you, or if they claim you are not in the top 20 percentile, you will not get a normal shift. This causes a very hostile work environment, as this causes reps not to trust, or want to work to help one another, because they are all trying to get the best schedules. The moral, there, is very low, due to the low wages, and bad scheduling. Everyone is so uptight and walking around on pins and needles there. I trained at the McDonough location, which looks dim and penitentiary-like. The national average for customer service jobs like this, at such a high security level, pay at least $15.00 per hour! Stop treating your workers like prisoners and start offering them better pay!"
bad,"notice given cant wait to go"
bad,"I was daily reviewing reviewing people access.  The level of the access for different people, users, areas  Created reports"
bad,training here would be awful if you ever received it.  Would have to pick up other peoples mess on a daily basis and management would do nothing about it despite being told.  Ops directors are worse then useless.  No chance of progression.  HR take for ever to get back with an answer to a simple query. Turnaound with staff is high and you are made to feel like you are just a number.  Wages are low and management expect way too much.  You are put under so much pressure constantly.
bad,"I learned sales pitches, along with full customer service skills. I sold kirby vacuums to customers with fixed income."
bad,"I appreciate the way I am treated by my managers and the employees, this company is fun to work for I just wish they paid a little more and were more flexible with the work hours."
bad,"Tsys managed services goes back on their company policies as they choose, at their convenience. Employees are not valued."
bad,"Bad place to work. Poor place to work."
bad,Don't think about working here its a joke. Trisha manager in PHX AZ is the worest
bad,Gained a number of different skills throught my employment at tsys however im now looking for a new career somewhere that i can actually progress.
bad,"This company is always hiring because it is always firing! Everyone in the help desk support area will be fired eventually. I have never seen anything like it. They reduced the training time 50% and increased the hiring and firing just after I started I was told. This is a terrible place to work. There were good people who worked very hard. Very smart and sharp people. 90% of whom will be fired within 3 yrs and more likely 6 months. They have a school built into the business to help them find the 1% who can tolerate the job. The pay is under $30,000. They talk a lot about advancement but only a few ever advance at all. To get a bonus is almost impossible. The learning curve is the hardest I have ever seen and I had 8 yrs experience in the industry! Bottom line, they like money more than people. They don't move people to a different position who are under performing or need help, they just fire them. This is not a tolerable environment. People all around me kept disappearing. New happy people would take their places for a few weeks until they got fired. Basically this job is a scam. Otherwise they would treasure their people and find them a suitable position within the company. That's how to build loyalty, happiness and unity."
bad,"If your looking for a company with lots of drama, scams and favoritism then this place is for youu"
bad,"Probably the most unethical leadership I have ever encountered.  The VP of Sales was demoted for inappropriate contact with a female employee, only to be promoted AGAIN.  Even when sales reps forge applications, they aren't turned over to the authorities.  All illegal and unethical activity is swept under the rug.  This place rewards those of low moral character.  Terrible place.  Quitting this job was the best decision I have EVER made."
bad,"Business to business sales, managing small to medium sized business merchant accounts, face to face sales and consulting, appointment and business presentations, maintained a professional and courteous atmosphere to ensure customer satisfaction, promoted business by courteous and efficient service, client interaction, technical and quantitative analytics and research, merger and acquisitions negotiations, business evaluations, meet with clients and customers regularly, analyzing merchant statements for business owners, advising clients for best business financial decisions, interpreting the merchant statements and recommending the best alternative"
bad,"I worked here for a year, and during that time, they probably fired about 15 people in my department. They cut old people out especially, then went after anyone making a lot of money."
bad,Very hard sell.. Cold calling on businesses owners to change there credit card systems along with 2000 other similar companies doing the same.
bad,out in the field meeting with business owner's
bad,My hopes were so high about working at TSYS.  I’ve heard so many things about it but obviously things have CHANGED there. First of all the call center is GHETTO FABULOUS and some of the Associate Managers are TERRIBLE.  I have never worked for a company that was so UNPROFESSIONAL before in my life.
bad,"Favoritism is rampant in Alpharetta location of this company, and they don't like if you have a voice. Unless you belong to a particular ethnicity, you will do ok by keeping a low profile."
bad,This lady was money hungry .she stole money .keep treating to fire me cause i asked for my pay so she was like bring in timesheet and bage she had a money problem i couldnt work with them no more
bad,This was by far one of the worse jobs I’ve had. Most managers were not helpful unless you were a friend of theirs. The handbooks and rules changed so frequently that the managers couldn’t keep up.
bad,"1. Culture is bad."
bad,"1. Parking: employees are told there is on-site parking. Yes, there is enough for about 50% of the people who drive in. So you can spend 40 minutes on a bus and get in 30 minutes early so you don’t start late or you can drive and get in 30 minutes early driving around looking for parking and then walk 15 minutes to the office. You’re not paid for the extra daily time it takes to do this, obviously. "
bad,"i worked here for 4 months. After the 5 week training provided, you are expected to know everything right off the bat. management is a disgrace. they really do like picking on others, unless you go right up their bottoms. you really are made to feel like a number and not a person. head of customer services is an absolute wet wipe. he does not help one single bit. he'd rather sit uncomfortably on his chair and wait for you to make a mistake so he can call you out on it and in some cases, fire you. This place will make you go through depression. the shifts are terrible, x3 10 hour shifts and x2 6 hour shifts scatteredthroughout the week, some weekends."
bad,"If any individual from different nationality is willing to work with TSYS Sudbury Canada, my advise is to look for any other job. Racism and Favouritism is their main tool. Managers demotivate you and do not value individual's life."
bad,"As a former employee I can confirm that TSYS do not care about you as an employee. You are a number, a means of profit and won't hesitate to remove you if you disagree with this ethos."
bad,Work environment was just a lunch table and chairs. Immediate boss was great and tried to make the best with what he had to work with. CTO (chief technology officer) would think nothing of swearing anyone out in front on a large group of people. Schedules were totally unreasonable. Held mandatory impromptu conference call  8-9 pm with very little notice.
bad,"I've been at this division over two years, so let me give you the real scoop on this place."
bad,"great training...then you have to deal with low morale, favoritism, incompetent management, substandard wages. Most of the experienced reps have left even though some had substantial residuals."
bad,"I was recruited for the Virgin Credit Card campaign before it merged with MBNA."
bad,"Boy, there just aren't many positives to he had here.  Haphazard background checks, poor training, constant restructuring of the entire company, embarrassing IT failures, dated equipment, micromanagement from the start,  compensation plan ever changing, tight fisted budgets, management and staff turnover leaving only the nepotism for long term employees.  You won't make much commission money here as the system is skewed for the few not the many and the direct preference for the inside sales force over the outside.  The recent Trans First acquisition gives off the usual cloud of the upper management doing something while the result is a fractured mess of a company.  If you can get passed all of this and still want to work here, make sure you understand that you are a temp to them at all times of your duration."
bad,"handle 60+ calls a day and forced to do work over your pay"
bad,"TSYS is supposed to be a technology company however they are severely lacking in their technology offerings. The market has far surpassed what this company has to offer."
bad,"Executive management and HR hire their friends and family and keep them there even if they do not perform. Horrible environment if you are ethical and believe in the work you do. If you can turn a blind eye to their misrepresentation of the numbers, then enjoy!"
bad,I worked at the corporate office as an underwriter in my opinion my manager was incompetent he was a terrible leader I don't think his people skills were strong at all. Given the chance he would throw you under the bus in a second I could not wait to get out of that job it was horrible. Sales managers were good guys no bad things to say about them.
bad,I have no words it’s hard to believe they still get away with it    training management team bullying environment  I was warned it was a bad company to work for but made the  mistake of not heeding good advice
bad,Support systems have declined over time in effectiveness and reduce my results and customer satisfaction.  There are no strategies in place by management to improve technical and other support systems; nor do any plans appear to be on the horizon.
bad,"The worse management I've ever experienced!  They tend to hire mostly Indians and predominately those on work visas so they can treat like indentured servants.  It's one of the most unethical places I've ever worked!  "
bad,"They have great benefits but do not pay you for the amount of stress you receive on the phones. They only care about numbers. If you want to have your own home and survive, TSYS is not it."
bad,"You will hate it!!!!! The managers will try to get you fired!!! the place is a playland for little kids, you can not have your cellphones in the bays at all"
bad,"If you like office politics then go here! The running of the building is so backwards. Such a high turnover of staff due to staff not being treated correctly at all. Different clients may have different response from the agents involved but the running of the place has gone down hill. The management would rather make you feel rubbish then progress. They will also discuss openly on the floor a lot of personal things that they shouldn't. Having had management openly talk about other peoples mental health, investigations and much more in front of a normal customer service agent on the floor. The Customer service operations managers are more worried about the fines that they will pay for not meeting certain requirements then they are the people they have working for them and the stress they are being caused. If you work here and are decent at doing your job you will be overloaded with the work you have to do, while maintaining good scores on your calls without them ever looking to progress you because you aren't there favourite."
bad,If you like to be micro-managed everyday and have every second of every minute being accounted for by your supervisors and on the phone assisting rude customers then this is for you.
bad,"The way the attendance policy works (since they changed it recently) sucks if you have kids and/or health problems. You ask one question and get different answers from each supervisor. They don’t care about their employees, would never recommend!"
bad,"TransFirst was a difficult place to work. I worked in Retention, and the goals were unrealistic. It was hard to balance the limited power of saving customers money to retain them, and not saving the customer too much, even if we were making a ridiculous amount of money off of them, and they were threatening to cancel and go elsewhere. The position I was in had no opportunity for upward movement. I did get along very well with my co-workers, and management would always go to bat for us."
bad,"i started here in january what a rubbish company training is a joke have a system dated in the 80s no logic on commands they throw you in the deep end and expect you to do the job "
bad,Every minute can count agains you even if you are on the phone with a client. You need to clock in-out fro breaks and luch O N   T  I  M E.  You only have 1/2 hr lunch and they don’t take dr excuses.
bad,"Everyone is afraid of losing their job."
bad,Transfirst was a better company prior to the merger with Tsys.  The merger has produced a company that seems to be more concerned with bottom line profits than concern for the employees.
bad,"When I originally started I really enjoyed the position, but I soon realized I had a lot more on my plate than  the rest of my peers that had been with the company at least 6 months longer than I. To ""benefit"" the department, management starting switching things around which actually caused a lot of loss - within a few weeks 5 people quit unannounced. The changes made the position more stressful. Verbal abusive from sexist Sales Reps, inner office Gossip (like high school - everyone in a clique) lack of pay, no pay for overtime though it was becoming standard, lack of management and lack of care. I know everyone is out to make money, I don't know anyone who really wants to work.. but a lot of us kissed butt and busted our own to get where we were but it was never really worth it. This company is strictly money driven, and the most they care about the employees is that they are making the company money."
bad,Make 70 to 100 calls a day.  Mostly are meaningless.  Pay was not as advertised.  Have to 'pay your dues' to get accounts that provide an income.  You have to attempt to upsell customers on equipment that many companies provide for free.
bad,"Its like a jail house, and its so micromanaged. Its hard to move up within the company. Its not all bad to work at TSYS but its not what is cracked up to be."
bad,"It's a ""dog eat dog"" world at TSYS. There is a lot of scheming and backstabbing in your rise to the top. You had better watch what you say and trust NO ONE! They will crush you in order to advance themselves. I never felt like I could be myself in that environment. They proclaim to inspire innovation and creativity, but yet stifle it. This is the same company that proclaims at one point they were a 46 million dollar company and now are a 7.6 billion dollar company, but still do nothing to invest in their employees or their benefits to those ""Team Members"". I would be cautious as to what division I worked for. Avoid Division 24 at all costs."
bad,"Revolving door, they hire anyone with a pulse which is always a bad sign. Too many stars have to line up before the deal closes. I gave that place nearly a year of my life and made less than 30k. Most of the year I only made $8 an hour which was on a draw. I have a wife and 4 kids, at the end of it I went 2 months without a deal and was shown the door. After all my hard work they fired me. Hallelujah!"
bad,This company has strict requirements and little flexibility. As a customer service rep one is focused on the calls and has little time for breaks. The company does not promote a fun environment for its employees.
bad,I love the company when I first started. However over time things changed. There is no consistency with upper management and a lot of favoritism that take place. It is very hard to get a decent raise and they let go of a lot of Great Workers.
bad,If you need a check then Tsys McDonough is for you. personal relationships builds careers in Tsys McDonough. Associate Managers are clueless. Written up for everything and rules only apply to agents not AM’s. Average salary Analyst 15. 50 per hr not 12.50. Associate Managers create hostile work environment. One Associate Manager is very deceitful and lack ethics. The culture they create not worth headache. Absolutely no room for advancement. They will lie and give hope to string you along with same pay. Fraud is a mess!
bad,All I have to say is do not work here for any position .. Mobbing happens at its best.  Management does not have any clue about job market and who they should work with random workflow..
bad,"If you get a job in production, you'll never get out unless you quit. If you're a temp, they'll take YEARS to hire you (and that's a big if). Management has been known to blacklist employees who seek other job opportunities within the company. They'll lead you on with the promise of promotion, but it never comes."
bad,"Hated the experience, management is absolutely appalling and as an employee you’re made to feel like what you say isn’t relevant. I hated it and wouldn’t recommend it to be frank"
bad,Know that you will not be compensated fairly. After you are hired wait 6 months and they will be paying people $2 more per hour. No raise or incentives to take on extra responsibility. Management at their best is uninvolved  and at their worst rude. Extremely stressful environment. Business owners are allowed to scream and swear at you. You aren't allowed to hang up without giving them several warnings..
bad,"This job was very stressful especially when production quotos were raised to unreasonable levels.  Also, very hard to get promoted.  Favoritism runs rampant here."
bad,The job seems all sweet in the beginning but once you start the real work and you think this is something I can do until retirement you start getting treated badly by managers you even hear associate managers gossiping about team members. The managers don’t know how to do their job so don’t even ask for help. They will get on to you about the smalles my little issue. You get written up about everything it gets the bills paid but not all money is good money going home and stressed from a job that really don’t care if you see you kids or family be my guest
bad,"very bad experience working here, no family orientation, no values, no morals, bad management, harsh working environment, no order, unfair treatment.."
bad,"Not worthy of a review.  The hourly wage is not up to the load and skill required to do the job.  Management is clueless on what the processes are.  The company states, on its website, they are a ""people company"" but not the people who work there"
bad,The leadership in the FOTS division doesn't pass information to the employees on a regular basis. This leads to mass confusion and poor performance from Account Executives. The compensation plan has caused almost half of the sales force to leave with the other half currently looking to leave. There is no direction and the entire division is essentially lost in the woods.
bad,"There is little to no chance to advance within the company in the specific location that I work in. The management is little to none. There's not direct human resource representative anymore, no training department, and most of the supervisors as well as assistant director has left or has been asked to resign. There is a shortage of employees and due to the lack of communication and organization, a lot of employees have left for better job opportunities."
bad,I worked here for five and half years no offer of advancement lots of offer of support if you struggle when asked for none given  high turn over of staff due to their inflexibility cold hearted attitude to barievement of late the management when I first started were great and supportive Definately a company on the way down
bad,"This is one of the worst companies i have ever worked for. The work environment is so toxic that it starts to impact your health tremendously. Here are some of the things which makes this place horrible:"
bad,"TSYS seems like such a wonderful company on the outside but don't be fooled. If you come in as a temp they will seem like they care until you flip perm. The leadership here is a joke. Literally have to go to the top to get anything done"
bad,"I'd just graduated, and I figured why not give tech support another shot and get rid of my college job. I should have stayed with the college job. I've been much happier since I quit this place. "
bad,I usually get to work around 7.30am and will generally be there until around 6pm.
bad,Takes efficiency too far in good times and bad. Chronic poor decision making by middle management. Middle management out of touch with subordinates. Management gets too much credit for work done by subordinates. Managers tend to have out of control egos. Upper management does nothing to keep this in check. Upper management too focused on beating FDR at all costs. Upper management practices duplicity and hides behind image.
bad,Adherence policy and the KPI monthly goal is a 95% which is ridiculously because life happens and most people have kids and family emergency. It seems as if the company doesn't care about your needs. They don't excuse doctor appointments and there is a 60 day adherence policy meaning if you miss two days of the 60 days you get a write up. If you are below a95% for KPI you get a write up up
bad,"I worked as the facilities systems engineer right out of college for 7 months. I was very useful in the fact of keeping environmental records and organizing projects. As soon as there was a decline in my type of work, they forced me to resign."
bad,The actual job you do it pretty easy. The company it’s is horrible. Managers continuously change. I was there a little less than a year and had about 5 managers. The rules are always changing and no one follows them. They are unorganized. A few of the managers have authority issues. This place is revolving door.
bad,Do not work at McDonough Call Center. The Center Manager for their client is incompetent and a bully. He picks only certain employees he cant bully to make sure you get fired. They hold your accountable for adherence when you are serving their clients. If you are a minute over your break from manual in phone you will receive harassment from Management. They probably about to close the center. Very high turnover rate.
bad,"There’s no opportunity to grow here. The only thing they care about are their calls being taken. You are over worked and underpaid. They don’t care about your personal life or if you have a family. They want you to come to work whenever they choose and if you don’t, you will fail adherence because you’re graded daily based off your attendance and adhering to your schedule. If you’re on the phone when your break comes you’re penalized and your adherence is docked, they don’t fix it for your scheduled breaks or lunch. Failing adherence can cause you to lose your job, and on top of that if you call out you get an occurrence, so you be fired either way, and don’t forget If you’re on the phone and don’t read your policy and do something wrong that is docked off your average too so you be terminated that way as well. I hated this job and felt like a prisoner each day there. It may be for you but for me it’s something I’ll never do again unless it’s my last resort."
bad,"Call center stressful work. Other ares of tsys may not be as stressful. Getting cursed out and belittled by customers ALL day ."
bad,Every day I came into work was Heck apparently you can't swear. Any time I improved on my call scores I got told it wasn't good enough it sucked. I was told I could work from home if I got call scores up but I made sure I was doing good they always found something wrong. I went into a depression so hard working here.
bad,"The training was fine and really enjoyable until I went upstairs to the call centre and then it went really downhill from there. I was given a warning about failing security questions and then when I asked for some further training I wasn't offered any. I was then sacked by telephone which was incredibly cowardly from all the management. I felt really let down by them and I even worried for my safety when the recruitment company rang my Mum and told her there had been an incident at work involving me!!"
bad,We had a lot of conference calls that were very helpful to contact clients.  We generatred all of our own clients.
bad,"In view of the positive reviews out here it only goes to show that you can fool a lot of the people all of the time.  This company used to be great until the CEO retired and a new CEO took over who was nothing more than a bean counting, head hunter.  Then HR got infiltrated by cowards and backstabbers who could not deal with a person face to face, they could deal with you if your back was turned.  The lower line managers were nothing more that corporate stool pidgons who will use the guise of private meeting to report you to HR  for any statement made in confidentiality.  This company has come to define the deepest and most reprehensible vision of PC."
bad,"Tsys has a great name in the community but this perception is askew. The grand opportunity and enthused work environment is only at the campus location. Corporate ridge houses the disgruntled leaders that carry poor salaries. The call center has unrealistic expectations and even poorer leadership. U will be confused and constantly monitored, no matter ur experience level u will be micromanaged. Say goodbye to holidays and discretion. U don't matter ;only the clients. They have great insurance that u will never use bc they reject pdo time off. The needs of the business and call volume supersedes all personal concerns and education, for that matter. Tsys is a horrible company to work for if u are driven or independent in thinking. It's unlikely I'd ever recommend anyone to work here and my heart goes out to those corporate ridge vets who have invested ample time and money investing in this company only to be treated with little regard. So don't punish yourself ... Find something else!"
bad,"I would not recommend this company as a place to work . They claim Support,education, advancement, job security however these things are by word of mouth only not by action. Salary is lower than other companies of it's seize and product. The Job it's self is very stressful,"
bad,"Its exciting at first especially if you have never work in a call center then after a year and there's no change no promising raises or promotion the recruiter said you WILL HAVE BASED ON YOUR PERFORMANCE!! Not really a ""family oriented company"" they claim to be! A lot of the managers are unprofessional and full OF MESS AND DRAMA! THEY HAVE FAVORITES That can have and get a way with a lot!!"
bad,The department I worked in was great because it was so fast paced that time flew however the management is rude and messy and when you go to them regarding a issue that problem is all over the bay it wasn’t a peaceful environment
bad,"TSYS is an okay company to work for, but do not care about their employees. They only care about their service levels and their calls being answer. They want TSYS needs to come before anything else, example sick child. Most department management are unprofessional and unorganized. You rotate schedules every 3-4 months and your attendance and performance determines which schedule you can select. Very slim chance to none that you will receive a raise or incentive."
bad,"The quality of management was inconsistent, and often you had little notice of next weeks shift and if you complained it was, 'try and get a shift swop'."
bad,"This company WAS a great place to work.  Then the new CEO's hired gun management completely changed the company culture.  It was an employee centered company where employees were the chief asset.  Now it is a performance centered company where employees are an expense.  "
bad,TSYS is the absolute worst company that I have ever worked for! Unethical work conditions and management is messy and beyond unprofessional.There is no work/life balance and no incentives. They treat you as a robot not a human being.
bad,Increasing pressure.  Looks like they were staging the company for acquisition. Repeated change of managers and lack of continuity in transition.  Lacking supporting infrastructure to fulfill requirements.
bad,"Training you get is good however different when you take calls. Breaks are good and only certain people are nice not everyone. Very cliquey kind of like school. Certain manager are not sympathetic when it comes to illness or sickness. You get put on an AIP ( attendance improvement plan) if you breach it you get diciplinary even dismissall. Certain manager have their faviroutes and honestly they do like to pick on you if you doing the smallest thing wrong, the whole idea is to learn from mistakes not like its a huge error. We are not robots mistakes are going to happen. And when you ask for training you dont recieve it at all, yet they always say training will be offered if you as. Thats not the case. You have to go through diciplinary before you get it. Very unfair HR as if you want to move teams for confidence to improve you wont be able to. Breaks are alright though, canteen food is ok not the worst. Theres only 3 managers that are nice rest of them in CS are not."
bad,"Very energetic, growth is possible pending on who you know. you meet a lot of diverse individuals, from business owners to agents, you gain a lot of knowledge about the credit card industry. Its a lot of work multi tasking. a lot of typing.. training is extreme but if you like a fast paced environment then you would love working for a credit card processing company such as this."
bad,"The job isn't difficult but you basically spend 8 hours a day getting yelled at by merchants calling in. Making matters worse, management is bad, you're tethered to a phone where they monitor literally every second you're there. Micro management goes to extremes. Even on slow days you can't have anything else on your desk, can't use the internet, can't do anything except wait until the next call comes. The benefits are the only positive about this place but they don't outweigh the cons of working here."
bad,Trust me when I say that this company is not a good place to work in sales! This company does not monitor or regulate what their sales people say or do. This is definitely an environment for the unethical and dishonest sales person. They will promote you if your numbers are right but if you speak up about business morals and ethics be prepared to find another job!
bad,"This company has a high turnover, theres some much information to remember in such a short amount of time. Once they throw you on the phones they constantly release you to take one call after the next. As for breaks, they pretend to give you a scheduled time for your breaks, but in turn ask you to hold off on lunches and breaks 1 to 2 hours after.  Customer service is so understaffed, which if why I feel like we're feeling so overworked. The upper management pretends they care about you, but all you'll notice is the favoritism. Very poor management."
bad,The Call Center leadership does not care about the staff. They only care about filling seats to answer calls. They show favoritism and it is hard to advance. It is a stressful job with low morale. The management team is horrible.
bad,"TSYS HAS NO BENEFITS AT ALL .IF YOURE SICK THEY DON'T CARE ITS NOT THEIR FAULT SO YOU WILL GET WRITTEN UP. No dr notes will be accepted, The new attendance policy that was just created is if your 1 minute late coming to work ,breaks,lunches, they you will get wrote up. This company forces people to quit. The benefits sucks you have to earn your paid time off 6 hours per month...The managers only care about themselves.Security is great I must say I honestly would not work here anymore. The pay is lower than I imagine for all the work we have to do ..thankful I only been here for three months and found a new Job. Think before you apply"
bad,"So let me start off by saying this company really does try their best to give their employees the best training, the best support system in order to succeed.  Here is where it goes downhill.  U have 0 job security.  All the top earners in this company that they constantly throw in ur face and use as an example all stepped in shi% and either live in an area where there is limited competition or just completely got lucky with a referral partner... The truth is if ur in the New Jersey/New York area you are a dime a dozen and the chance of you making $85,000 is slim to none.  You put tons and tons of miles on your car and they don't pay for your car, gas, tolls, or maintenance.  The bank partners no matter how hard you try are always going to think of you as an afterthought, there are 10 other products that they are always trying to push... No matter what the truth is or the situation it is never the customers fault or the banks fault, u will be blamed for every little thing that happens.   This company doesn't just throw u out there and for that I give them credit but as far as pay or considering it a long term solution don't even waste ur time"
bad,"As a work place, the colleagues you work with are fantastic. "
bad,"I was one of 860+ employees to get laid off in 2016.  After working for them for 18 years, they threw us away like garbage.  We were made to walk through the lobby, with people staring and gawking at you, out the front door.  HUMILIATING!  This is a company you want to keep your kids away from later in life...Needless to say, I have not found a job yet and it has been a year and a half.  Just found out not too long ago that some of the employees received $1,000 bonuses.  They never started that until this year...Thanks a lot you bunch of BUMS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,"Management will pick the favorites on the team to give all the success and accounts to.  No matter how hard you worked. Cases would be taken from you and given to others.  "
bad,"staff turnover says a lot about TSYS as a company, its got a complete lack of manager support and not a nice atmosphere in the office. not much team spirit and a lot of outdated processed resulting in spending your time listening to customers complain"
bad,"Management is disgusting, they treat employees badly due to situations, they hire people just to sack people, was good pay every month but loads of people did leave the company due to bad management and them sacking people when they feel like it."
bad,"I would not encourage any sales rep to work for this company. Cpay is unethical, they charge merchants hidden fees, and they make it really tough for merchants to get out their contracts."
bad,"The rules change constantly, the hours change all the time and you will be held accountable for their changes no matter what your situation is. If they hire you, you are expected to do everything they want you to do. Horrible place."
bad,I learned a lot there. Co workers were helpful & job was okay. I enjoyed this job
bad,"I loved my position in TD BANK's call center. Worked 10 hrs OT every week. When I requested part time status, immediate supervisor advised unlawful suggestions. Was 100% against Disability Act."
bad,"If you never worked anywhere outside of Columbus and are not looking for competitive wages, then this is the place for you. TSYS   holds tight to the 'good ol boy' way of doing things. After 3 years, I got fed up with the 'it is not WHAT you know, but WHO you know' mentality that permeates this company. If you are connected at TSYS, then you can get away, pretty much, with anything. However if you even hint at rocking the boat, you WILL be persecuted."
bad,"A couple years ago The company laid off staff that worked there for 2+ years so that they didn't have to put in as much money to match an employee's contribution for their deferred profit sharing plan. At 2 years the company matches your contributions dollar for dollar. After laying off staff they then had job fairs and job postings here,etc..terrible company to work for."
bad,they are unprofessional and is very bad at keeping you updated on jobs that are available. I would not recommend this job to anyone it is just a waste of time.
bad,Only care about shareholders and the stock price.  The next big breach will be from this company.  Worst vulnerability management and patching I have ever seen.  Disaster waiting to happen.
bad,Would not really recommend for anybody to work here. Members are micro managed and the compensation is really not good at all. I recommend to stay away.
bad,you get hired on thinking you will have an hour lunch break but they constantly change it just 30 mins.Management is no help and HR could care less about any issues you are having.
bad,Company shows A LOT of favoritism. Overall experience was ok
bad,This place used to be a good company that has gone to the dogs with horrible management. The health care division is a crock in an out house. Poor training. Unqualified management that plays favorites. Lack of leadership. I would never recommend anyone put their career here. Typical work day started with useless meetings and conference calls.  The hardest part of the job was having no consistent direction. Trying to sell by the seat of your pants. And the pay was way below market for health care sales. Benefits were ok. I give work life balance a 3 because I was able to set my own schedule.
bad,"The ability to coach, nurture and grow you time into successful individuals is none existent at this company.  As a supervisor you cannot handle your day to day duties all while trying to create reports,attend meetings,look at call volumes, listen to calls and take supervisor calls. Too much pressure and too much stress. Upper management has its picks and if you're not one then you could be on the chopping block for the next layoff.  It's not about how well you perform, it's about how well you kiss up! The call center agents are allowed to speak and act in non professional ways.  Corporate Ridge is not and does not require professionalism in any shape,form or fashion from anyone that works there. It's like the insane running the asylum!  You have people in management roles from supervisor and up that has no business managing anyone. Too much favoritism."
bad,"This place is a disgrace ,A lot of discrimination, never listen to both sides, Don’t work much in teams , Management is poor "
bad,If you have children or a family this is definitely not a job for you. The management sucks and they do schedule change every 3 months not a stable place to work.
bad,This job was sold to me. Little did I realize that at the time. They have no concept of life happens outside of work. If you are 2 mins late it will go against your monthly productivity even if it only happens once. This department wants you to show up sick and stay at your desk even if that means throwing up in your trash can. The only time you are allowed to get up for bathroom breaks is on your breaks. I love the job but management is impossible to please.
bad,"not good, a good place to start, work not good, management is very poor, they try to scare ou with being sacked, don't ask about our well being, not a challenging working environment, favouritism for choosing people to progress."
bad,I have learn no real job security. You cannot have a life outside of job. They would like your time no matter what you have going on. You are on call 24/7. They will try to get you to do a lot more than what you are being paid to do.
bad,"N/a. It was ok. Not bad but management stuck by themselves and took care of themselves only. They valued how long someone been at the company longer over someone's passion for the job even if they know someone was better for the job, they wouldn't allow the better person to do the job and and impact lives"
bad,"All they care about is adherence... They wouldn't care if you came in with the flu, no arms and legs. They are not centered around the care and concerns of employees."
bad,"This company is no longer in the Kansas City area, with the Health Services division. I can't speak much to what it would look like now to work there, as it's changed a lot since I left."
bad,"Typical inside O/B sales role using CRM, and being held to performance metrics.  Not an exciting place.  Many employees are sullen and fearful of losing their job.  Not a colorful place; it's grey."
bad,When joining you are lead to believe that there a lot of place's you can progress but in fact that is quite the opposite as there are people that have been there for 5+ years already and even though they advertise for progression roles even on sites like this it's just so they appear to be giving everyone a fair chance as they are already well aware of who they are going to provide the role to well before they have even started advertising for the role. Its a shame really as the customers are a delight to deal with but the way the managers conduct themselves within the establishment leads employees to brown nosing there managers so they have a higher chance of promotion as they prefer to give it to someone they consider to be a friend rather than someone who is better qualified to role though they don't see eye to eye.
bad,"Acquired twice in three years with multiple major systems conversions, constant changes in direction with multiple unsuccessful service improvement programs, aging systems had inadequate support"
bad,Very unbalanced delegation of opportunity for sales leads. Poor instruction of products/services to offer clients. Monotonous and stressful work until you're assigned a good amount for direct referral partners.
bad,"You are promised the world in the interview. I was told that there is lots of progression and training courses."
bad,Transfirst is an employer that is perfect for people that have no job experience.  They provide adequate training and promote anyone to management no matter their skills or experience.
bad,"Obtain proper approval of invoices for processing. Match all purchase orders with the correct invoices. Code all invoices appropriately according to location, department, and correct general ledger account."
bad,The environment is very stressful. Pay is not enough for task.
bad,Throughout my career at Tsys I have constantly strived to learn everything I can. I can do every task and process on the production floor including management responsibilities with no recognition. I've been told that I am doing all the right things but they refuse to give me opportunities to advance or get raises.
bad,"This company (I left April 15, 2019) is a high stress, long hour, no opportunities for advancement place to work.  The demands could not be met in a 40 hour week,  This was the primary reason I was asked to leave."
bad,"Management not helpful, does not allow unpaid time off.  Managers contradict themselves and each other.  Database referential integrity, process jobs, and data file processing rules not documented."
bad,"I worked in 2 departments in my 2 years at TSYS. I started in Customer Service and it was the most soul destroying job I've ever had. They are very much target driven and the management in CS is very poor to say the least. They are not empathetic to sickness/absence. I internally transferred to the Fraud team and the job was admittedly much more interesting than CS. You get to do a wide variety of tasks which breaks up the day but generally you are either taking inbound calls or making outbound calls. I found the management slightly better but there was a lack of professionalism as I found there was a clique between the few managers within the team. This meant that if you didn't fit in, your chances of a promotion were slim and you were mainly stuck doing the 'rubbish' jobs. I would say TSYS are flexible, a couple of times they changed my start/finish time so I could get to and from work (I had a 2 hour commute and I don't drive), however, the one main downfall is the salary, it is abysmal compared to similar jobs in the area. This, coupled with the fact that they scrapped the quarterly bonus but compensated by adding about 20p onto your hourly rate. I loved working in the Fraud team but the workplace culture started to grate on me and was partly why I decided to leave."
bad,"unbiased management "
bad,"everyday theres another fault with the systems, the managers havent got a clue bar one or two who actually think about the welfare of agents, there is zero progression opportunity unless you want to do 3x as much work for no extra pay, the benefits that they offer are inconsistent and very sporadic. they expect 150% from you but only put in 20% themselves. if you use the toilet too much you get punished with a monitoring report. job is a piece of cake, 95% of the customers are lovely."
bad,"It was at first a seemingly awesome job to have until you got in trouble for fighting for the ""little guy"", its a huge corporation and they operate like one too. The accounts that bring in millions usually get almost everything nearly free while the little man business are charged ridiculously for everything."
bad,Customer service reps are treated like garbage here. Mandatory overtime is frequent and could continue for months. People often burn out at TSYS quickly.
bad,"staff where awful, didn't treat employees right. wasn't sympathetic. "
bad,The work life balance is decent but there are way too many obstacles in the way of a successful career. I am not a huge fan of the leadership as they are too involved in employee affairs.
bad,i would like to say that this job was good but it was not at all. the people where the best part. i can only say that this company has a lot of improvement to make.
bad,This is a company that is owned by counselmen for the city of columbus
bad,"very unprofessional customers that would call in could hear the cursing in the background, employees were not knowledgeable about the company and products"
bad,Click-ish type of environment. People separate themselves by race. Brown nosers get promotions. Managers that lack actual management experience and skill sets. If you do not find a group to fit into they will harass you. If you are knowledgeable about EEOC laws and let them know that you are then you should be alright. Remember to ask for the pay you want. No matter how high it is. I made more than others that were doing the same job as me simply because I asked for what I wanted. The so-called lead was a drug addict that displayed severe mood swings. He would curse out customers on the phone and go off on the employees. TBH the employees are just as toxic as the Managers. Keep to yourself and have AN EXIT PLAN. GET IN AND GET OUT FAST!!
bad,"Although it was an ok place to work and the colleagues were decent and friendly, there was not much room for advancing up the ladder career wise and seem to lay people off without reason."
bad,"Not impressed with the lack of leadership.  Hiring all from the outside has ruined this company.  Promotions from within come only to those who drink the ""kool-aid""  even when it does not make good business sense."
bad,TSYS is a competitive job where nothing is organized and everybody has a problem with you if you are doing your job well. It’s very stressful and aggravating.
bad,"The company offers wonderful benefits , however you literally have to kiss butt just to move forward . The mangers constantly gossip and monitor everything except trying to make sure the employee succeeds . The constant changes in policy and management was stressful and also having to fight for cubes and having to share headsets . Became an unsanitary environment . My supervisor seemed to enjoy the fact of receiving a failed phone call . Also while speaking to supervisors everyone can hear the conversation and everyone knows everyone business . Very high school environment not the type of environment I would recommnend. Taking over a hundred calls in the call center was mentally draining and exhausting . I would only recommended the job If it's the last option ."
bad,"I must say TSYS is a good company for those who enjoy call center positions. I personally don't enjoy working in call centers hence the reason I didn't initially apply for the call center position. I applied for a different position however a recruiter pulled my app and offered customer service rep position. I was desperate for full-time employment at the time so I accepted the offer thinking I if I at least got in the door I would be able to apply for another position. I've been told different requirements for applying for another position, either one or two years in a position before applying for another. The company I take calls for have the rudest customers. Quality listens to and grade calls as well as supervisors. It's almost like being watched by the FBI whereas I truly understand being sure CSRs are doing their jobs according to policy and providing sufficient customer service it's really not that serious to screen capture and monitor absolutely everything employees are doing on each call. If one has given a reason to be monitored so closely I totally get it, but if one is/has been doing their job proficiently then why should they be constantly watched like children. Benefits are the ONLY thing I like about the job."
bad,the hardest part of job right now is my work schedule and mandatory overtime. i enjoy the sitting part the most and the eaw . i learned since i have been there it is a easy job
bad,"TSYS does provide a lot of benefits for there employees and does appreciate there employees at the top level. However the training, appreciation and support from management at the department level is extremely poor. Management is poor."
bad,"the company is very fast paced, no flexibility in hours. you are required to work mandatory at least 5 hours overtime. no empathy for sickness or having to leave early."
bad,"Passed all my background checks as expected when working with a company that deals with the type of Information that they do. Even supplied references. They wrote to a past employer for a reference even though that company was not one of the three references I had listed, and because they could not get a response from the company they fired me with out notice."
bad,"Management was horrible. They wanted me to do personal things for them like taking their cars to be detailed,  taking their cars to have tires changed. Splitting wood and loading it on a trailer for the owner to take up to their mountain cabin. Loading his 4 wheelers on a trailer to take up to the cabin."
bad,"I enjoyed the work I did as a fraud analyst, unfortunately management was the problem here. Zero schedule flexibility, employees are not valued, difficult to advance yourself and extremely disappointing raises (2 years of work and only a 13 cent raise)."
bad,"Love the fact that it is business related job site. There is not a lot of advancement opportunities in this work place.This workplace is also very organized, but lack management, employee interaction"
bad,TSYS is currently transforming the way their IT department is structured and how in does business.  As a result of this they are performing layoffs and closing remote locations.
bad,The company culture has changed significantly in the recent years.  Much needed jobs are being cut to increase revenue.  Job security and loyalty is a thing of the past.
bad,Own personal space...schedules very limited....management is okay...training instructors wonderful but time frame for training rushed...not very lenient with balance as far as outside of work...had to use all hours when i went on leave having my baby..if no hours you have to call out not request day off...
bad,The company was run in a very unprofessional fashion. Team cohesiveness was non-existent. The company was very unstable and several people were laid off.
bad,"Great leads available, awesome co-workers. Lacking in upper management and training is very low in the rankings. They need to learn how to spend more time with employees on a 1 on 1 bases."
bad,"My experience with this company was as a temp to hire employee (which is about the only way a low level employee can get hired by the company as they only direct hire higher level employees). The staffing agencies are hard to work for. (This was my first time working for an employment agency and not being directly hired). They charge excessive fees (like about 60 bucks for a drug test that they do with a drug test kit you can get at the drugstore for 20 bucks and since they probably buy them in bulk they are probably making a huge profit with just the drug test charges alone).Then the staffing agencies try to get you to use their ""global cash card"" instead of direct deposit so they can make money off of that too. They have t-shirts you can wear to work with their logo but you gotta pay for those too. It seems like the staffing agencies used by the company are extremely greedy and do what ever they can to make money off of low level hard working people trying to make a living. It was NO fun getting paid and then having fees deducted from my paycheck that went to the staffing agency. The company should cover those charges in their contract instead of placing the burden on the temp employees it uses. As a temp employee you have no direct hiring manager or human resources department to go to with questions or concerns. You have to deal with the staffing agency and they have their own agenda which is to make money off of you. It is better in my opinion to be direct hired and get paid for working rather than feeling like you are paying a staffing agency to be employed. "
bad,"fact paced"
bad,Ingraved Credit card plastics with all the necessary account information.
bad,Review credit card transactions for fraud.  Process ACH transactions.
bad,"The senior management team is all sales people so they practice the culture of churn and burn employees. The customer is not important to them, they say they are but do not practice what they preach. Example: They are not meeting the budget so they make up another fee and start charging their customers."
bad,Department Loyalty of TSYS
bad,"Follow rules, help customers, banking company different hours work with different types if customers"
bad,"More stressful than you would think and when you need to escalate a call, nobody ever answers and customers would continue to call back to back with no resolutions. If you have family emergencies., it could cost you your job. HR stated that once my situation at home resolved I could come back, but in the paperwork they put down as do not rehire. Managers are fake and they don’t really help. Strict for no reason. They set you up for failure on your calls. There’s always something new done wrong on each call. Breaks will change on you while you’re working."
bad,"The only great thing about TSYS are the benefits. They provide great health, vision, and dental insurance. The copays are low, as well as for cost of medicine. They offer a 401k as well. "
bad,"TSYS has a bad work life balance when it come to their managers. They hire your for a regular40- 50 work week but expect you to always carry your work cell phone and to answer at all times of night and early mornings and even on your vacation days. Also job security and trust is a big problem. Layoffs happen every year and the ""clique"" never gets touched but others who actually do their work are let go without a thought. Why hire people to lay them off not even a year later..."
bad,"I took the job as an entry level position to ""get my foot in the door,"" so to speak.  The economic crash of 2007- 2008 was in effect, and my job was to contact customers whose retail store credit card balances had become past due.  There were very few ""good days"", as people would tell you that they were not concerned with paying their bill, as they were trying to make ends meet by concentrating on feeding and sheltering their families - again, very depressing work for very little pay."
bad,"Poor management, unhealthy work environment, micro management, unhappy employees, very unhealthy employee relations and hostile work environment, lack of required training, lack of team work"
bad,A majority of the support employees are incompetent and unable to complete basic tasks or answer simple questions. This results in unnecessary escalations and unhappy clients. Constant misrepresentation of facts by the sales representatives do not set a realistic expectation for the clients. Turnover is high across all departments resulting in lazy and complacent tenured employees with no accountability due to a lack of discipline from the management teams.
bad,I worked there two separate times and each ines I found myself being overworked and under appreciated with absolutely no respect for the balance needed for my personal life.
bad,"Leads treatment of reps was that of principal to student. Socially harsh workplace. Coworkers(ghetto). VAC, PTO, & Float days great. Weird scheduling."
bad,This is a terrible company that promises their customers everything and then will ignore them. Once they have your money they dont care. They also lie to their emplyees promising bonuses and all kinds of support yet give you the most medicore training and expect you to do the rest. I can't stress enough how terrible this company is both to work for and to do business with
bad,Não pagavam em dia os pagamentos e sempre faziam cobranças que não era do projetos.
bad,This job very stressful. The training was not good enough to perform your job well.
bad,The culture is a little retro compared to current market. Most enjoyable part is the ability to work directly with the clients and board members. The typical day is constant motion.
bad,TSYS is a legacy COBOL back-end processing financial application (Credit Card processing).  Front end done by clients with interface to back end processes.  Mid level management all came from within.
bad,"The management is not very professional, the company has a way with making the job very confusing. all jobs have different task on the job that may contain multi tasking but the jobs are turning into a self inflicting oriented place. the management is to busy to assist with supervisor required items where is needed. certain situations cannot can be completed by regular customer service rep and there is not enough help in management. In need of the better management the staff is needing better help to complete the overall goal with the company. The job is requiring too much over time where it has started to affect outside life at tsys."
bad,The building and call center I was in are in poor condition. There were not always enough chairs to sit in at our desks and there were not always enough computers working for us to do our job. Overtime was mandatory and lunches were only 30 minutes. My department was open 24/7/365 so I did have to work on holidays and at night. We had to cube share. We were constantly being moved from cube to cube. Turn-over rate is very high. Employees in my department with more than a year's worth of experience were rare.
bad,A typical workday consists of reviewing calls for quality assurance and scoring them based on policy. I have learned so much coming from taking incoming calls from the customer to reviewing then from a quality perspective. It has allowed me to see what a big impact we have and can make on the customer. It is always important to show sincere empathy based on the circumstance of the customer and make sure to resolve the call on the first time. Although Total Systems is not the company they are calling however we are the voice of the client and we want to make a good impression. The hardest part is putting in hard work and dedication and not feeling appreciated. I enjoy working with my coworkers around me. We help one another to get through the day.
bad,"As part of the TransFirst side of an acquisition by Tsys I was subjected to a strong culture of old-timers and always felt like an outsider.  Direction and support from management was poor. Training very lacking. Expectations were unclear.  Department head not open to changes and process improvements, Very complacent and uninspiring.  My issues with this job were directly related to my manager and his lack of skillful leadership."
bad,"Good company, but not fast to changes. Some divisions are good to work with some need improvement. Co, may go through lot of changes with new CIO, hence .."
bad,"No progression. Low wage. High turn over. Who you know, not what you know. Unprofessional."
bad,TransFirst has a lot of potential but they do not value their managers.  Everything is on fire and the requirements change by the minute.  There is no work life balance and you pretty much have a start time with no end time.  They have good intentions but cannot think ahead to make things easier.
bad,"8 hour workday with up to a 1 hour lunch (off the clock)."
bad,Work for over 13 years and was overlooked for several advancements.  Local management staff was sub par.   It was a you look out for me and I look out for you enviroment.  Non-quailfied people was being promoted vs. The hard working qualified people.
bad,"I enjoyed my 12 years there, but was always dismayed by management. Too much of the good 'ole boy network, and people in supervisory positions that should never been given that responsibility."
bad,This company has major turn around rate because of management and dealing with other employees. Typical cube life working with a lot of women. I wouldn’t dare recommend this place.
bad,"Perpective merger with Global Payments is already causing plans to cut $300 Millions in the next 3 years.  That means even more red tapes, project delays, corner cutting, loss of talented professionals. The only resources remaining staying will be those unable to find a better job elsewhere due to their lack of knowledge."
bad,The financial service industry is very challenging!  The nature of financial institutions merging and moving from and thru contractual agreements is very demanding and it takes a toll on the balance between work and family life.  For that reason turn over is very high and job security is very low.
bad,I have been working here for almost a year and the pay and benefits are good but the overall job itself is stressful! If any situation comes up with family or kids and you have to leave or call out you get written up! If you’re in the hospital and have to miss 8 hours you get written up! You have to bid for vacation days so if there’s a day or few days that you’re really needing off more than likely you WON’T get them. The supervisors are okay if you’re one of their favorites. The call flow is out of control back to back. It’s extremely hard to get your schedule changed especially if you don’t get off til 12am. I wouldn’t recommend this job AT ALL!
bad,"Worked there for 10+ years, and was very content.  Was moved to a new manager who was very dictatorial in his ways.  He wanted me to change my career path to fit his agenda and I did not agree. Found out later that I did not fit into his ""old boys club""  , so I was ousted as soon as he got a chance."
bad,I would recommend only if you recently graduated from college and you needed work experience this would be a good start.
bad,"Work ethic is poor and team is not collaborative, The management is not supportive on critical issues and their treatment of employees is ridiculous. The work environment is not encouraging as well."
bad,"If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all. From a typical day to interaction with peers and management to the direction of the company, everything at TSYS is lacking."
bad,"While the TSYS culture has evolved into one I no longer recognize, they were good to me."
bad,"Everyday work was on the phone speaking with people , In enjoyed, learning new bank policies and how to operated a new system, management was ok , I feel that they could have been more outgoing and seeing peoples needs, working place was ok, did not like that we could not have any photos of our family on the desk nor could we have anything else, was stuck in a box for the time of work, the hardest part of the job was not getting help when needed, the most enjoyable part of the job was speaking with people everyday from different worlds and different states, also make sure they were please with the work I was doing for them."
bad,Consistent but very political and rude management while I was there. An unclear business motive with ownership changes and a seemingly chasing-the-big-dog-of-the-industry approach and mindset. Management was consistently poor or new amongst multiple departments. Politically engaged; family hiring family hidden and kept secretive as much as possible. Free food for special occasions and casual on Fridays only.
bad,"Teams operate in silos and feel compelled to point fingers and place blame on other teams rather than on accomplishing the common goal. Co-workers on my immediate teams were great, but it was evident that maintaining positivity and motivation in this environment was difficult."
bad,The work environment could be a lot better. Management needs to build a relationship with the employess
bad,"Do not accept third shift. No matter what they tell you, you are going to be stuck. They will even advice for you to get a new job before they actually try to switch your shifts. They'll always offer a shift to the new class that knows less than you before they offer it to someone that would be more beneficial."
bad,"Since TSYS merged with Central Payment, there is lack of leadership, support, and customer relations. I feel like a man without a country. The only reason to stay, is to make sure my existing clients are taken care of properly."
bad,Organization is often times changing constantly. Leadership and employee turnover was constant. Opportunities limited unless you are a technical programmer.
bad,"TSYS is not the best place to work but it is a good way to get the call center experience for the other jobs that require call center experience. TSYS care more about money than they do their employees. If you have the flu, very sick or have a family member pass they are more worried about if you are going to be able to come to work. I have had three promotions in my department and I have not got one raise from the promotions. You can not use PDO for a doctors appointment, etc. unless it is two weeks in advance. Management is not that great and in some departments they do not train to the way you are suppose to be trained."
bad,"I work in telesales in Aurora.  I like my mgr's & coworkers.  I wouldn't say it's my dream job - but it's not terrible either.  Lots to learn (and the training is great).  HR/management over promised on the realistic compensation in the first year.  You've got a small percentage of the team receiving the majority of the leads.  First year employees will be lucky to make $45k (and that's the peak performers) - many won't clear $40k.  The pay is entry level - but the performance expectations are definitely mid-lvl sales.  "
bad,"-Unfair call center system"
bad,"You must embrace long drive times and be prepared to deal with a lot of day to day customer service issues."
bad,Love the company hate the fraud department. too many rules that make employees feel like you are in grade school opposed to employee. It is overly stressful for the pay.
bad,Over all a good company but some mangers like to push you out the door and seniority and dedication does not even seem to matter. No training. Self traned.
bad,"TSYS was a job I landed after I graduated from college. It was a starter job. The money was ok. When I got there it just open in the McDonough area, so it was still nice."
bad,This job was definitely a pain. Training classes were a waste of time because I learned more on the floor than in the training class. Nobody got along
bad,Califico a esta empresa como una de las mejores en el desarrollo de la tecnologia de los sistemas de informacion
bad,TSYS is a good company to work but the pay is not enough for someone who  has over 15 years of customer service experience versus someone who has less. The opportunity for growth and advancement was not there as well which is why I would to seek other employment opportunities.
bad,Grat job friendly managers were cool. Hours were great one day out of week 12 to 9 . But morning job 40 hours a week. I enjoyed them they had to close the office up on where I was working at.
good,Management shows favoritism within the company when it comes to advancement opportunities.they have quality control people that listen in on your calls and they all grade differently than one another. what one would accept the other would not. information is not communicated from management to the team effectively.
good,Bottom of the food chain. The benefits were okay but the call center portion gets treated like the bottom of the food chain. Not paid enough for everything that has to be done.
good,No encouragement.  The only rewards for doing a job well done and working 60-80 hours a week was you weren't the one fired this week.  Management rules by fear.
good,"It's a call center job even though they use other ""terminologies"".I'd only advise you this role for very short term as you have the stress and responsibility of a job which pays twice this. American Business hours can become difficult on a long run (unsociable hours). A lot of things happens on the background, for instance, not everybody is invited for the Christmas party or can use the volunteering hours.."
good,the management  is poor it seems like internal promotion was based on likeability and not the actual skills of the employee. if you do fall ill or require a day off for family matter it will be in your best interest to start searching for a new job. you will be offered a lot of support but you wont actually get any. Processes change so quickly that  once you learn the latest its already been changed.  A typical day will see poor employees being praised as they are well liked by management for being suckups and employees who try hard and do the job well being looked down on as they dont take criticism well from management with little to no experience in the job role and are 9 times  out of  ten wrong.
good,"As a Fraud Analyst, you are paid barely anything. They expect more and more work from you with little compensation and the inability to do such things. "
good,"TSYS as a company has a great culture but the Corporate Ridge location does not adhere. They follow their own rules and so called culture which has nothing to do with employees. The location has a team of old guard leadership that walks around berating other leaders and agents. They have fake smiles and have clicks. They promote friends and together bring the location down as a whole. Current leadership is truly poor.  Corrupt in their practices. The lack of leadership training is evident in the performance of the location. A very high turn rate because the current atmosphere is toxic. Most new hires leave within a few months of being hired. Those that want to do well have their hands tied if not willing to kiss up to the current vanguard. Development opportunities are a joke. "
good,kiss butt to move up. If you are good at that it doesn't matter if yo don't know anything about the job. The pay sucks;they keep adding more and more stuff the pay never does up. They dont care if your sick. Dont get on escalations in inbound. If anything goes wrong they blame you. They will throw you under the bus!!! They have a manager on the floor now that deliberately tries to get ppl fired. If you dont have a backbone this is not a work environment. Too many attitudes from management cause they don't know how to do their jobs.if they have anything you can't participate if they have calls holding so you never get to enjoy anything very low morale. I wish they would fire everybody in inbound leadership and start over.
good,"Easy application process (virtual interview)"
good,"I have been here 2 years & received one 20 cent raise in that time, I have had 4 different managers & currently don't have one that is on several different write ups at once. The call center is a joke, but if you can get out of the call center, its smooth sailing & a great company to work for..."
good,"I think it is a great place to work, but the pay can be much better as well as management. I would love to advance in this company to further my career but I am afraid that I will be held back without being given the opportunity."
good,Coming into one position and trying to transfer to another is hard. Company seems to go out and hire someone from a temp agency instead of hiring from within. Co-workers are the best part of the job and only reason to keep coming back along with pay day and health benefits. Hardest part of the job is having to take abuse from customers and not being treated as a human being with a brain. Don't plan a vacation ahead of time because you may not get the time off .
good,The current state of change is constant while new technologies are being tested for acceptance.  The culture within the company has been through an overhaul and is not as collaborative as it used to be.
good,This company has been in business for over 30 years.  The company offers nice benefits. The company has clients across the globe in the payment industry.
good,Now just a place to work. People held value at one time. Now all is based on the bottom line. Disrespect across the board. Input not valued. Not recommended
good,The working hours are horrid and not lifestyle friendly. It is also difficult to book a holiday or a day off when needed. Majority or management staff were rude and unwelcoming.
good,"customer service answering the phones "
good,Good place to tart your first office job. Management rude. No real career progression. High turnover rate. Customers can be extremely rude. Wouldnt recommend to shy people.
good,"Not bad if you want to live in the ""Buckle of the Bible Belt."""
good,"There is little to no communication between the two major call center locations, and it often seems that we are working for two completely different companies. The client that I service will often send things out to their customers and make major changes without ever warning us (CSR frontline) until we get a slew of calls and ask for guidance. Then they’ll hobble together a very unhelpful training flash. "
good,"The actual company of TSYS is not a bad place. State farm within TSYS is horrible to work for, most of management does not care about the associates. I had one of the worst managers there. They do not care if your child is ill, or you are ill. They do not accept doctor's notes, and don't go out and have surgery and almost die, they won't check on you or send you even a get well card."
good,"you will not advance at this place. You cannot get sick. You can't get an extra bathroom break everything counts against you. You must be seated pretty much all day. The leadership is he say she say, not looking at your skills. It feels like elementary school there."
good,call center with high employee turnover and lack of training. Training was given after you encountered problems with the costumers. The leads weren't great.
good,"I understand it's a numbers game when working in Sales, but to have a upper management individual trash their employees in front of their peers..unacceptable!"
good,"Working at TSYS teaches you productivity and professionalism. Unfortunately, the recruiting department was laid off causing separation.  Weekly meetings and reports help to keep one in the loop of the recruiting and hiring strategies."
good,"Central Payment was very competitive in the sense that they gave you basic training, and when working in the real world going door to door to business's you weren't always given the tools the be successful. Your success usually came from that 1:20 business interested which you'd end up only making 200-300 per sale."
good,"Company has positions that will allow you to work with little to no opportunity to advance. There are positions that will allow you to do a trial run, but without pay."
good,Management sees employees as numbers who are interchangeable while giving no regard to the employees skills and advancement desires. Management has an expectation of complete obedience and is not open to hearing opposing opinions. There is more focus on statistics that can be presented to show positive pictures to the board than they are in actually producing a quality product. This leads to a demoralizing atmosphere for employees.
good,"Not a job for people with families, the money is inconsistent and unreliable. The commission draw is only $8 / hr. Just enough for gas and a value sandwich for lunch. highly stressful. I did however land a deal for around $20k and bounce out of there. If I had to do it all over again, I would keep looking."
good,"A typical day at work is very busy,you can lean a lot from the customer you interact with,then management can be better they don't really CARE about your family they just want you there ready to work the hardest part about the job is changing schedules every four months when you get adjusted to one schedule you have to bid on another one the most enjoyable part of my job is the customers and co-workers even thought the call volume is crazy at time its really fun to interact with different types of personalities on a daily bases."
good,"I help clients redeem their points with their credit/debit cards for different gift cards, merchandise or even travel."
good,"this was a fairly good company to work for until one day i told them my mother was dying and they said that they could no hold my job so i walk out i file for unemployent and was denied was i was told that i abun my job, so not so good company not good for peoples that have familys"
good,"Once tsys partnered with central payment. Everyones job was at risk of being outsourced. First the departmwnt began to down size. Once they winged out most of the existing employees,tsys atarting laying off an didnt keep management in the loop of things."
good,The company is very different now since a lot of outside leadership has come in. The morale is low and the environment is stressful. Constant worry of if/when one will be laid off
good,The upper management and 'old boys club' that direct this company makes it difficult to give a positive review for. They are unwilling to adapt and make changes when employees provide feedback to better the company to move forward with the changing world. Miss management will be the downfall of this company.
good,"a typical work day would be having a meeting about a meeting and management telling you what you are doing wrong, instead of all the positive things that you are doing or have done. It was a high stressed atmosphere that after a while became a toxic environment. "
good,I've been working at TSYS for almost 3 and it's not the best job if your in school and working or plan on going to school. The schedule is NOT flexible. There is NO work-life balance AT ALL because your here basically all day long. The management isn't all that good. The job is mentally tiring dealing with rude people and having to talk 24/7 non stop with such a high call volume. You work mandatory overtime which is 9-10 hrs a day with a 30 min lunch. You have so many other things that apply to this job that is the most annoying thing ever but ill let that be a surprise for you guys. Join the team if you wish. To each its own.
good,"I worked nightshift and it was comfortable.  I like working the nightshift we had lots of pot lucks which made the evening past by faster.  The environment was friendly and the staff helpful among each other,"
good,I would rather not disclose this information. It is not my place to bash  or discredit a company that I work for. I am preferring not to speak on my experiences because everyone's experience is not the same.
good,"I got hired on through a Temp service and let's just say; shortly after training I was ready to quit. Your schedule is SET for 3 months at a time, meaning if you start a shift from 2pm-11pm off only on Mondays & Wednesday.. that is EXACTLY what you will work for 3 months. Its almost impossible to switch or take time off. And depending what department you work in you can take very irate calls and have people curse you out for no reason"
good,"TSYS was formerly an organization with a strong family culture and it is currently undergoing numerous changes. New leadership, new culture and new people. They will hopefully be ok once they settle down and figure out what the new culture looks like."
good,"I've learned that no task is too small and that there is always a way to assist someone in need,solve their problem, or make their day better.I have also learned that you never stop learning."
good,"I was hired in as a Business Systems Specialist in the Alpharetta office. 4 weeks in, my hiring director and several of my team members were laid off. With minimal training, I was expected to take on the work of 3 positions and succeed. Management was not effective and training was constantly cancelled. My team was 'non existent' and not supportive. The salary and benefits are outstanding! But the workplace is designed for resources to fail. Maybe a different department or even a different team would have made a difference. But my experience was not a good one."
good,"standard archaic company stuck on the idea that being present is being productive. When I was getting hired, was going to be at 50 or so an hour contract, but immediately brought me to full permanent and cut me down to 85k per year."
good,After a while I didn't like there compensation plan and found that it wouldn't support my life style. Overall the pressure to generate all my lead on my own became time and revenue consuming.
good,Answered incoming calls throughout entire shift. Learned different credit card rules and regulations. Attended sevral customer service classes.
good,"More on your own pace kinda work. Basically, work all day. Talking with customers about what we can offer."
good,"Working here definitely helped improve my professional skills ie; Grammar and etiquette. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with, and spending time boosting moral."
good,"Pathetic how they find people to be fundgible but squeel about the secret sauce.  Hypocritical at best."
good,fast paced work environment have to have the skills to keep up. I would recommend to anyone that has strong customer service skills. Calls were non stop majority of the time.
good,"The focus of the leadership is not on integration but simply acquiring other organizations. It makes work considerably harder as more manual processes are introduced, lack of coordination between key areas is evident, technology and features/functionaliuty differ greatly depending upon which building youre in and no area functions similarly to their counterparts elsewhere. KPIs are not measured and you simply wont be able to provide a good customer experience let alone a consistent one if you are required to work across platforms due to unnecessary complexity due to lack of focused integration."
good,"This position wasn't difficult. In fact, it was much the same thing day in and day out. You answer the phones with a canned greeting, go through transactions with the client, and then go about taking your next call. We had ""mandatory overtime"" in the amount of 45 hours a week and if you happened to get sick, even with a doctors note you would get a write up. By the time I had been there a year, I was running out of days off. You could have, I think, 4 days off of sick leave before being fired (per 6 months). Ultimately, my reason for leaving was that I'd put in a time off request 6 months in advance, which had been approved, but upon coming back I came to learn that my direct manager had neglected to put in one of the days. It came up as a no call/no show and I was threatened with termination. It wasn't unheard of for people to come in and vomit at their desk when they were sick, and anyone who works in a call center knows how easy it is for illnesses to spread in such close quarters with only A/C to circulate the air. We also weren't allowed to decorate our spaces at all, unless you were a manager of some sort."
good,"The clients you service constantly change policy, but they will give you time to review if needed. But only if the call volumes are almost dead. You have to suck up to managers to move up. They have so many managers that sit around and do nothing while  call volumes are high. They are not flexible with your schedule if you do not have children. If you do have children they are a little bit better with flexible scheduling but only if you are one of the people who suck up to managers. They will make you do mandatory OT. Give you time off but still it will hurt adherence. Graded constantly on calls and have a risk of getting fired every month if you do not pass their strict requirements."
good,"The hours they do make the place very hard to have a social life, the people who work there are okay and they hold regular parties for staff, learned a fair bit in the role but management aren't as helpful as they could be"
good,"Not all employees treated the same, poor buildfing dealing with mold, not really safe if a fire or shooting breaks out consider yourself dead. Poor planning and behind on work due to lack of productivity and no teamwork between coworkers, more like enemies that will send you to HR for stupid things like talking a little to loud or something. Due to being behind on work deadlines causes having to work weekends, longer hours and holidays."
good,Too much swapping around management. A lot of miscommunication. Stressful environment. I  enjoy most of the people I  work with just not the environment that comes along with it
good,this is a good job place to work at if you like complaints when agents make errors. they have a high turnover rate and they can be very nice to you if they like you. do not recommend if you like your home life because they provide very unsociable hours to work.
good,"Seeking new opportunities to advance and use my current degree in the workforce. Very physical labor involving bending, lifting, stretching and long periods of walking and standing. Little room for advancement."
good,"there is poor management within the company, and no progression, the hr dept have no loosened ropes and makes many staff leave as the place isn't the friendliest place I've worked before there are some pro, the agents and some of the staff are lovely and make the days bearable but the work it self isn't bad, its quite an easy job."
good,"My current manager is great to work for and the work from home flexibility is a plus.  Depending on the area you work for opinions may vary, but overall I think many enjoy what TSYS has to offer"
good,"There are many good people here, and there are bad people here. It is like any other place of employment which has it's ups and downs. I will say I have learned a lot from my time with this company but with time comes change. I am all for change but this is in the wrong direction I am afraid."
good,"The business plan for TSYS / TransFirst is weak.  Pretty much for outside reps its go cold call - good luck.  Very weak at obtaining partners in either the Financial Institution or otherwise and if they do seem to go to inside sales groups bypassing outside reps.  If you have a connection to Omaha ( home base ) then you will experience favoritism - the word nepotism is a good description with whole families sometimes being hired ."
good,"I love my position and the clients I service, but upper management has start make major changes with software, company culture, restructures, and moral is down.  A typical day is open projects, review any new client information, daily meetings, and any other things that may come up."
good,great start but the business is not all that they are underpaid and overworked for the last year ive been working 7 hours of mandatory overtime with a 30 min lunch break they are hard to move up they want to keep you in the call center for business needs
good,TSYS is much like other large corporations.  Innovation and improvement are bogged down by middle managers.  Those who say yes to everything and don't question things that are wrong will do well in this environment.
good,"It's a job, nothing more and nothing less.  There's little incentive to do well as the promotions are based off of favoritism."
good,"Shoe Show was my first job. I learned a lot about time management, dealing with different personalities and the experiences at Show Shoe taught me how to be a humble individual."
good,"-workload changed daily based on that days problems; even though variety is good, it made it difficult to get day to day tasks completed"
good,"i learned to handle the clients and satisfaction way. "
good,"management & management choices makes it very stressful, as an employee you have little to no say so.."
good,A typical day at TSYS is fairly slow and methodical. I did not feel overly challenged in my role. Management was overbearing and seem divested in employee concerns. Co-workers seemed beat-down and despondent. My role had many difficult facets that were out of my control. I did not enjoy working at TSYS-Omaha.
good,Started by logging on to computer. Taking care of each customers needs.
good,TSYS can have been a great company but could not due to poor HR practices and poor management
good,dont like the shifts and working weekend without a choice and very hard to book holidays
good,It was an experience within the credit card processing business.
good,. Growth depends of manager favour not on performance
good,"Tsys is a great company overall but corporate ridge is not as great as it claim to be. High turnover rate, low motivation, toxic environment, horrible leadership. Agents are often harassed by clients, managers and other agents. New hire get during training or when they step on the floor. The system we use is outdated and hasn't been updated in years. You get written up when you fail adherence or quailty even if its not your fault. I feel worthless and unappreciated everyday i come to work. Management should build up agents not tear them down. Agents should be able to express themselves when talking to customers instead of reading scripts like a robot. I never worked with a bunch of despicable people i my life! Making fun of other agents after getting off a stressful call which is beyond distasteful and unprofessional. The only positive things is the pay, benefits, job itself and the hours. The job itself is interesting but the environment is too negative. There a a few people that do care and are willing to help but overall im very disapointed and feel like i have no purpose and i will be looking elsewhere. For anyone that wants to apply at corporate ridge go right ahead but please know what you getting yourself into."
good,"TSYS is an industry leader who is well liked by their clients and shareholders.  As a long term employee I would say the job security and good morale of the company's first 25 years has shifted toward corporate profits and shareholder value - at the expense of the employees."
good,"Typical day is fast paced and can be stressful.  Big corporation atmosphere makes it difficult to make an impact.  Management is fair and very focused self promotion."
good,"I advanced within a year of being there. I was disappointed when I came back from maternity leave that my position was dissolved and I was placed in a CSR role again. Soon after they randomly switched me to another bank. I loved my manager in my original CSR role. In my advanced role, my manager was horrible and also in the new bank. The biggest plus to working at TSYS are the vacation time (all given to you up front at the beginning of the year) and great insurance options. The pay increases are minimal. I asked for a raise when I was placed in my advance role and was denied. I was being held more responsible and coaching people at the same pay rate. Overall, if you’re just trying to get by, and have a cake/repetitive job, this will work great for you. If you want to advance and have an opportunity to grow, this is not the place for you."
good,It is a huge company. Wish they would invest into their lower level employees more. Without the lower level would they company be as big as they are..
good,"the trainers are actually really amazing and do all they can to help when people get out onto the floor, there isn't much preparation in regards to getting people ready to deal with those difficult customers."
good,"Great company to work for my first three years, then acquisitions made direction and internal support challenging as a remote employee."
good,A typical day at work for a customer service representative is spending your shift sitting at a desk taking back to back calls. There are two fifteen minute breaks and a lunch break that you may be asked to work thru due to call volume. Lunch is typically catered when you are asked to work thru it. People are friendly and getting to know your co-workers is encouraged.
good,"Typical day is taking calls from merchants about there account and there fees they call for a rate review and to sometimes close there account/accounts."
good,The company has gone through some organizational changes in the past couple years.  The job security that once existed is no longer there.  The same can be said for advancement opportunities.
good,I was initially excited about the position even with the disappointing news about the commission only pay scale.  The training materials and daily/weekly conference call sessions were interesting and grew my knowledge of the industry.  I was not impressed however with the guidance from supervising agents and did not talk to my director for a year.  Not a good choice for a small community either.
good,Working here gave me the opportunity to sharpen my skills in observing active accounts dealing with fraudulent transactions.  The supervisor then wasn't patient with teaching which is the reason why i decided to leave
good,"The main facility is located in Georgia, and most of the employees here have been laid off. Prospects for advancement do not exist in this facility and most employees left are located with another sister company."
good,"This job is EXTREMELY stressful, and offers almost NO advancement. They have people coming in the door making more than people who been there for years, which makes the people on escalations almost resent the new hires. The training is not adequate and very short, it should be longer, especially since we deal with money. Bay 3 is the worst Bay to work in. You arrive to work and get sent to another Bay because they have NO seats available. They basically want you to make no friends and resent you if you do. Management is a joke, my supervisor was actually okay, but the others do not care about you. You are just a robot to them. You are also required to work a lot, and they change your schedule without notifying you. Which means you have a chance of arriving to work but will not be able to clock in because they never informed you they changed the schedule. The banks always, always, always change their policies, so that's a mess to keep up with. The escalations group has a group chat where they talk about all the regular workers. They laugh when we reach out for help, so don't think they are your  friend.  NOT all of them do it, but most of them do. You most of the time will only get a 30 minute lunch and that's even when you are required to work that extra hour every single day. Sometimes it's more than an extra hour you have to work. Most of the CH's are rude, and curse you out. They will not work around your college schedule but they need people. Which makes NO sense at all."
good,"Worst manager I ever had to work for and because of this team members did not get along. Made for a very difficult place to work. I did enjoy the actual work, learned some new technologies"
good,Good start for freshers who want to learn product development and suppprt lifecycle. Flexible timings. On-site oppertunity. Handsome package. Lots of fun filled activities.
good,"Pros:"
good,"just another call center job. high turn over rate, but all vacation time for the year is given up front. it would be better if the pay was more. Also, not alot of growth."
good,"Nice atmosphere overall, workplace was well maintained and the tech used was modern. In-bound call center, 70% was dealing with technical problems for credit card based transactions, I like that a lot. About 30% of the time was fielding calls about the monthly charges for merchants to use credit cards. The banks set the rates, the merchants sign the contract and we (TransFirst) manage the transaction flow. So we get the calls when the banks hit merchants with various surcharges which all go to the bank in question. Yet the credit processor gets the call and takes the verbal beating. You will need a thick skin for this duty."
good,"Customer service. Helping customers with their banking queries/requests"
good,"Very little to no advancement offered. Leadership does not advance employees to match current job responsibilities. Great people, pay is not meeting current industry standards."
good,"It's always a busy day at work."
good,"Fun and loving work place "
good,"typical day includes taking calls in a cube for several hours a day."
good,"TSYS is a US based Credit Card processor.  Home office is in Omaha, NE and the satellite office in Louisville was closed after about 3 years.  Inside Sales position was unstable and very ""churn and burn""."
good,It is a satisfactory job for someone who is very assertive and able to handle many different personalities. Of course it is collections so for the most part people will already answer or call either uneasy or upset about their bill especially with outbounds calls. You just have to be very skilled in calming an irate customer by also advising them on the policy.
good,"You are constantly busy, at all time. The biggest upside is the trainers and the pay. The trainers do as good a job as they can given the current position and status of the call center, however, the environment can feel hostile, like everyone is using you to get ahead in their positions."
good,"Learned a lot about credit card processing from beginning to end.  A typical sales cycle, what to look for and how to prevent fraud, how to remain positive during stressful times.  The most enjoyable part were the relationships I built with so many people, from merchants to co-workers, even those internal customers we worked with daily.  Lower level management was close by and involved on many levels usually knowing employees on a first name basis."
good,"These guys really put some bright people together, and the owners are just inspiring how they act, talk to you, and treat their company and employees. One of their directors is a tyrant, however, and made the nearly 2 hour commute I agreed to just unbearable withing a month, and I hung in there 9 months. My immediate boss had NO power, and neither him, or the director, taught me a THING. I only learned of a great overall process for account management by a company, but no training or advancement provided. The director of operations came from working at a correctional facility, I believe, or something to do with law enforcement, and seemed like he forgot that at Central Payments he was not a CO, and we were not to be treated like inmates. Rough time. Most of the rest of the staff were a fun, hardworking bunch, and the overall culture was one of frivolity mixed with hard work."
good,I work in an outbound call center so i take calls everyday about credit cards. I've learned about credit cards and how to give good customer service. Most enjoyable part of job is my co-workers we get along great.
good,I choose not to answer any questions concerning TSYS. Due to me still being a employee at this Company. The work is good but overall the management is Horrible.
good,"Nice staff, clean environment "
good,I was trained really well before being put on the floor! We had a nice month long training class which was really nice. Everyone made us feel welcome. The management were all really helpful however depending on the shift there was sometimes not a single manager on the floor! There was constant mandatory overtime which really conflicted with a social life outside of the work. My campaign was awful!! Not TSYS fault. Just the campaigns fault. It was a really relaxed atmosphere and a great place to work. The moral was normally pretty high and the management always had little celebrations going on. I would recommend TSYS! Sadly only paid min.wage but did have great benefits. I still think it should be min. $16/hour.
good,TSYS was a terrific company to work for until about 3 years ago.  They have changed their culture and now seem to invest more in short term gains than sustained long term gains. They (as are many companies) outsourcing jobs to off-shore areas and reducing the U.S. work force.  They no longer care about their employees like they did for the over 30 years prior to the change.  It is very sad and I hope they get back to their previous culture of care and concern for their team members and clients that.  That culture was was made TSYS a great growth company with a culture of the heart.  Now it seems to be leaving the company very quickly.
good,Typical day with a lot of meetings.  Sometimes management needed to stay open for new ideas instead of the norm.  Give team members a chance to advance instead of staying in the same position for over two years.  Cut down on changes of scope for release planning.
good,"Daily work included working incoming credit card disputes and responded to merchant response involving merchant disputes. Worked chargeback on the Visa resolve online to submit chargeback, arbitrations and compliances."
good,"For the most part I have enjoyed my time working for this company which started out being a great place to work, that offered competitive wages and really good benefits, so much so I was recommending to all who were looking for work. However times have changed and unfortunately it's slowly becoming a typical call center environment."
good,"*Stressful"
good,The exciting thing about working here is the continued growth of the business and the opportunities every new clients provide. The product offering is evolving and is setup for long-term success.
good,A typical day at TSYS was spent coaching and mentoring the team. However nobody encourage or mentor the mentee. If coaching and mentoring was not involved then the rest of the day was spent taking calls or running reports. Management that I had didn't invest in their employees. There was no room for advancement unless somebody left. You didn't hear anything about any upcoming jobs that was within the organization. The enjoyable part of my job was helping the customer and being able to help shape and mold other people under me
good,I was a part time employee at TSYS years ago.  I left to explore better opportunities at another company. I was also looking for full time employment.
good,"Work culture is conducive to learning and development. Workforce and personnel are great team members. Environment is competitive, challenging and motivating."
good,"6 week training given, first two weeks are nice and then made to feel like you have to get through everything before the rest of the weeks are over (The last 2 weeks you're already on the phones taking calls)"
good,"Good working enviornment"
good,"Caption says it all. The manager I had when I was there used to be a supervisor or something at a prison - -literally, and could not leave that culture there, and treated his staff like convicts in shackles, and yelled a lot. No training. Other than that, the two co owners were cool, and I made some cool friends there too."
good,Outsourced to India after 14 years of service. Enjoyed working with the Boise team.  Enjoyed the work/life balance an the work flexibility provided by the company.
good,"Great company but always downsizing. Management is overrated, the CEO doesn't have the skills to close deals, but the products and the credit card platform is very competitive."
good,"My job is on a day to day base, it's subject to a change an day. I attempt to do my best with every task that is presented to me. I analysis calls and provided feed back to ensure the customer service agents are displaying a great customer experience and interact with clients."
good,"TSYS is a good placed to work, just not for me."
good,"I am a former TransFirst employee that was recently acquired by TSYS, The transition has been mostly seamless with a few minor challenges. TSYS made strong business decisions in retaining performing managers and sales staff in the merchant division. However, compensation changes and lack of a progressive culture are recent challenges that prompted me to search for other career opportunities."
good,The coworker are awesome. The management however leaves something to be desired. They have tendency to hiring outside of the company instead of promoting internally.
good,TSYS has a very diverse company of employees and is currently going through major changes within the organization. Those who helped build the company are being let go just short of retirement.
good,"Good company, but currently downsizing the organization.  Just went through a massive reduction in force. Many great people have lost their jobs.  I am fortunate that I am still employed"
good,"Great company to work for, especially if you want to be your own boss. As a Business Consultant, you provide local merchants with services and information regarding credit card processing. It is a grind as an Independent Contractor and it is not for everybody. If you like to challenge yourself, and like to get better day; then this job is for you."
good,"This was a great company until very recently. Due to the acquisition of TransFirst, TSYS has forgotten their main mantra; ""People Come First""."
good,"A typical day usually depends on the service levels, if the service levels were slower the day was quite a breeze, on busy days things could get stressful. The hardest part of the job is the scripting, and everything that could get you a failed called. Management was ok."
good,"I've really enjoyed my years at TSYS.  However, I've been through four enterprise layoffs so it is stressful. I've invested too many years to be afraid of getting promoted or laid off."
good,"Workday can begin any time 6-9, although TSYS leadership leans toward the early crowd (at least one leader was observed watching the parking lot arrivals on a regular basis from their window, later coincidentally calling out said latecomer during a meeting). It is possible this is used when considering ratings/promotional opportunities."
good,es una empresa en la que el conocimiento de los integrantes de los diferentes tipos de equipos de trabajo es buena
good,"it's a credit card processing company and it's nice place to work."
good,"Good work-life balance for most departments."
good,TSYS has a good work environment and excellent benefits. The salary structure could be improved. Methodologies are hard to follow and inefficient. Prepare to be overloaded with work at times.
good,Overall it has been an ok place to work. Advancement is hard to come by and pay increase is limited.
good,I ran an Embossing machine machine that produced credit cards.
good,I was not happy here so i left here for more money. This was the worst company I ever worked for.
good,"It was ok, but not great! to many people running around, without really speaking or acknowledging you. extremely nerve wrecking. People do not appreciate you at all."
good,Too many unanswered questions and uncertainty during this period of the merger.  It does appear that there is a culture shift and more changes are on the horizon.
good,It is a decent job if you like like jobs where you are by yourself. You have to have good customer service skills. It does have good benefits that you can receive with job.
good,This job was very ideal for me as a student looking for a part-time job. The working environment was very flexible to combine with my Uni workload and vice versa
good,"TSYS has changed a lot. TSYS has great people. Leadership is finally investing in training for business analyst. However, the company has been purchased by Global payments. NO ONE feels secure when it comes to their job."
good,"The work day is overloaded with phone calls, required overtime and with only a 30 minute break. Most of the supervisors just threw you to the wolves with no help. If you are just coming out of training then you should be able to at least ask a question without being looked"
good,"It's not a bad place to work but management is weak and human resources is even worse."
good,"Pay was not enough , managers were lazy acting does not want to take calls when customers ask to speak with supervisor they would just tell us what to tell the customer which it not apart of the call center customer service . Had to relocate due to client being temporarily removed. Will not want to work here again I hated it here but the only thing good they provided was great benefits, which distracts how awful the job is"
good,"Again 3 stars due to the type of people employed and the environment. They did not have set seating as far as cubicles, each day you had to rush to find a seat and they eventually made everyone turn their headsets they GAVE us at the beginning of training and zip tied them to the cubes and we all had to share. They would threaten termination if headsets were removed. Noise level was absurd and not because the reps would be on the phone they would be having outside conversations avoiding calls. Management was more worried about being friends with the reps versus managing them and holding accountable for short comings."
good,Tsys is a fast paced work environment. It can be stressful at times due to the high call volume but the knowledge gained is amazing. Management is amazon when you sit down and talk to them
good,"I would recommend TSYS to someone who is looking for consistent work with benefits and paid time off. However, there is not a lot of room for growth due to the amount of people working in entry level positions. You will often be told that there are opportunities available, and that they think you're the best fit for the job. I suspect this is to keep people there as long as possible since there is a very high turn over. I did manage to receive regular raises, but the company has since changed the policy to an annual raise, and the increase is not as good as it was before."
good,"Management was willing to help you learn the ropes.   The people are generally helpful when asking questions.  My team was spread across the entire state of Georgia, so it was somewhat difficult to feel like you were really part of a team.   I only saw my manager about once or twice a week, as he was constantly tele-commuteing."
good,"I only worked for TSYS for 18 months, but enjoyed my time while in their employ.  The only issue I had is they paid well below market value compared to similar jobs within the same industry.  Would have stayed with the company if they had paid a better."
good,Receiving incoming calls about credit accts is stressful. Calls come back to back with mostly negative comments about the client  and the customer service experience.  The hardest part of the job is meeting the requirements on every call. The most enjoyable part of the job is being complimented on a job well done from a customer for the performance of being served.
good,"After spending two years at the company, I discovered that I did not enjoy the IT field enough to work in any part of it. I am glad I did not waste my money on a graduate degree."
good,"Great company to work for in terms of work /life balance, compensation and benefits.  Must be prepared for the long haul, as advancement is not very quick.  Most areas are not very diverse and there seems to be a plan in place but there has been little visible motion behind it."
good,This is a great job to start out at if your into the clerical type of occupation. This job provides great benefits to any household and the atmosphere of the job is pretty fun too.
good,I worked in several roles at total systems solutions.  This was my first opportunity out of college.  The benefits and stock options were a great option.
good,"handling high volume calls"
good,entry level customer service for someone trying to get heir foot in the door in corporate America. TSYS is a overall good company. I would recommend to a fried
good,"TSYS is a good place to work. The staff was great as I learned the system, The instructors are good with taking the time to train you their products. They do offer raises maybe during the quarterly raises."
good,A typical work day would have a balance of working in the field and customer service. It's always rewarding to see a problem or an issue through to get the desired results with the customer.
good,Great people...horrible management..great benefits. Not really good with work/life balance unless you become salary instead of hourly. The pay is okay.
good,"But it wasn't. Dis jointed, fragmented leadership, unfocused work assignments. It had vast potential, but leadership was to short-sighted to look beyond the day after tomorrow."
good,"Mandatory Overtime with short lunch breaks. The pay is good and it is not too far off of the highway. TSYS does not accept doctor's excuses or emergency room documents for an absence, they will give you a point."
good,"Enjoyed the work and especially the innovation the teams were allowed to create. There was no ""stuck in the past"" culture here. Very much enjoyed the collaborative nature of the teams."
good,All companies could service their workers better as the workers service the clients. Working together is the key to being successful and satisfied for all
good,"I found that the most enjoyable part of my job was learning new skills. I continued to develop a foundation to providing outstanding customer service to our clients."
good,Resolving customer issues in the merchant machine business.  Ensuring on-time delivery of repaired equipment and selling replacement supplies.  Great people in the office to work with.
good,"A good company to work for, however, the time away from my family was not worth it to me. I learned a lot and appreciate my time at TSYS. It is a fast paced environment and a positive team culture."
good,"Worst patching management"
good,"Long days working at TSYS, lots of stress and sometimes not enough support or people to complete projects. Too many clients to be responsible for one person."
good,"I was able to apply my knowledge of sales, however the multi-level marketing approach was not viable for me int he long-term. I do value what I was able to accomplish at Central Payment while I was there."
good,"Good points and bad.  mostly good!    challenges like any job.  if you like a challenge, this job is for you.   you have to truly be a hunter to do well here."
good,"good company, especially if you want to get into the fraud sector as it teaches you how to spot different fraud trends. nice staff members and good office parties at christmas"
good,"Call center work isnt for everyone but if you dont mind it, it will be great for you. Everything is awesome except for the low pay. Ive learned alot about credit cards, how they work, and how to build credit."
good,"I've worked for TSYS for 12 years.  The first 9 years were fun and enjoyable.  The company had a family atmosphere and promoted within.  The last 3 years was a complete change in Work Atmosphere and Management.  "
good,This place is okay to work if you are in management maybe. I didn't too much care for it and left for better opportunities in the CSR world. I don't recommend!
good,"TSYS is a growing business, enjoying all time high stock prices after a series of acquisitions.   There are good opportunities, but the culture has become less employee centered in the last two years with the arrival of new people in most of the senior executive roles."
good,"While I worked hear, I had good moments and bad moments. My last manager was not very helping, and it seemed that the company was very biased. I however did love what I did and the people that I worked along side of."
good,I felt working at transfirst you were never appreciated for how hard you worked. I was an escalation rep who would take in and out bound calls plus the escalated issues that a csr could not handle including supervisor calls
good,Good Company and I enjoyed my tenure there.  Good professional working environment. Good lay out which makes it a good working atmosphere and easy to communicate with colleagues.
good,"A typical day at work was making door to door contacts. The hardest part of the job was finding the decision maker. I learned that every business I door knock already had someone they worked with. "
good,"I have done an excellent job while at TSYS.  Having received my Bachelors Degree in Business Administration from Columbus State University, I am ready to advance my career toward that degree."
good,Working with the company gave me good experience in my desired field.  I met some great people and formed good relationships.  It is a typical call center environment.
good,"Handles inbound and outbound calls on delinquent and/or over limit accounts with customers to reach a payment agreement. Initiates a plan of action to recover outstanding accounts to include various methods of payment such as, commitment to pay by mail, debit account, and Quick Remit. Identify accounts that need further investigation to locate customer and utilize information obtained from skip tracing material. Maintains accurate and complete records of all payment agreements and inquires. Must follow all client policies and procedures while consistently adhering to all Federal and State collection laws."
good,TSYS is a typical big company that pays only what it can to keep you long enough to get what they want out of you. You are completely replaceable. The benefits are pretty good.
good,"Working at TSYS has been both a curse and a blessing. The pay, for the area I live in, is phenominal. However, the hours are very long and working soley night shift, the benefits are not worth the mental stress that it causes. The management is scattered and unorganized. The follow through on employee complaints is terrible. That being said, the people there are wonderful. The atmosphere is, more often than not, laid back. I see these people more often than I see my own family that I live with. The supervisor I am under tries to make sure that his employees are taken care of and happy. They are very good at making sure that the families are taken care of as well. However, the stress from working such long hours does counteract the positivity of the atmosphere. If you are looking for great people and don't mind at least 13 hour workdays with minimal breaks and not being allowed to sit down, go for it. The benefits are good, better than most companies actually. But the stress that comes with the job makes those benefits minimal at best."
good,TSYS Card Tech is a good organisation and management is very helpful towards their employees. Good work life balance fro all the employees and flexibility
good,"TSYS Card tech is a good company. there is work life balance and good for noida people. Management is supportive towards your work."
good,"During my time at TSYS I have improved my organisation skills, meeting and exceeding targets.I was provided with a very informative and interesting training that prepared me well to fulfill my duties as a customer service adviser within the company."
good,"TSYS was a great place to work. They were constantly attempting to bring the departments together doing things such as games, fund raising and more.  I would definitely work there again."
good,Good work life balance.  Great pay if you are a top rep. It can be hard to get there.  Job is monotonous.   Some manager are good some are bad.  The culture isn't great.  The industry isn't very appealing.
good,"It has been  over 7 years since I have worked for this company.  At the time I was there,many departments were in cubicle settings, interaction with other departments difficult as they are compartmentalized.  Our entire department was relocated to a new location in SE Denver."
good,"I really dont have anything to say about the company ,it was a temp company.they did find me a job working at wainwright.i worked about 3 months and then found a more paying job."
good,Each day at work is a new challenge from setting personal and team goals in the call center. Work hand in hand with fellow leads and supervisors to improve call center numbers
good,"It's not a bad job, as long as you're willing to put yourself out there and you have a good work ethic. Depending on the dept you work in you might be busy which ensures you'll have a job. I've learned that it's not always about what you know, but who you know. My co-workers is what made the job enjoyable. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unprofessional people in the work environment, un-organization, and lack of training. Really can't specify anything enjoyable about this job."
good,Learned how to deal with conflicts and many opened windows at one time also multi- tasking between the computer and and telephone get challenging but its very thrill seeking
good,"Typical day is like any other day in the office. Come in do your work and there are no problems."
good,"A typical day at work is filled with laughter and excitement. not a dull moment ever spent at tsys."
good,"- Salary as per market standards"
good,"TSYS is a very good place to work and the benefits and compensation is above normal, but you feel like you can not go to anyone in HR to discuss a manager"
good,"Tsys is een leuk bedrijf om te werken. Het is een bedrijf waar je veel kan leren over verschillende administratieve werkzaamheden. Dit omdat het bedrijf Creditcards van de Rabobank onderhoud. Bij ons op de afdeling verwerken/onderzoeken wij reguliere transacties en fraude transacties. Dit is erg leuk om te doen, omdat elke case anders is. "
good,Interesting place to work management was always trying to find a way to bust morale. Work was stressful but i enjoyed my coworkers.
good,"Profitable company, growing and stable.  Most employees are fun and professional, working hard to do the right thing for the customer."
good,"Overall the company has an excellent benefit package.  The compensation doesn't meet with what other employers are paying. Customer service only pays 9.50/hr, collections & fraud 10.51/hr, It pays 14.50/hr the payscalle isnt up to par and upper management is so out of touch with what the call center reps expectations are."
good,"This was my first call center job. The compensation was very low, but I had the experience in meeting great people and learning a great deal for the positions in which I was placed in."
good,"it's a great place to work if you like high stress work places,the customers were not very friendly but you did make great friends in the process."
good,good place to work/must be flexible/24hrs call center/great management/hardest part is rotating schedule
good,Would prefer not to discuss further; looking for something more fulfilling than Customer Service.
good,"Really no direction you need to self assertive to much of a turnover of new employees. You need to be strong sales person to do that job."
good,"wonderful job, very high security. You deal with different clients on a daily basics."
good,Typical day would include client or internal meetings to discuss project plans. Review of processes and process improvements. Learned leadership and project management skills. Best part of the job is the team and relationships that are developed and evolved over time. Hardest part of the job would be a stressful work environment and high paced working conditions.
good,People are great and the experience was great.  I would go back if i found another position for this place
good,"perplexing, confusing, out of date standards loosely thrown together"
good,Loved my job but management was political and seemed like no matter how hard I worked it was never recognized.
good,"I really enjoyed my co-workers, it was a remarkable business to work in."
good,Handled calls from customers about credit card balances and issues. I would never work for them again. They are not an understanding company at all.
good,I only worked there for a few months and as a temp. I can't leave a proper review for this company.
good,"I truly enjoy every day at work because of the people that I work with, helpful and entertaining while being productive"
good,"Good Bennefits. The company has undergone many chnages throughout the years, some good and some bad."
good,Really do care about employees.
good,"TSYS is a great place to work, the people are friendly and you constantly stay busy."
good,15 min break
good,"A typical day at work would be to run reports, coach agents, and to motivate them to do their best. I learned how to be a great leader, and to push other agents to their fullest potential. Management sometimes micro managed, which sometimes made the job stressful, but at the same time rewarding. The hardest part of my job was to have to recommend an agent to get disciplinary actions taken against them. Or to see them upset on a mistake they made. The most enjoyable part is to see an agent improve on a problem area they may have had, and to see the I did it look on their face."
good,"Biased management, differentiate between divisions. However job is secure."
good,"It’s an okay job, just not very exciting and opportunities for advancement are very limited. You may apply for a job you’re fully qualified for, but there’s 100 other people who are going for the same job"
good,faced paced and paperless environment. We had to notate every account that we had access to. The hardest part of the job was getting a break whenever it got busy. I loved that they showed their employees appreciation and celebrated it for that week.
good,"long hours, good culture and worked with good people. working hours rotation could be better as they can be unsociable when working a 12-9 shift for 5 days but overall I enjoyed it when I was there"
good,"Corporate structure, corporate politics, fast industry, little communication between departments, little communication between locations... if you want a change expect 10 people to need approval and a lot of time to see it. The culture is pretty good, coworkers are amazing... Pretty good benefits... and there is always food. If you are looking at a call center position... expect many puone calls only 2 breaks and a lunch. It is pretty rough and you are stuck at your desk."
good,I work a 3 day a week schedule. TSYS is decent place to work. The only problems being compensation and having the fear of being laid off. Other than that its a good place to work.
good,TSYS is a great place to gain experience in the call center customer service field. It offers good benefits and the people there are amazing. The down sides of working there is there are rarely any chances to advance your career at the company. They  offer great benefits and are very accommodating for people with disabilities. The hardest part of the job is the constant change is policy and there isn't much communication in regards to the changes that were made.
good,The job gave us flexibility in scheduling and appointments. The support from management and leadership was not there and we did not have the products to compete with 90% of our competition.
good,Since I work in the fraud department the work load is nonstop. For the most part its typically relaxed. I enjoy learning new roles and taking on new task.
good,"clock in, answer calls, fight with the callers, go to break, come back and get on the phones, fight with more callers, go to lunch. come back, fight with callers, go home, rinse and repeat"
good,My typical day started at TSYS at 8:00am Monday-Thursday and Saturdays. The hardest part about the job was occasionally getting overwhelmed. The most enjoyable part about the job was the friendships I developed. What I learned doing my career at TSYS even if you work your hardest you can not please everyone.
good,"TSYS offers a friendly environment and good work benefits. It is perfect for anyone looking for a job or a career. For the most part they are accommodating in terms of scheduling. The managers are typically understanding if you need time off for personal matters. "
good,"On a typical work day things change, with out notice. The job is easy. Management is unsure of daily goals. The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers."
good,"When I started at TSYS (two decades ago), the culture was warm and family-like. With the turn-over of leadership in the last few years, only pockets of that original feeling remain, especially as more and more long-time employees are dismissed and others brought into the company from outside. My retirement came at a good time."
good,"Initially I enjoyed my position at Tsys. In fact I really liked my job until the last year I was employed there.  Tsys does a lot of reorganizations within the company, and this sometimes eliminates jobs and/or entire departments.  There are management changes regularly and this also affects how jobs are and causes jobs to change.  Fortunately I was able to promote to a supervisor position when I remained under the same management umbrella for about 4 years, but once the management changed I was moved to a different area and eventually laid off."
good,Since the company was purchased and went public the management team changes all of the time. Agents are not supported very well by new managers that don't know the job and moral is very low on the floor.
good,Flexible work schedule was great. Each project team is different and there are many tools and application to learn. Hardest part was keeping up with all the newest tools and applications and methodologies.
good,Things could be a little better with being on 3rd.shift. The other shift unfortunately i dont know what its like. Im sure its a lot better being that its more team members.
good,decide for yourself. It has pros and cons like any job. What are you willing to tolerate and where do you draw the line? Everyone has a different experience.
good,"Good work culture. Management needs more improvement. "
good,"- Progressive technologies"
good,Great place to work.  Enjoyed the People.  The work environment is wonderful and they always try to make the work day enjoyable.
good,TSYS was a very good company to work for when I started.There has been so many changes with the mangement. Majority of the managers came from outside of the company and made drastic changes without getting a feel on TSYS way of doing business. Most of the managers would stay 6 months-2 years and leave. So many projects are rushed during conversions which damages the relationships with our clients. Which is time and money wasted.
good,"Learned a lot of information working here, including how to master the area of customer service when pertaining to over the phone entities"
good,"Check voicemail/return any messages."
good,Currently in flux with corp direction. Little to no fore thought about product training and placement.
good,"Working with this company was enjoyable.  My co-workers were great!  I covered a large territory that at times made for a long day but my customers were great to work with which made it worth while."
good,"It has been a while since I worked here however, it was the worst working experience I have ever had. Granted it was during the recession.  Layoffs are a normal thing even to this day. "
good,I enjoyed the knowledge I gained from customer service with TSYS.
good,"I didn't enjoy the work. It was a bit boring to me. It was challenging and I tried to keep up with the brainiacs, but I found out that the IT was not for me. It seemed impersonal. The most enjoyable part of the job were my co-workers."
good,"I worked for them back when they were TransFirst. Statement week was definitely off-putting. Customers would verbally abuse you and you were not really able to disconnect unless they were being absolutely vile, and even then you could be reprimanded if they just happened to be monitoring your call at that time."
good,I truly enjoyed my time at Tsys as a Quality Control Specialist.  I worked with amazing people and learned so much from them.  I thought I wouldn’t be able to contribute but during my training I was calibrating calls with several different banks and completing audits. I was a nervous wrecked but I loved it all the same.
good,"- A typical day at work includes multi-tasking and staying focused"
good,Pay is great as well as benefits. Sometimes the call volume is high some days slow. The boring part is not having anything to do while waiting on a call. Books of all sorts is not permitted.
good,"I have nothing to say at this time. "
good,"Yes you get 2 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch. But it’s when they schedule you to go. 3 hours between your lunch break and 15 minute break? Need to use the restroom? That’s to bad, you’ll have to go into personal time and that is frowned upon. And this is potentially an everyday thing. I left because sitting in a corner and doing nothing but speaking with A-holes on the phone all day isn’t for me."
good,"Pro's - Salary, work from home, lot's of work. "
good,The culture used to be family friendly. But the board did not see money in that so they hired a cut-throat CIO who was brought in to cut jobs and instill fear into those that remained to work harder or face the axe.
good,"As an entry level job, TSYS is as ideal a place as they come. It has an above average starting salary, good benefits and a nice transition to the corporate world for someone freshly out of university."
good,Develops successful administrative strategies such as  that led to Establishes effective systems for information retrieval through  administrative support systems through keeps documents organized via [task] to avoid duplication.
good,"Internal TSYS culture is transitioning from a relational focused, caring organization to one where the focus is more on shareholder value and client value than on building an engaged and mobilized workforce."
good,"The experience at TSYS was ok but alot of things need to be changed. The main reason I resigned from TSYS is that I was in a car accident and had missed 3 days of work. When I came back, I had a doctors note stating that I had been seen. About a week later I get a write up about the days I missed from work even with a doctors excuse. I thought that was totally unfair and unethical."
good,"Decent place to work if you're just starting to work... calls come in back to back... on slow days, you're able to LWOP (Leave Without Pay)... definitely like the people I worked with"
good,"Recent acquisitions and lay offs proved detrimental to the core of the business because irreplaceable knowledge and experience was either let go or fled from the instability. Minimal advancement opportunities, but overall a decent place to be employed."
good,I have been with TSYS for 11 years and I must say that it has been a great company to work for. They care about their employees and try to be a competitive employer in today's market.
good,I just started as an independent contractor with Central Payment. Not enough experience within the company to give the proper review
good,"TransFirst, LLC is a growing company in the banking industry. It provides clients with a medium-size call center, sales and sales support functions, credit verification, chargeback assistance, and other departments appropriate for a reliable, full-service credit card processing company. Facility security is paramount. The pace in this environment is reasonable. In general, one may continue to work for TransFirst until retirement. There are frequent opportunities for advancement, and employees are encouraged to apply for cross-department job openings. The overall environment is very conservative. Employees are discouraged from making their work spaces too home-like. However, the company provides a Holiday party, and other celebrations throughout the year."
good,"overall great company to work for, very laid back environment. No dress code most employees take advantage of this. Provides great benefits and starts off more than minimum wage."
good,A typical day in TSYS was taking inbound and outbound calls from customers on delinquent accounts. I learned that some customers were more cooperative than others. My co-workers were very friendly. The hardest part of the job was getting a customer to make some form of payment on their delinquent account. The most enjoyable part of the job was listening to a customer when they needed you to listen the most.
good,"I worked for TSYS for about three years. On a typical day I handled 60-70 calls relating to a members credit card rewards program."
good,very busy days at work. I learned that customers can be very easy to get along with. My coworkers were very nice. The hardest part was trying to collect a debt from a customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping others.
good,"Issue with having the right people in the right positions and placing emphasis on the more value-added employees. "
good,"Door to door sales, paounding the payment, I learned ii is not easly to sale vendor with a close mind, Some people just witl no adapt to change."
good,"Work was great until TSYS bought Central Central Payment out and started to cut funds and now lay offs. They actually were offering a decent severance package and offer transfers for anyone who was willing to relocate. That was nice.  Lay off is just business,  do I'm not offended by it. Overall great paid time off and vacation hours. Simple tip request time off. Some positions are remote."
good,"I have worked here for over 9 years now."
good,Worked entirely unsupervised. Hardest part was trying to locate a person of knowledge. Depending on the group in which you work will determine your work environment/culture/stress/etc.
good,"low and decreasing income opportunities. Little to no advancement opportunities. Good 1st year sales job for experience, but nothing more. look to move out."
good,"They definitely help you ""develop"" your skills by using the low salary employees to do high-salary work. But in foresight, it looks good on your resume even though it is frustrating and counterproductive."
good,"Making out bound cold calls"
good,"Busy work atmosphere."
good,I work in a call center and answer inbound calls. I have learned how to work in in an stressful environment and multitask.
good,"In an industry that is difficult by nature, TSYS is one of the few companies I would be proud to represent.   They are transparent and ethical with exceptional customer service."
good,"I really enjoyed my job! Changes can definitely be made with management, but overall i enjoyed my duties day to day. The job can be repetitive once you get the hang of it, so don't be afraid to offer new, creative ideas to make it more interesting."
good,I am working in a small knit and i have very friendly colleagues. The athmosphere is nice but it is hard to keep concentrated with all the noise around you.
good,"I can’t thank you enough for all of the experience and confidence my position has given me. I appreciate the time and patience that the company has invested in me. Hope the people who managed knows how to communicate their team members, "
good,"TSYS is not a bad company to work for. The benefits they offer are second to none. However, there isn't much soul to the company either: unless you are high-level management, you are just a cog in the machine. After a while, I got bored with the same thing day after day, and was not really disappointed when they let me go."
good,they are very process and policy driven. and don't support you in your outside life. They very rarely make exceptions even in exceptional circumstances. But the people are nice enough and the pay is kind of okay.
good,"decent pay and hrs just the call center wasn't for me , the people were nice, my trainer was a hilarious foreign lady whom i loved"
good,TSYS does a fairly good job of keeping the agents motivated when call volume increases dramatically and for long periods by providing the occasional catered lunch. TSYS also has a great committee that makes every effort to make the agents feel the company cares by offering things such as random drawings for prizes and bringing a personal cake to an agents desk during their birthday month. I feel that none of these niceties over shadows the fact that TSYS does not provide appropriate compensation to agents when adequate up-training has been completed.
good,This was a college internship that gave me a chance to manage people from a far being that everyone was located out of state. I was force to connect through webex and conference calls.
good,TSYS is a good company to work for. They value their customers and make sure they are put first. I learned alot about customer service from working here.
good,Handled high volume in bound calls. Great Supervisors. It was always interesting because not only did we work but we also did many activities such as pep-rally's. Wonderful how certificates of recognition are given to show appreciation on a job well done. Wonderful co-workers.
good,"I work in the credit card department, and based off of what I’ve heard from other employees in different areas, ours is the easiest to work in. You get maybe 1 or 2 difficult customers per day, compared to 10 or more in other departments. The benefits are really good, and that includes healthcare, vision, and dental. And you have the option to have them a part of your healthcare plan. My manager is great. He’s very patient and always willing to listen and help out. But, it is a call center. So it can get emotionally and mentally frustrating."
good,Pleasant environment. Family oriented. I've been working here for three years and I really enjoy it. I have learned a lot of great things here.  I am now looking to advance my current.
good,"great place to work and meet new people. management was awesome, plenty of overtime hours, great pay and work environment.  i loved working here everyday!"
good,"It was a fun environment "
good,"Great company to work for. "
good,I like the job very much and NEVER wanted it to end. The owners wanted a 100 seat call center and it just was not possible based upon the money they were offering employees. They sent me to the Philippines all by myself and refused to give me any help. It was one of the hardest things I have ever done and I wish they would have helped me as if they did it would have been very successful.
good,"This job was a lot of fun, but did not produce very much money. Paid through small bonuses only, the inconsistency of paychecks forced me to seek employment elsewhere. My manager was helpful and enthusiastic."
good,"Total system services is a great place to work. Although, it doesn’t balance out very well if you have children. The managers need More training on ethics."
good,"I liked working at TSYS at first, but it quickly became stressful. The back to back calls and long hours began to effect me to badly. Some people can do it and others can't. Me personally I don't like sitting for long periods of time."
good,Day to day support of infrastructure and project person for systems administration. Support remote sites and help with tier 3 support. All dns and gpo admin work.
good,The reason for this job role was to improve my telecommunication and I believe I achieved that within my time there. Dealing with inbound calls of 100-150 a day it was challenging but enjoyable.
good,"I recently started to work there. It's a good team that I work with, so the work is enjoyable. Every day is different, and I am learning a lot."
good,The company lacks any type of work-life balance. I was able to move around the company but not always in an upward direction.
good,No typical workday. More and more this industry is lacking ethics. Wishing to change industries as a result.
good,"This at one point was a job I loved.  Due to acquisition, the quality of overall leadership and direction declined.  I once ingrained focus on clients and satisfaction, quickly dwindled to numbers and revenue, with no regard for clients and retention.   Just replace them with another, not providing the actual products and services they really needed.   Basically fake it till you make it mentality."
good,"Follow new fraud trends that we captured from bad merchant applications.  Follow MAC (Merchant Acquire Committee) and see other Acquirers trends and alerts staying on top of the newest fraud scheme."
good,Here the work place was hectic. I dealt with several accounts and imputed payments from different customers who were behind on there payments. Traffic was horrible getting to work so when you got to work your frustrated and annoyed. You never know what department your supervisor is going to put you in because they didn't have enough employees to cover all departments. I dealt with probate (death certificates) so the incoming calls where always sad
good,"TransFirst was a fast paced, call center driven merchant center.  The employees are among the best merchant service providers in the US."
good,"Finding that because I am over a certain age, seem to be overlooked for a younger workforce regardless of the experience and knowledge that I have"
good,"As early as your first day of training at Tsys Loyalty it becomes obvious that there are simply not enough people working with this part of the company. Training is typically rushed to get warm bodies out onto the floor. The training isn't difficult, however the trainers are under a lot of undue stress because of the frequency of abbreviated classes, and often leaves a distaste in the mouth of new employees who are already uncertain about their career path."
good,It’s a regular customer service job. Wish pay was higher and employees were more appreciated. Compared to other companies we do a lot of work for less pay than surrounding big name companies that do half of what we do.
good,"this job requires you to follow company policies to the T. your calls are graded and you are written up if you fail. its somewhat stressful as the management is poor and unprepared. the salary is good, benefits are excellent."
good,"It will take you 2 years to really make money.  I am talking about 80 to over 100K.  My job was sales which is the most stressful job in the company in my opinion.  I worked there 6 years so I am confident in my review.  Every year your commission structure will change.  Micro managed to death.  Call time, outbound calls.  If you have a great month or year they don't care.  What have you done for me today!  If you don't let these thing bother you you will do fine.  Keep your head down and work your leads and you can make money.  Just don't expect much else.  Benefits, health, 401K and stock options are very good."
good,"Good place, fabulous company. I love the environment and energy throughout the building. Upper management is very knowledgeable and approachable. Fortune 500 company and an amazing place to start your career."
good,"TSYS production side was my first job directly after graduating high school and I loved it! I started working there via Staffing Connections, so I wasn’t getting paid what a permanent worker was being paid, but I loved it. It was an great work environment and the workers were friendly and helpful. It was not filled with drama or messiness at all."
good,"•	Reviewed customer accounts for the prevention and detection of possible fraud for preferred and small business clients"
good,Good company to work for.  Challenging job and nice working environment. Great manager and team environment. learned a lot from my manager and was able to use the skill set in my career.
good,"TSYS is a great place to work.  My experience is that of a collaborative, institutional company with high ethical standards and strict adherence to principles & guidelines."
good,"For true payment pros and beginners who want to learn interchange, and learn how to sell, this a great company to build your book of business! The company is moving in a positive direction and was acquired the same time I sought other opportunities."
good,"Fun place to work but very easy to mess up. "
good,"TSYS is a good company with good benefits."
good,"A typical day spent at TSYS included problem solving. I learned how to book flights as a trade agent. The management was pretty easy going, however it was hard to maintain school and work like due to work scheduling."
good,Great atmosphere. It was a very good place to work with friendships and closeness few office jobs can match. Unfortunately the location is being closed.
good,I had no problem working with this company job training and sale motivation excellent. Down fall is that they provide you with no leads and compensations minimal.
good,This is a place where anyone with an aptidute for sales can come and learn a very lucrative business. Prior experience in sales is a must. Ability to overcome objections is crucial.
good,"1. Typical Day of Work"
good,"From 7 am to 7 pm and then taking a laptop home to work from home during the evening."
good,"Worked by Tsys was an excellent opportunity to learn more about the ITTIL environment."
good,Most of my day was spent loading and unloading computer equipment for the company. Other than that I was maintaining quality control and inventory management. I spent a lot of time talking with Finance and completing SOP operations for them along with expenditure reports. I shifted between that and computer repair and maintenance. I worked Technical Support for any team members that had technical issue with their equipment.
good,"TransFirst was a great challenge and I enjoyed learning new things on a daily basis. I was told during my interview that our manager didn't micro-managed, yet she did (a con). I learned how the payment processing business works with merchants and how third parties became involved. The company is big, but our department was small. I enjoyed our little amiable department."
good,"I have only work for one year. I am enjoying my work very much as it's challenging and busy. My kind of place! I still have much to learn, but that part of the fun."
good,"I’m able to work independently but if I need help, I’m able to ask management  the benefits are good  the company is very customer service oriented   They believe in making sure all clients are satisfied"
good,"Why choose to work for TSYS? The company is full of adventurers, dreamers and doers. People who make plans, and who make things happen. And, of course, people that have fun doing it."
good,Its a world leading product based company for payment processing. Its gives you the great opportunity to learn the payment card industry domain with major banks all over the world.
good,"best call centre to work in sudbury for now. good events, understanding environment. some co workers are amazing. just like any call centre it can be pretty stressful to sit all day."
good,policy needs to be updated in a more timely manner. the people who work the actual jobs should be advising those who write policies and procedures as well as quality.
good,"When the calls are not that high and the customers are not rude, this is a pretty relaxing job. I don't agree with how strict the adherence policy is, especially when calls are coming in quick there is no time to finish notations. If you don't give your managers a hard time they are pretty easy to deal with. There are great benefits and discounts, food trucks available every other day of the week, you get to pick your hours, etc."
good,The people are great and we're like family. Southern Hospitality is shown to clients. I love my team members/co workers. It is nice to be around great people
good,"good place to work for with great taw management ,"
good,"Working at TSYS has been a lot of fun. I got to meet so many new people. Sometimes days were slow, however the pay check was definitely worth it! Good job all in all."
good,"enjoyed it, keeps you busy, greeat trainers, benefts, thres a gym inside, flexible hours, clean, nice people, cafeteria inside, but busy phone lines, great"
good,TSYS Merchant Solutions is a good company and I worked there from 2000 to 2018.  I enjoyed most my time there and worked well with all employees. Work/Life balance could be improved at TSYS.
good,"A typical day at work:"
good,I do not wish to provide information about this company. It has been several years since I worked there and am unsure of the current policies. I enjoyed my work while there.
good,"Tsys was a very fast paced call center, must have excellent speaking and customer service skills. Also a lot of information to learn in short periods of time. Mandatory overtime, and shorter lunches wasn't my favorite part."
good,A productive day was a good day. Work is not always relaxed but it was never too difficult. The pay is amazing and the environment is always positive. I would highly recommend this place.
good,Some leaders within the company cater to some and ignore the rest. Some of the senior leaders were placed in those positions because they know someone and have zero people skills. Salaried employees were treated as the step children of the company. Id it wasn't for the benefits most would probably have left the company.
good,"Overall it is a good company to work for. Good benefits, flexible work schedule, employees are pretty good to work with. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the red tape when trying to implement new technology. Also when dealing with employees who are not willingly to adapt and change when new technology comes out."
good,"Worked as a Chargeback agent, because I did not receive all the tool to do the job. I felt the TSYS did not set me up to be successful. Learned a lot."
good,I really enjoyed working at ProPay. They have an amazing staff and are there to help you with any questions or concerns you have. As a customer service representative I took inbound calls from people who needed help with their account or had questions.
good,The management there at TSYS is horrible. I wished they cared about their employees and had better pay. I love the job however it's the management that gives the place a bad name.
good,"I am working from home 4 days of the business week."
good,"Tsys is a great job I enjoyed my time working there. Enjoyed helping my cx to the best of my ability. Tsys is also very strong on team work or partner ship which is excellent. its a professional, fun atmosphere. its also a place you can grow in over the years of your tsys career"
good,"Central Payment has a great reputation and great support staff.  It is a 1099 job that with the right base, can be unlimited in potential.  For a recent college grad with bills to pay, it can be a tough fit."
good,Spherion/TSYS was a great work environment. The only con that I have about working at TSYS is that the company did not work around my school schedule.
good,You have a variety of opportunities at this company and it gives you a chance to grow and impact so many people.  This is a good starting point for the young and young at heart.
good,"Recent organizational changes have affected the workplace culture of TSYS and many changes have taken place that are moving the company towards 'increased efficiencies'."
good,"Todos los días son productivos, hay mucho aprendizaje y actividades a realizar que son de mi interés, hay problemas que resolver y dar soluciones a la dirección"
good,I had a great manager and a great team. It takes a while to earn a decent living and a lot of work but they can help you get there.
good,"Difficult to come into the organization at a Senior level.Top heavy in the management area. Managers that have worked at TSYS for a long period of time are not very accepting or encouraging to experienced people coming into the organization. "
good,"This is a great place to work, but it is a call center so having time off is hard to come by.The training is great and they have friendly employees for the most part that is willing to help you."
good,"I liked working at TSYS, I learned a lot but the pressure that this job enforces is difficult to be managed. I had a very good relationship with management and colleagues."
good,I assist merchants with Technical issues and Problem Solving.  I learned several new systems and the main one was Lotus Notes.  Everyone worked well as a team to get the job done.  The hardest part of the job was getting the merchants to comply with the new PCI  Compliance Regulations but for the most part I enjoyed researching and helping as needed.
good,"I like how many employee activities there are and how relaxed it is on later shifts. There are also pretty good benefits, including discounts around town and for theme parks and attractions. I do not like the schedule selection process. Your schedule changes every 3-4 months. Sucks having no weekends/holidays off, unless using vacation time."
good,"•	Ingraved Credit card plastics with all the necessary account information."
good,"Make a lot of cold calls on the phone,good opportunity to get statements"
good,"This position involved a lot of pressure, constant changes, Had to be very task oriented, multitasking."
good,A typical day was assignment of projects. From that point research of doc and programmer analyst to get additional information. The most enjoyable  were the co-workers and knowledge. The hardest for me always are contract endings. I love to work with great people.
good,"TSYS is a very productive workplace , but it also has fun aspects as well ."
good,"A typical day includes the unknown.  Changes occur without notice and some changes are not tested in a test environment, as one does not exist.  "
good,The hardest part of the job is the best part of the day the cold calling can be either the best or worst.
good,Unable to work very long since I was having financial trouble and couldn't afford to drive to the different business. The orientation was very good and I think my supervisor was good also. I told him that I was going on a leave until I could be more financially stable.
good,Answer customer inquiries about credit card account information. I dealt with commercial credit card customers who called into the call center with problems on their credit cards. I explained their bills and charges on the bills as well as helping them lower their interest rate to better accommodate their needs.
good,machine operator that processed and sent out credit cards daily to customers.
good,"Management is okay"
good,Worked out of a system that fed employees different types of work requests that needed to be completed daily. Management was unaware of how to complete requests which meant I was responsible for looking up how to complete tasks through policy and procedure on my own. The pay was not adequate for the amount of work I produced. Benefits were great!
good,The Management's alright overall they're okay ... definitely room for improvement.Pretty decent company! Great benefits and insurance and room for advancement
good,"Baised manager"
good,Eleven hour days on your feet most of the time. Multitasking with at desk duties as well as supplying operators with the materials needed to prevent down time.
good,Nice place to work. Its comfortable and clean. You are only provided with the equipment and software necessary to do your work. You work mostly alone due to senior members being on-site with clients or too busy. I took the initiative to assist the new members who came after me with problems I encountered.
good,"not the best middle management, people are allowed to be disrespectful to other employees most people are nice and easy to get along with. for the most part not a bad place to work"
good,Would rather not review this company.  I did work with some amazing people and found the training and compensation to be acceptable.  I would not work for this company again.
good,Total Systems has a variety of departments and locations to work at.  TSYS main staffing agency is Staffing Connections. TSYS is a paperless environment.
good,"My overall review would be that Tsys as a whole company tries to be good to their employees,  however the individual departments within the Tsys team need help. Management needs to listen more to their employees, and make them feel like apart of the team instead of a separate entity."
good,"TSYS is a good company to work for, the only thing I wasn't a fan of is the opportunity to advance in the workplace is tougher than they initially let on."
good,"TSYS prides itself on being people centered and the people are truly the heart of TSYS.  The culture took a shift in the wrong direction due to several mass lay offs.  However, I believe they are working diligently to redeem themselves."
good,Great company to work for however layoffs recently. Job security and employee morale is low. Management is overwhelmed and doesn’t have enough time for their teams.
good,Enjoyed the company for the length of time I worked there. The hardest part of the job was the after hours due to the job .I enjoyed my client and the experience with their business.
good,"Excellent company to work for.  Very ethical, but undergoing a lot of change including lots of workforce reductions.  Lots of very good people work in this company."
good,Always room to grow within the business. Most schedules include at least two or three off days provided that you are on schedule to work 12+ hours on your scheduled days to work. Its not definite but you may still be willing to work some holidays in order to keep production numbers up
good,This is a freelance job. No leads provided. Cold sales and marketing. You are required to learn all product knowledge and generate all leads for commision based pay.
good,"Good management staff, good resources and floor assistance, interesting subjects to learn and apply. Kept me busy and challenged but pay was not enough to keep me there."
good,Management and expectations were excessive. High volume call center and no room for mistakes. You only get two and then you get written up. Also; training listens to live calls. All of your calls are monitored!
good,"they are not for your family the management I great some of them are nice. They don't gave holidays off like Christmas, new year, thanksgiving if you pregnant make sure you have the appointment on are off days."
good,Plenty of opportunity beyond the main segments of concentration. Global company with great clients. In middle of change process with new CIO and CEO.
good,The people are the best.  TSYS is a great company and really tries to make sure folks put family first but that's difficult because TSYS really cares about their customers so when something happens you need to be there.  The best reason to work there is for the people.
good,"I judge accounts looking for signs of fraudulent activity, if I discover or suspect a flaw I make a call to speak to the account holder."
good,The typical work load would be on phones all day in a cubical talking with customers assisting them in issues with their debit or credit card. I learned that you have to be able to multitask and be able to do more than one skill at a time to be able to advance in this particular job. I think that the management did not partake in enough of their employees interests. The hardest part of the job was having mandatory overtime even though you have already worked a 9 hour day. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was very independent work.
good,"A typical work day would be coming to work, clock in, I collect my packages to notarize and sign for attorney we would perform these duties until lunch time. After lunch we would package the affidavits according to attorney office, which there were about thirty different offices that we sign for, and send them off with the correct information regarding the borrower who owe the money."
good,"Overall great place to work.  My get along well with my co-workers and the company works really hard at making you feel ""apart of the team""."
good,It's pretty much what you make it. If you are self driven and have a background and direct sales and are looking to be your own boss then its for you if you have to be pushed to maintain focus then i wouldn't even bother looking into this job.
good,The company might be the best company in the world when it comes to culture and values.  It has a strong management team a friendly place to work that is financially very strong.  Compensation is light when compared to market and advancement is blocked in most cases.
good,Tsys is a good company to work for. Pay is comparable if you add in the benefits and vacation packages. Great way to get your foot into a large corporate world.
good,"A good company to work. The overall:  Job Work/Life Balance, Compensation/Benefits, Job Security/Advancement, Management, Job Culture is second to no other company."
good,empresa con grandes oportunidades y áreas de desarrollo
good,"Very disorganized in Broomfield since Acquisition, externally hired managers that don't understand industry, very outdated infrastructure. A major issue is that things often go undocumented and then when folks leave, they take ""tribal knowledge"" along with them and then the next time a related issue comes up, it's like reinventing the wheel. The situation feels like we can't slow down enough to fix the things that don't work but we keep trying to march towards new shiny things."
good,The typical work day is really busy with steady calls coming in. Calls can sometime stress you out. Some managers will work with you when you need a day off that's taken already.
good,"Great Company with great benefits, with a workplace culture of learning.  Executive management in the GTS Division is good/bad.  Company overall GREAT!!  Management GTS, marginal."
good,Good people and challenging and fun environment. Strong desire to be an industry leader. Lots to learn and opportunities for those with strong work ethic.
good,"Overall the experience at TSYS was great.  Intelligent co-workers with problem solving skills in information technology.  Management was fair in the sense the company was going through a re-organization and had misplaced skill-sets in leadership positions.  A typical day was ""Run-Run-Run"", which suits my personality and preference in the work place."
good,I have worked at TSYS for 19 years.  Tsys is a great world wide company that was started locally. They are a mainstay on the Forbes fortune 500 list of greatest companies to work for.
good,Great place to work and I believe I progressed a great deal during my time with TSYS. Opportunity to work with major financial institutions and deliver solutions key to the running of their businesses.
good,"This company was a great place to work for someone who wanted to build their experience towards a position or career that they would be more interested in in the future. I learned how to administer and maintain several security technologies and worked with various teams. There were times when the work/life balance was difficult, that was mainly during on-call weeks."
good,Very great place to work and is a well established company.  Their is constant work and a lot of good accounts to work on.  The management however need a lot of work and are not very well organized.
good,"Work culture ( when I was there, in my department ) was great."
good,"Fast pace, hard to balance life/work.  High expectations never stop.   Team is the best part of working there.   A lot has changed in the last few years.  Not the same family atmosphere and only seem to be worried about profits."
good,"TSYS is a great company for when you need the job. It pays very well and does offer great benefits,It offers moments of Team appreciation, but after awhile you fall into the norm of overstress of the job and how unbalanced and finnicky it truly is. If you're someone who gets sick often or has health issues you'll find that TSYS can weigh you down as doctors notes are not acceptable so you get punished for each day missed. Further realizing you are ntohing more than a corporate lackey who they will easily enjoy to replace. But if you need a high paying job, this is a great start."
good,"Buena empresa, sobresale entre las de su giro por ser un segmento muy pequeño, exigente en cuanto a sus procesos y calidad, buenas prestaciones para con sus empleados, se debe ser muy sobresaliente para destacar y tener apoyo y crecimiento dentro de la misma."
good,"Learned-Review and analyze merchant applications to qualify their credit worthiness. Following all Pivotal appropriate credit policies and guidelines to mitigate overall, financial and reputational risk exposures. Remaining actively engaged with the Sales team to identify risk and market trends."
good,"A typical day at work involved checking email progress on Releases for a number of Clients / Platforms. Meetings on a daily basis with a number of internal / external stakeholders. Analysing test results to ensure Releases could move to the next stages. Point of escalation for the team, and when necessary would liaise with upper management on decisions. Would problem solve and use organisational skills to ensure if there were issues with one release, these would not impact other releases in the pipeline. Perform weekly meetings with the team to discuss workloads and assist when members were struggling with issues on their Platforms. Specialist on a number of Platforms therefore, would deal with internal / external queries. Managed the out of hours meetings when deploying releases to the live environment for Clients. "
good,"Definitely an enjoyable experience to work with people like myself. The job itself I wouldn't call professional, but at the same time I don't think it's supposed to be a professional work environment. It's a fun and loose place to work and I believe the customers understood that and enjoyed the company."
good,"high energy office with lots of support, vey busy at times. great  staff and very helpful team leaders and mangers. lots of training given to help preform the role well and a lot of knowledge gained whilst working there"
good,"a typical work day consist of answering calls, helping merchants fix network issues and setup point of sale equipment and troubleshooting."
good,"Directed and actively participated in all business and product development for self-service financial kiosk of one of the world’s largest outsourced payment services companies supporting consumer finance, credit, debit, healthcare, loyalty, and prepaid services for numerous global financial institutions and retail companies."
good,Working at TSYS helped me grow mentally and it gave me the advantage of learning new procedures to help clients and other businesses.
good,"Innovation is at the heart of TSYS. It is amazing to work for a company with such a strong culture of innovation, creativity and boundary pushing. That, to me, is what opens the door to unlimited possibilities. To me, the ability to shape tomorrow is just plain cool. TSYS is a global brand, which allows me to do what I love – to work with people from around the world and see different perspectives and learn about different markets."
good,very busy and time consuming but overall i did like the people that i worked with and most of management. They very good benefits and took care of us when it came to the holidays and employee appreciation. I LOVED working in the different departments and learning the different stages that it took for us to fully complete an order.
good,"TSYS is a great place to work. I enjoyed coming to work everyday of my 7 years with this company. I learned how to be a project manager and completed a two year project in one year. My immediate supervisor was okay. I found it difficult at times to meet on required upper management decisions. The hardest part of my job was doing a good job and completing my project one year ahead of schedule. The most enjoyable part of my job was training, developing and assisting my fellow employees and team mates."
good,"On a regular day, work is usually relaxing. The stress level is not unbearable, but does require you to stay focused and alert. Working for TSYS has taught me extremely alot about the outside world and third party processing that happens behind the scenes of multiple businesses. Working for a few different departments also provides new and more experience that helps me on my personal journey from day to day."
good,Very good company to work with. Being a Independent Contractor with this company has been a good experience. The management is very informative and supportive. Overall I would recommend this company to someone looking for an IC position in Merchant Services.
good,"TSYS has been good to me of 23 years. I do think with the merger of Global Payments and TSYS, that they will become a younger company. "
good,Great place to work!  Very diversified environment in the US as well as Internationally.  Leadership pushes you to exceed not only professionally but in your personal life as well.
good,Working in the financial sector has its challenges.  A normal night in Operations would be setting up your workstation with the needed monitoring tools and making sure that documentation from the previous shift was accounted for.  The hardest part of the job was lack of growth opportunities.  The most enjoyable part was the close knit coworkers that all helped each other out.
good,"TSYS is a very good company. The employees are nice. even though the job is difficult it is challenging and fast-paced.The salary was very good, the more you worked the more your salary increased."
good,"Very fast-paced, call-center environment. Productive, but can be stressful. Great company with great benefits, discounts and perks. On-site cafeteria and lots of company-sponsored activities."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my job. Great pay and benefits. If classes were offered I was able to take classes to advance my knowledge. I enjoyed working on my own and with specific team members.  I disliked favoritism and phony people that got away with not doing their job correctly and a supervisor that was not really involved with his team to see what needed to be seen."
good,Tsys is a great place to work! The setting makes you feel like you are part of a big family. Everyone is willing to help and the management works with the agents. Team work makes the dream work!!
good,"Overall, TSYS Acquiring Solutions in Tempe, AZ has a ""Great Place to Work"" culture.  Employees rate it highly for a ""friends and family"" feel.  Peer-to-peer camaraderie is an important part of the work experience, and a big reason why people stay.  Compensation is not real competitive within the local market, resulting in a higher than average attrition rate for that reason.  Leadership is generally ok, but there's low accountability and a long performance management timeline for those who are not good leaders.  Reductions in force in the recent past have also created a flight of the best talent."
good,I would go back here in a heartbeat. I loved everyone i worked with and everyone i met there. The work environment was great. We had events going on all the time and the workload was not stressful at all unless we had a big buyer coming in that day.
good,Total Systems is a great place to work but really need to impove training for management staff.  Total systems offer great pay and excellent benefit package
good,Good job with great hours. Supervisors eager to teach you and encourage you to grow within the company. Fast paced call center with a lot of opportunities.
good,"Nice place to work, it can be hard dealing with some of the calls but the people are really friendly and will always help you when you need it. Training is really good."
good,"There is always something to do at TSYS, From taking calls for various banks to doing manadatory training that is assigned to you.  It is a very productive company."
good,TSYS is a great place to work.  Flexible hours.
good,I started on Transfirst/TSYS in Sept of 2015. Great atmosphere and people. Kind of lost their way with certain partnerships. When they merged it went downhill quickly. Not informative on a normal basis. Wish they would not have changed.
good,"Overall it was ok, some people were leaving due to management but I've heard they've improved since. People there are generally nice,helpful, and understanding. They also provide activities for employees and make the atmosphere enjoyable."
good,TSYS is a great place to work. I really loved the management there but the job i was doing just wasnt for me. They offer great benefits for any job you do there.
good,"This organization i am currently linked with it has provided me a platform to expose myself to technologies learn upgrade and implement."
good,"Excellent environment to start your care in the sale, tech, admin, the overall culture push you to develop your self on all you can be attitude. Pretty good place to work."
good,"If you can deal with the daily and monthly grind of inside sales and cold calling, you can make a lot of money here. Upward mobility is minimal. Not a lot of opportunity at the executive or manager level. High turn over as in any inside sales gig. Either you have it or you don't. Big gaps between incoming hires and Sr Execs. People either get hired and leave quickly, or stay for 5+ years. Very relaxed environment. Grinder mentalities only. Can chew you up very quick if there isn't initial success."
good,TransFirst was a great place to get started in the Merchant Service Industry.  An abundance of opportunity to learn and advance.  Open Door policy with management was much appreciated.
good,You are not able to move up as quickly as they say you are or even at all. There is a lot of favoritism. I love who I work under and whom I work for. Teamwork makes the dream work
good,Great coworkers and pleasant environment which has unfortunately been recently bitten by the 'lay-off' bug.  This has reduced morale and those being targeted are largely the most senior staff sadly.
good,"Identifies and analyzes the credit card fraud cases and card holder information. Communicates with merchants and cardholders to ensure their account safety and prevent loss. Investigates and analyzes the causes, methods and process of fraud activities and generates credit card fraud prevention and analysis reports. "
good,"TSYS is a fairly progressive technical company."
good,"Its not a bad company to work great to get your foot on the ladder and learn new things."
good,"I had a great experience. loved my co-workers, and my manager. I learned a lot about merchant services, and the overall market."
good,"I enjoy my employment with Total Systems due to the livelihood and the many of benefits associated with the workplace. Total Systems is not just a workplace, but it is also a place where you can express yourself. Total Systems provides us the options to voice our opinions on not only workplace fun, but also on job related matters. There is not anything hard about being a customer service representative, but it does have its cons when it comes down to learning new material."
good,"Growth opportunities, lower end pay scale, great benefits, handsome time off. Center is growing but struggles to find a voice as many initiatives are dictated from Columbus. Poor attrition due to staffing agency model"
good,"Good place to work. My only 'quirk' is that partiality is shown often. If you aren't part of the clique, your raise/bonus will not match your performance."
good,"I enjoy my work and what I am doing at work. My days at work are always productive because I was tasks to do on a daily basis and installs/changes to manage or assist with other groups. In my work, I touch basic with most of the things in IT, such as file-transfer, network, servers, database, developments, writing reports, and projects. TSYS is a large company so there are many productions and non-productions installs and changes on a daily basis. I get along with other groups and con-workers just fine."
good,"I think TSYS is a great stepping stone to gain some experience to assist with getting a better job down the line. I learned to take proper phone calls, for example, which I can definitely use as a skill for attaining a new  job."
good,A typical day at work was productive and fun. I would go in the mornings and the company had coffee and tea available. I would arrive early to prepare myself and converse with coworkers.
good,Signed on the phones and handle over 12 client policies from credit cards to online banking issues. I learned a lot of great customer service skills that I carry with me today. Customer where the hardest part of the job because people can be very crule over the phone. I enjoyed this job because all the co-workers felt like family.
good,"Management is very supportive of balancing work and family life.  TSYS has a great training program and continuing education program for their employees.  They are supportive in allowing you to advance in your career.  The people that work for TSYS are very dedicated to making sure that the client is happy and are willing to do whatever it takes to get something accomplished.  The most enjoyable part of my job is when our code changes are implemented in to our production region, and there are no issues, knowing I had a part in the analysis and design and knowing I thought of all the possible situations that could arise as a result of the request from the client."
good,"Interaction with clients & teams. Review of deliverables and monitoring of quality and adherence of established standards."
good,Typical day at works is collect on past due accounts/customer service skills
good,Good Benefits and Flexible Schedule.
good,"Successful established business, quick to get you on board. Very on the ball w/ supporting their employees."
good,"I like what I do, but this is not a forever job for me. They don’t pay very well. I do think they value employees, but they need to pay better. I will stay until I find a better paying job."
good,"taking pictures of new employees and ordering badges, requesting access be removed for leavers, updating spreadsheet, allocating locker keys, reception cover at lunch time, frank outgoing post"
good,"Enjoyed the years I worked with the company.  If looking for a good start and grow while doing business, this is a company to consider.  Pay and benefits are good."
good,"fast pace typical day answering calls, learned about financials, super supportive management, friendly atmosphere, hardest part was leaving, most enjoyable was being part of that team."
good,"TSYS is good company to work for. It has maintained a high level of excellency from being in the fortune 500 as well as other note worthy awards. This company is for innovative thinkers who can learn fast and is acceptable to change. You are only as good as your leader and I can say, I am fortunate to have a lead as well as mentor. I recommend for anyone who wants to work for this company, a strong background in computers would work in your favor."
good,"I enjoyed working at TSYS.  It was a relaxed environment.  My supervisor was great.  This was a call center environment so you are on the phone all day.   "
good,"TSYS has one of the best company cultures of any company I've ever worked for. They truly live what they say."
good,"Great place to work right from the start."
good,The hours are strange and inconsistent. The management is very keen to help and are very hard workers themselves. I have not only learned new skills but I have learnt a lot about myself also.
good,Good place to work but management leaves a lot to be desired. Great benefits. Good work/ life balance but management needs work. Would recommend to anyone
good,TransFirst taught me how to prioritize and how to manage a high call volume while keeping clients happy. My coworkers were always fun to be around and made work a more enjoyable time.
good,"I was able to work with this company for 14 years.  Longevity was nurtured by providing many opportunities, in many fields, and locations.  "
good,"I have been working here almost 2 years. Good job . Has perks as far as benefits , good training and willingness to assist. Supervisors are okay , some are good , some are bad but overall they are here to help. The only thing bad I would say is schedule changes. You change ever 3-4 months which is hard for people with children and how they go about scheduling but overall its fair as long as you come to work. You get a raise every 4-6 months . Its overall a good job , get vacation , paid off time. I would recommend it if you are a people person and can deal with rude customers. You have to have patience. Overall , its okay ."
good,"my experience with TSYS was absolutely amazing. Although moving from the customer service side to the Fraud Analyst was a challenge, I was able to learn so many new things and my colleagues helped me along the way! I felt like family at TSYS! The benefits were awesome and compensation was very satisfying. I recommend TSYS to anyone looking for stability!"
good,"I receive requisition forms to fill orders and issue supplies from stock."
good,Ramp up takes a bit of work.  Training is lacking since it is a inside sales position. Takes time to develop your craft on their schedule of ramping up.  Be patient and work hard.
good,"Great place to work; very friendly co-workers, challenging assignments; excellent management, employee focused; high pressure environment but fair and reasonable goals."
good,"Low salary, Set Salary, no compensation for overtime, Technology is behind with a .Net version of 2.0, Servers running 2008 r2 and using SSMS version of 2012."
good,The management is always accessible to help executives. I have have always been treated with professionalism and kindness. Management is very helpful.
good,some days are fast paced and others are not. management was fair and tried to keep knowlegable on latest innovations. Very good team spirit but upper management has put a damper on things.
good,"I have been working for Tsys for over 2 years in the collections department. I work from 8 to 5 with every other Friday off. My experience with Tsys has been a positive one, I get along with my co workers and have a pleasant work enviroment. The job is challanging due to the nature of the position. Currently I am making outbound calls with little inbound calls. Collecting on deliquent accounts is our main goal with giving the customer an good experience. Tsys has always maintained a great reputation of treating customers as you would like to be treated. The most difficult position is dealing with difficult people who are disrespectful. The positive side of my position is knowing that you have helped someone, along with the great management and coworker support."
good,"Quick paced, good feedback, fun, plenty of autonomy and mutual trust. Intelligence was a must and cooperation was mutual and enjoyable.  It was a fulfilling assignment as I had access to all the resources (people, processes, and equipment), my role required."
good,"Excellent /secured company.. Typical day at work, you go and do your job. Not much interaction with co workers. DIverse culture. Good place to grow as an employee."
good,"TSYS provided a great opportunity for growth and development. The type of work is very interesting and they are part of an interesting industry - electronic payments. I had great opportunities to grow as a leader and work with some very talented individuals. "
good,I loved working for this company until they started to lay people off for the sake of making the stock prices go up. As of right now half of the InfoSec team is about to be outsourced to India...who Thought it was ever a good idea to put the information of our clients into the hands of people we don't even know.
good,It was a great place to work but I was wanting to relocate to another state.  There wasn't an opportunity available when I was looking to move so I took a position with another company.
good,"TSYS culture was busy all the time; while meeting company deadlines/SLA and ensuring data was entered in a timely manner and processes completed daily.  My team also handled collection of probate claims processed bankruptcy data; very long hours because I managed and day and night crew.  We had a lot of team building activities for management and our team, cook outs and parties to celebrate.  Participated in thanksgiving and Christmas giveaways to shelters.  The hardest part was when I was laid off."
good,Call center where you are expected to take calls to assist account holders with many different inquires. Can get hectic at times but overall it is not a bad place to work. Many chances for pay to be increases if you are willing to put in the work to show you deserve it.
good,"management needs training on how to properly deal with agents, some team leads extremely rude and condescending. "
good,Ok place to work. Flexible schedule and management that is available and able to work with your needs. Great working environment and friendly atmosphere.
good,"TSYS has a nice environment. I worked in their office in Cyprus and in India. Both places have a great work culture which is collaborative and everyone is ready to help"
good,"The overall job is pretty easy, though stressful at times when dealing with certain customers. Company provides decent pay and benefits, though management can be difficult to work with and getting them to work efficiently can be a task. Would be an overall great place to work if it weren't for that!"
good,"Great, fun company to work for with plenty of encouragement and room for advancement.  Unfortunately the local office was laid off and closed down due to a company purchase and overhaul."
good,"A good place to work with a ""team player"" atmosphere. Its a fast paced environment with a competitive feel to it. Benefits are good as well as the medical plans. The salary levels for the different job titles need to be overhauled and re-adjusted, in my opinion, because they really don't meet industry standards. But over all, it was a very enjoyable place to work for over 10 years."
good,TransFirst is a great company.  Everyone works hard but there is a good work/life balance. Management is excellent and so are my co-workers.
good,Typical work day was taken phones calls for multiple banks both in English and Spanish. I explained to the customers their accounts the bank policies verifying accounts transferring when needed. Their was overtime offered but most of the times it was not mandatory the only times it was mandatory was only when we were short handed which we were not most of the time and it was only your lunch that was shortened. The pay for the area was not that bad. I did feel job security with TSYS I loved the company culture very open minded and ethical towards their employees. I had a lot of fun with TSYS while I was there I highly recommend TSYS for job security and growth in the financial and business sector.
good,"i learned credit card fraud, and investigations. very busy company, very professtional enviroment. Employlees are very friendly and welcoming. I learn alot about the credit care industy and how they work. I learn more about computers and software."
good,I started off as the Manager of the Shipping Department.  A need for programmers came up and TSYS started a program to teach programming to employees who wanted to advance.  I took the test and was accepted into the program.  About nine tenths of the way through the course I was offered a position with the Tandem Group.  This is where I started programming and advanced my carrier.
good,"Arrive on time every day because this expected and should be.  Take inbound and make outbound calls to achieve one-call resolution for each client.  Vast knowledge of technical support to esure clients recieve the best possible customer experience, while resolving their issue/concern/question.  Friendly environment that promotes within the company."
good,"Each day presents new challenges and opportunities of growth.  This creates new learning experiences that broaden one horizon.  Over the year, the management changed from a dictator nature towards development of members to grow the company.  The Kroger team is like a club with a team goal of success.  The hours are long; however, the rewards can be outstanding."
good,"Sempre muito trabalho porém com um clima bem descontraido."
good,A cooperative and an helpful place for all the learn and improve.
good,Working with the various areas that I directed and some great people. Hardest part of the job was telling people that the parent company had decided to sell the company.
good,I have learned alot of skills at Tsys Merchant Solutions. I have grown alot at this company. I am a team player and take my work very seriously and am a very dedicated worker. I have maintained and created a very positive releationship with not only internal coworkers but external clients as well. I am the SME of both Discover and Amex card brands.
good,"This has to be one of the top 5 companies to work for in Omaha, Ne."
good,"Working at TSYS is can be challenging and seem stresful at times but the companies makes up for it with various activities. The benefits they provide are outstanding and based on the people you work with directly, it can be a fun experience. I've learned so much working for this company. It has helped me grow as an individual and provided me with skills that can help me go further in my career."
good,It was stressful. I did not have a good supervisor. She never went over the things that I was doing wrong. I had a bad experience working there. The management in my department were not helpful. I prefer not to work there anymore.
good,"I can honestly say Tsys was a great job, but I started looking for something that makes more and something that was actually consistent but overall it was a great experience!"
good,"Recommended. While serious technical work is demanded the systems, the environment is laid back. The city itself, Columbus GA, is rural-like - traffic is nothing compared to Atlanta or New York City. I strongly recommend TSYS and the city of Columbus GA."
good,TSYS is a great place to work for a large corporate entity. They do a good job of making all of their team members feel engaged even through the company is very large.
good,I enjoyed working for the  company but I just needed a change and decided to make a change and I started another job. The company was ok I am not going to say anything negative
good,Tsys overall was a good company to work for with great opportunity's with a good work space so you can focus on your work. It also challenge you everyday to focus on the little things because one mess up can be major.
good,"I'll be honest; I didn't know what a TSYS was when I went for my initial interview. I'm not even sure I do now. "
good,"My managers at TSYS were amazing. They really foster a culture that is pretty unique in a good way. They had an open door policy which really allowed you to be you. "
good,ProCard was acquired by TSYS as we grew member banks and revenues. New management quickly changed the objectives from revenue growth to software development team for the parent organization.  That was unfortunate.

good,"This was a really proactive company wanting to succeed and surely helped me and broadened my knowledge within the company and Customer Service."
good,I enjoyed what I was doing and I worked with a lot of great people.  The issue with the company was the upper management; they did not have a clue of reality of the merchants on the street.  They were making decisions that were counter productive to what the customer wants.  The company had a corporate merger and they laid off a lot of people.  I did however enjoy working there the years that I was there.

good,"CP, Is a great place to work if your looking for strong business to business sales"
good,very fun and loving environment and all the employees are helping and friendly
good,TSYS felt like home from the first day. The company promotes a healthy balance between work and family. Benefits are good and advancement is available. On the down side IT On call Duties can last a week 24/7 dealing with international issues. Depending on the group size this can become mentally and physically draining.
good,"Working for Tsys has its benefits. There are exellent benefits, over time available,  and advancement. The one thing I think is not the best is required overtime."
good,"Really nice place to work, met some great people while working here. The work is ok, standard customer service role really. But with plenty of opportunity to develop, as a Knowledge Expert I was able to support managers on interviews/feedback/disciplinaries and covered when they were off."

good,Tsys has good pay and benefits. It's a large company. Sometimes you have to work mandatory overtime and your schedule changes every three months. The job isn't that hard because there are scripted responses and a guidebook to follow.
good,They have various locations in the US and overseas. Major Credit card processor for small and large businesses. Various positions available from Customer Support to Finance.
good,"Tsys has been a wonderful place the last 5 years.   You're not micro managed, which I believe is key to being successful at what you do.   The flexibility is another reason why I've always enjoyed what I do.   My job allows me to work from home and work the hours that are good for me.   The hardest part of the job when I first started was multitasking.  I had a variety of duties that I needed to focus my time on and needed to prioritize.  I overcame that obstacle and feel a sense of achievement knowing that something that once overwhelmed me is now just part of my job."
good,Tsys is a very good company to work for. They have a very nice and clean work environment and the supervisors are always professional. They also have great benefits as well.

good,TSYS is a company dedicated to building morale. Always creating new ways to make the work day exciting and interesting. Always willing to be flexible with any issue that may arise.
good,"Days are typically busy. There is a lot of off-the-phone work to be preformed on top of maintaining a good service level. I've learned a lot about communicating- it is harder to communicate over the phone than in person. The management is nice, but more one on one coaching would be nice. The hardest part of the job is helping people understand that there is time that does into making sure their accounts are handled properly and not everything can be done in a unrealistic time period. The most enjoyable part of the job is the environment and up front PDO and vacation, there are good health benefits too."
good,"TSYS Canada is a satellite of TSYS Inc. an American company."
good,"TSYS works in Prepaid Card Industry and uses latest technologies and methodologies in its curriculum."
good,"I was going through a rough personal time during this time. The company was overall great to work for. Management was kind yet, stern. Co-workers ranged all walks of life. Hardest part of the job was being confined to a cubical and calls continually coming in until break. No time between calls. Mentally taxing. Most enjoyable part was the friendships and teamwork, feeling a part of something that ran smoothly and benefited the customer."
good,"My current job is a great place to work. When it comes to learning experiences, I have gained a lot of knowledge within to the 11 yrs I have been the company. Their moto is, 'knowledge is the key' and I agree with that. The more knowledge you have, no matter what it is, the more you grow within a leading company."
good,"Overall I think TSYS is a great place to work. Of course, every department is not the same but as a whole it is very culture oriented."
good,TSYS is a great place to work! My position is challenging yet very fulling. I have a great team as we all come together to do what it takes to get the job done.
good,"Show up, sit down work accounts … No talking (within my department) I learned about fraud and an array of banks. Management SUCKS a lot , they're the least bit involved all the time. Co-workers were great. Stressful with a lot of emphasis on accuracy. The hardest part of the job is dealing with uninvolved management. The best part of the job was being able to go home."
good,Overall it was a good company. I enjoyed my time there. My only complaint is it takes a long time to get a decent pay.
good,"a typical work day required being on the phone non-stop. I learned how to talk to people in any situation. Management was great. my co-worked were very friendly & helpful. The hardest part of my job, was rude individuals during phone calls. The most enjoyable part of my job was the environment & hours."
good,"Must be self-motivated person, as this is a 1099 at the end of year. If you can stay busy and make good money you can do anything"

Organize and prioritize work, act independently, critical thinking and problem-solving, work collaboratively with others in a complex work environment."
good,"A very busy environment which I really enjoy, some downtime in between calls at quiet times. Plenty of training and opportunity to develop. My manager had been promoted internally and so was really supportive and knowledgeable about the calls. The main downside for me is the shifts are long and although we are given 4 weeks notice of the shifts it was hard to plan around and yes some people leave because of this. "
good,In 2016 TSYS acquired Transfirst and was launched into the top 10 list of Processors. This made a company in the  mature operation stage of a company life's cycle regress back into an expansion stage.  Changes are occurring in product offerings and  management.  I am certain that these changes will welcome in a new culture and better product delivery.
good,This job gave you the opportunity to move up in the company. Tsys provided a fun and enjoyable work environment. Working in fraud gave a different experience that I've never had before. The work load gets excessive from time to time but the work was always completed.
good,TSYS is a wonderful place for advancement and to gain knowledge of customer service skills. Strict attendance policy but the people/ co-workers remain positive and will keep you going even through hard times. the only con is scheduling once you have a schedule that schedule is permanent.
good,"Working 40 hours a week which was split to four 10 hour days, with having a three day weekend. TSYS works with different types of schedules. Due to going to school they provided me the option of working four days a week so I can go to class the three days I was scheduled without being rushed back to work after class. The environment was so friendly it was like a giant work family. The company had a few months were conversions made things a bit complicated and busier, but it wasn't difficult to get use to. It allows you to build skill while being under pressure. While being with TSYS Merchant Solutions I've learned so much about credit card processing, and the process on how credit card machines work. I learned about the service end; how billing works for businesses that accept credit card payments, different types of processing methods and fees. I also learned about the technical side of credit card machines, about how they are setup, the file building, troubleshooting, and the requirements they need to meet for the card brands.  "

good,"A typical day includes assisting customers with rewards redemptions (gift cards, cash back, travel), account inquiries, and providing administrative and team support.  I mainly fill the role as a travel specialist. This position requires not only booking hotel, car and airline reservations, but assisting with any related issues. These issues can include cancelations, missed flights, etc. I am a program expert on all clients (at least 30) and provide support where this is a need. I assist the research department in gathering specific information and communicating with clients. I provide team support to agents in my area and assist with escalated calls. I also provide support to the supervisors. This requires that I keep an eye on incoming call volume, adjust the types of calls agents receive to successfully meet service levels, and keep leadership abreast of any technical or client issues that affect the call center. I may be required to send service level reports and weekly updates to management."
good,"The management listens very well to improve the workforce. They treat their employees with care, where they will do what ever it takes to help their employees succeed. The most enjoyable parts are helping the customers understand what and why are product are the best."

Work well with co-workers we played as a team to hit numbers at the end of the month. hardest part working o 11pm or sometimes 12pm. Most enjoyable part is meeting new people.
good,This was a very flexible job and a fun place to work. We always had work to do so we were busy all day. Everyone got along and there was never any major issues. The bosses were also very respectful and social with all their employees but most of all very understanding.
good,"1,Typical day at work would be surrounded by fun/enthusiastic people who loved being at work with out any hassles or carry a burden on heart. They loved the work place so did I."
good,I accepted the position over another offer for $1.00 more per hour due to the relaxed nature of the call center. They really empower you to be able to assist the merchants by not having Average Call Times so you can really dig into an issue to resolve the problem and not have to worry if it will have a negative impact on your call statistics.
good,The experience has been positive. People can start in an entry-level position and work towards a more technical position. There’s a path for advancement. It’s been a rewarding experience for me.
good,good working environment with very considerate supervisors and team leads. Frequent training allowing for renewed learning. pleasant work environment. huge room for growth and promotion.
good,"Open to new technology if there is a business case."
good,I worked here as an intern. I was originally supposed to stay from May until July but the extended my to August. It was a fun and helpful work environment with helpful coworkers and managers.
good,"TSYS is a good company to have a career, a very relaxed environment.  I wanted to continue to work for the company.  I managed 11 Chargeback Specialist. Organize multiple projects with excellent results under deadline situations; make appropriate decisions; able to communicate effectively with customers, personnel and diverse management; supervise and motivate staff members; solve varied"
good,"The environment is great, and colleagues are great too. It can be really busy which is really challenging. There is sometimes down time and you can have some fun but when the phone goes, you've got to be on it!"
good,"Company provide's training and benefits. Fast paced inbound call center environment. Good company to work for, and opportunities of advancement available."
good,You have to really go out and make this job happen. Good job for me because I needed a freelance sales job. I would recommend this job to others in the sales field.
good,"TSYS is a good place to work.  They do care about their clients even though some of them are not always happy as, truthfully, TSYS doesn't always have the best speed to market or methodologies.  TSYS does not seem to have a lot of micro managers and frequently hosts events to engage team members with one another and with their communities.  The salary could be better but it is competitive."
good,"a typical day @ work is mingling with merchant's to schedule appointments to open new merchant accounts, calling the main office to the relevant departments to resolve merchant account issues."
good,Started out as an Admin Assistant and then was promoted to special projects.
good,"la verdad trabajar para tsys fue muy divertido, aprendi muchas cosas de trabajo como también en equipo todo el personal muy atento mi jefes directos siempre me apoyaron en todo conoci personas que en todo momento me apoyaron como amigos y compañeros"
good,I enjoyed my 3 years.  I enjoyed my travels and the compensation was great.
good,"Full-time Work hours with overtime, in depth training of new regulations and procedures, promoted within a year for my accuracy and work ethics, supportive team leaders and management to turn to from attendance to in depth work related cases, I enjoyed working there as I am a self starter, hard working, reliable and dependable."
good,"The work schedule is typical of a job, the benefits are good, and management is also good. Overall, decent place to work and gain employment experience."
good,"This job is very flexible and pays well IF you can make it. It requires hard work and patience. Some days I make a lot and some days nothing. That's the nature of this commission-only sales job. This job is not for everyone but for those who can make it, this can be a very satisfying career."
good,"It was a good job, I just really felt as if I didn't fit that role looking for a job that better fits me and my personality. Again it was a very good job I met alot of great people I cherish the experience."

Provide the highest level of customer service to merchants and retail banking customers in a timely manner. Maintains accurate and complete records of all inquiries and problems handled. Other duties as required."
good,"I love working for this center but I cannot say for sure if this job is permanent for me. There are rules that are not the same as many jobs that I have worked for. I have been working for them for a short time but after the summer is over I am afraid that they will no longer need me but will not tell me until it is too late. The management is great, the staff is great and some of the parents are cool but I would like a job that I know is permanent and I will have the next day."
good,"I would recommend someone to work at Westaff, however; working for a temporary service can become kind of a hassle. When the job is up then you must relocate to another assignment."
good,"The coworkers are excellent but, the job in general is very stressful. The management really are good people but they really need to organised themselves more."
good,"This is a great place to work, especially if you are looking for career advancement. The only reason I quit is because of the hours. I have a family and couldn't work the hours that were required."
good,"I liked working there, had great benefits, I learned to be more patient with customers, the mgmt was okay, the culture was fine, the hardest part was getting graded on calls and them watching how many times you left your desk, most enjoyable was leaving lol"

good,I started out as a mainframe programmer and ended up getting a great opportunity on the distributed side of technology.  I started out as a business analyst and eventually took on more technical roles.
good,Great place to work. Good opportunity to learn about Credit Cards. Multi client environment. Would highly recommend for young professionals. Good location.
good,"Management was very attentive and accommodating. Days weren't too bad, even the days when you spent an entire shift being yelled at by clients. They care about their people."
good,"One downfall, they could not or would not, keep up with the times.  New and smooth ran Products were always behind the competitors ."
good,"TSYS is the best company that I have had the pleasure to work for. This company offers so much benefits and flexibility. TSYS is truly a family oriented and supportive of its employees. I had the opportunity to learn so much about the Card Payment Industry, by my Mentors. Management was challenging but at the same time took the time to coach and support everyone. The hardest part of the job was not able to 100% satisfy all customers. The best art was the employees, we were are family."
good,"I had the opportunity to work at Central Payments from my own Home. It taught me how to learn experience of Sales, The management was good. They were a really great team. The hardest part of the job was to go out everyday and try to find potential customers. The best part of the job was to stay at home with my family while doing the work."
good,"With Central Payment being my first exposure to the Tech Support role, while support was offered via call center/ Help Desk, the experience working here helped pave my career in the IT Field."

good,"I was independent (IBO). The best part of my job is getting out and talking to business owners. Building rapport is very important when it comes to dealing with potential customers out of the company.I'm no longer in an IBO position. However, I highly recommend Central payment to any business owner. You will save quite a bit by switching your payment processing company."
good,"Love having the freedom to make my own hours.  Great, quick pay.  Good overall corporate structure.  Lots of room for making a lot of capital in a short time."

Management is awesome my co-workers are very fun to be around also laid back and are very helpful the hardest part about my job is telling a customer no.. the most enjoyable part of my job is working in a safe, comfortable & fun workplace and also knowing that I can help a customer resolve any issue they may have."

For example, analyzing requirement documents, attending walk-through meetings, writing test plans, writing test cases, executing the test cases (or running the test cases) testing the application, logging defects, retesting them and so on. I think I really like the process and that’s why I chose this career."

Listening to inbound calls and resolving client's request successfully is also exciting having done a done a good job.
good,"I worked 4 years writing computer programming manuals, 4 years in Marketing writing press releases etc. and the last 3 years as a client rep for Citibank Commercial Card. The last job I has was the most tedious and least fun. When you are working with a bank to get any change they wanted put in and were telling the programmer what was wanted and they accidentally put in an O for a 0 it could result in a mistake that could cost the bank millions of dollars . It was pretty stressful."

good,When it was just TSYS it was thriving and there was very high morale.  Once Transfirst was acquired and the layoffs started you could tell you were just a number.  You were only good while you were over-performing.  Then the workload would continue to increase but no extra people would be hired.
good,"great place to work, the company and the staff are good to work.. Fast training instructors and the environment is wonderful. I t was a pleasure working at TSYS, willing to learn more"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of reviewing projects.  Analyzing them and writing code to produce desired results.  Code was then tested, documented and moved into the test environment, and later moved to the different stages of production.  Paperwork was completed and meetings to communicate changes made to the system.  Some emergency fixes were coded on an extremely tight window of time, then documented and communicated the following day.  Code was also written, tested and ran to produce reports.  Code was also written to convert banks to a whole new system.  Sometimes code was written and tested to find missing monies of clients which could not be found by the clients, eventually saving the company millions of dollars for finding it to the penny.  That was the most enjoyable part of the job was writing code and fixing problems that no one knew how to solve."
good,"Hope you're not ambitious, as the managers here don't take well to it if you're trying to climb your way up the corporate ladder. I was in love with the workplace and my coworkers and was overbaringly silenced by management"

good,"I consulted multiple clients on phone calls all day while managing a large number of emails, also from multiple clients, and many of the emails required immediate attention. I was also responsible for managing an option maintenance box when clients would need changes to their functionality. I also had to manage projects sent in by the client that required my writing criteria to perform specific technical functions. My manager allowed me to work without being micro managed. I got along well with my co-workers and we all would help each other when needed. Hardest part of the job was managing so many different things for 9-10 different clients and being on call 24/7. Most enjoyable part of the job was that we were free to move around all during the day and pretty much work on our own."

Corporate America is high stress, fast paced and a lot of bureaucracy, TF is no different but once you find your niche, leaving the building daily knowing that you made a difference makes it all worth it.

They knew how to motivate their employees and keep the moral of workers high."
good,"I worked at Total Systems for over 10 years. Priorities could change almost daily, however managing your time was easy and flexible as well.  TSYS gave me my education and experience in .net c# and visual basic development as well as MS SQL, JavaScript, CSS, Web Services and other web development tools. The downside is that the enterprise didn't stay current with the industry in development tools so that when our office was terminated, It was also challenging in that half my teammates were in Columbus, GA, and staying in sync with them and developers in India was an adjustment to be made.   it left us at a disadvantage when job hunting in that we weren't current with what was being asked for in the job descriptions.  The workplace culture was friendly, collaboration with teammates in and out of the team I was assigned was encouraged and very productive.  Our office knew how to have fun and work/life balance was balanced."

A typical day would involve determining the requirements of Clients and working with them to capture the specific details.

The most difficult part of the job most times is being absolutely sure to capture the specifics from Clients to avoid change requests on projects.  The most enjoyable is the people."

good,"I'm glad I applied for tsys and got hired on. it took almost 2 months but worth the wait.  My previous employer was horrible..i gave them 9yrs and the last 5 yrs wasted. I never got the chance to move up. I worked hard for someone else's gain. I gave up. At first, I was nervous because Tsys was a more technical than what I'm used to..but I'm nationally certified in customer service so I got that part down. Trainers are awesome and very welcoming. My boss is the best boss by far. I have learned so much in the past year and got my first raise! It's laid back but professional environment. Benefits are great!

good,"A typical day at work would begin with everyone arriving for their shift. We all would wait on our supervisor to come greet us and informs us on what the goals would be for that particular workday. I worked in the mailroom, therefore all we did was handle and sort thousands of pieces of mail per workday. We got two 20 minute lunch breaks and some days the company would feed us.
