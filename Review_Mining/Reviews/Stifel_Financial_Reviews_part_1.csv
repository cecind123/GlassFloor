rating,review
bad,"All politics.  Management style is 100% top down.  No feedback mechanism for information to move upstream.  Run for the prosperity of senior management.  Worked for the company for 10++ years, although management could care less about loyalty"
bad,"Women do not advance with this company.  Women are allowed administrative duties and are not allowed to become financial advisors.  Very old school, Good Ol' Boy atmosphere."
bad,"Working was extremely busy,especially toward the middle of the month and the end. I learned many things regarding bonds.Worked with a great crew. The most enjoyable part was laughing at different jokes with the traders"
bad,there were a few nice people in the office. there is not much else i can say about this company
bad,"Work in silos but ""synergy"" is expected. People put on head phones and tune out all day. No face to face conversation. No shared vision."
bad,"No one is a person, you are just a number and your personal time and family is not important. Managers favorites do nothing all day while everyone else is pressured to work long hours. Benefits are not competitive. New software was just implemented and was not well designed, causing major issues. Every department is short staffed and the turn over rate is through the roof. If you absolutely need a job, it'll do the trick but I would never recommend this if you have other options."
bad,"I was let go with no warning."
bad,"Stifel was ok, not great, not terrible, but ok. Very much a ""who you know"" kind of place, otherwise not a great chance for promotion or much benefits. Being available 24/7 was expected. Lots of contractors go in, and go out. Downtown location is nice for amenities, not nice for accessibility."
bad,"not a diversified company. Offers tuition reimbursement. salary is not great. Woman are few in management. College education is not required. Raises are very low, and is reflected upon your appraisal."
bad,"This is a heaven for developers but, a miserable place for a DBA:"
bad,"I found Stifel to be lacking in technology, upper level management quality and regulatory oversight.  I was accustomed to much more advanced technology, overall management quality, culture, diversity and other qualities that I had at Wells Fargo, thus I returned to that organization."
bad,IT support is not treated well but there is plenty of work. Benefits are just above bare minimum. Not much in way of support or avenues in advancement especially of you are not in the St. Louis office.
bad,"Bulk of IT staff is located in the St. Louis, MO home office.  There are no advancement or lateral opportunities outside of that location, and staff are regularly reminded as such.  Mismanagement and miscommunication is rampant, and employees rarely know what is expected of them until they are reprimanded.  The culture is acidic, and employees are constantly on guard in fear of losing their jobs."
bad,I found to very difficult to relate the name of the company to new clients and prospects. Many people didn't even know what the name meant or even where the company was from.
bad,"Working with Compliance I learned how to prepare for suitability meetings, how to research and complete enhanced due diligence.  Compliance managers offer a lot of opportunities to learn new things."
bad,Hard to move up in this company without a security license in spite of having a BA degree OR  a MA degree?? Overall its a great place to learn the business
bad,"Typical day involved trading mutual funds, account opening, maintenance and review . working as a team to resolve billing issues great coworkers and sometimes difficult brokers"
bad,"If they offer you a job, prepare to work in a culture that you will never feel comfortable unless they like you. and obviously you can't control that."
bad,There is not much room to be promoted within the company.  It is very difficult to even learn about other departments to move to because your boss usually wants you to stay where you are.
bad,OK Company.  Mid west firm.  Laid Back.  Resources not like the larger wire houses yet they act as though they are better.  Culture is not nearly as stuffy .
bad,"Employment policy in transition."
bad,"Not a very dynamic work environment. large and confusing. "
good,"Stressful, non-stop work. Underpaid and under staffed,. If you are a good employee they work you to the bone and expect you to pick up the slack for anyone else that does not hold their own."
good,"Help desk department heads are rude, the employees are nice though. If you try to advance do not speak about it, because they will take it as you are not interested in your job and you will get fired."
good,"decent place to work and get experience. I work at managing routers and switches, and work with ISPs to purchase internet circuits. Work with staff to upgrade hardware"
good,"The people are great, the building is really nice. Good environment. The work isn't too overwhelming, but enough to keep busy for the full 8 hours/day!"
good,It was fine place to work. People were professional and nice.  It is a good location in the town.  It was a fine place to hang ones hat. I was sorry to go
good,Management is not supportive of the business model. It is difficult to get things accomplished as there is much red tape involved. Some good people there.
good,"The people working in the Operations department are great; however, the management is very poor.  Out of touch in regards to the work done which leads to ineffective management decisions."
good,"My role was fairly varied. I had a lot of interaction with all departments - HR, Traders, Sales, IB, IT as well as management"
good,"Good company, just a very intense production based results oriented atmosphere.  A way of life.  I made a lot of friends there and it was a great place to learn"
good,Benefits manager needed help. She had favorites instead of treating people equally. Benefits also hsd high turnover with the new benefits manager. Management not big on training either.
good,"Nothing special about Stifel.  Yes, the salary is higher than most financial companies in the St. Louis area, however, parking must be paid for by the individual as the building is located downtown.  Long work hours.  System issues generally occur through out the day.  401k match is poor, only .50 cents up to $1,000.00 contribution limit.  Generally working with excel files to keep track of your work as the system currently in use does not support the business."
good,The company is easily accessible from Illinois and the different counties in St. Louis. The company is growing tremendously and will continue to grow in the future.
good,I wasn't employed long enough to give a fair assessment as I pursued another business opportunity. While I was there the business culture seemed friendly as a new office was being developed.
good,"High pressure environment, lot of information learned. There are some smart and great individuals that you will work with."
good,"They are a good company, but in my position, they have systems to where they are mostly Stifel specific. I have gained little general knowledge that could help me in another firm, in my opinion."
good,"Not set agenda on how to operate your business here // commission based, fee based, discretionary, SMA, non-discretionary., etc. "
good,Professional atmosphere with high degree of integrity. Most of the employees are collaborative most of the time. Highly acquisitive and growing rapidly.
good,"The company is an okay company, the work life depends on the location."
good,Stifel hires great employees but needs to work on management. The managers have very limited communication with employees and tend to leave employees in the dark. This is true with one department but also between departments. It is often the case that one department does not know what another department is doing and the end result is a duplication of work and a waste of resources.
good,"Corporate is located in St. Louis with offices in several states. Sales management is inexperienced and lack ability to give direction. There is no job growth past sales liaison, no advancement opportunities"
good,Easy to talk and communicate with peers and coworkers. The office had a great location near Bryant Park in NYC. Everyone was nice and welcoming when I first started.
good,"Stifel is a good company. They're growing fast, which is subject to some growing pains. Stifel's has posted solid financial results just initiated a dividend policy."
good,"Company is growing very quickly and is still rather lean in some areas. Typical mix of associates in home office, most are friendly and easy to work with."
good,"They focus on the customer which is the correct method of running an investment company.  As a financial advisor, the tools were available to do your job."
good,Teamwork environment with focus on continuous news flow. Learned an immense amount of distressed credit and sell side research
good,"In my time as an intern at Stifel, I have learned a lot about the fixed income market. The Stifel family has been wonderful and this internship has been a great experience for me."
good,"Good work-life policies. Comp is good but benefits lacking. Struggling with loss of small-company, collaborative culture."
good,"I have had a great opportunity to learn in this capacity. I do believe that there are places that could be improved, and I think that my situation could be better in a different capacity"
good,I worked with Financial Advisors allotting shares on IPO's.
good,"It's a good place to work but the pay could be better.  Benefits are fairly good, but could be better as well.  Movement/promotions seems to be more unilateral than moving to the next level."
good,"I've worked at Stifel for 7.5 years and although I'm struggling with pay increases the environment is great and job security is real.  The benefits aren't great but the operations, hr, and assistants care about you. It's easy to get a range of experience while working at Stifel.  Home office is in a cool area close to restaurants and the building has a free gym.  Good PTO benefits and offer tuition reimbursement."
good,A good company.  My personal situation and relationship with my immediate supervisor was extremely unpleasant.  Expectations were unattainable.  There was little or no respect between us.  The worst manager I have worked for.
good,I enjoy the fast pace and the diversity in each days work. Stock market volatility can make for a busy day. I enjoy being busy and having the opportunity to help and educate our clients.
good,"Excellent work place. Enjoy the work, the company headquarters will not allow me to go full time."
good,"Great management and knowledge of the asset management industry. Most of the company is based in St. Louis, MO but everyone is willing to take time and answer question."
good,"Typical day is reviewing standard operating procedures versus the firm policy manual to ensure alignment. "
good,"it was an unpaid internship and I learned a lot about trading. The experience all depends on who you work for. luckily, I had a great supervisor and mentor"
good,Management was excellent.  Great learning environment. Everyone was helpful when I started with the company.  They were all willing to teach me.  It was a great place to work.
good,The job was busy which made the day go by faster however my department sometimes took on more than we could handle. It is a great job overall. The company offers alot of incentives as long as you don't mind being tied to a phone all day.
good,A typical day at work passed quickly as there was never a shortage of things to do.  I came in very inexperienced for the role but I learned so much in my years spent there and am so very grateful for the experience.
good,Stifel gives you the freedom to fully immerse yourself in the work of doing what is right for the client and they have unsurpassed services and products to make it happen.
good,"100% commission positon.  If you are good at it, you will be handsomely rewarded.  If you aren't, you will be fired or quit on your own.  I was successful but did not enjoy working on my own in a silo."
good,"I truly enjoyed my job here and would have stayed on much longer, had the company stayed in business.  We were a small, somewhat experimental Asset Management subsidiary of a larger corporation and in that, we had a lot of independence, with the perks and benefits of a large corporation.  My day would depend on the needs of the CIO first, then the 4 VPs and the management of the office.  I enjoyed having several different jobs to do, and rarely having the same day twice.  I work well with people that have been deemed ""demanding"" and/or ""difficult"" so my personality was a good fit for this position, that wasn't for just anyone.  As there were many demands of this job, time management was the most important aspect of staying on top of everything.  Thankfully, I had 8 years of working on the trading floor behind me, where your day is measured down to the tenth of a second, and each of them count, so time management has always been one of my stronger skills. In all, the job was a chance for me to use my finance and market knowledge in a support position that truly enjoyed and was very sad to see go."
good,I enjoyed working for Stifel.  I had challneges and good management and team players.
good,"My typical day at Stifel was not very different from Wells Fargo Advisors.  Checked daily work, answered phone calls and serviced clients and Financial Advisors. I enjoyed working for this company because it had a family atmosphere.  Everyone knew each other and we depended on each other to service clients and Financial Adviors."
good,"Stifel Financial is an amazing place to learn about accounting for a large publicly traded company. With a good work-life balance, definitely would recommend."
good,Stifel was instrumental in my financial securities industry education.  My job evolved into extensive customer relations.  I enjoyed my coworkers and the daily interaction.
good,Stifel is a fine place to work and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a position such as this.  Very good benefits.  The management you have will much depend on what branch you apply to.
good,"Working at Stifel has helped me to broaden my knowledge and abilities.  No two days are ever the same, which is important to me.  I have done a deeper dive into the Compliance end of the business.  Workplace culture is acceptable-the home office culture is exceptional.  Hardest part of the job is to make sure I have time for everyone on a daily basis.  I have learned how to prioritize my staff's needs and believe I have hit their expectations.  Most enjoyable part of working at Stifel is the employees and the wild ride every day brings."
good,"In this role, the Associate will see firsthand how business decisions are made, participate in senior-level meetings, be exposed to sharp scientific minds, and learn how a world-class sales organization operates."
good,Great support from management as well as home office.  Excellent research team and no pressure to sell any particular products.
good,"Good work-life balance"
good,"I really enjoyed working here. My coworkers and managers had great attitudes and were generally supportive. The customers were usually very sweet and easy to work with, but the occasional difficult client is to be expected. Professional environment."
good,As an intern everyone was very nice to me and willing to teach me the things I wanted to learn. I learned much about the Financial Sector and the economic cycles the country continuously endures.
good,The Stifel staff was very knowledgeable and welcoming.  Interns were trusted with meaningful responsibilities.  Office doors were always open for receiving advice.
good,The Sales & Trading group at Stifel in Greenwich was primarily made up of people who were very intelligent and very good at their jobs while also being interesting people to work with
good,"• Under general supervision, assist Financial Advisors with the maintenance of customer's accounts and performs a wide variety of administrative support duties. "
good,Learned a lot. People were friendly and eager to help and answer questions.
good,hard work; minimal interaction with managers/coworkers.
good,Supportive managers and colleagues made this a great place to work.  Stifel's support personell at their Headquarters in St. Louis reflect a 'can do' spirit every day.
good,"Overall great firm to begin a career. Entrepreneurial nature, able to take as much responsibility as you can prove that you can handle. Flat culture that promotes discussion."
good,"Typical day would start with replying to emails, downloading the previous day's commission reports and distributing them to the sales team. I would then input the commissions into various reports tracking multiple criteria."
good,"Stifel puts it's employers first, with a highly supportive entrepreneurial culture.  Growing aggressively, but conservatively.  Great fit if you are tired of the major warehouse culture."
good,"It's been a fantastic almost 7 years working at Stifel.  I have thoroughly enjoyed working at Stifel.. My boss has retired and I feel like I have done everything I can for the company."
good,I would still work here if i could of! The branch Manager is such a good man and is very understanding if you have something that needs to be discussed whether it be about personal life or work related. There is someone in this office that is stopping this place from keeping a good person in the front for a long time. Stifel is an all around great place to work and i would go back if one thing was changed!
good,"The best part about working at Stifel in the Princeton Office was working with the two other assistants in the office.  It was teamwork and no task was beneath any of us to do.  If I didn't re-locate, I would still be there. I assisted two brokers with daily tasks.  Opening New Accounts, sending funds out as requested to clients as well as assisting client directly with any of their needs which I thoroughly enjoyed. Aside from that I also was the Receptionist and backup Cashier.  Loved my job!"
good,Absolutely the best environment I've ever worked in.  I would gladly take on a full time position with the company if they ever would come to my attention.
good,"Great firm with an excellent workplace environment. Exposure to all aspects of the asset management division, including marketing, research, and client interfacing."
good,My typical day of work was highly structured due to a list to follow. I updated an investment database and researched stock sectors. I learned more about technical analysis and some portfolio management. The culture was excellent and was a good environment to learn the trade. The hardest part of the job is to stay focused on the subject at hand. I enjoyed the sit downs my boss had in order to help me learn more about the industry I intend to enter.
good,"Stifel is a great company, and a great place to have an internship. They allowed me to see all parts of their IT department, and gave me a good feel for the different types of technology they use."
good,"As an Intern, the job kept me busy, and there was always something new or interesting to that would come up to work. There are many work assignments or projects to be worked on. The best thing is, you get to collaborate with people either within the office or from all over within the company to get tasks done. A lot of room for growth, and development. I would definitely come back to work for the firm upon graduation."
good,I have been working for Stifel 20+ years now and have nothing bad to say.   It’s an amazing company to be a part of.    Please go to Stifel.com and review all it has to offer
good,Good bank looking to advance with the macro changes including mifid 2. The institutional environment was competitive but also collaborative. It required an entrepreneurial spirit to develop relationships throughout the firm. One challenge was having Baltimore as the hub for the New York employees.
good,Stifel has treated me nothing but family. While I learned a lot i felt like i could have learned more though by attending classes and or more seminars. No doubt that i was around very successful and smart individuals that taught me what i know now.
good,"Great company"
good,"Had a great summer at Stifel. The culture is relaxed, but there is an expectation that everyone is working their hardest. Everyone there is nice and friendly."
