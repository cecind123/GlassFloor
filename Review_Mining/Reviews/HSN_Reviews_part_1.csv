bad,"Management & team leads in inbound is very incompetent & lazy. Too busy socializing & playing with cell phones to do their job."
bad,"HSN was awful from training to how they conduct business with employee's; never heard from a manager got minimal direction. Question's were not something they had answers for, bad software and the only time anyone was ""coached"" was when they were letting you know your time was about up. Don't suggest anyone work for them for the pay, terrible experiance. Alot of nothing!"
bad,"Worst job ever. No life except to work, work, work. Never knew if you were going to work all day or not and never tell you about weekend work till you were leaving on Friday."
bad,"In my personal opinion I wouldn't recommend starting here bc they don't care about individuals trying to make a living, supporting family, or anything else, but that doesn't benefit them without having a loss."
bad,"I was in returns, the manager had his picks and if you were not one of them your out the door. Its another company you can't seem to satisfy or work hard enough. Run!!!"
bad,"The job is ok at first but you will quickly find that you are just a number. Support isn't really an option since you are always ""wrong"" and customers will not like what you have to say because of the higher management."
bad,I worked as a Software Engineer.  The reason I left was the commute was unbearable.  I was only there for a month assignment.  The people were very friendly
bad,Hsn had a hard time keeping people due to management and it just wasn't enough pay for the job. The people were very hard to work with and did not make the job easy.
bad,"Very poor workplace culture"
bad,"HSN is a shopping channel and the majority of its customers are much older, you either get the incredibly mean and rude customers or you get a nice customers who are slower than most. This company does not care about its employees and only values making more money. You are pushed to meet certain call handling times that seem unrealistic to most. It is back-to-back calls your entire shift, you have to remove yourself from taking calls just to use the restroom or take a sip of water while also worrying about your compliance being effected. They enforce policies that can be bent for certain customers at your discretion, but you are damned if you do and damned if you don't. so you never feel like you are winning. Had a very bad experience at this company. Only benefit is working from home which saves money, but you will be miserable here."
bad,You have no job security and are not guaranteed hours. when it gets slow they start laying people off even if you have great numbers. The management id incompetent and you are just a number. they don't care about their employees.
bad,"super discriminatory work place, unfair treatment of hard work "
bad,"Customers are NOT aware that you only have three minutes to end their call and often your calls are multiple questions and chatty customers who are oblivious to this restriction, meaning 10-25 min calls, you will be fired if you do not keep an average call time of those three minutes as well as sell a percentage of product, you may or may not get a breaks, other than lunch, if your call goes over your break, you cannot reschedule your break, very difficult to be teathered to your phone for eight hours with a 30 min lunch.  Many customers are extremely rude and HSN makes you stay on the call and take the abuse unless they are pornographic."
bad,"home shopping network is a place where you will get your hours but you will kill your body doing so, working 12 hr shifts 3-4 days straight. i would not recommend that anyone work here."
bad,Hours are impossible to get. You can never get in contact with management. They train you and then throw you into it and the reprimand you for doing it incorrectly. This company lies to its customers frequently about products overall a bad experience I stayed for 8 months and I just had to quit. NO room to grow within the company.
bad,Management is like a bunch of chicken with their heads cut off. No consistency in business policies. Customers are rude and disrespectful. Pay isn't great.
bad,"Poor leadership, production lines was always going down.  Poor communication between leadership and lower level employees.  Company needs more experienced repair department."
bad,Finally I could take it no more.  HSN has poor leadership.  Every manager and supervisor gives different information.  I was required to make a certain % of upsells and found it difficult when the upsell department did not even attach the upsells that were being aired.  Sales was punished for this by not getting a sale ding. But the upsell department still received their enormous salary.  Very backwards company.  Reps are not treated well and there is NO way to advance!
bad,Was not a good place to work if you have a family I was working 60 plus hrs a week Management did not work half of that. But on the plus side is was a great way to loose some weight lost of 60 lbs there
bad,"I worked for HSN for 4.5 years.  Management is disorganized, uneducated and unavailable.  A work-at-home rep is not allowed to talk to anyone in any other dept. - only your supervisor, so it's difficult to get a sense of how the company actually works.  For the amount of verbal abuse and pervert calls we receive the pay is low."
bad,hsn I thought was a great company at first but when I came ill it was all over from there I worked my butt off for them and they terminated me because I was unable to work for a while per Doctor
bad,"This company cares nothing about work/life balance.  Work is solely based on you being in your seat for 8 hours a day.  If you dare to take a rest room break get ready to be scolded.  You have 6 minutes of personal time outside of breaks to get anything done.  Not to mention as a smoker you have to walk 5 minutes away off campus to even get a break.  The cafeteria is overpriced and the management cares nothing about workers other than the productivity they show you on a screen 24/7.   I had very high hopes for this company based on reviews and years in business, however they do not care if you have car problems, family issues, or anything else that would potentially interfere with normal persons issues.  NOT recommended.  Poor Pay, Horrible Hours, Terrible commute.  I'm still trying to find 1 positive from working there, but I can't seem to do so.  Very Sad, and Unfortunate considering they can pay their CEO 15 Million a year and treat their employees as fodder.  Shame on you HSN!"
bad,If you need 40hrs a week I would not go here. They also dont have heating or cooling in this building. Team leads do not know what they are doing or what they want you to do half the time.
bad,"I work on call, so the work is little, and it rates lowest of all the places I have ever worked. Really not much to say. except I give one star for everything from management on down. Can't say much more due to reprisals, if they see this review they will make everyones life miserable, It's a horrible, but so true."
bad,Terrible work environment with horrendous compensation for the employees. HSN does not truly value the effort it takes from the warehouse personnel to make them the millions in revenues for the shareholders that they just love to hold town hall meetings about.
bad,"At just 10 dollar an hour which is the pay rate they offer here which we all know isn't enough to make a living off of, the people are quite rude and unprofessional. The one girl meredith is quite rude and unprofessional, she normally is the one who calls and books the interviews. Normally if you don't get to speak to her indirectly she will leave you an unprofessional voicemail, and then when you call her back she forwards you straight to voicemail and then it's like days later before you hear anything else from her again. And not only that sometimes you are only scheduled in 2 days a week to work, which all of a sudden becomes a part time job instead of a full time job. They say you can earn up to a 3 dollar differential added to your base pay, but that is a complete lie, I found out later on that it normally only happens once you are premoted within the company, and obvioulsy it usually takes a couple of years to be premoted within the company.I'm not trying to deter anyone's attention away from working here, because obviously a pay check is a pay check and with the economy being as bad as it is, a 10 dollar and hour job working only two days a week might not be so bad for some people. But I would definetly take these things into consideration before deciding to work here."
bad,I don't even know where to begin this place is horrible your worst nightmare horrible Managment especially this one supervisor and one peer they are great friends they tag team together and literally put this one employee in to tears EVERYDAY EVERY HOUR they are seriously gonna gave this employee a heart attack it's not fair. Something seriously needs to be the managemment are phony whats sad is the operation manager should hear what the supervisor's say behind there back.... Something needs to be done Im really thinking about reporting them to the media!!!!
bad,Poor management and a lack of training and development for leaders to become successful. The senior leaders created an environment that was toxic . No one addressed the behavior.
bad,They said I was only clocked in for 80% of the time but I had just increased my hours from 8 to 10. They couldn't understand the simple math behind why their micromanagement software was saying 80%. I told my manager who acted like I was cheating or lying! I went to her manager and no resolution. Very poorly managed.
bad,"A typical day at work at hsn in piney flats for me was the same thing over and over. I made boxes for the packers to fill orders. My shift began at 5 am and included all weekend days and holidays. The only time during my shift i seen the supervisors was at the morning meeting, unless they sent people from other departments to help us. Thats when they would send cute ladies to help us and the male managers would come to our work station and flirt with them nonstop. It was pretty pathetic. I worked there in 2012 and the pay then was terrible. Hardest part of the job was the noise coming from the conveyer system that fed the packages to the trucks. Most enjoyable part of the job was going home. Not sure how things are now but while i worked there it was really  bad. Worst job ive ever had."
bad,the job is easy but they short the production pay to $1.36 a week down from $133.00
bad,Working at HSN will provide you with the opportunity to wear many hats simultaneously. You will be asked to do several tasks outside your job description frequently and be expected to continue to raise the bar whether this was your area of expertise or not.
bad,"constantly working 12 hr shifts 6 days a week no work life balance at all if your not there no matter the reason "
bad,"HSN prides itself on hiring employees within the company. You will hear through out training that everyone started taking phone calls and ""worked"" there way up. Well work your way up means be popular. There is absoulutely no other way to seperate yourself from the pack if everyone works the same hours, get the same amount of phone calls and the same amount of reviwed calls and the only calls they review are the one around 4 mins. You need to be in favor of your supervisor and everyone around you to get a foot anywhere or you will be ""shawdowing"" for decides. You will constanly see managment huddle in in groups of 3 or more all throughout the day and throughout the call center. Every single day GUARENTEED!! Not only are they talking about how much it would suck to answer the phone allday but  they are talking about their team and the people on them BEWARE IF YOU ARE IN BAD WITH ONE YOUR IN BAD WITH THEM ALL."
bad,"Typical day: taking inbound calls all day, peer to peer coaching"
bad,You are promised  new learning opportunities and opportunities to move up. Just doesn't  happen. I've not had a good experience.  I took a  significant pay cut from a temporary  job position  to a full time employee position.
bad,I didn't like it there. I wanted to go back to dentistry. I didn't like labor work or working at 5 am. 10hrs was to much. I didnt like wearing pajamas.
bad,"We took calls from customers all day to assist with ordering what they were seeing on the tv. We also assisted with incorrect / damaged orders that needed to be replaced and returned. "
bad,"- Take 80 plus calls per shift from customers regarding issues with orders, flex payments and their account information."
bad,"My responsibilities for HSN were processing Freight that came off the truck, Stock and make sure the store was cleaned up and presentable for the following day."
bad,Once you walk into customer service. Welcome to Hell on Earth!
bad,"Horrible incompetent management, hostile environment, retaliation."
bad,"It’s a shame that the work environment is toxic these days. Treating long term employees like they no longer matter. The communication has failed since QVC bought them. They seem to longer want a friendly phone convo with customers, only care about your talk time. Sad that they are now like the unfriendly CSR at QVC. The saying “it’s fun here” is no longer true."
bad,"My training was a joke, every day of training employees were discussing things with their family, pets, carpet, even the park by their house. they train you one way and punish you for doing it. i feel they don't care about the customer because there are employees that just say and do anything to get the sale. some customers would believe their order was in and the employee had not even placed it. it took me 5 weeks to get my first check and they did the same on 2 more of my checks."
bad,"The culture was one of allowing childish behavior from management staff. Degrading employees, and revealing confidential information about other employees."
bad,"Too many rules to try and follow and no Lea way for Mistakes in the 90days. My supervisor was not personable at all and expected you to figure out issues on your own. If you couldn’t figure it out then it was counted against you. Just felt like they never have time for you and wanted to boot you out so they can just keep hiring. Also, you’re not allowed to be personable with the customers or that is another notch counted against you. Pretty much they want robots to take and answer calls. My supervisor boasted how she’s been with the company for over 20+ years but never has time for the team she’s supervising. Very very poor management. Even the customers are noticing it’s not like it used to be. Worse place I have ever worked at."
bad,"There is usually no breaks in between calls and you must be in your seat for every second throughout your shift. Not a good stay at home job if you have kids. Bathroom breaks are highly discouraged. I understand from a business perspective trying to cut back ""Waste"" but these calls come non stop over your 5 hour shift with no room to breathe. It can really tear you down by the end of the day. The trainers are GREAT, upbeat, and very good at there job. Most managers are pretty nice as well. I excelled at this job but I couldn't take constantly being beaten down by calls every single day."
bad,"Supervisors are completely incompetent. They say one thing and do another when it came to issues. Team Leads are absolutely uneducated on Hazmat procedures and are high on drugs. Training was a disaster. 20 different people,including Leads/Supervisors telling new employees 20 different ways the jobs should be completed. It shouldnt have been such an issue teaching  employees an extremely simple job. Very immature group of employees,especially on second shift. Very cut throat and if you work too fast the employees will do everything to make sure you quit or get fired. Very immature work environment. Lack of competent management at Piney Flats location. Corporate needs to clean out the staff they have at Piney Flats."
bad,"If you're a diva, you'll fit right in. If you are inept, you'll fit right in. If you are pretty but have no brain, you'll fit right in. If you can compliment your boss without breaking a sweat, you'll fit right in."
bad,"The work was easy for the pay, but I have never worked in a place with such stuck up rude people before in my life..EVER. I thought getting paid 11 and hour my checks would be good, but i was wrong I only had 1 good paycheck. I would walk in being in a great mood, but when I tried smiling or even just making conversation, the people would just give you go to h*** looks for some odd reason, which start putting me in a bad mood and I hated that."
bad,"Managers are not concerned with helping you grow, sales managers used for service managers and do not know their job. Management very rarely answers a question, sometimes leaving one wondering if they are even working. Went through three managers in 3 months. Very cut throat on quality reviews, and not received the number of quality reviews we are supposed to. No matter how much you exceed or strive to be better, one slip up and you will be fired, write ups only drop off if your supervisor likes you and wants to pull for you to keep your job."
bad,The book cover looks good but the reading of the book disappointed and not as represented or no substance.  Bias and discriminator supervisor.  Likes cookie cutter employees to be just like her. I would not work for her again a waste of time moody and tempermental
bad,"I liked the associates I was working with made the day go by faster, the place lacked communication skills."
bad,"The job consists of a traditional schedule (5 days-40 hrs a week).  Don't be fooled by the fact that HSN is on television; it is simply just another call center that has a high turnover rate because the workload does not match the pitiful pay you will receive.  The pay sucks and even though the company offers 120 hours of time off (sick days are included and are not seperate); you go on a waitlist to have days off that 90% of the time don't become available. Long story short they give you the days and then make it impossible for you to take them.  Getting ahead has nothing to do with your job performance, but actually who you know.  There are people promoted to positions they are not qualified for while employees that would be better suited are passed over.  I've seen it happen repeatedly over the years I worked there.  The company only cares about making money and allows employees to be verbally abused by the customers that call in.  No matter what happens the customer is always right.  They will often even overlook their own policies to appease whiny, bratty customers that have learned to abuse the system over the years and you will be expected to do the same.  HSN is a horrible corporation.  It looks appealing from afar, but don't be fooled you'll basically be a low paid call center rep; just in a prettier building than you're probably used to.  The best thing about it were the friends I made while there, but I would never, ever recommend anyone with options to apply here."
bad,Local management finds it humerous to bully and humiliate sub-ordinates who make mistakes instead of helping them learn constructivey through their mistakes. Constant gossiping with a total lack of respect for confidentiality.
bad,The pay was horrible.  The best thing was being able to work from home.  That is it.  It was only part time and I needed more hours.  The discount was great for products.
bad,"Even  dough I learn a little bit, This job didn't training me  but I didn't give up I kept on trying. Some day I got it and other days I didn't get it. This I believe this job wont for me but I still work it."
bad,"dislike this company very much, they lie to their eomployees and customers. id rather not work for this company anymore"
bad,"No accountability, if your pc breaks they make you move to another but the other pc is never fixed, no assigned seats so you always feel like a guest or displaced, You can't leave anything at your desk because anyone can sit there. Feel like a vagabond. The commission is a joke, you get pennies on the sale and that only if you upsell them for what they called in to buy. IF not you get NADA!"
bad,I would never recommend anyone to work there.  The management were shady and everyone seemed to be overworked and under paid.  A typical work week consisted of 75-80 hours.
bad,"No room for advancement .  You get beat up every day from customers wanting free items and/or returns.  Customers know how to work the system and when you see a pattern with a certain customer, no one cares. Customers get more perks than the employees."
bad,"answer inbound calls"
bad,"Everyone I talked to about working at HSN always had very positive things to say about it. In retrospect, most of those people were talking about other various departments within the company, and not the actual call center. "
bad,I once took pride in working for HSN until we had an incident occur in which the company fired a temporary employee who had done nothing wrong. Management has really gone down hill the last few months and I'm quite disqusted. One week you may get 15 hours and the next 52. They make it nearly impossible to maintain a home & work life and are not fair when it comes to scheduling between shifts.
bad,"During the thorough training everything was upbeat and fun. But they don't tell you about strict call handling times and software that makes those times impossible. You are required to keep under impossible call handling times while maintaining quality assurance and sales. My supervisor ignored the few men on the team and worked for a sister company and had never taken an HSN call, yet was to coach us on them. She also could not provide things supervisors should, like where to get pay stubs, knowing your rate of pay, who to go to with questions. I was eventually wrongly terminated by her and am having her investigated."
bad,"After working for the company for over 3 years they fired me based off of unfounded rumors from other employees. Then, they tried to prevent me from getting jobs with other companies after they fired me. I wouldn't recommend them to my worst enemy."
bad,"The HSN work at home sales representative seemed like a great job for a student like me--I could save time and money without having to commute everyday, and could dive right into my studies.  The initial training was a lot of fun and I learned to bond with all of the employees and made friends.  It was nice to have the online chat system to keep in contact with other employees.  I transitioned to my team and began working all the time. I had several meetings with my supervisor, who told me all my numbers looked great and I was ""one of her stars on her team.""  The holiday rush came and went and shortly after the first of the year my supervisor was let go.  My team was split between many supervisors until we finally got a new supervisor at the end of February.  I met with my new supervisor sometime in the first week of March and we did introductions and he gave me the same praise, saying my numbers looked great, and I expressed concerns of lower than usual quality evaluations I had received since Christmas.  He assured me that he would help me(and everyone else because that seemed to be the trend), which was a sufficient answer.   He seemed great and really wanted to be there for the team to motivate and encourage.  About a week later, he asked me to call him again for a conference and I didn't think anything of it.  When I talked to him, he told me that several people had been flagged for shortened call times.  What? I had just been told the very week before that my number (one of which is my AHT) looked ""great.""  I was told my calls would be reviewed and we would talk about"
bad,"Some departments are really wonderful, others have shoddy management. Politics run amok. "
bad,"Had 3 to 4 weeks of online training, however, as soon as I was out of training and on the phones full time, all of the rules we learned in training changed, as they did on almost a monthly basis. I answered incoming calls from customers wishing to purchase items being aired on the HSN channel. Operators were required to complete all calls in an average of 3.6 minutes, which was almost impossible without being rude to the very people purchasing merchandise from HSN. My co-workers were very helpful and were one of the best parts of the job. Management and supervisory assistance was almost non-existent. I did enjoy talking with most of my customers. When I was let go, as badly as I needed the job, I was relieved"
bad,"I somehow ""slipped through the cracks"" during training and had no one show up to help me through.  Once I was able to catch up and started to do really well, I was unexpectedly let go from the job for having ""too many"" compliance marks against me.  The manager dropped the ball so it was her or me, and it turned out to be me who she let go."
bad,The hardest part of working at HSN is the constant repetitive heavy lifting and the other bad thing is the early starting hour. you have to get up at 2:30 in the morning to be at work at 4.
bad,"This was a temporary position, at HsN.."
bad,"Leadership micromanages and are so out of touch the regular person/customer.  They want to make all the decisions but when things don't work they just make their employees the scape goat. "
bad,"This could be a really good place to work. I do not believe however you can do great customer service in 3.00 minutes or less. You as a CS rep are penalized if you go over your AHT time. This is done by trying to resolve customer complaints and find the best outcome for the customer. Management is hostile for the most part. As long as your numbers are good, then you are the best, but if they drop , you drop in the manager's eyes. and you are treated very differently. Managers do not really care what you have to say about anything and if you dare to disagree in a polite way, then you are being argumentative.  Also they need to upgrade computer systems and processes to enable employees . You work every holiday with no additional compensation. You are also penalized if your call goes into your break time. You either do without a break or take it and cut your compliance way down."
bad,"In 1987 through 1989 when I worked for this company we were a small and fairly new company my co-workers and management were fun and kind to work with and for, however as they grew the management became distant from the employees. I was a customer service rep. answering phone calls and assisting customer with their accounts. I also filled in as an operator to take customers orders, the job was fun and I liked the customers and co-workers and management. (although few in numbers) if there was a day that weather conditions were bad or my children or I became sick the company would hold it against me and after so many times of not being able to come to work due to things beyond my control they let me go."
bad,"My comments only reflect the Live Show and Video Production segments of HSN: "
bad,Full time job with part time hours cause they never have work unless it's the holidays. Full of druggies and its overlooked. Poor management. Never live up to promises!!! Dead end job but better than McDonalds. Especially if you need a job
bad,"It did what it needed to for me... I'm not a home body so I was miserable. However, it was a great line on my resume giving me experience with a customer relations database and proper customer service etiquette."
bad,Its always back to back calls which is fine but i am also working another system along with hsns system and it constantly freezes my computer. No assistance. Loved working from home. Tried for a shift bid they wont approve it. Its. Not the happiest place i have ever worked
bad,"There's no praise for work well done, the customer have to record their own messages.  If you don't make the click, you can count on a witch hunt.  Don't count on this one."
bad,"It was a decent place to work, before they pretty much got rid of everyone and hired all temps. The company is now on the way to bankruptcy, so I really wouldn't apply."
bad,"This company is a those who play get ahead and those who work get treated poorly.  There are pets and no room for movement.  There are layoffs every year and it usually involves people that would shock you. The gossip is 'but they're such a strong employee!"" ""they work their tail off!""  Unless you know how to play the office politics game don't bother"
bad,"While being a new employee, we were told we were not working the Thanksgiving holiday and then we were told that we were off. A few days later we are told, sorry, but all new hires are working Thanksgiving. Very poor management and not ""mom friendly"". The training sessions are scheduled from 2-10:30, during the time frame that kids come home from school, spouses come home from work, and kids need picked up from daycare. Plus it is very difficult to keep a house full of people quiet while your on the phone for hours on end! Very frustrating!"
bad,"The job is great at first, but they give you very little sales training, train you on mostly customer service, tell you you'll only do backup sales and then it's all you do. You won't get any extra money per hour for doing extra work and you feel on edge every day going into work."
bad,"I was employed at HSN for about six months and I’ve never been at a job that was more unorganized. You would think a big corporate company I wouldn’t be a guinea pig but I was! No appreciation for your advancement, very negative management. And very unprofessional team structure, if you’re not best friends with your boss you won’t make it anywhere in this company. Expectations are unrealistic  and no type of training for the amount of work and stress. NOT WORTH IT"
bad,This company works on punish and little reward system.  Lowest paid hourly rate for Customer Service work at home reps other co’s paying $5.70 more per hour . Work you to death with back to back calls every single shift. Timed calls (expect CS resolution in under 3 minutes) write their reps up for Anything and Everything. They Fire reps for no good reason.
bad,Air the same products everyday. The Upper management does not care about the television aspect of HSN. And the Supervisors are lackadaisical. The production team works 7 out of the 8 hours broadcasted with a little 30 min break in there somewhere. Overworked and Underpaid.
bad,I was hired as a seasonal sales customer service rep.   This was the worst job ever!    The phones are non stop -- you can't even get a breath in before the next call comes in.     I couldn't stand the pace.  HSN is trying to squeeze the most of each and every minute.   This is like working in a call center in India.   I don't know what the mgt jobs are like but this is a tough job.....
bad,There are many talented people to work and learn from within the company. However there is very little opportunity for promotion and personal growth. It is a 24/7 a day job with very little work/life balance. Employees seem replaceable and undervalued.
bad,"I worked my butt off day in and day out for this company. Came in on my days off when they were short, so orders wouldn't fall behind. In the end they laid 125 of us off. I will never go back!"
bad,"Good place to work at! Very low hours. It does pay extremely well though and I do recommend working there. Does need better management though. $11 pay in Greeneville, TN."
bad,Ok when I first joined but after being bought out by QVC everything has changed and there is no direction. Everyhting is changing all the time. Most systems have incorrect data and we are all overworked lately. There is no clear direction of anything and very little help if you are a mom and need time off or work from home.
bad,"Hsn is a great company for retirees, college students, high school students, and stay at home moms."
bad,"Returns Coordinator, Inspected clothing items to make sure they have the proper presentation and packing requirements for the customer. Prepared items"
bad,Customer service managers micro manage. They will stand behind you and make comments while you are on a call. Department managers change often and existing work policies change drastically. Very little interaction among employees.
bad,"Executives do not care about employees at HSN. I rubbed shoulders with Vice President after Vice President and the few that had vision were under appreciated and smarty left the sinking ship. Everyone else in management is in a mad dash to grab any scrap that falls from the executive board. Managers at every level have no strategy for the future and no appreciation for the employees running operations day to day. It is the same bad idea recycled over and over again. "
bad,We just lost another receiving manager which makes it 3 in just 2 years and this guy was very good. True professionals dont just quit and leave their job just because. This is another example of Upper Management pushing people out who will truly challenge the status quo and try to make things better for the employees. Now we are left with a Supervisor who still is allowed to talk down to employees and who gossips about them with fellow supervisors in the office instead of being on the floor. HSN cares more about celebrities and the sales they bring rather than their warehouse employees. So many people feel this way but wont say nothing because of retaliation from some Supervisors and Upper Management.
bad,Plagued by long term mgt and employees who focus on making sure no progress happens and status quo remains
bad,I was fired then they lied to unemployment about the reason why. It was for compliance but they said it was for attendance. I didn't have proof or the company manual downloaded so I didn't have proof. I've worked for horrible companies but I've never worked for people who would lie like this.
bad,"Call times do not mesh with the business we are in. You are allowed 2.26 for customer service and 1.96 for sales. Management does  not care about the sales and customer service staff. If a call runs into your break time, you are penalized for this if you then take your break. I was hired as customer service and now am made to do sales as well"
bad,"Managment is incompetent, not very approchable, hardest part of job is no face to face people interaction & rude customers, programs use for performing job on the computer are very outdated."
bad,"A typical shift involves non-stop phone calls, averaging 35 to 45 per hour. Calls are a mixture of sales calls and customer service calls requiring fast knowledge of which department to access. There are many goals to be met on each shift."
bad,"No AC or heat. On your feet on hard floor. The building has asbestos. Very dirty. If you work till 8 pm they drag out the break times. Example: first brake 10:30, lunch 1pm, afternoon brake 3pm, last brake 6pm."
bad,"very stressful, unfriendly environment.  the people that work there are extreme in manners, that are very poor.  there are also a lot of racist issues while i was there.  the ""team leaders"" are lazy and do nothing at all except tell everyone to work more while they sit in their office and ride around on forklifts for looks."
bad,"For the most part the people that work there are like family to you, they are your lifeline.  As far as hsn itself your immediate managers (you will get moved around a lot I had 8 over 2 1/2 years)  are really nice or really mean their is no in between.  They really do not care about you as a person.  You are just a number, and just as easily replaceable.  I quit, I did not get fired.  And yes, I am rehire able but I will not go back.  Ever.  They screw you over 9n your paycheck, they screw you over on raises, for example, when you get your annual raise they will say it's. 30 and then after you get your .30 raise they will say, we'll we are having to raise our minimum amount paid due to minimum wage raising, but if you are already over that about you will not receive a raise.  So you don't actually get your raise,  you get nothing for your hard work that you put out, and someone who has been there for a month is getting paid the same hourly as you.  They change their policies on everything daily, and don't tell you about half of them.  So one month on a quality call you won't get dinged the next month you will.  Or you will get dinged but a coworker will not get dinged for the same thing.  They play favorites a lot.  They will pretend on the outside like it is great, but in reality it sucks.  They did pretty much give me the schedule I wanted though.  I chose it when I started working there."
bad,"	On air sales host, responsible for meeting or exceeding hourly sales goals while engaging customers with compelling sales presentations that effectively educate customers to inspire sales."
bad,"To provide context, I was a temp/contractor during my time there. As I’m sure 90% of readers here will be as well. It’s a decent enough job, honestly I kinda enjoyed it. But it’s a typical tycoon laundry pile really. They go through temps like underpants. In my case, they “forgot” that I had scheduled a day off three weeks in advance. It was approved and everything, handshake and all. Don’t expect to make it to the end of the contactor period."
bad,"It might look good, but it ain't. Find another company that you can get away with everything. Yeah you might get discounts BUT you will spend your whole check there."
bad,"This is a awful place to work. Some of the management was pleasant but most were unfair and hard to get along with. You never had consistent hours of work, You had good benefits but could not pay for them due to no hours."
bad,"My time with them was good. I was a Loss Prevention Officer. After some leadership rearrangement, the old manager was let go and they brought in a different guy who brought in another manager from a different HSN site. They swore to the department that we were not getting outsourced, no one was losing their job. However, during Thanksgiving week, we were told that our department was being outsourced and in order to get our severance package we had to stay and train the private company coming in. If we chose to stay with the contracted company, we lost over two dollars per hour and all of our benefits as the new company didn't offer anything. I loved the people I worked with, I just think that the situation could have been handled differently."
bad,"At HSN the rules and regulations were constantly changing. the pace is very fast paced with a very stressful work environment. The pay was good but to weigh out the good and the bad, the bad out weighs the good."
bad,"I loved my work, but there was little to no room for advancement. QVC recently acquired HSN, not all under the umbrella Qurate company, and any departmental redundancies are being done away with. Not a good time to join the company. Little to no job security."
bad,Management is lacking and they are not caring about employees only the bottom line. They hold technical issues against you even if it is i beyond your control.
bad,"Too Much Work Not Enough Money, Very UnOrganized from the Top! I wouldnt call this a real store no label for shelves a true liquidation store!! wanting to be a real retail store!"
bad,"They do not compensate your efforts in sales compared to the amount of money you are actually making them. They do have part time PTO but that still doesn't make up for the lack of incentive pay. If you're good at sales ,stay away."
bad,Had a big area for lunch with microwaves and refrigerators lots of tables and chairs to sit at water tanks and every work space fresh air running threw dock area
bad,"good working place, management is very supportive, job security, i a m working here since 2010, lost of experience gain, very helpful for future........."
bad,"This is one of the educational center.We provide all level tuition classes, languages and abroad study.We provide quality education for classes secondary level to Master degree and we are teaching many types of language as Nepali,Hindi,Urdu,English ,Japanoes,Korean etc.We comprate to sudents to study in foreign country"
bad,I wasn't to happy working for HSN because i was told i would get 60 hours and i was barely making 30 hours. So the hours sucked but i did make a few friends so i guess thats a plus.
bad,"A typical day was answering phone calls and trying to give bad news the nicest way possible, as well as try to answer questions about products you have never seen with very minimal information. Management tries to use review sessions to improve your work by making you point out all your own flaws, its degrading. In a full time shift you get only half an hour off the clock time, two rigidly scheduled 15 mintue breaks and about 5-10 minutes of other off the phone time, every minute you are on  the phone and off the phone is counted, so hope you dont have a stomach ache and need to use the bathroom more than during your breaks... it counts against you. Or if you get that unlucky call that takes up your entire 15min break, guess you dont get one then and its somehow your fault they took too long..."
good,"There is no communication between management and employees, the only thing is that is the benefits given to the employee. There is a lack of authority"
good,"Worked like a dog and abused daily. Quality monitoring is a joke. it's literally like rolling the dice. One day you receive a 100% for doing /saying something. The next time you are monitored and do the same thing, you might fail that call. There is no consistency among quality reps, supervisors, and management. You are expected to do whatever the customer wants at that moment, even though you are supposed to follow the company policies.They can fail you on whatever they want whenever they want. It is impossible to win. I have worked in many call centers for many years and have never seen any company run so terribly in all my years. You are given two 15 minute breaks. If you are on a call however, when it's your break time, they tell you not to take it. They will let you take it, but you will be penalized for your compliance stats which will eventually lead to termination. They do not care about you or their customers. It is NOT fun here."
good,"We moved to Tennessee and jobs are scarce so I was hired for the 9am to 9 PM shift. If you need a paycheck, its a great temp job but if your there for money or Advancement, don't bother. It's long hours standing on your feet and work is very fast and if you're older like me and out of shape, you will feel like your dying and you will hurt! The people are very nice but management treat you like your working in a sweat shop. Its all about the money, not the employee. They do offer decent benefits and PTO,  but that's the incentive since they have low wages. That's how they are able to keep long term employees. The turnover is large due to people either not serious about a job or find better employment. I needed the job, but was blessed when I was able to find another job with better pay and hours. You don't always work 12 hours but you never know when you will get off so there's no way you can make plans. If your young and no home life, its the job for you! I don't regret working at HSN but much happier with my new job!!"
good,Very hard job in a loud environment.The only thing good was the PTO hours were good.
good,"I worked the whole store customer service cashier open and closed the store , I would also work the truck put out merchandise but mainly ran the registers"
good,"Average pay even if you factor in WAH (work at home)"
good,sure the money is good at hsn. that's great but there's no flexibility when it comes to working schedule or working around one's life. Supervisors have forgotten how to be human.
good,I learned how to use an RF gun. That was pretty much all I learned to do. The enviorment wasn't pleasant at all. The overall experience was terrible to say the least.
good,offers some off and nice pto but expectations are a little unreasonable. Great for transitioning and good resume builder. No opportunity for advance like what is promoted during training. Very biased in who is promoted and also does not like to give fair chances to employees who out perform peers.
good,"Typical day includes reviewing emails/phone messages/day events/meetings with my exec each morning and evening."
good,The management really seems disconnected from the employees but tries to make it seem like they care. My first supervisor was nice but in a fake way and then she ended up screwing me over when it came to me missing work due to a medical issue and she gave me the wrong information and then when I did what she told me to do she denied that she had ever told me that.
good,"Great pay during busy season, easy job if you can lift weight and tolerate the ignorant management. Easy to get hired in if you actually work. Work conditions a little unsafe due to no heat, air, or ventilation."
good,"Working At HSN has been something short of UNBELIEVABLE!!!! Never in my 20 years working in call center have I ever worked a position to where when there are no calls in queue your peer mentors and mgmt will call into the queue and create customer interactions with test dummy accounts and make fake customer interactions. As a representative you are aware while in training that this type of scenario goes on to assist you and preparing you to take calls which is great but once graduated on to the floor you would think that this dosent happen. Issue is that once you are in production these calls come in when the call volume is low and instead of making reps take CV or VTO to help offset the number of reps on the phone they prank call you to keep you on your toes and to keep you believing that you are interacting with customers but of course there a tell tell signs that you are being pranked they use the same personality and background noises so you know you are speaking with the same group of people. Sometimes these calls are unfair especially if you are struggling with AHT or compliance and you have these ACTORS keeping you on the phone, trying to keep you off task, humiliating you, stressing  you out, and creating unrealistic situations and when reaching out to second level support half of them have attitudes like they dont want to assist or give you pushback for help just bad team effort all together. I dont think that these interactions are fair or designed to help you but hinder your performance and stats as these call do count against you. Not a very good place to work. Everything"
good,Once my direct report supervisor left the company it became a hostile work environment. The only nice thing about being an HSN employee was the really great discounts you get on their products.
good,"Answering inbound calls, sales/up sells, billing, appointment scheduling. Assisting other representatives with questions, floor walker, escalations or supervisor calls. Interacting with other departments to assure we meet the customer’s needs in a timely manner."
good,I get a lot of exercise job requires a lot of walking.learned how to use rf gun.work with a lot of nice people
good,"I worked during the start-up under a different management culture. I served as a vendor under new owners, and my buyer turnover was outragous. It may be better now, thought they continue to be #2 in the market."
good,So many changes have been implemented that it's no longer the same company as when I started. Working from home is the best advantage of this job. WAH employees are treated differently from the on campus employees
good,Typical day was working with a small team to create an in-house hosted version of the existing blog using WordPress.  I learned much about theme creation and plug-ins.  Culture is seemed good however I was a contractor and left out of open discussion meetings.  I enjoyed my team and wanted to go full time but the budget did not allow for that.
good,"great benefits, they offer a good starting pay with annual review and pay increase based on performance. Very fast past environment Work from home is great"
good,"This was 9nly a temporary job for me, the manager I was under was fired shortly after I left so I have no real information about this company currently."
good,"Hours worked depended on the allocation for the day, you did not know if you would be working 10 hrs. for that day or less until you got there and the meeting was held at beginning of shift. You had no certain position that you were assigned to on a permanently basis it was assigned each morning.  It is a total metal free facility so as far as ones apparel you could wear your pajamas to work if you wanted to. Certain outfits was not allowed but really not enforced.  As far as management, some supervisors was nice and treated employees with respect and others not so much. Sometimes it would feel as managements left hand did not know what their right hand was doing. "
good,"inbound 100 plus calls a day"
good,"The money is decent, however work and home life balance is not there. They require all weekend days and holidays to be worked, even after 4 years of employement, I could not get a single weekend day off."
good,"Overall I loved the experience and opportunities I recieved. Management should really start to pay attention to the employees,   so much great talent."
good,Majority of management is very helpful on a day to day basis. There is a lot of favoritism when it comes to upper management. A few  management positions have been eliminated over the years putting more stress and work on individuals in similar positions. working +12 hours a day as a salaried employee with 0 appreciation or compensation is unrealistic.
good,"I enjoyed working at HSN the time that I did. I worked twelve hour shifts. A typical day was very tiring, I learned how to package items and label them so they were ready to be shipped. I got to meet new people some of which I still talk to today. Management was friendly and helpful."
good,It started well but the manager in charge of me just seemed not to like me. Made me feel super uncomfortable. 
good,very large call center
good,I liked working at HSN but was not challenged enough. I also found that they lack the will to increase their market share by utilizing modern technology. Benefits and compensation are okay but not par with market rates. But they do allow for a better work life balance than most businesses in the Tampa Bay area. They tended to look the other way if you took a long lunch provided you got your work completed.
good,"Great place to work, Most wonderful group of people I have ever been fortunate enough to work with and I miss the crew and camaraderie every day. Happy to this day to still call most of them friends"
good,Was challenging everyday loved the sales part of job an being able to help the customer with one call solution if at all possible Was one of the top upsellers
good,"Used to be better. Not sure where this company is going, likely not going to be here in the long run. Senior leadership is lost and likely wont get any better."
good,"I have not been recognized with advancement for the work I developed and coached for the sales incentive program.  I feel used and not benefiting for more money or advancing position.  For all that is said about openness for new ideas, they continue to show favoritism despite time put in or effort."
good,"I worked for the company for almost 8 months before they fired me for my compliance and quality(time on the phone and how I handled the call)...  I worked from home and loved it at first but then going to work became a chore and miserable. The entire Christmas season was miserable and non stop back to back calls, most of which were rude customers calling to yell and tell you how useless you were.. it is a very hard company to work for.. The pay was oaky, I started out at 12$ with no previous call center experience. The health insurance wad expensive and not really worth it, and sometimes the discount was not worth it either. As an employee you can't use coupons or things like that either. They started micromanging every little thing they could and it got to be annoying more than anything."
good,"I would take inbound calls and place orders for their customers. I would also do small customer service issues. I learned the value of having patience with people a lot more. I loved that I was able to work from home and not have to deal with traffic. The hardest part of the job was trying to work with a system that wasn't always up to par. I can say that even though I've never met any of my co-workers, I have built a lasting friendship with a lot of them."
good,Lots of Orders to pack. Management is okay. Good co-workers. Hardest thingTrying to meet your quota. Lots of different kind of people.
good,"Micromanagment at its finest, Senior Managers do not trust staff to complete work. There is no collaboration or opportunity to advance"
good,Nice perks but not much money.   Good starter job!  Customer service is never easy and being on the phones can be tough.  Benefits are expensive.
good,"Good environment, good support teams, place for freshers to learn good things, nice management to employee relationship"
good,"Hours are not steady, health care is great. co-workes can be catty and childish, ALOT of stress is put on you. Management is ok some better than others. The hardest part is working 12 hour day 6 days a week on your feet all day 3 months out of the year."
good,"I worked as a Master Control Operator at HSN for a combined total of 12 years. I was laid off around 2008, then placed into Freelance and then rehired as a Production Tech II in 2009."
good,Great learning in a very different type of retail.  The ability to change quickly and react is critical to success. 
good,While working as HSN I have learned so many things not only about retail television but myself in the process. No two days were alike and I learned to adapt to the fast pace quickly. My co workers have been supportive and would give praise. The hardest part about the job was the stress of a 24/7 environment with a reasonable work life balance. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with very talented people in the merchandising field and learning from them to further my career.
good,"Over past three years, I have learned alot and have enjoyed becoming part of the HSN family..I love enteracting with employees as well as managment...I spend my day entering data and reporting, the hardest part of my job is the long hours and the little pay.."
good,"I had a few great years at HSN. After that, meh. Things shifted and it became much less relaxed, much more corporate - even as the company thrived."
good,"I work from home taking incoming sales calls from customers from around the United States. I have learned about different personalities, how to provide customer service. I have never met my co-workers because we all work from home; however we do have instant messaging we communicate that way. The hardest part of my job, is dealing and trying to help a very upset customer. The wonderful thing about my job is when I am able to help a customer out by locating and researching items that they are looking for."
good,"The only thing I enjoyed about working at HSN was the ability to work from home and the employee discount. You are back to back with phone calls all day from rude customers and there is no job advancement opportunities if you work from home. The pay is low even after being with the company for awhile, new hires can make more than tenured employees in the same position which seems unfair."
good,My first 6 years were very dynamic with the ability to develop new products and grow sales and categories.  Executive mgt changed and everything stops and became a stress point with unreasonable expectations.
good,KPI's are are not realistic. Team chats is what keep you going. Sales reps are not valued how they should be. Stop the micromanaging. Take the sales rep suggestions on how the calls should be handle since we are the one's on the phone dealing with the customer's and watch the business grow much faster.
good,"I clock in and I never know what kind of problems will be facing me throughout the day. Since this is a call center environment, the calls come in constantly. I answer them and then determine if they are ordering a new item or if they are calling about questions with an item they have received. We have to be up to date with procedures and products so that we can upsell products. I take orders while also giving the best customer service possible. This is a work at home position. We speak to our manager about once a month. We have to adhere to extremely strict kpi measurements on calls. The hardest part of the job would be that they constantly change the systems. Once you get used to one, they change it again. We have great coworkers. We see each other during a chat app we are allowed to use while we are working, between calls. The most enjoyable aspect has been to wok at home for 6 years. That has begun to take its toll though,"
good,Management was okay but could have been more adequate.  Work hours were okay.  Difficult to really get a handle on average handle time.
good,"the local managment was great, corporate did not care for employees(commodity) biggest minus for me, 98% of what they sell is from china."
good,I enjoyed working with customers with their needs and/or concerns.
good,"The systems used for sales and calls are archaic. They have merged wit QVC who has a much better and advanced system yet HSN is still relying on a handset connected to a phone to receive calls. Meanwhile, QVC is completely modern with order information being given on FB messenger. HSN is drowning and has been going straight downhill since it was acquired by QVC. Motto was it's fun here. It was from far from fun. At least after my 1st year and the merger."
good,"The pay is okay for at home work however,  no job advancement is available. The position was strictly seasonal and the managers don't really help much when it comes to improving performance. Also calls are targeted to be between 3-6 minutes each, this can get stressful depending on which issues you are handling. There are no benefits available or time off. The most enjoyable thing about the job itself is the ability to work form home. The pay should be more but the job is really simple for the most part."
good,"HSN has become increasingly sales oriented for the Customer Service Reps, having to upsell customers who call in. Customers often are very verbally offensive to the agents. Glad was able to get off the phones when I did but that department was shut down."
good,Very little chance for advancement.  Minimal choice of days or hours to work.  Only a half hour for lunch no matter how many hours you are scheduled.  Major holidays they are closed.
good,"Stay busy and pace yourself. Make sure you use your paid time off wisely.Be ready to multitask and work long extended hours.You'll discover challenges that excite you as you develop professionally and explore many career paths based on your interests and abilities. We reward ambitious, talented individuals with a work environment that fosters teamwork and collaboration while encouraging innovative ideas and fresh thinking. You will work in our product and technology teams or in any role across the globe, you’ll play a part in designing and launching industry-leading products"
good,"You don't get any extra time to dilly. You must be on the point at all times. That includes being prompt, hitting every mark on every call like keeping it under 2 mins. Good luck with all that. Once you have learned how they want it done, it will change. The rewards for the sales you make will change. Management sucks. My manager wasn't  too bad buy there are horror stories. It's cool to work at home. The benefits are good. But if you can't live up to what they want - pack it up."
good,long hours walking around filling peoples shipments then restocking the bins. Making sure the items are in the right places if not finding and moving them to the new spot.
good,"I love working for this company. It truly is a fun place to work; however, as far as getting information or working with your management, it can get extremely frustrating. There are great people that work with this company & overall it is a fun place to work!"
good,inbound customer service and care with online orders from clients; work environment was nice and clean
good,A great place to work.  I really loved my job.  I learned a great deal while working here as well as a great deal about people.
good,its a great job i had but had to quit because of my schedule. no hours sometimes 2 hours a day
good,The days were 3 days one week and 4 days the next 10 - 12 hour days. I loved packing the merchandise
good,When there was work. The day went smooth. Also it has been over 10 years since I have work there. I don't remember anything about it.
good,"Very fast paced environment, strict guidelines, heavy quality control."
good,This is where I gained most of my Customer Service experience. I learned how to engage customers and how to respond to their needs. Also listened and offered suggestions to customers in order to exceed their needs and expectations.
good,Good job friendly environment they do ask to move at a fast pace but all in all it is a good job pays good they have a place to get something to eat if desired
good,"HSN does a lot for their employees. Their always doing something, whether it's free treats, free lunch or a celebrity showing love. The job was very easy unfortunately for the amount of work they give us, we should be paid a lot more."
good,"Work culture needs improvements"
good,very quick with incoming calls constantly over 80m to one hundred calls a shift. must be a people person and a problem solver. ability to resolve customer request
good,"Just covered-see previous page completed. Handle everything under the sun customer services & sales positions require. Selling, resolving problems, answering questions. Clarifying billing received, help them get caught up on outstanding payments due."
good,"When i worked at HSN i was hired on as a seasonal worker and worked at/on an assembly line and would perform the same task over and over until we got breaks or the task at hand was finished. I would sort and manage packaging and also load a trailer with packages, i worked different stations every night just depending on where management wanted to put me."
good,"HSN does good vetting of their products so you are representing good merchandise. Good training for position. Have Convenience Leave so you can take off during work day if not busy and not be punished for it. Have regular meetings w/your team lead that are meant to be helpful & the team leads are helpful and concerned. It is just hard to keep up w/all 3 categories of the company metrics, which are Call Handling, Quality & Compliance. If I would get 2 categories in place the 3rd one would not be."
good,"My experience as functional and technical resource for large corporations like Oracle, CSC and IBM as well as independent contractor has established me in Oracle's data warehousing, analytic and business intelligence applications. I have extensively worked with various OLTP data sources such as EBS, PeopleSoft and SAP with hands-on experience with Oracle Fusion applications."
good,. The hardest part of the job was knowing that the Mgmt was making the wrong decisions and we were going to have to redo the work again due to the fact they didn't listen to get the information to make the right decision.
good,It was a great place to work and the office management associates were very nice and friendly. It felt like being  part of a family. A nice fast paced environment.The day just flew by.
good,Overall the company and position was decent.  The pay was decent  also. The benefits were definitely decent and company discounts were nice.  I would recommend for those that  have the ability to work around a families schedule.. This was hard for me to do.
good,I enjoyed the time I spent at HSN though I believe a lot has changed since then. It has been nearly eleven years since I worked there.
good,"If you like call center work this is a good paying, steady job. It's all about the numbers and you are reviewed often on your call center skills and results"
good,I enjoyed working for this company doing customer skills and seeing all the nice items you can call in to order off line they had nice things
good,HSN is a great place to work if you are ok with customer service. The job is not hard and there are many areas of growth. The company encourages growth.
good,Lacked in leadership and developing employees to move further on in career. Was not very open to ideas and often overlooked employees who worked very hard.
good,Great place to learn cable terms and technology.  Cable industry suffers often from tough competition making it hard to stay in the game.
good,I have learned to multi task in many jobs. Met some really wonderful people inside the company and out which has made me a more social person.
good,A great place to work especially if you want to work from home! I was able to process order for incoming calls from customers and assisted  on purchasing items from online.
good,No potential for growth. low pay and you must work weekends. Call volume is very intense and the job can get stressful. The hardest part of the job would be keeping your numbers and metrics in good standing each month.
good,At first this seemed like a very promising job. Once you make it past training it becomes very hard to meet the expectations of this company. They want you to offer many up-sells and make customers happy all while trying to rush them off the phone in a timely manner.
good,Mainly interested in short term gains.  Was told not to be a visionary.  Very heavy CYA climate.  trying to compete with QVC.
good,Drove a forklift to pull orders.  Worked on the assembly line to fill orders and package them.  Handle the inventory data for my shift.
good,"A typical day at HSN includes answering phones to take customer orders and entering their data on the computer. I enjoyed this job greatly except for the management. I enjoyed most of my co-workers with the exception of one. The hardest part of working for HSN is trying to keep your call time within their expectations and getting rid of a prank caller without being rude. Another difficult part is that not only are you doing the job you are assigned to do, you are also doing the job of customer service. You must solve customer complaints yourself by trying not to send them to customer service unless they specifically ask. Also along with taking orders you must sign customers up for credit cards through HSN if they desire to do so. The most enjoyable part of the job was upselling and making the extra money that comes along with it. Training was also great because it gave you a break at times."
good,This company has a lot of teamwork. Even when work was slow they always found a way to get our hours in.
good,"Was able to help out customers with there purchases. Also, upsold products."
good,"While employed at HSN I found the money to be a good insensitive for the requirements in which you will have to  endure.The  work was easy although, the mandatory pace for the production work was crucial. I was happy to be employed by HSN at the time. It has the potential to be a wonderful stepping stone for the right applicants, if you can handle the daily metal detectors, working with seasoned workers, and an extremely fast paced  production work."
good,I learned the ins and outs of sales and customer service I advanced quickly.
good,"Support staff was great to work with, experience was great its allowed me to move forward in my career and I have networked with many of the staff."
good,better pay and hours the job is not for a life job or to make a good living on.
good,Great place for a non single parent who needs to work slot of overtime the opportunity was always there for overtime. Supervisors were nice as well as management. HR lady was stuck up and didn’t ever follow through with what she needed to
good,"Change is great when it is purposeful, reasonable, and makes sense. Change because that's the way it is somewhere else, not so much. Hours can be varied. Sometimes you live on overtime, sometimes you have to use PTO to have a full check."
good,It just is not the same since acquired by QVC.-the new Qurate Retail Group. There are a lot of chiefs and I have been unsure of how or why decisions are made.
good,"I started this job during the holidays and the hours and pay was great, however that was over in January.  Great part time job...not for a single income individual...not enough money"
good,I think it's a very good place work great benefits good people to work for very fast pace . They have a lot of options to move up in the company and good pay.
good,"Nice discounts and PTO.  Unrealistic time standards. Upper management is hyper-critical and micro-manages all aspects of the job, including supervisors directly below them"
good,"Very nice environment in call center 2001-2005.  Very nice Team managers and supervisors. Fun Company at the time I worked there and overall great Supervisors. It is a cheerful and inclusive workplace, at the time I was there. Company seemed to be concerned for your success and it was very much involved in the growth of each of its employees."
good,"For those who enjoy people interaction, this is a good job choice. Must be very quick as there is much pressure to complete calls in a limited amount of time. Unfortunately, some calls require more time depend"
good,"An excellent platform to execute your ideas. "
good,"Worked there for over a year, I left for another job. The beginning they butter it up and hold your hand, then it's go time. Any technical issues or any time off the phone you have to enter in an exception or your adherence will be off it must stay at 98% which is basically taking calls when scheduled and breaks. The scheduling is the best part about HSN, u can put in temporary schedule changes or split shifts and they always approve. There is always vto."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was when supervisors recognize your hard work!! excellent co-workers environment. The hardest part of the job were the short hours and pay rate.
good,"i would clock in and out each day and for lunches.I went either to rework or receiving depending on where i was needed for the day,management wasn't very organized so it was very hectic and made my hours be cut.."
good,If you like constant variety and a 24/7 job you will like working here.
good,"Constantly on phones taking incoming calls for returns, exchanges, personal information changes and sales."
good,"I was impressed with the training I took over the phone from home with a virtual classroom. The work hours were great, as a part time job. I kept in touch online and over the phone with co-workers and management."
good,"They did everything they could to make the workplace enjoyable. But if you express interest in moving up, they will do everything they can to make sure you cant."
good,Very resonable. Very good on hours. Co-workers were very supportive and worked well in team
good,"I found this job to be a job that was very stressful as far as how you go about your day to day activity while working, however I found it fun to see the celebrities walk through the call center. It was also rewarding to be given the chance to win prizes and products, also to be able to receive samples and insight into the products that were being sold to assist with selling to the customers."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at what I called ""the Wild West of retail"".  I only left because I was ready for me but they were not quite there yet & I wasn't waiting anymore."
good,"some customer calls were okay but for the most part, customers were rude and they lie a lot. I've never talked to so many liars in my life. The nice callers were few and far in between. Calls were back to  back which could get stressful at times, especially if the calls were annoying."
good,If your looking for a place that will hire you with no experience great place to get started. Just keep to your self this place have  talkers and will start rumors so fast and by the time you get to explain your self your no longer employed. But if you stay to your self its a great place to work
good,"Typical day at work off cause hard work sometime slow and we usually worked 8hrs overtime mandatory."
good,"Having survived the influx of tons of customer support calls with successfully product sale placement over the phone while viewing in the distance, the actual live TV broadcast."
good,I enjoyed the way they handled the scheduling. Pay was good benefits were awesome. I can complain. other than them being not so understanding when the loa team messes things up.
good,good place to work overall. stay to yourself and do the best that you can. great opportunity if someone is looking for stable employment
good,A lot of great talents are leaving this company. Due to being overworked and underpaid. Management isn't very supportive at all and there has been quite a few lay offs.
good,Training was excellent. Great benefits. Offers mostly over night shifts before you can move up to day shift. Pay was reasonable.
good,"Serve as an integral part of the recruiting structure at Cornerstone Services. Recruit and conduct all aspects of recruiting for call center and distribution associate positions. "
good,Working from home is very rewarding.  The company has a very strong vision of the future.  It's a high stress position with both customer interactions and making KPI's.
good,A typical day at HSN is taking approximately 100 phone calls per shift. I learned to not take negative calls personal.  The hardest part of the job was not being able to make every customer happy. The most enjoyable was working from home.
good,"A typical day of working at HSN well...  Most of their shifts you start at are in the afternoon. So, I worked 3-11:30. I enjoyed that shift I liked being able to sleep it. The guards at the gate to get in were always pleasant, finding parking was usually a nightmare. So, you'd have to show up a few minutes early to find parking. Then you'd get 5 minutes to check-in. Every second after that is recorded, You take your break more than 3 minutes late or early and you're penalized. It's not that hard to manage. "
good,"Home shopping is a nice place to work as long as you are physically capable of standing for 10-12 hours 6 days a week. The shift leaders are decent, one must try to keep their daily production in positive numbers in order to get incentive pay. Being prompt for work is highly recommended."
good,"I did not enjoy working here. Its was very hard dealing with the working atmosphere and I felt that it was impossible to advance out of the call center, which I wanted to do."
good,"i worked here for only a short time as a customer service and sales rep. Training was thorough and everyone seems to be helpful and polite. Seeing celebs is always a nice rush at work too. Overtime is offered a lot around the holidays when i worked. Expectations are clearly expressed. Lots of discounts are offered and the workday can fly by on busy days. Get used to communicating with management via emails and on the phone, HSN is huge and it's possible not to SEE your managers for days. You will deal with great customers as well as infuriating customers as you can find yourself taking heat for a previous rep's mistake, all part of customer service."
good,I was never sure of how many hours a day.  I am needing full time work with benefits. I enjoyed the back of the line but not the processing.  I could not pick up my pace.  That was not a good fit.
good,"This position was difficult. They required us to work Saturday over-time every week, which cut into time for friends, etc. Working until 1am was stressful."
good,the job was very easy but at times difficult. the management helps anytime they can and knew their jobs. everyone i worked with was friendly. the hardest part of the job was walking around the warehouse
good,"A typical night at work was spent answering call after call from home viewers watching HSN.  Management was very supportive.  Hardest part of the job, was just sometimes the volume of calls received."
good,"Many life experiences"
good,"It can get reall hecked at time, especially during the holidays. Customer can be very aggressive and angry and violent. Pace picks up without warning and you have to be on top of things to satisfy the customer in a timely manner."
good,"Sometimes busy, how many people shop via television,great co workers,maintaining sales quotas,loved talking to customers"
good,Loved working at HSN great company and empolyees. Some of the bosses don't do exactly what they should and could cause the employee to suffer.
good,no not really its a cs job in a bland environment.   Don't believe the hype its very hard to bonus.   If you get a decent manager it makes it tolerable unfortunately they are few and far between.  One gal pinky had her desk decorated in pink to celebrate her victory over cancer.  After taking picks and showing it on their website to show their support.  They made everyone take everything personal off their cubicles.  I lost respect for HSN at that point.
good,Worked independent daily in an area of the warehouse as a team effort to cycle count the inventory quarterly.
good,"The training was great, but the escalation process leaves some things to be desired. Daily changes in process are not explained or communicated well. Employees are sometimes left to their own devices."
good,"It is micro managed and you get points off for being off the phone if you are not scheduled to be off. like if you need to use the bathroom and its not on your scheduled break time..they ding you for points for being off the phone when you gotta go.  they check your time handling of the calls. which you do want to get the cust off asap but also be helpful. also they make you apologize several times on the call. other than that its a good place to work. they keep it competitive with draws or games to win, plus the discount is awesome."
good,Love the customers. Job was rewarding and was able to help customers make payments and manage their credit union accounts  The company started to slowly make changes to what they offered to their agents. This quickly became a company that was and is only concerned with the top employees. Very Sad...
good,loved working from home. Training was good. The hours that were available limited but being able to set your own hours was great.
good,"A typical day involved prepping for live shows and gathering all the information you can. Once on your show, it was pretty regular as far as duties performed. I spent a lot of time as a Vacation Relief tech and that meant a lot of time at each individual station. Post show recaps and meetings follow each shift in which problems are identified and kudos are handed out. The work was fun, but always seemed as though the upper management either had no idea what they were actually doing or they were quick to attack the crew for any (imagined) slight. Having a good group of friends or friendly people there makes a world of difference."
good,One must devote their life and lots of time here. It was a nice environment. Training was a little rough because you are learning everything before you actually have to use it so it take a while to adjust to the ways of working there.
good,HSN is going through a takeover and it is less fun as the process takes place. Many new changes and rules. Overall it is a great fun job. I  am a on air model so my work is always fun.
good,A typical day for a sales and service rep is a fast past environment with inbound calls. The training is good and prepares you for you to perform the job successfully. There are bonus/rewards for the amount of calls completed and upsells.
good,"Great job and benefits. Drama was too much. Supervisors and line leads have favorites and they dont hide it very well. New speed lines are not safe. Watch your hair and fingers. Time off , pay and benefits were the only good thing about this job."
good,"Need something with a better work life balance and also more Advancement opportunities for family support as well. Learned work at home systems, how to take and direct calls. The most difficult part is dealing with back to back unhappy callers. Best part is working at home."
good,"I helped customers shop, make returns, refunds, tracked goods, etc. HSN wanted every call to be 2.26 minutes which is nearly impossible when you are helping a woman shop for a dress!"
good,Assisted customers with whatever they needed. Worked in a timely and efficient manner. Worked from home so no co-worker experience. Hardest part was hearing a problem that was out of HSN's control and could not do anything to fix it. I love getting to talk to such amazing and gracious customers.
good,Management is very different from previous jobs but i love it. I love the employees that i work with it’s a great work environment. Everyone is open and nice.
good,HSN has a fun workplace culture and cares about there customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking with my clients and helping them to purchase just the right item for themselves or for gifts.
good,"Interesting place to work.  Imagine being responsible for analysis of promotions for products that are sold on a time on air basis on a twenty four hours a day, seven days a week, while changing times and days. "
good,"Home Shopping Network or HSN is a 24-hour basic shopping television network that can be seen on cable, satellite, and TV channels in the United States. The company also operates HSN.com, an e-commerce operation."
good,Expect to be lied to by management they will tell you one thing and then take away any hopes of advancement. This doesnt matter what department you work for.
good,"This was a very good company. when it was bought out .A lot of people was laid off. I was one of them..It is now known as QBC . I'm sure they are a good company  to work for,Now that they are getting settled in"
good,There is some bias and favoritism there but overall it isn't too bad.  They don't adjust the work schedule and that is why I am unfortunately leaving.
good,"This was my first Work-at-Home jobs.  The idea is great, I just got stuck with the late evening hours.  My schedule block was 7pm-1am.  The job is easy enough.  It's good to have thick skin and understand, the customer isn't angry at you personally.  Make faces at them silently if it helps, just don't let it come through in your voice.  That's honestly where it went bad for me.  After about a year and half, I just couldn't hold back and was heard saying some things in a less than pleasant way.  So we agreed it was time to part ways.  The worst thing with this position at HSN is the same as many companies have started doing.  There is no full time.  All employees in this position are part time.  Not that many could take it full time to be honest.  But you will not have benefits other than paid time off.  Which was a good amount.  That's it though.  And the discount.  Which was worth it even though I'm a large man and 99.9999% of their customers are woman.  I still found plenty of things that I could use, and still do."
good,"A great place to work around with flexible hours. Can work and teach yourself along the way without too much supervision. If there was any problem, there was nothing that could not be personally solved to improve the efficiency of the business."
good,"I took my job very serious. I liked a lot about the company as a whole,but there was somethings I didn't agree with. I liked how we made an incentive so that gave us a chance to make a little extra money. And I loved how we could listen to our own music which always makes the workday go by faster."
good,"This is not relevant to posting my resume. I will not continue to complete this due to lack of relevance.  Perhaps if I understood why this was required, but I it isn't."
good,"When I worked for this company a few years back I fell in love. The support was wonderful some office politics were present, but overall I loved coming into this job every single day."
good,I enjoyed working with the public who called in to order products. I received very good training however the hours (8p.m-4:30a.m.) was very difficult to handle while trying to raise 4 children at the time.
good,"job training was very fast past rushed"
good,Good company to work for. Comprehensive benefits package. Advancement opportunities. Hardest part of job was walking for 12 hours
good,"You take inbound sales and some customer service calls.  You ask the customer what they want to order and once you have that, you are expected to off accessories (upsells) to go with their purchase.  You are rated on call time. You are required to have a certain percentage of upsells in a month. They do rate your calls from 1 to 3 times a month to make sure you are doing your job within HSN specifications. Management is ok. "
good,I love it. Discounts are great and so are the people. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
good,"It's a good place to work if you like dealing with customers and don't mind selling the same things on a 45-60 day rotation.  The customers are usually great 10 months out of the year - during the holidays....not so much, but if you can deal with that stress, it's a breeze.  "
good,"Fun and fast paced."
good,Taking customer orders and assisting them with locating items by phone.
good,"Good work-life balance"
good,"HSN is very structured and repetitive. It is similar to a well-oiled machine! Difficult to advance upwards, but there are plenty of opportunities to try. Management staff is helpful, but I did not feel challenged at this job."
good,"I enjoyed working at HSN, I worked from home and had a flexible schedule. We only had to go into the office once a month to work and talk with our supervisor."
good,"I have gained tremendous experience working for HSN.  The people I work with I have grown to care about very much.  However I feel this company has communication issues between each department that prohibits it from truly thriving.  I really enjoy working here, however, I need a change because I feel that there are few advancement opportunities that I would be interested in here.  I also have worked from 4pm-12:30am for the past 3 years without weekends off and I would like to change that."
good,Management and co-worker are eager to help you maximize your true potential.
good,"My day started at 5am and didn't end till 330.We stayed pretty busy,your on production so u have to keep moving.My job wasn't to hard at all it was one of the easiest in the warehouse.The supervisor was a nice laid back person if you were doing your job just like any other manger or supervisor would be."
good,Management is really friendly. They have many events that show employee appreciation
good,Took Customer Service/Sales related calls
good,Test drive it you either love it or hate it. For customer service representatives its a non stop phone call after phone call type position but its actually very interesting how everything comes together to run the streamlined process.
good,"HSN is a very productive company! It is fun to shop and meet people from all over the world! Their benefits and perks are the best that I have seen in any job! You will meet so many friends from all walks of life! You will may friendships that will last a lifetime! They offer lots of incentives for excelling on your job! Most importantly you can work from home! They have an excellent 401k plan, medical issues, and long-term and short-term disability programs. Upper management is awesome!"
good,I learned more than i could ever imagine working here. i expanded myself for my future here. a fun place to work. they have great benefits and vacation time is amazing.
good,"Develop the live show execution strategy for respective categories"
good,I truly enjoyed working for HSN although it was only temporary it was a very pleasurable experience.  I only wish that it had been more of a permanent position. It is very fast paced but your trainers really take the time to make sure that you know the material needed and coach you so that you can improve on the things that you're not as confident about
good,Understaffed was always an issue. Enjoyed the people I worked with and most of the management but the lack of respect from some made it tough. Never being fully staffed routinely would work 10 hour shifts without lunch or breaks.
good,"Team meeting - brainstorming sessions"
good,Very fast paced environment focused on answering customer questions and completing tasks.  High turn over rate due to strict rules pertaining efficiency.
good,"A typical day consists of customers calling wanting to know about the different products being advertised & wanting to place orders."
good,A typical day at work would be to handle one hundred or so calls as smoothly as possible while presenting the HSN brand in a positive light. Co-workers and management were very helpful. Unfortunately they close their call center in 2014.
good,"HSN is a dynamic place to work, especially for the Tampa Bay area. Growth is challenging in certain departments."
good,This is a great company to have worked for '  we had all the tools and equipment plus parts we needed to do the job .  We worked long hours between 12 and 18 hour days .  we were always on ' On call static . This is a Hight Stress  and fast pace company ' reason is to asure that our customers recieved a great experieance allowing HSN handle all their needs .
good,Log on system and into the phone for inbound calls. I learned all the products that HSN offered and to work with customers. we had meetings each week with supervisor to discuss and learn things of value while on the phone. This was very helpful.
good,always working as a team to get the work orders out. Co- workers were great fast pace work enviorment.
good,"HSN is extremely busy, so a candidate must be able to multi-task for a 24 hour live television network. The employee will be expected to carry a company phone and work odd hours weekly. The sales portion of this position is extremely stressful as you  have sales goals to meet, but if you are a positive and ambitious you can hit your quotas. It's warp speed fast and so, the employee should be ready for anything on TV happening at anytime during the day or middle of the night. It is a super, super fun company and the position of Buyer and Planner is great!"
good,"Incoming sales calls come in back to back. If you don’t like a fast paced, high pressure environment while being continually micro-managed, consider looking elsewhere. Good benefits package including all the basics plus 401k as well as discounts. Great people to work with."
good,Overall great company to be employed with. Management can be alittle rough but nothing terrible.  Wish the warehouse wasnt closing. Decent pay and benefits. Training is top notch and safety is always the top priority.
good,"It is a pretty laid-back but strong work environment and I would be willing to work here until I retired, but the career path I want to follow is not a part of HSN."
good,HSN is a wonderful place to work. I learned may things there and am grateful for the time spent with this organization.  They need to continue focusing on the employees and look to get a better work-life balance for them.  They need to look at the overall organization and make sure that all of the facilities and equally balanced with leadership and expatiations.
good,"Pay isn't the best, but it's fair. Decent benefits all around. Management is slightly above average, in my experience. Work is actually enjoyable! Very erratic work hours. Some months you're working 7 straight days at 12 hours a day, other months, you're lucky to get 30 a week. It's just the nature of the business. Supervision is very encouraging to employees, and helpful most of the time. Fellow employees will help whenever you need it. It's the type of place that really makes you want to do well."
good,The job itself is Fast Pace but it's not so fast you can't keep up its work your own pace you just go out of Goodspeed once you figure out what you can do supervisors could have been better the atmosphere itself could have been better
good,I worked nights for 4 years and it was a good experience.  There are a lot of goals and I think sales associates should get paid more. Overall a convenient job for someone who needs to make some extra money without travel.
good,The pay amount was better than most warehouses.  Not to much workload at this warehouse.  Wasn't really room for advancement.  They did occasionally buy their employees lunch.
good,I really appreciate the opportunity I have been given here. I have been able to advance and grow here. They offer a good benefit package. We get great vacation time. I enjoy the people I have met and see every day. I meet new people all the time and we work together as a team.
good,"back to back calls "
good,"HSN is a fun environment and my personal experience with the management team has been great, although some can be catty. A lot of young professionals that makes for a great teaming experience although very competitive and difficult to move up or learn new things. Been told ""to stay in my lane"""
good,"It is awesome being able to work from home, but only getting one weekend off every 2 months leaves zero time for family and life in general. The pay is not very good either. Good benefits though and an amazing discount. Love the team of co-workers and great managers as well. No real room for advancement either which is the reason I am looking elsewhere."
good,Typical day is reviewing invoices for payment. Entering invoices for payment. Back up to check matching and scanning invoices into system to be processed.
good,Its a good work place you can't wear any clothes with metal and depending on which part of the warehouse you work at there's drama
good,"If your looking for a part time, work from home position, working nights, weekends and holidays  this is the company for you."
good,"There are benefits to working from home.  You have no commute.  A typical day is taking lots of calls from customers orders or needing to resolve customer issues related to products or services.  This company is very  limited for advancement opportunities for any work at home reps.  If you like talking to people all the time, then this is the job for you.  All calls are recorded and there is quality department that will review your calls at random,  The hardest part of the job is listening to abusive screaming customers.  If you can keep a level head, and calm attitude, then you will do great here."
good,"There are laborious work which I daily have to be done, I learned very much there like advance excel and quickbooks software. But there is no advancement in work. My co workers are very much team players and help me in every aspect of office work."
good,I would come to work we would have a meeting and then be told what trailer to unload. what I learned was how to work with others as a team. And to get along with my coworkers during stressful times. The hardest part of the job was when we had to unload the product by hand onto pallets as fast as we could and get it onto the floor. I liked my manager I felt he did a go job and treated everyone fairly.
good,Interesting was the culture and growth of an industry unlike any I had ever known. HSN was in a new growth cycle and moved to a new complex in St. Petersburg. Order takers and customer service side by side separated by walk-way. The on-camera talent on stage for live presentation with remote cameras. All about sales to the customers.
good,"enjoyed the job, but not the hours.  management less that stellar"
good,"HSN was a good place to work. All the employees were nice and focused on making the company better. Big on community service and helping causes around town. Most of the customers were very nice and pleasant. "
good,Worked hard answering customer related questions and resolving issues.
good,Great benefits--
good,"Overall, this was a pretty great place to work. I left because the distance was too far and they didn't offer the option to work from home at the time I worked there. I also didn't see much opportunity for advancement. At the time, I was young and enjoyed the non-traditional schedules (for second shift) and they even offered volunteer opportunities throughout the area. It was suggested by the company and got you out of work for a day. The computer recommended products based on a customer's order, so all you had to do was make the offer and you could get a little commission easily. It was a no-brainer and easy!"
good,The hours where long. I went into work at 6 am and i didn't get off until 4:30 pm. The build was HUGE!A lot of walking. It would take me about 5-10 minutes to walk outside to the smoking area. i only got a 30 minute break.
good,"Great culture, truly a fun place to work and the benefits and compensation are competitive. I would happily work there again if the opportunity presented itself."
good,Great place to work. Hard to get out of starting position. Meet and see celebrities every now and then. Big cafeteria decorate for the holidays but have to meet quota.
good,"The job was routine - very specific tasks and reports to be completed daily; however, a special project could arise at any time. Had to meet Key Performance Indicators."
good,"People are great - loved my co-workers but company expectations were not always consistent with supposed ""company culture"" and ""values."""
good,QVC lowered time to 300 secs buy you are still required to upsell and offer warranty sales and customer service calls it was impossible for me to meet the new standards. My final month I averaged 302 seconds instead of the older 340 avg. The same day I was terminated I had a perfect evaluation of 100 and a new customer testimonial for excellent service   many long timers left
good,"It was a great company to work for and relatively no stress.  Job became uncertain once QVC took over.  Typical call center type of environment.  Shopping Discount was great, especially at the holidays."
good,"You'll find that there is a very solid job culture there. The company is in a transitional period, as they were recently acquired by QVC last year. Many people who work there have been there for many years. You you are paid below market value for your title, but the benefits were good."
good,It's a very secure place to work. There is sercuity everwhere. You need your employee badge for eveything. You get great discounts on merchantdise.Great place.
good,Great place to work with discounts and benefits for a work at home job.  Management is on hand to coach and answer questions.  Pay is low considering you are required to upsell products with no commission.
good,There is a great deal of teamwork and closeness within our Accounting and Finance group.  It has been an enjoyable experience working and learning with my colleagues.
good,"Really liked working for HSN, I did enjoy the flexibility of the hours and being about to come in and make up time whenever it was available. Co-workers were about to give and take hours from each other, which I liked a lot. You didn't always have to use your PTO time if someone wanted to pick up your shift."
good,"I have had very supportive management.  Currently, HSN is undergoing a merger with QVC, so there is a lot of disruption and re-organization. Otherwise, I like working here and feel there is good future potential."
good,"We were a subsidiary of HSN, and far away, so most of us had little interaction with HSN. We were happy to be able to sell some of our product on HSN, which greatly helped our bottom line. We had a good culture - we were a family."
good,"Fast paced, Good place to work if you enjoy talking on the phone and its very nice working from home but thats kinda the downfall of the job for me. It gets very boring working from home but other than that its a great job with good benefits."
good,"Seasonal, but fun for a work at home job. 3 weeks training, and then in 2nd week put on phones. Taking orders online and handled various   "
good,"HSN is a fast paced enviroment with great benefIits. The management team is very involved in the day to day activites on the floor. The assocaites are very flexible in their schedules and open to changes based on buisness needs. I would recomend this company as a great place to work , especially if you are starting your carrer"
good,"I genuinely enjoyed working at HSN, but here are the things I did not like, and ultimately the reason I left. "
good,"All though HSN provided excellent benefits and programs for their employees, it was extremely micromanaged.  It was more than just timed breaks and lunches, it was down to seconds that you were clocked.  They did offer wonderful benefits and activities to all employees and tried to make it fun for everyone."
good,"HSN offers reasonable pay and very good benefits. You are expected to work both days of every weekend, and they are not willing to accommodate you if your needs change, schedule-wise."
good,"I had an average experience. I was promoted to supervisor after 5 months and it wasn't a bad job, but it's customer service, so there's that. HSN customers can be sweet and understanding, but they can also be some of the most entitled people you will speak to in your life."
good,HSN warehouse was a very good place to work. The management was amazing and they made sure you were okay in their work place.
good,"I had a chance to experience and learn things that I hadn't previously."
good,"I was fortunate to be able to substitute in the Lansing School District for many years, as my schedule permitted.  I substituted in the elementary and middle schools most often."
good,"The current corporate motto is ""It's fun here"" and that's true most of the time. However the rest of the time you release that the people in management only got there by outstaying their welcome in other businesses. If you boss has worked at the company for 20 years and not moved past supervisor or manager there is a good reason."
good,"Very relaxing."
good,"8 to 10 hr day. Answering call from customers via phone and computer. The following things were performed: tracking packages, updating accounts, ordering items, solving problems. Each call was a different challenge. Worked as a team with my co-workers."
good,Placed orders over the phone. Upsold items to add additional sales. Meeting call time and upsell expectations was sometimes challenging. Receiving incentive pay for upsold items added extra income. The call volume was far from overwhelming.
good,BOOKKEEPING
good,They have plenty of very friendly people there that will help you if you ask and not discriminate. The work is also extremely easy if you can stand on your feet for ten hours a day.
good,"It was a place that I learned a lot about selling and transactions online. And that, I really appreciate it since they helped me to get another level of Customer Service that I never did before."
good,"I worked in Sales but too much emphasis on upselling. The supervisors are great at coaching you,  and they have a great work environment. They have contests, raffles, and give away great prizes A great place to work. Flexible schedules. They have work at home positions and also call center if you want to go to the campus."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at HSN. Definitely made me become a better, more efficient artist due to time restrictions and quick TV pace. Having to work with talented artists, editors, producers, etc. Definitely gives you the experience necessary to work anywhere"
good,"Nice place to work but when hsn was bought out by qvc, I wasnt sure about advancement and decided to move on, Pay not great and long drive for me. Nice flexibility in shifts and was able to go to a night shift for a month due to a family situation. Very understanding of family needs."
good,I lost my job for disconnecting a call before the customer indicated she was done.  To be upfront I had done everything she had asked me to do.  Had this call been selected for quality up to the point I disconnected it would have been 100%.  I had done everything she asked and each time I asked if there was anything else i could do for her she said no.  Then she would begin to complain about something.  I completed 2 customers concerns for her based on her complaint and each time she said there was nothing more I could.  I ended up disconnecting the call when she said NO to additional help then began her 3rd complaint.  You CANNOT DISCONNECT a call.  If you do you run the risk of being caught.  Under the circumstances I don't believe this was a cause for termination.  My supervisor's super was a jerk and he made the decision and there was nothing I could do and nothing she could do.  I would have stayed with HSN.  I had 5 years  in.
good,Great company culture and benefits.  It’s a   Fun atmosphere and you meet interesting people. I miss working here . Would love to go back.! It’s been 9 years. So maybe in a different area I would go back to the company. Grew up with the culture on and off for many years.   Great place to be creative and make money.
good,Allows remote/from home work. The pay is average for the area. Systems work smoothly and efficiently for customers and sales reps. problems rarely arise and are easy to solve.
good,"Work/life balance is great, managers are easy to talk with. Issues get resolved. Respected by coworkers and great team environment.Other departmental communication needs to be worked on."
good,Not a bad place to work but it's stupid all these factory hqveing to go through these temp service.if a employee had a better job security they would want to work more and harder.
good,"24 hour environment that is ever changing.  Must be adaptable and a team player.  Surrounded by talented, creative, smart peers makes the intense work atmosphere feel less stressful."
good,"HSN is a good place to work. "
good,"HSN is a fun company to work for. You will find the training excellent and the benefits to be excellent as well. You have to be able to handle back to back inbound calls and know how to enter data and keep the phone conversation flowing. The down side is they expect you to move through the calls very quickly and sometimes that is not viable. You will find some supervisors give you the answers, attention, and extra tips to help you excel and sometimes you will find supervisors who do not care what crisis you are in. The Seasonal team is not as friendly or willing to help with the new hires through the holiday season but as a full time employee they are very helpful and strive to make you the best at what you do. The attitude of the company is friendly, fun, and fast paced. They invest alot in you so if you are hired they do their best to keep you there."
good,I was there fora little over 10 years.  The management cares about customers and employees.  Dysfunctional work flow.  A little politics. But overall a good company.
good,"Busy workplace.  Had to work with remote data centers to get some of the work done. The shifts were setup for 3 days on, 4 days off one week, 4 days on, 3 days off the next week.  This was handy for having time off."
good,It was a very fast paced but fun environment. Being a HUGE discount store we had trucks arriving every few days and sales would often be huge. It was demanding work but fair.
good,nice to be able to work from home the supervisors are very supportive and friendly I recommend this job to anyone the only downfall is I work nights and it is very hard to get daytime hours
good,"I really enjoyed working at HSN. The only real drawback is the annual review process. It is a 1-5 you can earn, but managers are limited on how many 4s or 5s they can give. Generally only 1 or 2 per business unit even if there are several that deserve higher."
good,"It was great to be an employee there, the staff was amazing. I just wish they had more leniency with their attendance policies. The distance I had to travel to work everyday using public transportation made things difficult at times."
good,I was promoted a number of times in this company.  The company is a very established one and the exposure to professionalism is evident.  I would recommend anyone to work for this company.
good,I love diversity and the ability to meet and assist customers to the highest level of satisfactioon. I belive that smiling while helping a customer is one of the best aspects while working.
good,"Communication was lacking, emails and phone calls went unanswered. This was frustrating and led to me leaving. I would still recommend."
good,HSN is a strongly motivated company that offers very good benefits and financial compensation.  The atmosphere is very friendly with everyone treated as an integral part of the company.  Salaries and benefits are equal or better than most competition in the area.
good,Culture is good and teams are well coordinated. A lot depends upon the team one is a part of. Managers tend to support their teams for good work and for leading projects.
good,"a day consisted of taking customer calls helping to resolve issue taking orders averaging 100 to 120 calls a day in 16 years took over 500,000 phone calls. Learned to deal  with upset callers and  de-escalate irate customers. Management gave plenty of leeway so we could do what was necessary to help members. Every one I worked with was friendly like a family but unlike a family less strife. Hardest part of the job was listening to people who called because they lonely and just wanted to talk to someone it's hard not to feel sorry for them you don't want to be rude and unfeeling but you have a job to do a can't spend a lot of time listening to their problems. Best part was when you were able to help someone with their problems"
good,"I used to work in the call center but now work at home part time. in the call center we would share information with other reps to help each other, now at how, we do that with IM"
good,"I would answer calls from my own home. I would place sale orders for the clients and answer any questions they may have. However, this job is not for everyone. It can become really stressful during the busy months (July, November, December, January). The staff is very pleasant and considerate of your thoughts."
good,"Overall, HSN is a fun place to work. The environment and functions held make it very enjoyable. I've learned a great deal about the television retail market and in doing so, have learned to anticipate customer needs. "
good,This is a great place to work. I was able to work from home which made this  job perfect for what I was looking for.
good,"If you enjoy being on the phone for 8 hrs or more, this is the job for you. High volume call center. Great people, room for advancement but not a job for the lazy."
good,HSN was a wonderful company to work for. I was offered flexible hours and reasonable hourly pay. The employees were certainly quite friendly and productive.
good,It was easy to learn. You take items from a cubby place in a box and label it and send it up to be shipped. U also make sure ur boxes are stocked and area is clean. You have to pack atleast 60 boxes per hour.
good,Good company to work with well-standardized structure. The management will make you take initiatives and more responsibilities which will strengthen your career goal.
good,we would receive packages and sort through them wether or not we could re sell the item in the package then we would tape I back up and put it on the converyor belt
good,HSN emphasizes an all-hands-on-deck approach in order to keep up with the constant inflow of work and timely shipping expectations.  Employees experience variety at work as they can often be stationed temporarily in departments that may be short staffed.
good,"I went in as a FLEX employee so I made my own schedule on an app on my smartphone.  Sometimes shifts were cancelled but I knew that going in.  Work isn't hard as long as you can be on your feet for 4-5 hours at a time.  Management was a bit disorganized, but didn't bother me because I was only there temporarily.  I would go back to work there if ever between jobs or if I just needed some extra money!"
good,HSN is dedicated to bringing customer quality products at a reasonable price. They are a data driven organization with associates searching the globe for new products to bring to their customers.
good,The company is focused on the customer and driving the brand to create a engaging shopping experience.  Opportunities for advancement are available if you are interested and motivated to succeed.
good,Was a fun place to work and they even called me back to work full time but it was a temp job for me more than them.  They treat people well and are flexible with time.
good,worked in shipping  loaded semi trailers by hand with packages that customers had ordered  varied with weight and size and quantity  worked with great people that cared about their job
good,Company that is very awesome to work for. With time off when needed as it is available. Chances for you to be with family while still being able to bring in a decent income. Recommended for families that are having trouble bringing what's needed while taking care of what needs to happen at home.
good,"Is helping the customers that are looking at TV live and trying to explain to them about the different colors, sizes or other things. also getting samples of the items to try so you can explain to customers how they work and how to use the product"
good,HSN was well managed at the corporate and local level and is well positioned for the future. They are adding automation and resources in order to stay competitive in the market place. They have solid infrastructure and treat their employees very fairly.
good,it is not a bad place to work. it is great for an additional income. it does offer good benefits for part time such as paid time off plus holidays. I would recommend.
good,"good hours, they work very well with you and what you want, the pay is decent, is was just closing down and moving out of state, so it wasn't no use in me staying there."
good,I enjoyed learning the different positions in the warehouse. I got license to drive heavy machinery. I stayed busy and got to meet a variety of people.
good,"When I started I was part time and going to school, I worked on the packing line and helped in the shipping dept.  Where I still was when I finished school and became full time.  I then bid into the cycle count dept. after that I got to move to the data entry dept.  I ran reports and printed out orders as well as the data entry.  "
good,"Worked with cross functional team to identify waste and implement continuous improvements .Highest standards are maintained for safety, housekeeping, and compliance with all government and company standards. Record Management of handing documentation related to warehousing operations (Inward, Outward, Stock Transfer, Transportation)"
good,"I like working with this company. The pay was good, as well as the people who I worked with. A typical day at work for me would be to pack product into boxes that would then be shipped off to the customers. I learned a lot from this job, including things like speaking up. I was very shy at first when i started and being there has got me out of my shell. The only hard part I would say about this job would be working overnight. I would constantly be tired in the day and would sleep my day away due to me being up all night."
good,"My shift is from 4pm-12:30am. It consists of sitting for eight hours, fielding calls from customers. These calls may be questions, sales orders, or simple updates to their profiles."
good,"I was 3 years in when I realized that there was no more movement in the position I was in and I was not able to move to something else that I would be interested in making a career out of. I do miss the people that I worked with, but I honestly do not miss the micromanagement that I found that would hamper the ability to provide TRUE quality customer service."
good,"Steady job. You would be Iucky if you landed one weekend day off or even a Friday. Started out as a Customer Service Rep and went to Email/Chat shortly after. Within 5 months I was alternating in the Command Center. You learn ALOT about the company in that particular area and it looks good on your resume. Lots of PTO time added after 90 days. Great job security and in/outside discounts. HSN wants you to move up and around but you have to have good reviews and be patient. You also are eligible for decent raises after 6 months, all depends on your reviews. If you can handle back to back or no calls for long periods of time while dealing with angry or talkative customers then this is the job for you! Perfect for you if your in College or are a recent graduate from High School."
good,"incentives on sales and credit cards are great. Team support is wonderful. Sales calls, assisting customers and trying to get them to purchase an upsell. Job environment is great because you can work from home. Hours are flexible, part time gets PTO. Its a great work environment. The hard part is trying to not take a bathroom break to prevent compliance from going down."
good,"I take calls from all types of customers and enjoy my experience with every one of them! I have learned that putting a smile on someones face and using a positive tone can uplift anyone in this environment. I have worked with many wonderful people in this company! Management does a great job at ensuring that their staff is comfortable and ready for the work day and my coworkers have really helped me through the training process as well. The most difficult part of my job is having to deal with difficult customers, but this has really taught me how to work with the public in a greater way and gives me the chance to bring light to their day. I really just enjoy working with the public and helping everyone who I come into contact with everyday."
good,HSN has a diverse workplace with many different industries under one roof - it is a great place to learn new skills and make new connections.
good,"I have gained many valuable skills while at HSN, for which I am very grateful."
good,"HSN is a great place to work, good benefits, competitive pay, well kept campus/facilities, and a reasonable amount of sick leave/pto per year, the most difficult part of working here is the customers that you deal with on a daily basis. My job is to assist customers and resolve their issues, but the customer base is a combination of elderly, angry and confused, or those who cannot afford to shop at normal outlets so they come to us for flexible payments then are angry at us when they cannot manage to hash those payments out on time. You will spend the majority of your time coddling what can only be described as unreasonable dullards, but once you realize that you are only speaking to a small fraction of the customer base and you have paid your dues on the phones, there is a lot of opportunity for advancement."
good,I've been with HSN for 14yrs and my department has always been behind me. My co-workers are more like family.
good,Process customer checks and money orders for their purchase.
good,HSN was an enjoyable job for me. I was able to easily advance into higher positions as my phone scores were always in the top 98 percentile. We handled a variety of calls from clients and we did everything in our power to make sure the client was satisfied
good,HSN has been taking the lead on leveraging technology and entertainment to change how people shop from home. Company CEO has strong leadership and visionary ability. The work life balance and benefits are comparable to other retailers. The location of the corporate office is not as desirable.
good,This is a great place to work if you are a single person with no responsibilities as far as a family. The benefits are great and if something happens in your life when you need to do a leave of absence they are very accommodating.
good,"Loved the ""can access everything from the campus"" approach the company took with allowing a mere call center agent like myself having access the production side of the company! great pay, excellent coworkers and flexible hours. if only i didnt have failed transportation in my commute from Tampa to St. Petersburg."
good,"Awesome supervisors, get to work from home , excellent benefit package. In depth training.   Just merged with qvc which has cause a lot confusion but getting thru it.  Great job security for the most part"
good,Fast paced and fun with great work/life balance. Supervisor cares about your success. Metrics not within reason to properly take care of the customer.
good,"You do the same thing every day and there is little room for advancement. With the new kpi's since the acquisition it's very rush the call get off the phone without alot of emphasis on customer service like before. They short you on your breaks which is not fair. If you have a call that cuts into your break time you lose your break, they are able to do this because they call it poor time management on the employees part since the break was scheduled. But over all it's a steady paycheck and the work is not hard all. They also offer convenience leave when it's slow and a buddy trade system to trade schedules on your own without approval to help get a more flexible schedule."
good,"The phone rings, ""Hello, this is ___ with hsn! May i have your item number?"" between 1.5-10 minutes a call navigating the every so slow  ordering system helping customers order thier favorite items!"
good,Answer on average 80-100+ calls in an 8 hour period handling a wide array of customer concerns and needs. I was blessed when I worked here with 2 of the best supervisors I think HSN has. They really looked out for my best interest. The hardest part of my job there was having to disappoint a customer by not being able to always provide them with a resolution to their issue. I enjoyed being able to work form the comfort of my own home as well as most all of our customers and working with different team members and knowing that at the end of a call I had went above and beyond to provide the best customer service possible and that customer was happy ending our call.
good,"A typical day at HSN is. Packing the customers orders either in bags or the right size box. sending the box to the truck to get shipped to them. making sure that the order will get to the customer in the right amount of time. Making sure the item is safe packed in the box so it doesn't get broken. There is really nothing hard about the job. its a easy job. that requires a lot of standing, bending, lifting all day for 10 hours a day."
good,On any given day it could be steady with what is being sold that day. I like working from home.  I also get to help people by placing orders or answering their questions.
good,"Interns and MAs get excellent Training.. It is very fast pace and can be intense if you are not a diligent, passionate and motivated worker. You can run into a celebrity at any point so that can be exciting.."
good,"A typical day is assisting customers through email and chat with issues or questions they may have."
good,"On a typical day there is always something productive you can do.Treating your customers  with respect is the key word for the company, it drives the business. As being part of Management I find  this work well when we are all on the same page, we communicate in a better way. Co-workers working as a team bring productive and customers to the business. The hardest part of the job is getting multi task done within a certain time. To see the store in well organised and every thing is at visual standard make you feel great."
good,"Answering phones all day every day is a typical day. I've learned a lot of my customer service skills here. All the managers are nice and willing to help you with anything. The hardest part of the job for me would be getting a call from a really upset customer who is pretty much done with the company, other then that i love it there."
good,Start with team leader for  picking department after 3 years become warehouse manager system in weekend shift.
good,"12 hr days 3 days a week"
good,"I wish i could have stayed longer but the work expectation is great! it wasnt hard at all, but when it came down to it i have a two year old and a daughter so the schedule wasnt that great for me plus weekend and holidays? they werent as understanding on a BUSINESS wise tip about having things beyond your control but personally they were VERY understanding."
good,The perfect job for work/life balance.  The company offers multiple shifts.  Great benefits.
good,"Highly Driven members of staff, Jolly good fun to work with, always learning new technics and methods in regards to resolving customer quires. Knowledge and sales technics shared amoungst the staff. never a moment to outdo the other in regards to sales or any difficulties that may arise."
good,Assiting and providing a great shopping experience .Being able to work from home is great. Productive calls with problem solving concerns.
good,Working at HSN was exactly the type of job I needed at the time.  The hours were flexible and it left me with time to do my errands during the day.  The job was very easy to do.
good,"Good place for working from home, they give you good training. The hardest part is customers who you can't make happy no matter what you try to do for them. And the most enjoyable the people I work with and my supervisor."
good,I was so busy at HSN (worked several different positions) the days went by quickly.  People were great. Management was easily accessible.  Was a great job.
good,"great supervisor, friendly atmosphere where co-workers work together"
good,Excellent training provided in all areas. Room for advancement. Great work/life balance. Excellent culture and values. Beautiful 40 acre campus in St. Petersburg.
good,I started in the mail room - left after working Desktop Support for another opportunity. Great place to climb up. Great people. I learned a lot while I was there and had a great time.
good,"HSN has a really comfortable environment that really focuses on the customer. They are very engaging, and often bring in celebrities or have fun events planned in order to keep up work place morale."
good,I loved my manager. The money was decent but not enough for a single mother of two.
good,"Store is well maintained and products are generally in stock. Management needs some ""Tweeking"""
good,"Have worked for HSN for 2 seasons now and I love it!!! Would love to work here Full time!!! if not, I'll be back next year!! So much fun and get to work from home!"
good,I enjoyed working at HSN. I had the work from home position which was perfect for me at the time and due to where I lived. I would recommend this company.
good,"I love the job . It’s really simple .. I learned everything fast . The hardest part of the job would probably be walking on your feet for ten hours , other then that I like it"
good,"My duties included answering calls from members to help with returns, product descriptions, billing and credit card issues. Ordering members items and checking inventory availability. Arranging returns and explaining policies of the returns and refunds. Escalated issues in billing and product dissatisfaction if warranted to floor supervisors. Maintained address and credit card updates as needed. Assisted in overflow calls from the Network side when the queue became backed up. The pay and the opportunity to work more hours were great. It became though very routine. Due to personal reasons, the hours were becoming an issue. Not anything to do with the company itself."
good,very relaxed place love how you can wear anything management was great and helpful they train you very good to where you wouldnt have any questions about your job
good,"A fun, exciting, and friendly environment. Kind people that really want to see you succeed and will help you every step on the way. Encourage personal growth and advancement. They have the option to work from the comfort of your own home and in your PJ's."
good,Great company to work for. Learned a lot from both culinary and media standpoints. Worked alongside many celebrity chefs and got to sample/test all of their new products.
good,"Fast paced sales and in depth services, with in a work from home office. The company was very intuitive and loved their customers. Not only did they worship their customers, they absolutely gave the best care for their employees including a very fun environment."
good,On a typical day before we started work we had a meeting letting us know what to expect during the day and as well as 5 minutes of stretching to ensure we were ready to work. I worked in rework so I would open boxes and make sure product was not damaged and had all proper materials. The supervisor was very helpful and very motivating to the staff and made sure we were hydrated.
good,"There is no typical day in my job. I have a great work environment with a management team that allows me to handle my own brands, work load and determine the best strategy for my support. I work with talent, marketing, merchandising, QA, Legal and of course, the live show team, to craft and support on-air presentations. The hardest part is balancing the multiple company priorities, but the best part is seeing it all come together on-air."
good,I have a message to send to the viewers and to build their confidence in a product just by demonstration and education. I love the challenge and seeing how much of a gift I have when the show is over by the TV sales screen!!!
good,"I am a WAH (work at home) sales rep for HSN. I answer phone calls and place orders for customers. Unfortunately I only have the opportunity to meet with my co-workers roughly once a month if even. Being at such a young age, interacting with people is important and since I do not have the option to do so face to face that would be the hardest part of the job."
good,HSN is a great company to work for. This company truly cares about it's empolyees and advocates growth within the company.
good,"Customer Service and Sales. Maintain new customer and payment database. 100% Quality rating and Top Sales, multiple quarters."
good,I will never recommend any one to work at HSN. The management is so bad and confused with the day to day activities and most of their employees and confused
good,"Overall, it was an awesome company to work for.  They had a gret benefit package.  I learned a lot of the 21 years that I was with the company.  Unfortunately, there were a lot of changes that happened and it was time to move on."
good,"I loved my job at HSN. It was quick paced and challenging. The people you work with are nice and good teachers. I would recommend this kind of job for anyone looking for good pay, great benefits and paid time off."
good,"Enjoyed the position of packer/shipper/floater. "
good,"I enjoy working here, but lately the customers have become out of control.  We are making a lot of changes due to a merger with QVC, and it seems everything has gone downhill since.  I am looking for more stability and a promising future at a company that won't possibly go bottom up."
good,I had a great supervisor and was part of an awesome team.   Great place to work with good benefits including discounts on products.  Some days the customers were really difficult but then there was always that one customer who would make your day and you will forget the difficult ones.
good,I love the ability to work from home! This job has changed my life in so many ways! I am so grateful to have had it. I still get asked to come back for seasonal work every year around the holidays!
good,"HSN was. a great company to work for. We had a very strong family culture. Even with the upper management in Florida."
good,At the time was makeing big change to the company but was not head to keep up with it all was more changling for some but i love helping ppl keep up to speed infact wail i was there was talk of a 2 full time training spot . And i was in for the drawing of one of them over all i loved it but sad i had to leave .
good,"I loved working form home doing sales, I only left the position because my school work was getting to a point that it was much harder and required more time for me to study."
good,Great place to work. Lots of diversity. Loved working there.
good,"great place but no flexibility in schedule, overall great company but I cannot work 52 weekends a year and they need to work on schedule options!"
good,HSN was a professional TV crew and staff. The work culture was fine. The hardest part of the job was the daily change in work hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was the professionalism of my co- workers.
good,I worked for Black Knight when it was LPS. I loved this job excellent benefits and plenty of time off to have a life vacation etc... I was paid well.
good,Fast paced job. I packed orders placed by members by phone or internet. Enjoyed seeing the new products ordered by members.
good,We had a putting green in the server room.  On-call was minimal.  Learned VOIP systems.  Co-workers and management were great.  I gained warehouse and call center support experience.
good,"•	Accounting representative responsible for bi-weekly payroll processing"
good,"Flexible schedule, available 24 hours a day. Management was approachable."
good,This a great company to work for. The values are great and the management is great at development in having a well balance work place.
good,I enjoyed the job even though I was under pressure to meet quota. This made the job challenging which was good. The permeant employees were not very nice or friendly. I some times felt alone and left out compared to most all other jobs I have had.
good,I enjoyed my time at HSN. I was there two different times as a contractor and both were great experiences with a great team of people. The only downside was a lot of meetings that didn't necessarily need to happen.
good,I would definitely reccomend anyone to work for HSN. The company is great and always ready to help their employees achieve the HSN experience. The customer is always right even if they are wrong lol.😉
good,HSN is an awesome company. But it's not challenging and you don't really have much ability yo move up in the company. The leadership and management is amazing and the people you work with are good people.
good,HSN is a productive work environment with good discounts for employees. The management team at  HSN is a good bunch of people with a good open door policy.
good,"Great place to work! They care about their employees and opinions. Opportunity for growth within your department and continuous learning. Nice campus, with an on-site cafeteria and walking path."
good,The managers were relaxed and helpful and very understanding. You don't always get a ton of hours depending on the season but overall it was a great place to work and I hate most jobs so that is saying something. Pay was 12.50 hourly plus 50 cents after 5pm
good,"Working as an HSN sales rep, while occasionally stressful with high-volume times of year, was generally great. Getting to watch TV (on mute!) in my underwear while working a full-time job was phenomenal and I would recommend it to anyone."
good,The office was very friendly and upbeat with direct interaction between agents and management with a focus on customer satisfaction.  The agents were made to feel appreciated.
good,HSN goes to great lengths to insure the success of their employees. They provide extensive training both on site and remotely. The supervisors promote team work to obtain desired results..
good,"Very good company for an at home worker, flexible shifts and alot of work hrs.. great incentives. also open to new accounts great online experience .."
good,Great place to start in production and grow in creative thinking and production skills. Creative work environment where ideas are welcomed.
good,HSN is an awesome company to work for. They offer a great work at home opportunity that helps balance life and work at the same time!
good,HSN is a wonderful company yo work for. The people are great and it has provided me with many benefits and advancements.I enjoy working in a competitive environment that challenges me.
good,I worked at HSN for more than 19 years and learned something new every day.  It was a fast paced energetic environment that I will miss.
good,"I started working as HSH when it was a small new company"
good,"HSN is a great company! "
good,this job was great learned alot about working in warehouse.
good,"HSN employs a talented team of product writers and evaluators.  They are professional and trustworthy."
good,"This job is great as far as saving money for the transportation part as you work from the comfort of your own home. I intend to keep this position and go to Part-Time as I desperately need to work two jobs, and this is a great paying Part-Time position."
good,Most enjoyable part was assisting customers purchasing items they seen on tv.
good,This was a really cool job just for the fact that it was the Home Shopping Network and we got a discount on everything.
good,"Overall, working for this company was a positive experience. My supervisors were very helpful and knowledgeable. I learned a lot about customer service guidelines, policies and quality. My coworkers were very helpful and pleasant. Most enjoyable part of the job is when I felt that I had made a customer's day better"
good,"This was my first W@H job and it is so much fun. No drama and no negativity. I love how thorough my training was and if you struggling understanding anything you have access to so many lines of communication and ways to assist you,  you never worry about being left behind!"
good,Great management  Just be sure to be on time and stay compliant on phones. Great pay. Always for the customer. Need a lot of patience for customers. Most are great.
good,Good company except when qvc took over. I was on an on air sales coordinator. I screened calls for on air testimonials and kept in touch with producers to activate new items as they air.
good,The company provided their workers with lunch everyday for 3 months and gave out a lot of hours for the holiday season. The company is a great place to work.
good,HSN has been my home for over 15 years now.  I met my wife there.  Its been a great adventure for me to work there.   The only reason I am posting my resume is to try and find something with more traditional hours.  I would recommend looking at HSN to anybody who asked me.
good,"-HSN is an all around the clock 24 hr job which gave me the opportunity to pick up shows when I was free"
good,"Working for HSN has been great.  With the purchase of HSN by QVC there has been a lot of uncertainty of what the future holds.  QVC has a great vision of where they want to be.  The CEO is a perfect fit to drive this company to a successful future.  The only fear I have is they take over, grab only the top selling products and dismantle what's left."
good,"A fast paced job of live television.  Live broadcasts with on air shifts of 2 or more hours selling approximately 6 - 8 products per day in categories ranging from beauty, home goods, crafts, fashion, kitchen, bedding, jewelry and more."
good,"They actually train you!! They train very heavily and all remotely.  They then still coach and hand hold once you are out of training for months. They set goals and follow up with you on progress consistently.  Very friendly,  open, honest and caring managers and employees. Pay is not very high, but it's s work at home position, so I'm saving on gas and wear and tear on my car. Great culture!! Great place to work!!"
good,"At times I felt the flexibility could be a bit better, however it was by far the best company I have worked for to date. the benefits are awesome though sometimes costly but quality. This company has so many avenues you can take as a career but most require further education unless you know someone who can help you excel."
good,"Great management, fun place to work, low stress call center. "
good,"LOVE working at HSN-- most fun job I have ever had. Laid back and casual work environment with lots of employee perks. Managers are super nice and approachable. Pay is on the lower end of market value, but get resume builder."
good,"This was, in 20 years working in retail,  my favorite retail job I have ever had.  Great company, amazing co-workers, awesome customers (most of the time.)  I will truly miss working here."
good,"This is a great job to work from home if you have the self discipline for it. As a customer service agent, you take a lot of calls and handle a lot of different opportunities. Some customers are nice, some are not so nice. You do have to learn the skill of diffusing a bad situation and how to get the chatty ones off the phone."
good,This is a great job to apply for when you want to work from home. I love how it was easy to manage being a at home mother full time.
good,"Log in to start your day calls are in queue already.  Days at HSN were very very busy before you knew it was time to go home.  On days where there was down time you could get to your neighbor not many down time days.  Management  in some department were great. my co-workers was fun & great to work with.  "
good,"Great place to work,it really is fun place to work. Discounts was great. Everyone there was really helpful. I love the support staff in every department, The manager was very nice and encouraging. Staffer had many chances to correct any behavior before they were let go. It you was fired from HSN, it's because you did not do your best to correct your behavior. I love the model they go by. Great company, I would recommend HSN. I was able to work at home doing most of my time at HSN, I loved it."
good,"It is a very interesting place to work. Constant change. High Pressure, at times. Lots of departments to shadow and possibly work in."
good,"Excellent company with great benefits, discounts and great flexibility.  Co-workers and supervisors are great and ready to assist.  Typical day is to answer back to back phone calls, provide excellent customer service and resolve any issues with a one call resolution."
good,"I enjoyed helping and talking to all of the customers.  I learned a lot, and had a lot of training time.  7 weeks of training was suitable."
good,Typical work day consist of helping customers resolve an issue they may be having either with ordering or with an item the customer has received.
good,"One of the best work at home positions out there. Benefits start relatively quickly, and include healthcare, 401k, dental, and others. Very easy to work with and has a great selling environment. Co-workers are always within reach via chat to assist you if needed."
good,"Productive place to work, great co-workers, alot of overtime hours."
good,"HSN is a great place to work, but in the production aspect there are often management changes and the stability can be a bit shaky. Overall HSN treats their employees very well and prefer to hire from within."
good,"Great company! Lots of fun helping customers, however it can get stressful around the holidays due to call volume.  It is basically like you get paid to shop!"
good,"Productive,competitive and  and fun workplace with great management. "
good,This job provided me with tons of flexibility and an amazing manager. It was almost like I was able to set my own schedule. It was awesome lol. I recommend if you’re interested in part-time work that’s worth it.
good,In a typical work day we unload trucks processed all the merchandise. I learned how to processed the merchandise and how to see if the cereal numbers all match.
good,"Clock in, have a brief meeting, and then go to work, then leave for the day on time. Work schedules printed a month in advance, the ability to swap days with other workers is allowed as is the ability to request those days off. Con is they force overtime during busy peaks and holidays are hard to request off without prior notice."
good,"Worked from home so I didn't need to worry about what to wear. You will get coaching usually every money, with tips on improving sales. You will be asked to listen to your own calls and explain how you could have improved. I personally had problems with pushing upsales. To me unless it is a matching items, it is hard to convince someone to add to their wardrobe or jewelry collection, just because it is another nice looking piece."
good,"This was my dream job, I have always wanted to work for HSN and I had the ability to.  The entire company is incredible!  The training was informative, you went into sales confident and the first two weeks or so you had someone helping you get oriented.  Over my time there I had several supervisors who switched shifts or went to different positions.  However, every single one of them was supportive, helpful, encouraging; pretty much everything you'd want in a supervisor.  The hardest part of the job was at the times the call volume.  Depending on the item being aired you could be back-to-back calls for several hours or you could have only several in an hour.  I only left the company because I wanted to do more than sales for quite some time and the opportunity never came up for me."
good,Great work at home job with excellent support from company.  Excellent training and opportunity for advancement if you want that or just great for a long term job.
good,I was. Tote picking going into halls picking clothing. Items from off the shelf it had to. Be in  correct order and put it in the correct tote and put it in the tote for packing but I had to complete the order first before I put it on the line
good,"HSN was my first job and let me tell you , I didn't know how good I had it. The culture is wonderful and the training and room for advancement are endless. I have nothing but great things to say about my years at HSN. You are lucky if you can get your foot in the door!"
good,"HSN was an opportunity for me to focus exclusively on customer service. It was fun to be in the heart of live television. On a typical day I would answer 80 to 100 calls regarding a wide variety of customer services issues. It could be tech support for the web site. Helping people to reset passwords, redeem awards, or set up their online account. To solving the difficult problems of returning damaged, defective, or recalled products. The hardest part of the job was during Christmas when packages were stolen off of peoples porches and not being able to replace them in time for Santa. Or at all, if item was out of stock. "
good,Excellent company to work for.  Great people and great management team.  Strives to make training comprehensive.  Work schedule is highly flexible for home/school considerations. Benefits are excellent and the pay phenomenal.  Best company I have ever worked for.
good,"HSN is a great company to work for. Plenty of overtime available, the co-workers and management are caring and keep track of your progress through out the weeks. Management helps keep you focused and help better yourself. The hardest part of the job was handling customer accounts who had a loss in the family or sickness. The most enjoyable part of the job was how co-workers helped you get through those tough calls and how management had me listen to my calls to help me progress swiftly through them in a timely manner when needed."
good,"Provided real time; up-to-date inventory information"
good,"HSN has been nothing but an amazing place to work. When at HSN I don’t feel like I’m working, I feel like I’m having fun engaged in whatever Task I’ve been assigned."
good,If you're looking for a laid back and relaxed place to work HSN is it! I wouldn't have left if I hadn't moved out of state. Definitely the best job I've ever had
good,Inbound calls only . You are either helping sell items on air or fixing a issue that customer has with an item. You get free products and good discounts on all items
good,"Best first experience with a WAH or remote job. Had a great team, lots of laughs. Very helpful and everyone helped each other the best they could. My manager (supervisor) was amazing. She would do anything she could to help! Great workplace if your willing to work. Must meet sales goals, but they're reasonable."
good,"Great atmosphere, coworkers genuinely care for each other and try to help lighten each others work loads and offer amazing support. Management is amazing too!"
good,"I had the best experience of my life working on HSN. It’s a brilliant company that makes staff  so comfortable. It’s organized, clean, pay is good,but it’s hard to get there on consistent basis as a model. You feel like a star on tv, meeting celebrities and often getting product after shows. Free lunches, coffee, drinks, snacks, comfy couches where you can rest between shows. The best time of my life!"
good,"I loved my time with HSN. It was by far the best job I ever had. Yes, it was hard but I loved my customers so much it had it ok. I helped customers find items they wanted for their family members, holidays, and even for grandkids. It was such a great time being part of that process. I know sometimes customers can be hard but that is the case with any sales job. But I was able with the training I received and the management be truly empowered. I love it and hope to return next holiday season."
good,"HSN is a great company to work for. I enjoy working there and they provide great benefits. They also provide job growth, training and discounts on items thru HSN and our partner companies"
good,My typical day at hsn was answering incoming calls al day long. Management was very nice and understanding. I learned how to be a great customer service rep. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the rude customers and being yelled at constantly. The most enjoyable part of my time at hsn was the management and the staff.
good,Very fun company to work for. The management was great. I worked from home but they still made it a point to make me feel included in all on site work activities.

good,hsn was a good place to work most of the people was good to work for had a good training program I enjoyed working at HSN HSN gave bounes and a good pay
good,"Home Shopping Network is a wonderful environment to be in. The supervisors are top notch. I clock in, and assist customers with their purchases and/or inquiries. I have learned to handle each customer differently as everyone has a different attitude. Some are friendly, some are frustrated but I handle them all professionally and with respect. I have maintained a good customer to seller relationship. Management  at HSN is awesome. They want you to succeed and they are always there to help when called upon. The hardest part about the job in my opinion is trying to keep the customer from going off topic. As in they want to purchase a certain product, but they want to chat about other things. As a business we must find a balance between listening to the customer, comforting them, but do it in a timely fashion. The most enjoyable part of the job is when a customer says something to me like "" Thank you John, you were very helpful"" or ""Thank you John, you are very professional"" That lets me know I have done my job and satisfied the customer. That brings me happiness."
good,A great place to work. I enjoyed working form home and having a great support team I could turn to for any questions. The hours are great no matter what shift you are on and the calls stay steady.

good,"great workplace, great benefits, management awesome, good benefits"
good,I liked how the owners treated all of us. We would have daily spiffs and daily cash. Everyone here always had a smile as with the owners. They understood when something happened with family or someone was sick they gave time off for those issues.
good,Was a great company to work for. great managment and flexable work hours. always was able to get a hold of anyone what had a issue that needed to be resolved

A van pulls up with four peipke, balloons. etc. I thought it was the Publishers Clearing house. It was my managers, supervisors bringing me a card, balloons, and tons of makeup products we sold! Plus a gift card!"
good,It was ok. It wasn’t for me but they really try to make it pleasant. I just couldn’t handle the old ladies n young yelling at me. They weren’t mad at me I know but who cares I had to hear it lol
good,Interesting and fun working environment with room for growth potential. Flexible schedule but days can be long and it was an long commute from where I lived.
good,"Layback, work at home, a lot of help from management. And really nice discounts. But the discounts ends once you are no longer employed. Customers call in often asking to order an item that is being aired, and may asked for your opinion. Just be friendly and helpful."
good,"great experience working with this company.would love to go back to work for them if had opportunity. fast pace love helping customers"
good,I supported HSN customers from my home office. It was an amazing experience for me while I started and raised my new family. I recommend this type of work to anyone needing more time at home but not at the sacrifice of earning an income. A lot of fun!
good,It’s a decent work place. Great people to work with just a little crazy How they ran things. But otherwise good place to work but works you to death. But I like working hard.
good,Busy company to project what is shown on TV which is rather amazing considering how many systems work in sync to show the video feed on TV which no one even imagines is happening in the background
good,"I was lucky enough to be part of the Short shopping experiment in the late 90s.  I consulted, then Directed/TDed and Produced the show.  We were trying a new style of merging sports with product sales."
good,"Company trains well, makes sure you know your role.  Listens to suggestions and feedback.  A very fair company who respects and treats their employees well."
good,HSN is an amazing company to work for! All of management has a desire to see their people succeed even if it means losing them to another area of the business. They are supportive and understanding and make sure that all of their team members keep a healthy work-life balance throughout the year. The culture was overwhelmingly positive and supportive!
good,you had to clock in 5 minutes to check emails and you start work start taking calls helping customers taking orders. HSN was  nice place to work for and managers were very sweet and understanding and helpful and respond quickly.
good,"Great Place to work for! I was offered a full time job after my seasonal job ended, but I had my last baby and couldn't take it at the time, so they kept me as a re-hire at any time!"
good,"Management at Brandon store are Great, They listen  when you have a problem and take steps to help you solve them."
good,I loved working for HSN.  The pace is super fast and intense.  It is by far the most challanging job that I have had.  It was stressful at times because there is simply so much to learn.  However the reward was amazing.  You have a ton of support!  The pay and all of the benefits are also great.  The hard part of the job was dealing with rude callers and taking so many calls per hour.
good,"Good place to work, lots of advancement and good work place balance. Happy to be a part of the HSN community with lots of benefits and happy people to work with"
good,"There were times you could not even go to the bathroom. Then there was times you had little to do. It all depended on what was going on at that time. If there was issues, you needed to find out what and contact the right department to fix it. This included answering the phone, emails, instant messages and even people walking in. You did what had to be done."
good,I loved working at HSN because it was a full time job with full benefits and I worked from the comfort of my home. I did not have to burn gas eat out for lunch or deal with irate customers directly.

good,I love to work at home. The benefits are great. I love the management. The discounts on HSN products are great. The only thing that I did not like is the average handling time.
good,"•	Front line service professional and brand representative for HSN: Interacted with customers and established account: built customer loyalty and increase brand value with each phone interaction."
good,It was a good place to work for and get hands on experience with latest technology etc.  The manager wa nice.  I left because the salary was not good.
good,"HSN is a very good company to work for and provides very good benefits for part time employees. The discount, alone, makes it worth working for them! Sales quotas are a bit hard to reach but not impossible."
good,HSN was one of the most amazing experiences of my professional career.  At first I hated it as it was in florida.. and I did not want to be there.. but once I got there.. I LOVED every EVERY second of it. IT was fun.. creative. .and made me smile every day.
good,You can work from home and the company is great.  They aren't pushy on upsells. Friendly all around.  They will work with scheduling.  I just wish it wasn't only a seasonal position.
good,"HSN was an experience that was amazing!! Not only did you have an opportunity to assist customers, the environment and what they do for employees makes it a dream job!! Unfortunately due to an unexpected family matter I had to resign my position to assist a family member. I am eligible for re-hire however I am also exploring other opportunities because I think that there are things that I can accomplish in other scenarios. HSN and their management team gave me an opportunity, with not only superior training, but the ability to succeed in other ventures. I learned a lot, from behind the scenes airings, set building, and different products being offered. The hardest part of this job was nothing!!! The culture the way they cared is what I'm seeking in anything I do. Fun part of the job were the celebrities that came in to promote their products!!!"

good,"HSN is an amazing place to work not only are the customers super sweet and fantastic but your team members and supervisors are beyond supportive and positive! They really make sure to stay behind you and make sure that you are doing your best and understand how to deal with every possible situation! I love that we got to pick our own set schedules and they were really supportive and understanding if we needed to step away for a moment or even call off/arrive early and leave early. Overall I love this place and I had a blast being here for seasonal, I wish it wasn't almost over for me and I could stay on as a full time Sales Rep for HSN."
good,I love working from home and it was just so easy and convenient for me. All I had to do was place orders! Pay was good. Wish it was weekly instead. I would recommend to anyone

good,"I have had many jobs in my time keep in mind Hsn at a sales or customer service position is just that a job. With this job they have great pay, benefits , paid holidays immediately starting and you get paid time off, and community service pay. You have opportunity to move up and your voice can always make a difference. This job can give you an opportunity to work from home in your pjs. You have opportunity for a career with specific training in fields but I have no problem with where I'm at and it's very rewarding."

good,The people at hsn are amazing to work with. It is an environment that keeps busy and people are always there to help each other out. And if you need help and not understand what to do. Someone is always there to answer your questions. The products and items they assemble are very easy to package. Then you put the labels on the boxes. But always make sure that the items match with the receipt. That is a very big deal!  If the item does not match you have to make sure you give it to the team leader in charge.  Then they will find the problem. I loved working there and would always give them 5 stars because they keep everything organized..there we're some days that we're not busy but always had something to do. You learn something new everyday you work there and learn faster.
good,HSN is a great company to work for.  They understand that there is a need for a work/life balance and do fun activities on campus to motivate the employees. Example: bringing puppies from local shelters.

good,Had great benefits and support.  I only left because I was working a full time job plus working up to 25 hours a week at HSN and my 7 year old son needed me.  So I had to leave.  I am reapplying with them now.
good,I come in and log in to my station and watch dialer as customers called in to order. I also had to upsell the customer items that matched the items ordered and also mentions todays specials that were advertised on television. I learned patience because I had to often help customers find like products because of sell outs and also I had to find past products for customers. If it was a seasonal item I could not always provide them what they were calling for which was disappointing to both of us but I often was able to come up with an alternative that they were satisfied with.
good,Great benefits and people HSN is a great place to work. Training is great and the people are easy to work with and work for. Supervisors are always there for you.

good,"enjoyed to go to work it was very satisfying"
good,"I worked for HSN as a work-at-home sales representative for almost 2 years (I only left to pursue a full-time job). The convenience of working from home is already incredible, but add that to a respectable company that is easy to be proud of. HSN offers exceptional products and services, and treats their employees like family. You get one-on-one coaching if needed to help meet goals. There are minimal sales requirements, but they are easy to meet if you are engaged with your customer. All calls are inbound so there is no cold outreach. If you struggle with meeting any of your numbers you get coached by not only your supervisor, but also peers on your team that can zone in on the specifics you need for improvement."
good,"taking incoming calls from home shoppers, I learned how to type really fast working here. management  you only see if you have a issues or if you have made an accomplishment. you do have time to get acquainted with your co workers between calls. The most challenging part of this job is leaving it is a very good work environment. I enjoyed going to work and working as much overtime as I possibly could."
good,The environment at the Home Shopping Network provided a wonderful place to learn and work.
good,I was a work at home agent but the organization was very helpful to my work needs.
good,A fun place to work. Great benefits and always a chance to learn with new products all the time. Management is available to ask questions. Teamwork is a big part since I am work at home. We work together and help each other. I love meeting new people on the phone and building trust in our company with them.
