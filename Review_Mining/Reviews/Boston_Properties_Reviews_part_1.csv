bad,It was okay to work at this company they were not fair in how they treated the temporary employees including myself don’t let them make you feel less than
bad,This was the worst job that I ever had! The do not care about employees well being.  If sick or experiencing any time of emergency you are still expected to come into work.
bad,"Of all companies ive worked for Boston Properties provided the least amount of support for new hires and people working up the ladder.  They rely mostly on the engineering department to run the buildings, interact with tenants and manage construction jobs with little to no support from management. Normally this would be fine but from what i understand they just outsourced the entire department and took away all these benefits."
bad,"Outsourced all the building engineers, no job security after dedicating many years to the company, corporate had no regard for personal in the buildings."
bad,"Worked here in Princeton almost 10 years, non-union so we get pennies for a raise. I like my maintenance job but do not like being micro-managed by immediate supervisor. Being able to have people skills, communicate by at least saying good morning or good night should not be so difficult for low level working supervisors."
good,"It was a disappointing experience, though most of my ill feelings toward the company are contributed an unapproachable and hypercritical micro-manager, nepotism in the hiring process, and lack of team work/basic communication. You are unlikely to find a mentor here."
good,Generally a nice place to work. Fast paced day at times and other slow. Peers were helpful with questions. Advancement was not available. Pay very low for the work you do.
good,Great place to work. I’ve been with this company 11 years. It’s time for something new. I’ve also been in the same position the entire time. This company has commited employees and there’s just no movement.
good,"This is where you meet different people everday, but still must treat them like you've known them forever. Nothing less than profesional."
good,Tours and maint of three commercial buildings.
good,"okay place to work, but expectations are very high, while pay scale is low..."
good,"Great for college kids. Good pay, ducky hours. Also their break system sucked. Too many chiefs not enough Indians. Overtime is given to whoever they prefer instead on whoever is the senior in the equation."
good,company was good to work for/provided nessesary input and management in the overall was great
good,Boston Properties is an exceptional company to work for.  It was a relaxed and professional atmosphere and my fellow colleagues were extremely knowledgeable in their respective roles.
good,Good at what they do. Always striving to complete their goal/mission. Employees are driven. Management/higher authority are very encouraging and motivational for their employees.
good,"Shirt & tie kind of a place.  Learned internal systems and a bit about accounting for a REIT, JV, and third party fixed assets.  Management is well-trained and knowledgeable.  Co-workers are nice people.  Stuffy environment though.  The people are the best part of the job as well as the benefits.  Great location in the prudential center tower."
good,"The workplace culture at BP was hardworking, but balanced with perks. I enjoyed being able to work on various projects and not being stuck at my desk all day long."
good,Company is great . Good benefits and great people. The only problem I have is Im under pay and been for this company for couple of years and finish a lot of schooling and have a lot of certifications and still haven’t got promoted yet. And they seem not to care much. But overall good company they take care of you but hard to get a  promotion .
good,"Working at the Prudential Tower in Boston was a joy. There was never a dull moment. A fun diverse environment build up of many tourist and tenants (employees) from health care, financial firms to law firms my job was to communicate with the entire body and ensure everyone's safety. Taking employees concerns and following up with my superiors was a daily responsibility. I learned how to be detailed oriented, a quick thinker also learning to communicate with various individuals with multiple personalities and desires."
good,"this company is a good place to work.  People are very friendly but its a super corporate and professional work environment.  Not suitable for just anyone, but if you are looking for a professional environment, this is the place for you."
good,"work 8-4:30"
good,"Working in Boston Properties it was a great workplace, from the chief and all co workers, we made a good team and enjoyed work in this company also they guide each time that I need it."
good,"The day begins as I check the curb appeal (or line of sight) that a tenant would see. Items I view and address are: is the sidewalk clean, is the lobby glass clean, are the floors clean, does my access card work, are the security guards present and attentive, do I have to wait for an elevator, is the elevator clean, can I access my secured space, are the lights on, was the trash removed, does my computer turn on, is the temperature comfortable. I learn and get exposed to something nearly on a daily basis which is what I love about this industry. We have a great team at our building and we all communicate very well with each other, without that it would be much more challenging. The hardest part of the job is logistics -meaning planning between work, tenant, regional directives and keeping everything amicable for all parties. I am one of the lucky ones who gets up every day and I love what I do. Solving new problems every day is extremely gratifying."
good,"Check building system and equipment through the BSA system"
good,"The people that I work with made the job worth while.  "
good,Decent location.
good,Boston Properties is an excellent place to work. They take pride in all properties they own and manage and they hire extremely capable people to perform all necessary tasks. Lots of education and training available.
good,Typically a day at work involves responding to tenant needs and service calls.  Preventative maintenance is ongoing.  Escorting contractors and giving access to work areas.  All in all a good job with great benefits.  Some of the people are odd but that's typical anyplace
good,"I enjoy my job and I love the people I work with. However, there is no opportunity for advancement in an administrative role unless you have a desire to transition into Property Management. Since working for this company, I have gotten married and had my first child. The commute with me living in Maryland and working in Washington, DC is something I would like to remove from my work week. I desire to work closer to home or at least have the option to drive to work and not have to pay over $300/month to park in my building's garage. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with and the atmosphere of the office, starting at the head."
good,"The job has an interesting change for me, but I have learned a lot from this position and also what I can and cannot do. Overall, I have enjoyed my time here."
good,"Very proffesional company with tons of room for job growth, and learning experiences in the field. I entered pretty green and was educated and trained to become a dedicated operating engineer."
good,great place to work plenty of vacation and personal time excellent benefit package including 401k great culture and people. only draw back was not much room to advance and job security is questionable depending on location
good,"BXP offers a great place to work and grown in your field,"
good,"Company is leader in industry.  Management want employees to be involved and develop their skills.  Encourage employees to further their education with aid from company.  However, salary is not at their peers level."
good,Great people that are willing to share their knowledge. The most enjoyable part of working at Boston Properties is the continuous learning of all aspects of commercial property management
good,"A typical day at work includes; greeting guests , assisting guests with directions and or questions , a building tour  ( Interior / Exterior) (Foot / Vehicle Patrol) , responding to various calls i.e. Access Issues, Escorts, Shop lifting, Medical Assistance etc. "
good,Each day is a new adventure. There are quiet moments but very busy days.  You have to be adaptable and ready to deal with  many different personalities.
good,"I worked for BP for 5 years and i wish i would have stayed with them, there employer to employee was by far bar none. There has never been a company that thought about there employees more than this company. The working conditions were far the best i have ever worked at and the attitude of the employees were always positive."
good,I learned that this required alot of attention to detail and focus. Very time consuming but a wonderful environment and good choice in a career path.
good,"I have doing everything from PC repair to the highest level firewall/security design for government occupied buildings.  My knowledge of technology, the business and people management have grown during this time."
good,"Great place liked the people bosses were fair, great benifits, great raises great place to work I miss it alot hope to go back some day,"
good,Excellant company to work for with great beneffit packgae. Great communication between managment and employees.  Being with the company for 15 years it was a very difficult decision to leave but made a family decision to relocate out of state.
good,"Boston Properties is a solid Blue Chip company with great people leading the helm.  I would not have left if it was not for the work of a trusted confidante that lured me from them.  They people across the board are great and the work environment, though stressful and demanding, is fun and collaborative."
