bad,"I make good money, but I wouldn’t suggest this place to anyone at this time This place has gotten just sick!!! Don’t know who to trust in upper management so you just don’t express your concerns, it’s all around uncomfortable anymore. Corporate would have a field day with the things going on in this place. Upper management has become a joke. The men and women both in the office seem to have forgotten this is a work place and not a play ground. Ive always been told not to sleep with anyone where you make your money. Guess they never caught on to that rule growing up. Hiring new HR and safety etc. and I swear safety thinks she runs the place. All over all the men in the plant walking around with her clipboard barking rules and orders. But stops to talk to all the men in the plant. It's just disgusting. Senior workers afraid of losing they jobs to young punks who never show up half the time. Place needs major help. I won't be here too much longer that's for sure. Because there's a few of us that are about to explode! GET IT TOGETHER!!! Grow up!! Do your job and go home like you're supposed to!"
bad,Laid off without notice. Said too many workers at the time. Then a couple weeks later was hiring 20 plus people again. No phone call back. I showed up to work on time and nothing.
bad,Was looking for a stable place I could grow and get more experience and it just hasn't been the case. I want to feel like the employer is sympathetic to employee issues and questions.
bad,It was such a terrible place to work worst manager she was such a terrible person moral was low I was so happy when they shut it down that manager ran that place into the ground .
bad,"This company had a horrible culture and did not promote from within, period.  Yearly we would be subject to cuts and belt tightening, only to hear about the gross margin records being set at the end of the year."
bad,"When you get interviewed they promise you bucu over time, profit sharing benefits, ect. I know someone that has been with this company for 6 months.  They are lucky to get 40 hours a week, no profit sharing bonus, no Christmas bonus, NOTHING that they were promised. This company is a joke. Then to top it off employees were informed yesterday that things will only be getting worse so they can waist money on things that are not needed or pointless! How can a company screw their employees (the back bone of every company) and expect a good response.  In my opinion never, never NEVER stoop low enough to need this job."
bad,"Se trabaja con mucho stress debido al maltrato y malos modos de la Dirección Local."
bad,Grab any free samples you can and run.  Don't hang people out to dry when they go to bat for you with the local customer that impacts other areas of the business and bonuses
bad,very stressful place to work.they was very bad to the workers and threated poelpe bad .work their people everyday no break .it does pay good but is not worth it.
bad,They work you like a dog for the busy season then let you go. If you don't kiss butt and get in with the in crowd you will not advance at all. They keep the amazing people who deserve to be promoted stuck on their machines and let the people who can't make numbers and slack off be promoted to higher positions they are undeserving of. Don't get your hopes up working here. It's a sinking ship.
bad,"Not a good place to work, Supervisor want treat you right. Hot place to work, good lunch rooms. Not enough pay for the job that you do, Can't decide if you going to work 50 or 40 hours a week."
bad,"They only hired temporary workers for the season, instead of air conditioning they had giant fans that rotate which does make the air less stuffy but does nothing for the heat."
bad,"Easy to get hired, pass a hair follicle test and background check and you're in! Jobs are difficult and production based,  usually paying 7.25hr. You can make 10-13 hr after getting good enough at job to make the high production quotas. Raises are lump sum based .25 times a estimated 2000 hrs. No cost of living raises whatsoever! Not one through 20yrs. Hot, nasty work. Only for the desperate"
bad,Management was hard to get along with. Stressful environment to work in. not understanding at all they only cared about the numbers at the end of the day
bad,"Nice lace to work, before the new supervisors from macys came in and I'm pretty  sure they dont know what they are doing. safety is horrible, people are very dangous on the forklifts, and the leads and supervisors dont treat their employees fair."
bad,"Its the worse job, Management do not care about their employees. they pick and choose who can get a good position."
bad,"Poor management, double standards,care less how employees feel on the floor. Have big numbers and goals but nothing  to work with. Expect a lot out of there employees but give them little in return.."
bad,"They pay ok, their benefits have high deductibles, favoritism is all over there. If you know someone or if supervisors like you,  you'll do well "
bad,Very poor management. Treated people like you are just a number. Never had enough people to run the lines. They didn't care about anyone or never wanted to listen to you. Does not pay the hours you worked.
bad,I want to get to done to fast  and and do to many jods they will fier you if you get hurt and tell them they have a lead that will tell you to go faster when you are allready going fast the manager is trying to manage two buildings it is a big mess
bad,They don't respect you and won't let you use the bathroom or anything. They cuss you and scream at you all night. The team leads always are no where to be found. Every machine in there doesn't work and requires fixing every 30 minutes.
bad,management lacked a lot to be desired I really didn't like how they treated their employee's . Stayed with it though and stuck it out till something better came along
bad,"Newell Rubbermaid was a very positive and productive workplace. I learned a lot of internal company skills like production, packaging, quality, modeling, and layer. The company is very good for team work and would recommend any hard working person to work for them. They offer good starting pay for any all works able to get on and settle in a positions with the company. "
bad,Poor mgmt and company benefits would not work for again when manager compares herself to God and demands that level of respect. Hours were never consistent.
bad,mangers are very unprofessional they talk to you how ever they wont even if they are not you mangers. the work days are very long especially being a 12 hour shift they don't have enough people to carry the workloads in that place.
bad,"I was terminated for being in the hospital for two days, even after providing my hospital note on two separate occasions."
bad,"I've been working here for about six months now, and I haven't felt worse mentally or physically in my entire life. They start you off with promises of safety and how people will help you and how if you physically can't do a job, let someone know and you'd be switched. They harp on ergonomics and safe lifting techniques, but on the floor? All that goes out the window. Floor people don't care if you are like me and literally too short to reach into boxes sometimes. I'm short, but I'm certainly not outrageously so! The majority of people are over 5'8"", yet lack the ability to understand that shorter people have shorter arms! It's not for a lack of strength either. "
bad,The company is exactly what the title says... DRUGS and POOR WORKING CONDITIONS!! And don't ask a manager for help because you won't get it
bad,Employees were required not to communicate per management. There was very little effort to build a team and allowed employees to work as a cohesive group.
bad,I didnt work here for long i was a temp to hire. I go laid off due to cuts that the company had to make to reduce cost and a contract employee didnt mean as much as a direct employee at this place
bad,A typical day at work consisted of standing for 12 hours and making sure the machine work accordingly and also doing my other responsiblities with shipping and cleaning the product. I did not learn alot from this job because the management and the people where not well mannered. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the management because i was racially harrassed. I did not enjoy this job that was I resigned .
bad,The management to the supervisors treat you like a jail inmate. Blow the whistle when its time for break and act as if they are better then you because they have a different color vest on then you. It is not a good company to work for if you really want to succeed . I could go on and on for days about the company but its a waste. Glad I quit it felt like I was released from prison the day i walked out.
bad,"There were no supervision, no determined rules, and if you did not do your job right, without training then you were punished."
bad,Very favorites oriented.  No work/life balance mandatory overtime. Sometimes brought in to do jobs other than your own then criticized for not doing it well. Management is always looking for reasons to get rid of you if you are a long time senior employee.
bad,"Too much politics, very stressful environment... a lot of sharks there. No career planning or coaching.  Random overtime and frequent relocation of offices in Atlanta"
bad,local distribution management is only concerned with getting theirs at your expense. managers are not worthy of respect since they offer no respect or even simple courtesies to the employees.
bad,I should have walked into HR with a tape recorder and give it to a lawyer. I was in Brute dept where the trash cans are made. So physically yeah its a hard job for a 12hour shift. But to make life worse the employees like to verbally harass you with racial slurs. Try telling that to your manager whos mouth needs to be kicked in. I was there for the paycheck. I would have stayed but try working with the same jerks everyday isnt easy. This is no lie. I really sis work there. Plastics division off Valley Ave. Virginia.
bad,"Hot. Long hours. Dehydration is a real threat. Line leaders, and management definitely play favorites. If you're not a suck up, the constantly ride you, and act like you're not doung your job correctly."
bad,"Not sure about the whole company but the FL location was not a place to be proud and enjoy to work for. Some of the staff  were very unprofessional and rude. "
bad,"I liked what I was doing, running a machine. The machines ran around the clock so when it broke down it would stay down. Asking management a question or help would b a big deal, you were always bothering them never wanted to help. Mecanics would b helpful unless it was the same thing braking down then it would b fix it yourself..I would have stayed if they were hiring because I did like my machine. And they would lay you off from thanksgiving till after new year. When you needed it the most."
bad,the management is always looking to fire someone i did as they ask and the let me go anyways. tough working environment. its also somewhat slow depends on where you are in the plant
bad,"Very cut throat, no one helps you nor speaks to you. Stuck at a desk with no direction. Managers are not helpful. No one will help you answer questions or find files.  They expect work that is not even made familiar to you."
bad,"I did not like working at Newell Rubbermaid. The people are very childish, and the management isn't any better. They didn't have things figured out. I thank them for the opportunity to work there, but the company is not professional."
bad,"The dept I was in paid descent. The coworkers were nice to work with but the management, supervisors you have to be careful because majority of them do not care about you or your well being. People where getting fired left to right, because they ran all over you. Favoritism was going on within certain people. Changes took place every other week. Nothing is wrong with change but every second you turn around their was a change."
bad,"Rubbermaid Commercial Products in Winchester, VA, is a chaotic place to work where oppressive, dictator-style leadership is a way of life. If a daily dose of ""what part of ----- don't you understand?"" and ""who do I need to fire to get this done now?"" is your kind of fun, then you should find this a great place to work."
bad,"Poor management,  If your not one of the mangers buddies then you don't stand a chance.  No opportunities for hard workers to advance.  Treated very disrespectfully by management.  Not a fun place to work.  Always feel like you are under a microscope.  Management feels the need to bully employees on a daily basis. They have lost a lot of great people in the past few years due to the lack of respect that the management displays.  Would not recommend applying here.  You would be wise to look elsewhere."
bad,"the CEO is rude and she criticized me in front of the other mangers/line leaders ,she was being racist towards me and my cousin. Then she said I’m still a dumb kid with little responsibility"
bad,"The only way to advance is to work overtime. If you don't, expect to stay where you're at. Management has no idea what's going on out on the floor. Sitting in the office for 12 hours not helping at all. Just avoid."
bad,"From the perspective of a temporary worker the company does not care for its workers, Advancement was very difficult, Management started rumors and drama, and I recieved no benefits. The job left me with no time outside of work and you are allowed to call out only 3 times every 90 days. My manager was great though, so the management can't be all bad."
bad,"I hate this place with a ***perfect*** hatred. Just a bunch of greedy Capitolist. This place is operated at such a FAST PACE that I obeserved many mistakes made which clearly could be avoided. The woman ""training"" me is no good. Always lectures you on SPEED and to GET FASTER. A person can only work so fast if thrthey want gpod work. Contantly pushed tp SPEED UP. they want"
bad,"It started off great, then they promoted this Senior Manager from Chicago and she is going to run the place into the ground. Poor communication and management!"
bad,Pick a direction and follow through... changing everything every quarter doesn't help.  Real change takes follow through and time along with empowered employees instead of constant second guessing.
bad,"Post Newell - Jarden merge, the company is being run by a bunch of people who have no idea what is needed to win and will not listen to those with the knowledge and experience to succeed."
bad,Newell has turned in to a giggling girls call center. The do not want you to advance unless you are friends with Management. The manager in our particular department was not knowledgeable at all. Special arrangements were made for certain people.
bad,Couldn’t be managed any worse. Upper management wants more with less.  Continue to cut help on the production floor. Expects the same amount and even more work to be completed with less labor.  Doesn’t care for your safety and puts a budget on tools that are needed to do the job safely. What used to be a great place to work is now terrible.
bad,Management will stand and lie in your face about things happening in the company. Never know if your your going to have a job tomorrow or not. Not very professional atmosphere.
bad,would not recommend place is poorly managed far too much favoritism. no promoting within the company. The management treats you like a number not a person.
bad,"Good place to work if you aren't looking for a career advancement. Terrible management. No air conditioning, not very friendly people, long stressful hours"
bad,I worked with SMX for nearly a year.  The pay DOES NOT reflect the amount of work that is required.  Shifts are extended due to work that is required of you and there is with no extended compensation.  Work is required to be done at home if it is not completed in the office.  It is a thankless job and promotions are slim to none unless you move to a different branch of the business.
bad,"union city distribution center is an adventure in itself. where do we start. a trillion dollar company that practices legal human trafficking. what dO I mean? No set schedule with last minute notice of 12 hour shifts regularly. Pay is not equal to what the job is worth. Mgmt sleeping with women to hire from temp to perm. Point system with no schedule meaning you leave early you're pointed unless you're politically involved or sexually involved. "
bad,This is by far the worst job and place I have ever worked for!!! The management and most co-workers are mean and will throw you under the bus for there own sick twisted gain and enjoyment.. They have there own circle!!! You can be a hard working employee there but that does not matter to them while the people in the circle can be lazy and get away with it. HUH!!!! What I have learned is to never go back there take my ADVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,Management lacks people skills. Do not know how to answers questions.Too many cheifs not enough Indians.
bad,"Difícil que te den planta, usan puras bolsas de trabajo para trabajo y los corren cuando quieren poca estabilidad laboral."
bad,"Poor executives and Sr. leaders"
bad,There are far better jobs out there. Rubbermaid has a bad reputation for setting and run by their own rules. They don't care bout their own employers.
bad,Overtime is more important than family/health. You're child needs stitches? Have to leave work early? They will still penalize you (person experience)
bad,I worked for Jarden Consumer Solutions.  There was no room for advancement.  Management did not assist with growth or gave opportunities to gain transferable skills.
bad,Very political and unprofessional managment. They only look out for themselves and people they care about which are a select few. This place is an absolute joke and I urge everyone to avoid Newell like the plague. Only use as an absolute last resort. You'll regret it when you work for a bit and it tears your body to pieces.
bad,Too many hours. No time off. Slave driving management. No people skilled managers and team leaders. Unsafe working conditions. Racist company. Would not recommend to any living thing.
bad,"A typical day working for NewellRubbermaid consists of trimming excessive amounts of plastic off of finished products. This is mainly due to their technical staff, which is comprised of uneducated individuals with low I.Q.'s. However, not much smarter are the QC inspectors and line coordinators that try organizing each work station. These individuals are the reason parts and clutter lay on the floor. This is due to their poor organization skills and incompetence in finding unique ways of executing assignments."
bad,"Management was a joke, put a janitor into the flow line manager position and had no clue about cnc! Also I missed six days because I was hospitalized and had proof and was still fired, management loved the slackers and treated the hard and good workers like dirt! Started out with free health care then every year it got more and more expensive , 72 hours a week was the norm! Stay away from this sweat shop!!!!"
bad,"Worst job i ever had..currently  still employed there.just waiting on new year to leave this place.Been here 4 yrs.new management sucks.working 7 dys a week.8 to 10 hrs a day. Cars get broken  into on property.management does nothing.They could care less about there employees. .No HR department!! "
bad,This place has gone downhill: no room for growth. If you’re not screwing  with a member of the office staff you’re not going to get anywhere. Just ask a few who get away with everything. Company phones being used for personal reasons  hey there’s plenty more of us that would love a free phone to have for personal reasons We all agree there’s no way the supervisors and HR don’t notice some of the things on camera yet they always telling us they’re watching so they obviously don’t care probably because they are part of the corruption. Corporate needs to get involved and fix the issues before they lose some of us employees that actually do care. Yet we get swept under the rug.
bad,Would not recommend anyone to work here. You work long hours with people who only get high and never show up and if you have any personal matter go on they will fire you
bad,"Dysfunctional organization. Really set in old ways of working. They had a transformation office that was dissolved and was deemed ineffective, yet the leader of that organization was promoted to company president. Previous CEO was based in NY, so moved the company headquarter from Atlanta to Hoboken. Now that the CEO is gone, the Hoboken office is being dissolved, less than 2 years after it was set up, leaving the employees there stranded. The Chief SCO brought in a team from his previous life, favoring them with promotions and high compensation. Even though some of the leaders are allowed to work from home and travel as needed, the Hoboken team were told to either relocate to Atlanta or leave.  "
bad,"Had an awesome boss until we were restructured under a different Supervisor.  Horrible, never had anyone micro manage like this.  We never have any meetings.   Also, depending on who you are, within the team is how you are treated.  In particularly, favors one person and tells her everything.   Ethically, not sure a Supervisor should be talking about other team members to another co-worker.  Very very unprofessional... never seen anything quite like this.  Its to bad because upper management has no idea.  Everyone is too afraid to speak up so it continues"
bad,Prefer not to answer.  I wasn't at Newell Brands very long and I was not hired by Newell Brands.  I was hired by Jarden Corporation before being acquired by Newell Brands.
bad,"The salary they give is decent and comes with nice benefits, but this is all there is. The pros do not outweigh the cons, such as the lack of any guidance and communication and the fact that progression is only possible if you are willing to move countries. Also, the company does not foster good relations between employees and this is felt in the workplace."
bad,I wouldn't recommend working at Newell.  Everyone has a sense of fear right now after 4 re-org's in 2 years.
bad,"Extremely high turnover. Workplace culture is not great at all. Hence the high turnover. "
bad,Newell is a company that grew too big too fast with no clear direction on how to get there.  There is a culture of hiring your friends and only advancing based on who you know.  There was no payout of bonuses even though eCommerce grew by 40%.  Overall declining morale in the office for the past year.
bad,"Newell Rubbermaid or ""Newell Brands"" as it's called these days is a corporation that has a good potential, but unfortunately the shameless management attitude and way of doing business/ treating their employees is at least shameful. They aren't afraid of investing their money on you, but also won't think twice before getting rid of you no matter how good of an employee you may be."
bad,"Flexibility , learning from the job being independent to manage my work and to get it done , changing the management all the time doesn't give a clear strategy to grow, USA market is the main focus of the company."
bad,"The company goes through regular reorganizations due to their inability to create a sound strategy.  For this reason, there is no job stability.  The culture is poor and there is no rhyme or reason to how they operate from a supply chain perspective.  Management is also very poor at best, no guidance or support is provided - no formal review process either.  The biggest mistake of my career was choosing to accept a job with this company."
bad,I drive 1.5 hours need somewhere closer I hate working weekends and 12 hours.  Work is super slow and I'm needing more hours.  More days a week . I love what I do
bad,I worked for Newell Rubbermaid under a temporary basis It takes at least 6 months to get hired if your lucky. I was a forklift operator and enjoyed my work but had no future.
bad,Newell is a very cut throat company to work for. the management does not care about the employees but once a year at customer service week. other than that they dont care about the workers who put their but on the line to make that place better
bad,"Nice warehouse, But the supervisor needs a management class and basic skills on how to talk to employees and ways how not to discuss employees business."
bad,"It is hot in there"
bad,"Stellar company, but in my opinion the department in which you work will be the key to long term employment. Very high turn over, seems like every month they are hiring. This company has not figured out yet what the issues are within in regards to keeping employees around. If you are looking for work life balance, this company is not for you-they don't support it or allow time for it."
bad,"Moving through integration too quickly, not sure if all divisions will be successful.  Too much change to drive profitable growth."
bad,hired on as a temp and was promised a full time position but was dropped after busy season.
bad,sometimes very fast pace but you got the slow and forever days. the job is easy and alot of overtime if you want it. theres no real challenge to the job have some common since and you will b good.
bad,I wouldn't recommend anybody for newell its too hot in the plant 10 to 12 hours a day 6 days a week no family time no paid time off no vacation time no sick days.
bad,"If you enjoy a very fast paced job and on your feet for 12 or more hours a day then you have it made. Money was mediocre, Just don't get hurt because they will get rid of you."
bad,"I worked here for several years and hated it the whole time. It is all about if they like you. If they will not hire you and they will get rid of you. Their quality of product is not worth it. Markets don't write most of time it write for a short period. A hair dryer was purchased and caught on fire and so did the hair straightener. No one helps each other, they may say you get trained, but it's what you learn on your on."
bad,"it was a good job, just not a good job for people who have children. the money was good but no benefits and no PTO. it was a laid back environment. call volumes where high. but not a stressful work place"
bad,It was to hott and too long.And to compleated.Did not enjoy working in the heat
bad,"I worked at newell for several years and learned everything i could. Out performed 90% of the other employees. I knew more about the overall floor work than most of the so called ""leads"". The leads talk about employees behind their back and about each other. Its very toxic after you start to figure eveyone out. Most of the leads are rude and disrespectful when you get tired of them being disrespectful they will then single you out and treat you even worse. I trained quite a few people on the system they use and later on was passed over promotions for the people i trained. At one point shortly before my departure from the company the first and second shift supervisors were competing to see who could get the most attractive girl to fold their labels for them. I could go on and on with examples of this type of behavior from them amd it follows all the way up to their current manager. Bottom line if your not thier buddy or relative it doesnt matter how hard you work they will screw you"
bad,"This is a great job if you’re entry level, but no room for growth. There’s no work/life balance and morale is lacking. Leadership isn’t involved much."
bad,This company is not a good place to work for. There are too many cheifs and not enough Indians if you have ever heard that term used before. I was sexually assulted by a co worker and the issue was not resolved the proper way it should have been.
bad,"I feel that its not a good work place yhey do mot show the worker how to do there job they throw them in an just let u figuer it out. I asked to go to the rest room came back the one that was in charge that told me i could note ""i been peeing blood"" so i had to go as many times i could to help this problem but when i came bk bout 5 mins he let all the bags of markers fall all over the floor didnt even try to help me i was so agervated cause why ask if they was going to do that i seen NO TEAM i only seen for there self then said dont worry bout the machines i know they tell u awful stories but thats never happien. I was SHOCKED that these people they had leaden thats why newell brands cant keep workers then they talk bout drugs an i ant for that. I want a good team playen job somewhere i can make something of myself. An have good people i want an like to work for cause we know we are a good team players"
bad,It's a good place to work but not enough  money or hours when you don't make production  your paycheck is bad die to machines not working  properly or not enough  material to due job properly
bad,"Unbelievable nepotism favoritism sexism racism"
bad,I started picking goody hair products on a assembly line. Then I started making boxes and labels. I tried to move to a hire payed department but was unable to.
bad,Temp job that was needed at the time. Underpaid and overworked. The environment was hot and uncomfortable. I made it work though.
bad,Not a great place to work for. Worked there for years and not enough pay and recognition for years of hard work and dedication.
bad,"the factory plant was very safe, but lacked in professionalism"
bad,Not a good fit for me professionally. Not channel friendly company and most business would go direct. Not a good situation for someone whose role was managing the IT Channel.
bad,Continued turbulence in the Board room and executive suite cascade down through mid level staff. Many managers use intimidation to drive what is left of the teams. Most of the mid tier staff are excellent people to work with. Clueless management
bad,"Consistent work you are going to be busy your full shift. Answering calls from 8:00 am- 5:30 pm, so consumers are always calling and they are always needing assistance with products and inquiries. The only issue is they say that they bring the remaining temporary employees on, but they have people who worked as a Temp for over 15 months. Contracts were supposed to be 6 months  but a majority have been changed to on going contracts. It depends on how you transfer from brands. I have been a consistent hard worker for the company for the past 9 months and the only thing making it tolerable was the overtime, because the pay is not sustainable without ."
bad,"You are at the mercy of this employer. People are fired on claims while others do the same exact thing, IF NOT WORSE, and continue to hold employment."
bad,"As far as the work goes, its very rewarding assisting consumers and helping resolve issues for products, and guidance or specific needs. "
bad,Poor Management/ Poor Team Effort/ Bad Communications/ Safety Hazards/ Bad place for Job Security/ Overall This is not the place to work if you want a career. But if you need a job its good pay.
bad,Its a very top down run facility. Management does not listen to associate suggestions and concerns. Safety is second fiddle to production even though they tell you otherwise.
bad,I would not recommend working for this company. The culture is one of us nd them between management and employees... I say this as a former member of management.
bad,This job appeared to be very bias. If someone didnt like you basically even if it was just personal reasons than your job was not safe. That isn't a good settling feeling and for that reason I would not reccommend it
bad,We were laid off for a lack off good management. The company is not structured as well as some of the other places I worked for.
bad,"Hardees in the beginning was a great place to work . But in my store , nobody wanted to stay . Due to management , we were always behind on employees and staff ."
bad,"Long hours and then if the work is still not done, more hours are required.  "
bad,"I start my day in a early morning meeting to asset what need to be done for the day.. I proceed to go get my forklift & pick up my work & than for the rest of the day I pick orders to be shipped out of the building to their correct destinations. But if need i fill in any other areas of the building to apply as much help as needed."
bad,I worked here only as a temporary employee. At that time we were working at least 6 days a week sometimes 7 - 12 hour days. It was very grueling.
bad,"There are some good day when the manager was good. But because of some the manager got the position base on who they know, it leads to imbalance. And they are no check and balances to rate leadership to hold accountable."
bad,Worst management ever. Work life balance is way off. Top level decisions are poorly communicated and usually make no logicial sense and employee morale is low.
bad,"I worked an average of 12 hours a day, 6 days a week.  Goals were unattainable due to the tremendous workload.  The only perk was summer hours that I never got a chance to enjoy.  Benefits were subpar.  The shareholder fiasco in 2017 was ridiculous enough to be a reality tv show."
bad,"In general the company is struggling due to its performance"
bad,This company bought Elmer's Glue in my area. They tried to push their products out even tho their machines that make laminated boards are over 22 years old.  They try to blame their employees for the mistakes that the machines are doing.  They have tried to milk the old machines for every ounce they can even tho they have added some upgrades to the machine’s it causes them to breakdown almost every day.    The pay is OK but not worth the strain of the job.
bad,"The business is going downhill. I used to love this job. However, management is lacking in training. There is no leadership and they lack in caring. The only plus side to this job is the benefits. "
bad,"Had to take night shift to start, with the promise of moving to days when the opportunity came up. After being on nights for 5 years, the company hired multiple new people for this position on days and would not move me. Never would give a clear reason why."
bad,As Rubbermaid it was a good place to work.  Newell took over it was not fun at all.  Constant management change.  Threatening employees. Glad to be gone from there.
bad,"Most jobs very fast, very hot, or very cold. Most people do not like it at Newell but it is a job. You have mandatory overtime if you do not have enough overtime hours in. Insurance is expensive and not very good."
bad,"Business changes mean that no one is safe and no one knows exactly what is going to happen.  Day to Day culture is awesome, but the uncertainty runs rampant"
bad,Corporate structure unstable due to changes taking place over the past  5 years. 
bad,Very particular culture and low opportunities for growing. Good for initial levels
bad,Not the best job to have. The company dont really give a darn about their employees. Pay is okay. Lots of back stabbing and people screwing management to get ahead.
bad,"Very happy to no longer be working there. They made everyone move to Huntersville, NC with no say from the employees. Benefits are good as well as the pay, but Corporate cares nothing about the employees."
bad,It is a place with very high turnovers and the management places a tremendous focus on short term results.  It is not a good place for people planning a long term career.  Minimum coaching and development...
bad,"supervisor is a bully, does not seem to care only insists the machine continues to run nonstop.  machine is always breaking or broken, extremely high turn over rate"
bad,"A typical work day starts with conference calls, resolving quality issues, educating new team members on category. It is a fast paced environment, but the sense is that hard work is not appreciated. one could spend 18hours working to get things done but it is not appreciated."
bad,Daily workload is extremely repetitive. With little or no advancement available. More leadership is needed for the business to thrive. Employees are being treated poorly.
bad,"Very stressful job, HR puts things in place to help the work life balance but wont stand behind it leaving it up to each manager to decide if they will support it IE work from home and flexible working hours. Many departments are understaffed which means several things are left undone or you have to spend twice the amount  of time on them as you usually would. Most of the people hear are friendly and willing to help if they have the time."
bad,Hard to get along with employees and hard to get management to change ways. Hardest part of each day was not knowing how many hours you were gonna work each day
bad,"Operates on good ole boy system, no chance for advancement, no respect. Too many hours, hostile environment and management. Treated like children, no trust."
bad,"Not a bad place to work for an okay pay. I mostly liked the people I worked with. The work wasn't to bad, but it wasn't something I enjoyed. The production numbers were always high! All 10 hours a day, you ran out of energy quick! I wouldn't see myself going back there,"
bad,"Start by Scanning product in or out of box."
bad,A typical day consent of verifying orders for shipping. Our production was posted daily and sometimes half way during the shift. We worked 10 hour shifts in a warehouse. The hardest part of the job was sometimes the weight of some of the boxes. The work environment could be harsh due to no air conditioner.
bad,"Newell's business model is fairly straight forward in that they continually invest and divest consumer product lines to squeeze what ever cost they can out of a product and reduce pricing to get as much volume as possible out of their main distributors. Over the past few years they have experimented with a shared services model and segment models having had limited success with both. As of Feb 2016 they are joining business segments which will increase work loads while limiting clear priorities and any time saving innovation is discouraged. "
bad,clean out the machines and dispose of the metal shavings and sheep up the shop.
bad,"It can be a really easy job if everyone is doing their thing, most of the time thats not the case especially in 1 and 2 shift. You cant have an opinion because management just brushes it off as you being a crybaby, especially 2 shift. Pay is alright if you don't own a house or have kids. Favoritism play an important part in the warehouse so you really have to be careful."
bad,"Space looks great when you walk through the door but the open barn design is very difficult to work in. No place to think or have a conversation. This leads to lots and lots of gossip and mean words."
bad,the job and the people i work with directly are good.  Management and higher ups are horrible.  You are not recoginized for your hard work.  There is no room for advancement unless you want to suck up.
bad,"Fast pace, brand focused, team work, result driven,.  The most enjoyable part of my job was managing my direct reports and working with them to build on their career.  Love projects and researching process improvement."
bad,"I enjoyed working within the company that Newell Brands owned, however, many employees did not feel comfortable with so many organizational changes that occurred."
bad,"this was a good job i learned alot from here, until dhl took over it went down hill from there, no breaks less pay and lay offs , if you were getting paid 16 in one position ,your rate would go down with dhl"
bad,I would not recommend this employer to anyone i know. Morale is VERY low at this company. No incentives to move up in the company. They play favorites and overlook qualified people for certain positions and they discriminate against African-Americans.
bad,"horrible place to work benefits are good but the management is awful no commination, guidance ,  or help. a supervisor would rather write you up then teach you something. the worst management team that I have ever seen THEY ARE BULLIES."
bad,You work 12 hour shifts on a rotating day schedule. The rotating schedule really conflicts with work/life balance. It's hard to schedule appointments or find consistent child care and very hard to keep your own mind right with the rotation. You will do at least the same work but probably way more work than the  full time workers but you will get paid 3 or more dollars less. You will do their work for them as they bad mouth you to the leads and management behind your back. They will still get to keep their job and you will be laid off or let go. Most people are cut throat and spend more time gossiping than working while you do their job for them. They get the pay and they get to stay. Management is very unprofessional supervisors are frequently fired for misconduct ....yet the complaints still keep coming...hmmm.
bad,"This not a job you make a long term job. I work 30 days with out a day off mandatory overtime. We work in real bad heat condition, late breaks and lunches."
bad,"supervisors needs more relationship training, bad communication, too much overtime, pay is not equal throughout, will let you go if not needed. point system needs to be better, alright benefits, too much micromanagement and not enough breaks."
bad,"This is a non people oriented company,and I would not recommend to a friend or family member. Work / life balance not taken into consideration and very much a who you know to get ahead mentality."
bad,"Assembly line,packed items ,counted items, made sure items wasn't damaged,made boxes up,count lids and bowls ,12 hour shifts ,very hard job ,make sure you keep water and food or you might get sick"
bad,i was done wrong because i had staff infection and had a doctors excuse to be off for a week to heal and turned it in and still got fired
bad,"- existing routines;- "
bad,"it was a ok job but it was temporary work , once job was completed they let go of us"
bad,Not a good company .  trying to get back in the sales trade iam happy in
bad,"Warehouse were all products stored, unloaded or loaded trucks and trailors"
bad,Irwin Tools a division of Rubbermaid Mt. Comfort road warehouse. Company works you to death.. Mandatory overtime 10 hour days and work weekends on top of that.
bad,Ok place to work company has close down so no one can apply to this job it was an good opportunity for you I’ve learn may skills like quality assurance and pick packer
bad,"Newell Brands is full of constant change with no end in site. You really need a good sense of humor to work here due to the unknowns in the job that will undoubtedly come up day 1 thru day 1000. There are not systems in place to do simple tasks, so get ready to spend days or weeks doing something that should not have taken longer than 30 minutes. "
bad,"I liked my job and what I did. However, the management is terrible. I had problems with a lead and all they did was make excuses for him, because he was there for 17 years. I honestly felt like I was working with a bunch of kids at that place. Drama, drama and drama, very immature people. I never worked with so many unprofessional people in my life."
bad,"The company is still a mix of often incongruous departments that are often at odds with each other. When tensions or inefficiencies arise, no redundant departments or teams are phased out, but merely trimmed down and restructured every quarter or so. The people you work with can be great, but they can disappear within the quarter."
bad,"It's a great place to make some cash, but they're constantly turning over people and replacing them.  It's not an easy place to work and they don't really have strong code of business ethics."
bad,"this was once a great place to work.  management has changed in past 6 weeks and now the place is imploding.  ppl there 20+ years leaving and/or looking for other employment. the job itself is good, but people in power definitely throw their weight around.  cliques in management are huge issue.  and if someone in management has an issue with you, you better start looking for another job."
bad,The company is experience significant change at this time as it moved from a 2 pillar business model to business units.  Your experience at Newell is greatly influenced by the business unit you work on.  Overall there are good and talented people at Newell.
bad,"It’s all depends upon you and your pace an development of work environment "
bad,"Too many overlapping positions with inefficient process and communication."
bad,Typical work day is working in the factory and certain injection mold machines. We would switch machines about four to five machines a night trimming the excess plastic from the parts that came out of the machine. Management cared about the number of pieces made on a shift rather than the employees. Everyone was out for themselves and wouldn't assist anyone that needed the assistance. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the machines. Most enjoyable part was when the shift was over.
bad,"Working at Newell provides a good balance between work and life, thanks to the generous holiday allowance and the possibility to work from home from time to time. However, the management style at the company leaves much to be desired."
bad,"Worked in inventory control. Learned aow to operate the RF unit and to operate a cherry picker, fork lift. Became proficient in inventory control."
bad,"aprendi muchas cosas buenas y malas, la responsabilidad la limpieza,el orden,los superiores muy buena onda aunque para la gente de la bolsa de trabajo siempre habia discriminacion,aprendi a trabajar en equipo,la parte mas dificil fue trabajar con señoras dificiles y envidiosas,lo que mas me gusto fue que la gerencia ayuda mucho a los mismos empleados."
bad,El ambiente laboral es bueno pero los cambios constantes en el Senior Management no favorecen el compromiso necesario
bad,"After being laid off from a plant closing, I look back and see things that went on that could have been improved. The training program they had for set-up techs was practically non-existent. After repeated requests and inquiries about further training, my supervisor at the time told me that Rubbermaid does not offer training. I had to learn almost everything from my co-workers. There was a so-called training program and several skill levels associated with my position that I could attain, but the materials/skills they had were old and obsolete and did not apply to the machines we used. Tests were used to qualify for the next skill level (after study of some current and some obsolete data) and some employees had copies of these tests with the answers. I want to be worth what I'm paid and did not want to advance my position and pay by cheating. I enjoyed adjusting machines to make a better product or doing what I could to make others' jobs easier."
bad,Good money. Management sucks. They are not personable at all. I had a shift change and was given a small raise for it. Absolutely not worth it. Try somewhere else
bad,"The company went through a huge merger, now selling half the business.  Some teams are strictly 9-5 and some are more like 7:30 to 8 every night.  It depends what department."
bad,Not enough job security have been working there for 6 months and I'm still getting minimum hours and no contract. Everyone that works there are nice though.
bad,"Production is very hot in the summer and very cold in the winter.  There is only spot heating and cooling in the plant.  If you work in the office anywhere but the head office, you can expect them to move your job to the head office without much, if any notice."
bad,"Worked on the assembly line from Jan to March 2016. During some of the worst ice that year, I would get off a twelve hour shift at 6am and see that the parking lot had not been salted or cleared. I would be forced to sleep in my car til day light and dig my car out."
bad,"The only positive to working at Rubbermaid was the great payrate. Working conditions are horrible; dirty everywhere, oily floors, could in the winter and terribly hot during the summer with temps above 100 many times. Management will give you a yearly ten minute briefing on how to recognize heat stroke and ONE free medium size Gatorade per 12 hour shift to keep you hydrated but only on days that are 100+. Rubbermaid cuts benefits on a yearly basis and raises the prices on the ones they allow you to keep. Other reviews here talk of free lunches, but if you work on the production floor you might get four a year and a cupcake for Mother's Day. Office employees enjoy forty hour weeks, no weekends, free coffee and snacks along with air conditioned offices and daily catered lunches paid for by the company. So you should notice that most of the high rated reviews here are made by support staff employees that have no idea what production people endure to make the product at the rate prescribed by those same support staff. Management allows cliques to form inside departments that are allowed to pick on the other employees and can actually lie enough to get people terminated without any evidence. It was a very good place to work when I started but after a few years, not so good."
bad,This Job came to me unexpectedly.  Once i came in  each day i gave it 110% of my effort. Unfortunately that wasent enough. Management was slow and uninformative. Most Associates were Comprehensible. Finally the pay rate was the Cheapest Affordable in the High Desert.
bad,"Typical day would start off at 5 am we would clock in and had to the floor to receive our assignment and work station for the day. We would learn how to assemble all different types of brooms, mops, deck brushes etc. The hardest part of the job was the early start with the little 15 minute breaks in between but the best part of the job would have to be every Wednesday they would have chik-fil-a come for lunch."
bad,"Too much re-organization.  Re-organizing, selling off profitbale brands, creating HQs to fit location of senior leadership while laying others off to ""save money""."
bad,A typical day at work is unorganized and lack of communication. I have learned alot as a process technician in the business. Management is always changing and not knowledgeable of the work being done on the shop floor. Work place drives safety. Hardest part of the job is trying to self manage the work flow with a mismanaged schedule. I enjoy the physical part of the job.
bad,Just an ok place to work.  Generally not so culturally friendly.  If you are not a part of the old family at Newell you do not matter.  They only look out for those who have been working there for a long period of time..
bad,"Ever since Newell Rubbermaid purchased Jarden the company has been failing. There has been so much “restructuring ” that they have lost a ton of their workforce leaving more work for the remaining people. The time that I was there, there were so many different people in the board and ceo type positions that it makes you worry about the future of the company. Newell bit off more than they could chew when they purchased Jarden and are doing a horrible job trying to rectify that. They are already selling off company’s to make up their losses. They are taking away thousands of jobs to help recover their losses as well. This is not a good company to work for as they say you have opportunity and the next day they eliminate your position. The business model that this company follows is a failing one and the future of the companies that are a part of Newell Brands are never safe."
bad,"it was a great job to work for the people are nice and they train you well and it a fast pace and you get a good pay raise when you learn a new machine keep you busy and the time go fast,"
bad,Hard to advance. Lots of non English speakers. Yellow shift ther is the best because they have events for holidays. Not the worse. You just have to watch where you walk and talk cuz they could get rid of you easily.
bad,"Newell Brands has a great portfolio of brands and has hired aggressively in the past 12-18 months to expand into new areas, especially eCommerce. The company and senior management clearly believe in their long-term mission, but a series of financial misses over the course of 2017 and poor communication to its employees has left Newell Brands full of disillusioned and stressed employees. Recent announcements about the potential to sell up to 6 brands as part of a restructuring has compounded this issue, and made employees feel even less secure in their future, and the company's future itself."
bad,"Always had something to do, but the managment was bad. The managers had no respect for the workers and didnt take care of a conflict if there was one."
bad,This company is always downsizing. People are selected based on who they like not so much on what you do. They expect you to work long hours and you do not feel appreciated. The major benefit is that you get a discount on product.
bad,"Great people to work with and can develop lasting friendships with colleagues but work life balance is flaky at best due to expectations of always being available and non-stop urgent requests from leadership."
bad,I had very little dealing with office personnel. Headquarters was in North Carolina & would get back there maybe every 3-4 years.
bad,"Fun work environment, ability to learn more about the many operations of each machine."
bad,"Over the duration of being with this company, the benefits are what I would say to be best while employed by Rubbermaid. Benefits include the basics: dental, vision, medical and multiple HSA options. About 80 in/20 out. Company offers on-site screenings for employees to receive extra HSA contributions. Free flu shots are given and gym membership included. "
bad,Newell was going through major transition when I was there so the leadership was lacking. There was good work life balance and salary was fine but not a happy place to work.
bad,"Management was picky about who they choose to help"
bad,"A typical day will start with what item you will run."
bad,"Worked for Newell about 10 years. Never once felt job security. Company restructures and changes direction constantly... A poor vision for the future accompanied by the problematic acquisition of Jarden has resulted in a major decline in Newell. As an employee, things became even more unstable and the future unclear after the Jarden purchase and subsequent liquidation of core brands... There were, years ago, good times but those have since faded for Newell employees. Felt a huge relief once finally laid off. "
bad,"I've worked at Newell for 4 year and it started out great. They had a vision and stuck to it. It all started to go wrong following the Jarden acquisition. Since beginning of 2017 the company has dropped off a table in nearly every way due to awful leadership."
bad,"Most of the people were alright but the upper management kept speeding the machines up and cutting back the number of workers, an overall  ""don't care"" attitude was slowly becoming more prevalent."
bad,"If you can handle 60 hour weeks and management having you do something just to change there minds the next day,"
bad,"As said before, I really enjoy the team work, getting the people together to solve the issued linked to the customers."
bad,The job will indeed be better if they were completely staffed atleast 80% of the time. Supervisors need retraining. The job of a Lead is not taking too seriously. We get triple the work instead of overtime when big orders come in.
bad,"Leadership at the top lacks direction and environment has become increasingly toxic. High turnover and layoffs. "
bad,Newell has cleared out the old guard and is establishing new culture and the results are very much TBD.  The lack of established leadership and the centralization of everything to a few people at Newell is concerning.
bad,"Rubbermaid was a reliable career opportunity, but as of lately hours have decreased and not steady. Supervisor is proficient but team leads are not. Job assignment is not bad but extensive training involved"
bad,Newell Rubbermaid is not a bad place to work at all but the pay sucks and that's the only reason I plan to leave. No employee appreciation financially.
bad,A typical day at work consists of taking technical support calls for DYMO and Rhino Products. Provide assistance to customers and make necessary changes to satisfy the customer if needed. The company had dedicated morals and tactics to please customers and stand behind their product but did not effectively train new staff so responsibilities could be carried out smoothly for a call center environment.
bad,"I really enjoyed working for this company. However , it is seasonal. Then again we was opted to work at different lines and people per day. Or we was able to work on the same area if needed."
bad,Newell Rubbermaid was great place to work & great people to work with and it was a very busy place to work. I look forward to going to work every day as I enjoy my job.
good,Day is fully utilized.  Will be able to work cross functionally to accomplish tasks. Work Life balance is a challenge. Organization encourages independent thinkers and provides latitude to grow.
good,they are horrible plant manager is horrible the place isn't fair at all you can work you butt off and they don't care as long as your on the floor they don't care about there employees
good,Loved working at Newell Rubbermaid up until change in managment.
good,"Many of nights I would work past 5 o'clock because deadlines are deadlines at RCP.  It wasn't uncommon to work until 1 or 2 in the moring and then be expected to be back to work at 8AM. "
good,"this building is the only one that does not have AC or Heat, you either burn up or freeze to death while working there. Very old building, this company has changed names over the years."
good,"The company has left this area,  sad since it was started here.  The coworkers were amazing and helps one another.  It was like a big family. The company didn't want to stay in this area."
good,It was a little to big of a company.  They had to relocate to Atlanta so I was let go.  Benefits started right away which was nice.  Management was not so great.  Never got any feedback on where I stood.
good,"Gives benefit of doubt to foreigners but unforgivable to Americans. Management only concerned with production and not employees. Very low compensation for employees rushed training, have no concern for work life balance."
good,"I don't want to come off as ungrateful, but here are several things that must change. My company was taken over by DHL. That was the start of most issues I'm having."
good,I love working and always take a lot of pride in what I do I can work fast paced and still do excellent work I am a company man and love to teach others the trade good maintenance tech. Are hard to find and I consider myself to be one of the best in Shia state. I follow orders by management and very safety minded safety is very important I an lock out tag out trained and am certified ferry responder.
good,I ran a transtaker and also made large and small trash can baby changer cut excess plastic of the trash cans and baby changer  I put things on pallets to be put away
good,Poorly managed warehouse facility.  There is a very high turnover and very little opportunity to advance.  The work culture is chaotic because the work schedule changes on almost a weekly basis.  Everyone there are poorly trained and because of it there is a high turnover in personnel.
good,Little to no training that is balanced around longest employed. Supervisor was great at the time team leader sucked scared to stand up for employee. Good benefits but paycheck was not great. Lots of layoffs no security.
good,"Poor work environment, very small work cubes.  Not too concerned with educating employees, very limited opportunity for advancement.  Co-workers good people."
good,The company as a whole is alright. The DC was a different story. Worked long hours and job was very stressful. It was all good for several years and then upper management outside the DC made some very bad decisions that cost the company financially that caused a downfall of the DC and many upper management lost their jobs. We had some good employees with the DC but we had a lot of employees that mainly was temps and created problems in the DC.
good,The CEO was constantly changing directions. Very poor management. No room to move up within the company they do not value their talent and their stock price reflects that.
good,Very talented group of employees but many were leaving due to workplace culture.  Flexible hours and ability to do some work remotely was good.  Management was not involved enough in my progress and development.
good,"Newell Rubbermaid is wonderful for anyone in a salary position but for anyone in an hourly position, job security and work hours are not really guaranteed."
good,Some of the supervisors are pretty awesome and dome have no idea as to what's going on and count on team leads to make decisions for them. The 12 hours is hard when you have a family.
good,A cohesive strategy and vision is needed for this company. Management needs to reduce rework and inefficiencies on a day to day level and provide strong leadership for the vision.
good,Company is not being managed properly. Jarden acquisition put the company in a really bad state.  Many good people are losing their job and the direction is unstable.
good,There are tons of great people. On the engineering side it was good pay but it was a more about being buddys with upper management than it was about the quality of work you do.
good,"They liked my work quality and speed. And were training me on additional machinery. They said they didn't want to lose me. But, after 5 months all us temp workers were laid off. They said they didn't have enough work to keep us all. And since I have heard that is their pattern. It is seasonal work only. Slow season is usually Oct-Dec. "
good,Long work day if you work night shift they don't care about having you do quick turn around for mandatory meetings or staying over and working 14 hour days
good,"I would come in before 6:30  and go to our quaterback meeting. When the meeting was over I would go to a machine and work. I learned how to lay markers, and do change overs and paperwork. Hardest part of the job was the changeovers. Getting the machine and other workers ready for a new order. I enjoyed having the breaks."
good,Different people from different countries are working at Newell which makes it interesting for me.
good,"Employees tend to work against each other, not as a team. "
good,I was employed here too short to truly evaluate.  I will have to pass on this.  I was laid off after only 5 months of working here.
good,"Travel 90% of the time and work remotely."
good,Pay was good but the management is terrible.  They have no pride in the product that they sell.  Management also believes they own you and don't want you to think for yourself.  They also don't care about their people and will downsize in order to make bonus along with fudging the numbers.
good,"Factory work, hard."
good,"If you have to work at Newell-Rubbermaid's Mogadore Operations, then know the majority of the work to be found there are low-level manufacturing positions whose prospects for advancement are nearly non-existent. "
good,Temp service that does a good job of get people placed. Not exactly truthful about the assignments.
good,Difficult working atmosphere as the company looks to sell itself.  Day to day working is made difficult by having no ability to look past the next quarter.
good,Hate that I had to leave. It was a really good company. They give goodie boxes certain time's of the year. They had employee appreciation day's. Company cook outs.
good,"Long hours, hard work and at the end of the day the pay does not represent the work put in. Once you work here, you rarely have any personal time."
good,"I learned how to run all the machines and pack boxes for shipment."
good,"Products of Sanford Division are very strong, management changes all of the time, new products regularly, one product drives the company ""Sharpie."""
good,"Best Co-Workers on the planet!  "
good,"Sanford Corporation was a place to be with brands like PaperMate, Sharpie, Foohy, and Expo flourishing. The culture was great with a lot of diversity and everyone had clear objectives. "
good,"As with any good business that is competitive, they don't tolerate idle employees. There is always something you can be doing (This, I completely agree with). What I do NOT agree with is the lack of financial recognition for their most knowledgeable and hard working employees. While they will verbally recognize you as their best (if so be the case), you can only make what you're worth if you come from another company. They will promote, but only on a percentage scale. This means, if you start from the bottom at their entry level wage, with a 3-5% raise every year, and take percentage based promotions, you will ALWAYS be their lowest paid employee in whichever position you take. There is NO negotiating based off of your merit! Learn from this company, and go elsewhere for a career!"
good,"the most enjoyable part of Sanford is staying so busy. It makes the time go by that much faster in between breaks. I learned time management skills, consistency, and that I could push myself further than I thought I could."
good,"Just like any large corporation one can get very frustrated when trying to get help with such things as HR related topics and insurance. Our team's HR group was completely worthless to say the least. The company pays and compensates well; however, be prepared to work 24x7 if needed. I have suffered a marriage due to the travel and work hours and this company will suck the life out of you if you choose to let it."
good,Long shifts and little pay but a very laid back atmosphere . Very steady work . Production lines and buildings could use improvements but very laid back and safe work .
good,"Pay was good, health benefits were horrible. The job culture was bad. They had clicks. Certain people got away with hardly working, while others worked their fingers to the bone!"
good,"Good people work there, but they don't get treated very well. Perhaps I'm just bitter, but after 22 years of service, being told ""we don't need you anymore"" and sent out the door three weeks before Christmas is enough to make you bitter. Lots of other good people went along with me. Sorry way to treat people."
good,I cant really give a good review due to the company relocating out of state.The company started out great before contracting DHL. Now the company has lost a lot of businesses.
good,Everyone concerned about being laid off after recent firings in August.Many employees seem unhappy and reflects in their work. Poor communication is also an issue.
good,A very friendly working atmosphere with knowledgeable associates. There is room to grow and advance in the company with the vast career opportunities in the many business segments
good,I have worked here two times now. Both times the was stuff i dint like as in having to work the weekends with very little work. over time is good when you have the work..
good,Uncertain future due to heavy reliance on Walmart and the imminent loss of sales with them lead to reductions in workforce routinely causing turnover and uncertainty to future employment
good,Hardest part of my job is getting the support to do your job correctly. training of the job is self taught.  the working environment is very much nose to the grind.  Not a lot of down time. The work load is heavy for I feel the we are understaffed.
good,I enjoyed the fast pace of the job as well as all the variety of people I had the privilege of working with.  The work hours are long.  HOT in the summer and COLD in the winter.
good,it was a job. at times fun at times you had to put your family behind and responsibilities of homelife behind. the employees made it bearable with humor and being in same boat
good,Very decent place to work. The pay could be More but I liked it there fun atmosphere it does get hot and cold bit a good place to work I believe. I would recommend it
good,"Great place to work, but management needs improvement. I loved working for DYMO. Again it's not the job itself but management that i personally had an issue with."
good,"I would never recommend working in a stressful environment for 12 hours a day. The managers are pretty cutt-throat and a bit mean. This job is one that will leave you pretty tired and mentally drained if they didn't have every other day off to sleep and recover. You do the same task every day so it becomes a bit mindless over time and highly repetitively boring. My only advice is that you make a friend while you are there so you don't lose your mind and have someone to talk to during your breaks."
good,on day 1 you're expected to keep up with people that have been there 10+ yrs. If you don't get it within 10 minutes they move you. No chance to learn.
good,"Highly professional work force sacrifices autonomy in extremely flat structure.  The focus on limited initiatives concentrates decision making."
good,Thus job Cary's a lot of stress with it if you are single its a good job pay is OK when I started it was good but I have seen it go down hill in a year its not a place I wish to stay at
good,Newell just acquired Jarden Corporation in Apr-16. I have had the privilege to work with brilliant industry professionals and learn and grow my skill base.  The most challenging part of the job was the lack of support.  The corporate team is spread very thin.
good,"Lifestyles had problems being there for information and assistance, even though it was technically the sole reason for their existence outside of hiring employees."
good,"Horaires aménageable "
good,"overall, Newell Rubbermaid is a solid employer with a good compensation package and average benefits.  The only issue I have is they are not focused in healthcare specific to technology.  Our division is currently in the process of being sold."
good,"loading and unloading of trucks, preparing customer orders, stocking product. Operation of forklift.  learned to use a hand scanner. Management was average, only problem was certain bosses would not listen to suggestions. Co-workers were great to work with. Hardest part of job was dealing with stubborn supervision.   Most enjoyable part was going to work , performing my tasks to the best of my ability and working with a great group of co-workers."
good,I gave this company 11 years of my life. I was laid off with no explanation. If you are between the age of 22-33 it is a great place to work. Otherwise they will lay you off to save money. The products they make are mostly made in China and are junk
good,"A typical day at work is busy, but not really hard work. They have great hours and they will try to work with you on your personal business schedule."
good,"É uma grande multinacional americana de bens de consumo, presente em mais 90% dos lares americanos, porém luta dia a dia para consquistar o coração do consumidor brasileiro."
good,"A typical day would be pulling orders for customers, and leading the leads label the products then loading the truck for shippment. I also maybe in manufacturing pulling product off the line and putting it in inventory."
good,"Newell Rubbermaid /Rubbermaid Commercial Products is a large global corporation that has many product portfolios with opportunities for advancement and training in many diverse skill set sets. Management is trying to mature the company to the global status it aspires to. The morale of the work force is low, the associates job responsibilities are overwhelming, the work/ life balance is unbalanced."
good,The work environment was very stressful. At times would have to work from home without being paid for time worked. Many times you will have to cover for other co-workers while they were out. This meant double the work.
good,The night shift was bad and the hours were long the people were ok but management was horrible very nit picky and fired anyone on there first mess up .
good,"This company has always been in the local business pages (Boca Raton, FL) as struggling, always trying to climb out of its hole. It was once Sunbeam, then Jarden. I thought Newell would have the resources and management to finally make it a winner, but no dice. Just made 3rd place Fortune Mag's ""Biggest Money Losers"" list."
good,This place is a joke all they care about is production getting out treat employees horrible a lot of favoritism certain people get paid good most don’t
good,The morale was low and constant uncertainty was high. Every worker was focused only on their own survival as an employee. Nice office spaces and fair pay.
good,"Overall good job with great people, just a bad company.  Brands are bought and sold almost every month.  Current CEO is 'speeding up' his retirement plan after Newell was classified as a junk stock."
good,"A typical day at work usually consists of, bad management, poor team skills, and lack of communication. The hardest part at work is, getting co-workers to work as a team."
good,"2018 has been a significantly tough year at Newell Brands, with multiple rounds of layoffs, mismanagement and disorganization. Most of the decisions feel very haphazard, rather than well-reasoned."
good,Not a good place to work.  Very fast pace demanding environment that is 24/7 in nature.   They pay well.    Leadership is extreme at micro managing the teams and individuals.
good,Consumer industry focus provides an opportunity to focus to work based on what average people want out of the product. Very diversified products ranging from baby products to lunch boxes to writing enables one to get a wide range of experience. Constant movement in management and direction creates some unrest at times. Divisional teams work with divisional or regional focusses.
good,Company is downsizing in order to improve the bottom line and streamline operations. Some of this is positive but some area pay a price in a loss of jobs.
good,"I liked my department and management.  once the merger with Jarden happened, work changed and jobs were moved or eliminated.  I was with Newell for over 15 years.  They lost a lot of talent when they merged with Jarden."
good,"Not a bad place to work. 12 hour shifts can be demanding. Good benefits , including vacation, paid sick time. Can be up and down at times with work availability."
good,The overall environment of the facility is not good. This is based off of a lack of communication. I believe a firm shakeup in the management structure could be beneficial.
good,It use to be a great place to work with great management but there is a newer plant manager that is very unprofessional. He treats the temps and the full time people like you dont exist.
good,"Newell Rubbermaid is not a bad place to work.  They have a lot of good people there, and few bad as I'm sure most places do.  It's a very fast paced work environment and the 12 hour days can be overwhelming at times.  On the other hand the 12 hour work day allows for more time off with your family.  The job security lately had been a little questionable but right now its looking like things are picking back up."
good,"This company has an opportunity to help develop the workforce of the future, but they don't consider that when they are working with the temporary employees."
good,Good place to work liked working 12 hour shifts and getting all overtime wanted.Always learning new things at Rubbermaid.Pay was good.Enjoyed working close to home.
good,"I gained experience and knowledge to operate several different machines , how to use rf guns , and almost every task needed in a warehouse . "
good,"Some of the things the company is developing are advanced and progressive in their field. The company is hugh however, so even if you have a good contact with your direct superiors, there are many levels above you, quite likely your own superiors are just numbers to the higher management"
good,"The CSR job is fair for a call center but if you have children would not recommend the job due to policies. "
good,"I enjoyed my time at Newell Brands for the most part, nice workplace culture, monthly birthday celebrations and reasonable benefits. I worked with Dymo and they are an awesome team."
good,The culture has changed over the years. It has become more stressful and management does what it has to do with out looking at the big picture. If you quit or get fired you are replaced by some fresh face out of college who doesn't have a clue as to what is going on.
good,"Wonderful place to work. Everyone is so nice. Rough hours. But,doable. I would love to go back. Need 1 more smoking deck and more tables on smoking deck."
good,"To many hours of overtime. I do not like speaking about Newel . Poor  leadership,one no work, other times your living there for weeks on end, their safety is number one ,Q>C is good"
good,Fun and friendly co-workers. Top management has been there for years (Jarden) and refuse to change processes to increase productivity and efficiency. Recently acquired so change may come with that.
good,productive work place and easy going. the company could have done a better job with hiring fulltime employees. The company have a good work safety environment.
good,shifts varied from 10 to 12 hours a day and the work environment wasn't the best but the leaders are very good at working with your needs a best as they could.
good,I liked working with the people but there were some things that could be addressed. I believe management should have to be on the floor and experience the stuff the employees experience.
good,Depending on where you're at and who your supervisor is makes all the difference in the world not every supervisor will treat you with respect but the ones that do are phenomenal to work for.
good,"It's good if you don't mind doing the same thing everyday for 12 hours, two breaks and a thirty minute lunch. Overall it was an easy job with decent pay."
good,"poor communication amongst supervisors. hard to have a life around work with all the required over time, understaffed 90% off  the time"
good,i love a peaceful but fun loving environment. where people can talk and ingange with being treated like kids. a typical day for me is getting to work happy and safe. but making sure the company has a productive day.
good,"this past year has been a very trying year here @ Newell Rubbermaid.  We, feel in the Winchester offices, by the end of the year we will not have our jobs any longer due to moving all jobs to High Point NC."
good,"It's a good place to cut one's teeth and learn the business, but I don't see it being a long-term destination. It has recently undergone some turmoil, but with the restructuring, one can tell that the leadership is making an effort to get back on track. I don't know how sustainable this model is though."
good,"Over the last 2 years, Newell has greatly opened its international markets and is growing very well. The experiences I have had are rare compared to most people in my field, and there was much that I learned with my time here."
good,"Newell-Rubbermaid as a corporation will figured it all out and they have a great leader in charge now but the Rubbermaid Commercial Products group will sink with the current President at the helm. I find it hard to say anything good about this person who is quickly taking a great company and making it very average. However, there is hope as Mike Polk the CEO continues his quest to reshape the business. The rats on board the SS RCP will be scurrying around and will certainly be thrown over board as soon as soon he gets a chance to peel back the layers of incompetency."
good,Since starting at Newell the culture changed drastically. I was no longer happy or utilized to my full potential when my job was eliminated.
good,"When Rubbermaid own it,great place to work.When Newell took over they paid too much money,and at the end of the easy dollar days.Change batterys, 165 units,drive fork lift,drive yard jockey,ret&store product.In the Warehouse we had an open door policy they welcome ideals,how to make our job easier & faster.Great people to work with most 12years together.Newell bought a (pkms) computer tracking system,too many bugs & too many steps to move one pallet.My crew was about 12 people so everyone was nice,once a month we have a cook out,we bought."
good,Typical day would be come in and check testing fixtures left over night to run and start up fixtures or robots that was shut down for over night. Check email and scheduling from manager.....continue working in projects you were asigned or picked up. Schedule always changing in test lab......co workers good to work with.....hardest part would be having alot to manage at one time.....enjoyable part was working with my co workers and then learning something new from time to time....
good,Good exposure to complicated; challenging and rewarding projects
good,I learned to stay forced.
good,shop manager wasnt to good but pwr for the course day supervisors wasnt to good
good,I didn't work at Rubbermaid very long but during my time there i did pick up some skills as a machine operator. No complaints really overall this was a good place to work.
good,Really not that bad of a place to work. But management needs improvement. Other than that a lot of good people work there. The forced overtime got out of control sometimes.
good,"A typical day of work is always the same."
good,Newell Brands is a great company to work for if you don’t have a family waiting for you at home. The hours can be very overwhelming and you should never expect a day off in the summer months.
good,Pay is ok but local company management could find improvements. Since they took over company people have lost jobs or been moved from job they had occupied many years.
good,This was a job to get out of fast food and on my feet. It did its job as I did mine but it's not for everyone. It's very fast pace and very hot unless you work in the office. I would go back there if I needed to but it probably wouldn't be my first choice
good,"A typical day at work was a bit stressful because of the boss I had, but my teamwork was very productive. The company has the award ""great place to work"" what means that in general terms it's a good place to develop skills and grow as a professional."
good,"Currently, employees don't trust the decisions being made by the CEO as we don't think he has our best interest at heart. He is more concerned about the shareholders that the employees who get up every day and do their jobs to make their brands stand out against the competition."
good,Newell is a great place to kick start your career with fun and recognizable brands. There are opportunities for training and a lot of cross-functional interaction.
good,"Pays well, safety minded, training programs in place, quick paced,  payed vacation and sick leave,  rotating weeks, multiple in company job opportunity"
good,"We have morning meeting that tell us our daily assignments, the amount of work we have for the day and if any accidents have been reported and if we are going to have any overtime that weekend."
good,"The Ecommerce division is constantly going through changes and reorganization.  It is both a pro and a con.  The division is full of smart and engaged people who come to work everyday with something to prove.  It is without a doubt the most collaborative place I've ever worked.  The con is the every changing atmosphere is a directive from the top.  Leadership either actively chooses to create this culture, or they are incapable of managing such a large division.  If you believe in chaos theory this is the place for you."
good,Decent place to work for a paycheck although you are treat s as a number. No one really cares about you unless you have family in management and everyone is replaceable
good,"Work hard, and no room for advancement. Pays nice if you get hired in, if you are a temp. then you are there for 90 days then they send you back to the temp. service"
good,It is a cool place to work. The pay is good and so are the hours when you need them during the busy season. They also have good benefits. Be ready to work and work hard.
good,"I was a great place to work for, changes was a challenge because the resources provided at the time. A work day was stressful when meeting deadline. Decision making was a pace where it took more time that its was expected."
good,When I first started it was a great place to work but after a while the company had a major shake up and change in management and the way things were done and now they have lost most of the full time employee's that had been there a while.
good,It's been great to work for this department with amazing coworkers. there's a lot of fellowship and respect to each other. Feel's really comforting been here.
good,"40hr work week."
good,"Productie en materiaalplanning in een internationale, goed gestructureerde onderneming."
good,"i enjoyed working at Rubbermaid most people treated me like i was part of the family, how ever i was judged for something i had no control over that happened in my past. and then told i was not RubberMaid materal, then releasted from by job."
good,"walk in clock into work wait for supervisors to come say what needs to be done and any other work related business then we all go to work i hopped on a forklift and did my job"
good,"I was praised for my achievements. I lead a great crew of up to 30 associates. Would have liked to been able to take classes that was offered to the Supervisors before more. For I believe training is important to get a full understanding of the job. Thus, allowing one to brainstorm on how to make it even better for all, company, employees. I made sure that I conducted productive meetings and stressed safety in all of my daily meetings."
good,"I started during a time when there were a lot of shifts going on within the company. A lot of people had been let go and a lot of people were still leaving due to not feeling secure. From what I have heard (and was able to see), this was a common thing within the company. A lot of turnover. There was also an underlying negativity and anger towards having to deal with all of the new people that had filled the positions after the layoffs, which isn't the best experience when you are one of those new people. A lot of people talking about looking for other jobs and taking interviews constantly around the workplace. Just an odd environment overall."
good,"Standing, machine operator, bending, lot of physical labor"
good,Newell Rubbermaid makes all the Rubbermaid materials that are found in the stores and outlet stores.
good,if you want to get hired on to full time this isn't a good place but if you want just temp. work this is a good place plus you get lots of overtime.
good,I learned how to deal with diversity
good,Co workers are always willing to assist. Everyone knew the challenges that existed but always found a way to smile.
good,this is high paced factory that needs to be more lean in their processes.
good,Great group of people to work with - very high turnover rate at all levels of management. Poor leadership.
good,"I enjoyed my 17 years at Newell.  I have seen the company go through ups and downs, as well as 4 different CEO's.  I believe this can be a strong company again."
good,"Fun place to work, though there is significant barriers for advancement due to internal politics. Decent benefits, decent pay, depending on the area you work in."
good,"If you want to do nothing but work and make money, this is the place for you"
good,"The company has gone through a lot of acquisitions and mergers over the last couple of years, but there is a lot of growth opportunity that exists for employees."
good,rubbermaid is a very tough but easy place to work. The work is very easy but you have to stand for 12 hours in steel toe boots and if your on a assembly line it is fast pace
good,You had to be in the click to move up here. Though you were expected to perform your supervisors job. You wouldn't be promoted if they had a friend that may have been interested.
good,"i been with newell for 12 years. i was a machine operator, a team leader, a powder coat painter now a packer. I am getting layed off sept. 30th. they deleted my job in the metal dept."
good,Everyone there had bad attitude on work site. The people acted like they didn't want to be there. They was very un organized in the way they did stuff
good,based on production. fast paced work place. overall work environment was laid back. daily lift inspections were required. order pulling and order selection.
good,This is an all right place to work if you're fresh out of school and you need a job but as far as a career choice it's hard on your body and your family life.
good,"Un buen ambiente laboral, prestaciones de ley así como un salario mas o menos"
good,"I liked working at rubbermaid, sometimes got paid extra long breaks,  very layed back workplace, good people. They are very flexible with their employees."
good,buen ambiente de trabajo pero solo manejan bolsa de trabajo y pueden tardar muchos mese en darte la planta indefinida
good,Most of the time it is super hot in the place. Also some of the jobs were more stressful than others. I probably wouldn’t go back to work there again but it was an alright job for the moment.
good,The demand is high and so is the labor. Workers are pushed to the limit in hours and productivity for next to nothing while there really is no demand. The products are being sent to a warehouse where they sit and wait.
good,"It was a fair job,  I got by with what I was being paid,  over all the job was hot and painful and I would somewhat recommend this job only because of the money."
good,"•	Assisted in the merger of Jarden Corp. and the Rubbermaid Corp. forming the new Newell Brands Corp. 200 plus user environment at the Norwalk location including field users. Maintenance of network infrastructure, desktop and telecommunications equipment support, copying and faxing solutions. "
good,"The position within the R&D laboratory was a disaster. When I started with the company as a temp, they were some 6-8 months behind on their product sample testing. For my first two months of employment, I was repeating the same testing parameters on Aerosols and soaps day in and out. Overall, the work becomes too repetitive and the volume depending on how many people are actively tackling the work can be overbearing. Management made functioning within the laboratory a nightmare! What started as directions on how to complete the testing, soon became issues as to how the work was being completed. Management often times contradicted themselves; you would be tasked with projects, just to get bashed on how you independently work as well as questioned in a micromanaging fashion about said projects. Your best bet if you seek a laboratory opportunity here is to write everything word-for-word that you are instructed. However, the people outside of R&D are amazing, they made the job culture so welcoming and are truly the reason I came to work everyday. The lab is also not fully constructed, there are physical cracks and splits in the walls, so the temps in the summer are hot and freezing in the winter months. With this company going through structural changes, people were quitting as well as getting fired, production workers were laid off several times throughout the 2017 calendar year and it left people questioning the sustainability of this company. My advice to the R&D manager would be to actually listen to your employees rather than get upset and try to break them down with words."
good,If your looking for a career in plastic injection. This one is for you! Of course this is my opinion. But it isn't a bad place to work and they offer decent hours.
good,I have not worked there in a long time but I do know the have multiple shifts to accommodate all types of lifestyles. There management at the Rubbermaid plant was not trained properly and was not very supportive.
good,"Could be a better place to work. Some management treats certain workers differently. Too much going on behind the scenes, feel like your never hearing the truth. Loved working with all my fellow workers."
good,Not a bad place to work for they work well with schedule and others. Friendly enviroment. Descent pay. Twelve hour shift. Over time is able to puck up but also can be mandated
good,Laid off after 6 months. Was recruited and told there would be a lot of opportunity to grow and advance internally.  Beautiful building with many places to work with wifi throughout the building. Free parking. Great company discounts. Many people seemed to have come up through their college intern program.  Employees all seem very young.
good,I worked with Newell Rubbermaid as a contractor.  The work environment was very laid back and they allowed summer hours.  Alot of people liked this freedom.
good,Rubbermaid was a good place to work until they closed our local plant down and everyone lost their jobs. I would still be employed there if they would of stayed open!
good,"I liked the job because it starts early in the morning."
good,"- Great benefits and a good entry level salary."
good,It’s was a good run. Very fast paced environment with new positions every 4 hours to keep youu on your toes. Always learning new things to help youu be faster at your job.
good,"some days were great others were not. could have an easy schedule or bad schedule depending on orders of product. the work schedule was also interesting . working a 36, and 48 schedule"
good,I wasn't a bad job. If I was younger I probably would have liked it. It's pretty rough in the beginning. Very fast paced. Not much training. I had a few days training and was expected to run 4 lines afterwards.
good,"Place has gone down hill since management changed hands."
good,"Great products, but poor leadership.  Too focused on the short term, not looking at the long term effects of the changes that were made without clearly understanding the consequences."
good,Newell is very well managed with a focus on bottom line attainment to objective.  The product line was excellent representing great value to the consumer.
good,"Management could have been a lot better, there should definitely be an increase in pay. Offers a lot of hours and benefits. It pays to learn to operate a forklift"
good,The team I was a part of was absolved while I worked there.  This team was a bit too unstructured for my liking.  It wasn't clear what goals and expectations were.
good,I think that the assembly line is too fast-pace which the employee don't have time to make the packing into box while the product is overload in the assembly line.
good,"A typical day at work is 8:00 - 4:30pm."
good,Rubber maid was a good place to work but there were some things that made it stressful and unreasonable. The line leads would disappear without saying anything or instructions. There was little care from some workers about safty regulations and some workers walked of the line without permission. The hot environment made people uncomfortable and some pass out will on the line.
good,They over work you there and exclusively hire through a temp and only get at max 11$ p/h until 3 years later you get hired on. The management is nice though.
good,A good place to work I met a bunch of good people. I also learned how to stack pallets and wrap pallets. Management was good they worked with you.....
good,"At Newell Brands, I enjoy working with my customers and representing a wide variety of Newell Brands product assortment.  We have a strong brand recognition, and my customers are great to work with in growing sales.  "
good,Teaches you how to call on retail stores and train employees to sell to consumers.  Low pay for what you do.  The most enjoyable part of the job is forming relationships with the customer base.
good,"I am currently a lead so there are many tasks I have to help with during a day and that makes my day go fast, one thing I enjoy a lot is meeting the deadlines for that day and helping my team to meet theirs. Management could do better when it come to motivating the associates and hiring more temps to be part of the company. In this company I have learned to be more detailed oriented and to operate all the warehouse machinery. good job, good people, I wish my paycheck reflected that."
good,They work long 12 hour shifts without climate control. Summer can be really miserable if you aren't used to working in the heat. The cultural mix of employees I found to be interesting. Always learning new things and meeting interesting people.
good,This company is trying to drive stock performance for executives to the detriment of its employees.  this company doers not value or invest in workers over the age of 40.
good,"With this job title, I did more than one job. I bounced from machine to machine meaning I had to learn how to run each one with its own rules and regulations. So much to learn you must be willing to understand patiently and calmly. I loved this because it was not just the same thing day after day I never knew what you were going to be doing because I knew how to do so much I got to do a little of everything. Highly recommended if you do not like doing same day to day work."
good,"Average company"
good,Ok place to work overall.Management is ok and responsive to your needs.The work they have you do is easy and the other workers are nice.
good,I found this position to be a rewarding and gratifying position. It allowed me the opportunity to learn new and challenging things daily. I enjoyed my employment opportunities here and I would recommend this company to anyone willing to put in a hard days work.
good,"Melhorar seu marketing no PDV, busca divulgação de sua marca."
good,Very Productive and change oriented company. Newell is transitioning to grow to a larger audience. The game growth plan is in place.
good,Job too far from location. Good team environment first real job and co-worker was friendly and willing to assist as much as possible.
good,You have to have the ability to be able to stand and work in very cold temperatures for a long amount of time. You have to be able to complete several different task on your own during a certain time frame.
good,"The job was fairly okay. I sometimes liked the work environment, however, it was a little unorganized at times. The co-workers were great to work with, however, I learned that many didn't show their best interest in helping you."
good,Great employees.  Fast paced environment but very unorganized and unstable.  High turnover with C-suite and executive leaders.  Work environment is constantly changing and priorities conflicted.
good,"Liked the people; job overall was challenging, hours could be long depending on projects that you are working on.  Direct manager was open and honest."
good,my duties consisted of upkeep on cleanliness of equipment so that they continue to function properly. conditions were extremely hot and humid. the people I worked with were nice. management was decent. hardest part of my job was working 2nd shift and being away from my family.
good,Typical work place where you can get frustrating or you can get blass  from other people and you can get a lot of experience in a short time
good,"ce poste permet d'acceder a differents fonctions. KAM, marketing, logistique , relationnel. COntact avec nos confreres europeens pour connaitre les marches a developper sur la france"
good,"Worked with all functions within Newell---Brand, Sales, Trade Marketing, Finance, Supply Chain, Shopper Marketing and In-Store Visibility team"
good,"Manufacturer and distributor of home organization, kitchen, hardware, seasonal, and cleaning products, as well as commercial items."
good,"Environment consistently changing, management does not have insight as to managing the daily changes.  Unable to provide product to consumers as warehouse is constantly ""out of stock"""
good,"Fast paced, low pay, management act like they care about you but really don't support you when you need them the most. very high turnover rate"
good,LINE is making sure everything is in working condition and not melting the product and keeping the product coming in the way it needs to
good,"good place to work.  advancement is difficult.  must be willing to be comfortable with continual change.  days can be long, but others can be easy and short.  be ready to work with plenty of consultants."
good,Business partner to Segment Executive Leadership Team and Food/Dollar/Mass Leadership team providing business insight and related financial impacts of strategic alternatives.
good,"I like working at Rubbermaid, I know and do my job very well.  There never is a moment in the day where I find myself with nothing to do.  It can be very stressful as I work with our key accounts and expectations of my performance is very high. This is a good thing, it's kept me on my toes and continuously analyzing and looking for improvement in everything I do.  Most positions moved to North Carolina leaving no room for advancement at the current location.  We  lost a lot of good people because they did not want to re-locate.  With that said I am ready to move on to a new challenge, hopefully meet new great people and prosper."
good,"Working within Newell is one of the most exciting thing I´ve ever done. It´s very dinamic, with lots of changes, you have to be quite proactive & dinamic to catch up on things, it gives you the possibility to grow quite fast around the world & diff functions."
good,Pretty Laid back. Good company to work for as long as you do what your supposed to and avoid the drama. I learned that smiling faces tell lies. people who don't want to see you progress will try their best to see that you don't. Management is decent. The hardest part of the job is balancing the 12 shift and your everyday life. The most enjoyable was the weekly paycheck.
good,"The typical work morning, you have to stand outside in a line to be searched before entering the work place i can understand why but the people who were doing it were harsh and ruled. What i learned from this job was how to keep my mouth  close an just work. Seems like the moment you spoke a word that was your last day so i stayed to myself getting my work done to pay the bills."
good,the job was ok I didn't like when coworkers starts a lot of mess so I had to keep myself away from that
good,"Empresa casi desmantelada actualmente en España."
good,I would not like to review this company in comments. This was a good company to work for.
good,unloading and loading trailers inventory I like  the exp. of working with others
good,Although company is shifting toward NC and GA Rubbermaid is a good place to work.
good,"Management was awful, I don't know where they pull these people from. They lacked leadership ability and had no clue what was going happening on a day to day basis. Quick to throw people under the bus."
good,"Expertise export "
good,"Nice coworkers, decent pay, cool culture. They welcome new employees and show a great interest in your needs."
good,"The current path the company is taking has created a ""sinking ship, jump overboard"" mentality for most of the younger employees, everyone under 30 is looking for another employer."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of hand packaging items. Management was great. Most co-workers were great. Hardest part of the job was the heat and standing in one spot on concrete for 10 hours. Most enjoyable part of my job was learning something new, new experience, meeting new people and keeping busy and productive."
good,"Working at Rubbermaid wasn't too bad at first. But there is a lot of favoritism shown to certain employees, and that's not right. I was satisfied with how things were ran/managed. A lot of people do absolutely nothing and are getting paid the exact same rate that people who are busting there butts working. "
good,Operation was 24-7 so there was no typical day although hours were 0630-1800 most days
good,Heard there are a lot of layoffs throughout the company. The job environment can not compare to its used to be.
good,"It Was Fun. Forklift driver. load/unload, build bundles, reciving and putting away."
good,"great company ,great people ,felt like home ,great learning ,"
good,"Worked at this company for 22 years, so I have seen it go thru alot of growing pains. It is a fast paced company that demands alot from its employees, but if you are ok with that then you will be fine."
good,work 12 hour shifts 15 days a month rotating shifts.
good,I really don't have anything to say about this company because wasn't there long. When I was there they treated me well and cared about me.
good,"I worked at Newell Rubbermaid for 15 months absolutely loved my job. I was there for 15 months, but something changed and it wasn't the best treatment by some went downhill. I felt very let down. I had a word with agency and was told I couldn't go back so laid off which made me depressed and hurt as I had done nothing wrong."
good,"Not a bad place to work enjoyed the relationships I built over the years company slowly started changing, and not for the better. Ceo did a lousy job consolidating  in the later years  employee morale was down"
good,"work four on four off, 12 hour days, getting pass the initial probationary period is the hardest part. lots of standing and heavy lifting. Ok benefits,  great 401K."
good,I've enjoyed working there. Going to miss everyone. Great coworkers and team leads. I would recommend this job to anyone in the area. It's a really great career
good,very physical and fast paced place to work with 12 hour shifts were hard but you had 3 days off one week and 4 days off the next so the days off gave you plenty of time with family
good,"Was often unable to keep up with the pace, especially when I first started. There was very little room for error, as any mistake often meant you needed to be replaced on the line and that slowed efficiency."
good,A typical day was pretty flexible. I enjoyed the ability to manage my day. I learned a lot in Newell Brands about how to manage corporate behavior.Hardest part of my job was trying to maintain day to day direction from management. I did enjoy the flexibility of my work days.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, estabilidad laboral buenas prestaciones"
good,"A normal day working at Newell is pretty fair pace and productive, since I've worked for Newell I've, learned how to operate a Reach Truck, a Walkie Rider and a Cherry Picker. The hardest part of my job is dealing with a lot of negativity from co-workers, but I manage to put that aside to continue my work day. Besides dealing with the ups and downs at work, the most enjoyable part of my job is being safe first and foremost, productivity and quality."
good,I only worked there a short time due to a pre planned trip out of the country. I enjoy working in a warehouse so it was a nice job . Management went above and beyond.
good,Good job for the past 13 years with an unfortunate ending. There are many benefits and perks in this company. Yearly raises. Potential for advancement within and throughout the company.
good,Each day brings its new challenges which definitely help keep me professionally and creatively fit. This job requirements multi-tasking at the highest level. A great environment.
good,"In a typical Day at Newell Myself and 5 other Maintenance tech catch an average of 65 calls a night.  It's a very fast pace work environment and the numbers that out customer needs get higher and higher every year.  We make the Sharpie markers, and Expo dry erase markers at my plant.  The productivity of the equipment is in our hands and we are held accountable for the numbers just as much as the operators.  Because of this we all take extreme pride in how our plant runs when we are on the floor.  Over all Rubbermaid is a good company to work for."
good,"When this company was just Rubbermaid, I loved it. It was a fun, rewarding place to work, with competitive pay and great benefits. Then, Newell took over. The pay didn't move, the benefits were cut, management was more worried about keeping their jobs than they were their employees. They lost good employees, refused to punish/fire bad ones, good employees were told to pick up the other's slack--not a fair place to work."
good,"You will be calling on big box stores where your product is already in the stores.  Management is ok.  Co-workers are fun.  "
good,"I love what the company stands for as an organization.  However our unit needs lots of work.  There is no work life balance for anyone above a rep role.  Leads, Supervisors, Managers, Sr. Manager are given many hats to wear.  It would be great to have more of a support staff to help achieve our goals in consumer care (quality team, a true operations department, etc).  If the staff were only able to focus on the people and delivering on KPI's the consumer care group for Newell Rubbermaid would be a great place to work."
good,"picking\packing tools using scanners, loading\unloading trucks and some dealings with trade customers,"
good,"Safe, clean workplace"
good,Rubbermaid was like a slave camp but the money and ours were great. The management was horrible and the environment was hostile.
good,"There's many draws to working for Newell Rubbermaid. The people, facility and the brands are great. Over the last few years the dynamic has really changed though. HR is in a very bad spot and executives only care about driving shareholder value up right now instead of fixing the moral inside the company."
good,"Many opportunities to move up if you are willing to put in time and effort. Leadership is pretty good for the most part. High visibility, leadership is not shy about interacting with all levels of the organization."
good,"the management team, with the exception of a couple, are absolutely a joy to work for and with. I was terminated by one of the the ones not in the exceptional category! they acted before knowing the entire story, which seems too often the case with him. there pay structure is not great to start for what they expect, however it does jump quite a bit once you make the transition from temp to perm. it is a very fast paced environment and not a job for those that like a lot of time off in the spring - summer as their back to school time is their money maker. When you look at my pay please remember that i was not the norm. their starting pay is only $8.50 per hour. i busted my butt and gave them all i could during my time there and also have years of previous experience in the field."
good,"de organisatie was niet goed "
good,"Empresa com cultura americana, focada em resultados, local onde se trabalha muito e com isso não tendo equilíbrio com a vida pessoal, porém de ótimo ambiente e equipe, tendo suas políticas bem definidas."
good,This is a packaging facility. The machines were very face paced which was very challenging to get used to but accomplished it very quickly.
good,"Company of great, well known brands.  NR is in growth mode driven by the desire to unlock trapped capacity for growth.  Environment currently unstable due to planned restructuring activity and high unplanned turnover."
good,"Monitoring full P&L of 4 Business Unitis and consolidation, I have always met the company standard requirements and I have enjoyed liase with collogues in the EMEA market to reach common targets."
good,Decent job with good pay in my area. My co-workers were always nice. Sad when the closed the factory.
good,"A typical day of work included making sure you had enough employees to get the job done, learned to work with different personalities of people and how to turn a stresssful sitution to a smooth productive operation, being in a lead position required showing good and safety minded decision to get good repoor from those working for you and the hardest part of the job was having a malfunctioning sitution that could not be avoided and the enjoyest part of the job was going to work and having a productive day and meeting company goals."
good,"Great talents to work with.  "
good,"EL trabajo a veces tiene varios horarios disponibles y de medio tiempo, pueden contratarte fácilmente por temporalidades y si se acaba la producción recortan al personal, a veces llegaba a pasar que despedían a la gente a una 15ena o mes de su contratación, el trabajo es mas o menos bien pagado de noche"
good,"Location closed. No longer in business in Goodyear Arizona. Building is vacant. Was at the time, a prominent employer and the warehouse was very well managed."
good,Machine operators operate three machines  at any given time. The work environment is very hot in the summer. The winter months require only a tee-shirt and shorts
good,good company to work for but over the years things changed as new management took over and company took over. great benefits. just need a little improvement in areas as a whole
good,"If you show interesting certain positions after sometime they give you a chance and even in  maintenance they hire women for it.  Most company's I heard of usually have excuses to hold women back, which is relieving considering this is coming from a male who appreciates fair employment in business."
good,Great people work at this company that truly care about what they do. Upper leadership is making changes which impact the locals teams.
good,"Extensive interaction with senior executives and managers on a daily basis.  Coordinated travel arrangements, prepared expense reports and handle basic administrative tasks such as telecommunication"
good,"i worked from 7-3:30.  It was a fast pace job. i sewed, ran machines, bagged and boxed. I learned how to creel. My mangers were always nice and let me know where i was supposed to be that day. I worked all over the plant and did different jobs. I got along with my co workers and worked with them to get the job done. The job was not hard, I enjoyed learning new jobs"
good,En el tiempo que estuve no hubo mucha posibildad de crecimietno dentro de la empresa
good,"Newell-Rubbermaid has fantastic leadership at the top level and the CEO and his team have done a great job in strengthening this company. However, the fall off is so drastic when it comes to leadership positions in some of the divisions."
good,"I like working at Rubbermaid, but at night they get away with alot One guy comes in to work smells like alcohol and weed. If you say something to the manger they don't do anything about it. I have learned that I can pack-out and also run a press  but the press was a one time thing. The hardest part of the job in that I was working 3 third shift. I knew my schedule for the whole year and getting raises every 500 hours."
good,Production. Keeps the company moving with safety rules. My coworker work as a team. we always get the job done in the times its suppose to be done.
good,"It's a fun environment, but the only do Merrit raises which is less than 1%. The work to life balance is manageable. I feel like this is a great job for a kid fresh out of highschool but not for an adult with responsibilities."
good,Fast paced lots of overtime and you are busy during black Friday  specials work rotating shifts so you work 2 on 2 off and work every other weekend off
good,this is a good job if you can keep up with the pace.  At the time I worked there I kept over heating and ended up having to quit but as far as I know they have new fans installed
good,I feel Newell Rubbermaid is a good employer with fair wages and acceptable benefits yet they drive employees to hard and I feel that management is out of touch with employees
good,This was my first factory job and it was ok. I loved the weekly pay and how often overtime was allowed. I also met a lot of great people who were willing to lend a helping hand if needed.
good,Great place to work if you don't mind 12 hr rotating shifts. Rotating shifts allow perfect balance between work and life outside of work. Wages are fair for the position. Extremely hot during the summer though.
good,"One of the best factories I have worked at. Although it was 12 hour shifts, the time went fast, stayed busy, which I like to stay busy."
good,Good place to work but after your 90 days they will find a reason to get rid of you if they really dont want to keep you and also they dont want to payout the extra money to the employees once they are hired in.
good,Management should be reviewed and all shifts should operate with the same supervision. With the respect to treat each shift the same. Day shift under strick orders when night shift is able to do as they please. Causes a lot of conflict among co workers.
good,"I never cared for Newell Rubbermaid, it was ran poorly and they don't care about their employee's. It's very hot in the summer time and they would never relieve you off your door so that you could catch some cool down somewhere"
good,"Environment is relaxed and flexible and management in this office is great."
good,Check the folders to see how loads are going out... Count all the labels before putting them the product. Go to the sort to start the line for the pickers.
good,makeing sharpies and how to box them and ship them. mangement was alright I enjoyed working with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was working nightshift. I enjoyed working on different machines made the night go by faster.
good,"I've been at Rubbermaid for almost 3 years.  "
good,"El entorno laboral es excelente, mis superiores me enseñan cosas nuevas cada día y siempre estan abiertos a responder las dudas que puedan surgir. Lo compañeros de trabajo nos apoyamos mutuamente incluso en los momentos mas dificiles."
good,Employees give 200 percent. They strive to be the best and to deliver top-quality products and services. They take responsibility for their actions and decisions.
good,12 hours a day long and a lot of running around  how to stack a pallet   management was amazing could go them for anything love to help you it is rough you are responsible for 6 machines total to make they are well taken care of when a pallet is finished takeing it to the well keeping up with the machines spending the day with youer co wrokers
good,"I supported the Bernzomatic brand as well as their Irwin Tool brand although that was not my primary job. Marketing, meetings, brain storming, clerical it ran the gamut but I enjoyed my team. The Vice President of Marketing for this brand was a highly intelligent, jovial and an optimistic employer. Realizing the team was dealing with a major malfunction of the product. The whole team was compiled of young energetic talent."
good,"No tempo em que estou na Newell tanto como funcionaria quanto como representante(atual), pude aprender muito é uma empresa focada em resultados."
good,Was treated good for the first half of my time there then the manager left and they allowed a person with zero quality to take over who was pretty bad at people skills.
good,i loved working there because it was fast past and alot of fun great people i worked with but i got let go along with other people too
good,a day at work consest of lots of moving and being able to be on you feet for alot of time management is ok the co-workers some are good then you have other that just stand around and make others work harder the hardest part is being on you feet and on the move for 12 hours and the good part about the job is there is some good people there
good,The less you try the more likely you will get promoted. Going the extra mile never got me anywhere. All the B rate operators get the promotions.........
good,Buen plan de crecimiento profesional mas falta de vision para crecimiento de negocio especifico
good,"It is a really good paying job. At the time i worked there, I was making 9.50 an hour. I was hired through a staffing agency. Now they pay 11.50 an hour from what I’ve hear from friends who work there. The staff of nice and respectful for the most part. You meet a lot of new people and it’s a very fast pace and competitive job. I unfortunately had to quit due to school and wrongfully being accused of things. Other than that i would’ve loved to still be working there but my school work comes first."
good,Typical day is keeping 81 injection molding machines running and 100+ suporting equipment units running. With managing 44 maintenace employees and managing the regrind department.
good,a typical day at work is very busy
good,I was a Machine operator in the molding department. Which is the HOTTEST department at rubbermaid! My responsibilities were biuling up boxes and filling them with the product. Then stack them on pallets and move them to the next department. Then do it all over again until your shift was over
good,"The company has good foundation and strong brands but outside of the executive level, many people don't know which direction it is going.  Really enjoyed the work and responsibility - learned a ton."
good,Management was very unprofessional. Very unsafe and at times unclean work environment. Very high job turnover. Unproductive work environment. Good compensation.
good,Travaille trés agréable et une bonne équipe!Le travail est bien d'écrit et expliqué!
good,Corporate culture quite poor. You don't know which company will be sold from one day to the next. Or have a clear direction in where the company is going.
good,The physical training in all departments need to last a little longer. There is too much detail to cover and information to absorb in three days. Maintenance and Engineering are great. They volunteer their time to show operators technics if they asks.
good,very little communication from management to employees on a daily basis.  training is lacking for new hires.  A lot of favoritism in certain departments.
good,I love my job. I take pride in my job and my work. Knowing I helped to put this product on store shelves makes me feel very rewarding. And working with a great group of people who aren't only your coworkers but family.
good,very nice place to work. The facility was a great place. My coworkers were all very nice and accepting and helpful. The down side is that this position was contract.
good,"Como todo trabajo tiene sus pros y sus contras ,"
good,"Rewarding company to work for, over the past 3-4 years the work life balance has become an issue. I have met so many great peopel and mentors in my 20 year career with this company."
good,Nice place to work. Fast paced at times with good supervisors. Very mindful of Safety at all times there. Good break rooms for lunches and air conditioned breakrooms in the summer time
good,A warehouse job where you print or assemble the labels that are on markers such as sharpies or expo. Working 12 hrs a day with 3 paid 15min breaks and 1 non-paid 30min break.
good,Not and overall bad place to work just a classic example of team work only being followed within its own team and not from dept to dept. the people are great to work with.
good,"Great team of leaders and associates, fun place to work.  A lot of long hours and pay didn't match job expectations.  Leaders where always involved in decision for site which was a great thing."
good,The job was always fun to come to work. We had a good crew and a good QB! I was only doing the job for the summer as a temp and worked 12 hour shifts 6 days a week but if you work there full time I hear its good benefits. I enjoyed my time there very much.. I don't think some of the other lines had as much fun as we did but I still think others liked it too. It was very long hours over summer and tiring working night shift since I'm not a night owl but It was a good job still
good,"Management could use some improvement, excellent for those that want job stability and overtime opportunities. ADC recently was contracted out due to inability to manage logistic tasks, not exactly the best for employees."
good,"Working here was fun at first, but it quickly took a turn. The employees and employers were utterly unprofessional. Newell was like a sweatshop, everyone side by side constantly. However, I learned how to be quick with my hands, stay focused, and stay professional. The hardest part was the drama, due to the fact that it was mainly a bunch of teenagers. However, the most enjoyable part was every Thursday, we all got pizza on break if we did a good job."
good,"Rubbermaid is good but looking for part time work right now. "
good,"It was an interesting place to work at for awhile, but things seemed to change for the worse in the later years I worked there, then they sold out to another company. It's hard to imagine what was really going on that we wasn't informed about."
good,"The important thing is all about working together to make the job done effectively as well as on time with the good quality ."
good,"Newell has a lot of things going for it.  Great people and products that you can get behind, good culture, benefits, and resources.  There are two problems that I found.  1) The culture can be very political at mid and upper levels with a strong bias towards who you know as opposed to what you know or how hard you work.  2)  The company is in a pretty strong state of change that is aligning itself with the ""in"" people."
good,I would go in and run machines. I would train any new employees on machinery and run teams on some machinery. I would also move to shipping area and run paperwork. I also would use computers and fix machines when they broke down. The hardest part of the job was dealing with employee coming in and leaving after a few days. I enjoyed this job because it gave me new skills and it also gave me communication skills and learn new things.
good,"They are always going through a new ""restructuring"" program. Not a stable place to work."
good,"Stressful, high paced manufacturing work environment. "
good,The job personally was easy for me. I enjoyed doing something different every few days. Things weren't repetitive. Over all the job challanged you to improve yourself. When someone needs help their is always someone around to give a hand.
good,"The pro of working for Newell Brands is the benefits are good. The work is very easy work, and your schedule was always the same. The cons of working there was the advancement is not there, the training is not there. In the summer the heat in the warehouse is unforgiving. I must say again the work was easy. The turn over is very high."
good,"When I worked at Rubbermaid in Winchester, the pay wasn't bad. If you aren't able to stand for 10+ hours at least 3-4 days in a row, then you'll probably get exhausted and quit like other temps that joined when I did."
good,"very young company, perfect company to start your carreer."
good,"Newell Brands is a great company to work for. However, there are many changes taking place. The company isn't the same as it used to be. Many layoffs are taking place."
good,"typical work day begins with no specific schedule of yard moves "
good,enjoyed working for newell brands. I learned a lot of different jobs and made numerous friends in the process. Management cared about us and made it a fun place to work.
good,"Ambiente de trabajo relajado, el trabajo era interesante y siempre aprendía cosas nuevas"
good,"Would come in and be hot in the summer time and cold in the winter back in the warehouse, some days it would be very stressful with meeting the needs of production . And getting several trucks to load and unload in a timely manner. Management seem like the didn’t appreciate there employees like they should. I learned a lot from working there started out in production,  then went to the warehouse which I was able to be a receiving/ shipping clerk partime, was a backup lead, which I learned a lot from doing these positions. I tried to advance in my career was unable to. I don’t know what the reason were."
good,"Great staff, OK Pay. Good safety practice. Overall Newell brands was a good working environment for me. They are very productive, and leads and supervisers are very good with training they're employees.hours are great and the work is not so stressful."
good,"It's fast past and not everyone is cut out for it, but that's factory life, if you can handle it and the summer heat then you can handle anything life can throw at you."
good,"The Managers seem like they care about themselves more than their employees, and seems like there is too much drama in the building. The team leader that I have is the best one out there."
good,"Newell brands was a good working environment for me. They are very productive, and leads and supervisers are very good with training they're employees.hours are great and the work is not so stressful."
good,A typical day at work was a very busy day. i learned how to load trucks at a fast pace. the management is typical.the hardest part of the job is knowing that no matter how hard you work the chance for advancement is slim
good,"Great position to be introduced to sales/marketing functions.  Job duties were fun, appropriate and extensive training was given for product line. Recommend this company for employment."
good,Enjoyed the work and loved the fast pace environment. It was a great schedule with me being a mom. I got laid off around Christmas time which put me in a bind
good,"La empresa tiene un buen ambiente de trabajo, sin embargo algunos jefes de departamento/área tienen cierto favoritismo hacia algunos de sus colaboradores."
good,Muy bien pero recortan personal seguido y eso no gusta
good,"The company followed all safety and work related regulations, they were up to date with all regulations. Employee friendly, looked out for their employee's well being."
good,"Very clean facility. management was a bit too pompous most of the time. however tedious some of the rules to follow might have been, the place was mostly pretty quiet and could be pretty laid back at some times."
good,productive working environment. I am a team player that work well with others. Participate in working when needed extra hours. Willing to work weekends.
good,It's a great place to work. Employees make it fun to work there. It's good job if you like to work as a team. Allows you to learn different positions and work you way up.
good,Enjoy the associates that work here very friendly and helpful. The corporation has changed quite quickly with not much communication. There isn't many chances for advancement.
good,"Great Place to Work 12hr shifts available, plenty of good and fun people to work with which makes the job enjoyment that much better and the work is pretty easy too it can be tedious at times but what job isn't and there is also plenty of overtime if that's what you're into over all good and safe place to work!"
good,"Newell Brands is always changing. It is great if you don't like to be complacent but if you like consistency, it may not be for you."
good,"Empresa demandante pero con mucho beneficio."
good,"Empresa nota 10. Muito s'eria e justa."
good,"Rubbermaid really takes care of their employees,from training to promotion! Very exciting company to partner with as an entry level sales rep."
good,"Supervisors treat you like slaves. They don't back their employees. You WILL get yelled and screamed at. If you cannot bite your tongue when being yelled at, don't even try to work at Rubbermaid."
good,"Worked here for 5.5 yrs and experienced cohesive teams and involved management with a focus on growing the associate, but was down-sized twice do to a streamlining of the sales force. There were others with stories similar to mine with their positions being out-sourced or absorbed into other teams throughout the U.S.. Newell Rubbermaid definitely knows how to take care of their associates while they have them. It's just that, in some instances, certain positions are more expendable than others.Bottom Line: Solid Company shaky ground."
good,"I really haven't worked there long enough to write a story about it. But from the few days I have been working, I see that it is a fast paced job and it requires a lot of team effort. The workers that I work with seem to be very helpful and help me understand the job and how to create a finished product."
good,"I enjoyed the people,management,competitive pay, but in the summer it can get pretty hot on the inside and messy I Learned how garbage cans are made."
good,"Newell Rubbermaid's portfolio of leading brands is organized into five business segments. What unites all their businesses is a belief in brand-led growth, based on an understanding of the constantly changing needs of their consumers and the ability to create products that win in the market by delivering superior performance, design and innovation. This commitment has enabled them to build a strong competitive position in each of their categories as consumers worldwide trust and prefer their brands."
good,The facility is chronically evolving for the sake of efficiency. Close knit work environment. Lots of jobs opportunities upon request.
good,"Great position in Test Lab. Conduct experiments, fabricate test fixtures, and collect data."
good,I work on the line and untility like cleaning machine on PM crew and it was a good place to work. The coworker was like family  and helpful.
good,"l'équipe comptables statutaires comprend 6 personnes dont un responsable. Chaque comptable a en charge une société du groupe et effectue la comptabilité de cette société de l'OD à la révision annuelle des comptes. De plus elle effectue les déclarations fiscales et autres et est en relations avec les administrations. Ceci dans un contexte international et une comptabilité principale en USGAAP, il faut donc contrôler la conformité de la comptabilité aux normes françaises"
good,"In my daily roles I was responsible for planning run rate demand and promotional volumes for the Irwin and Lenox Tools Business Segments within Newell Rubbermaid."
good,"The internal audit department is a fun department to work with.Besides the normal operation and assignments (financial, SOX and operational audits) performed in the Internal Audit Department, there are a lot of opportunities to bring new ideas, improve and develop current processes in place. Some regions are in the process of implementing new systems and processes. So The Audit Department has the possibility to provide consulting services and help the different areas involved in this process. The Department gives its opinion to the business on how new processes and procedures to be implemented may or may not be in compliance with company’s policies and/or best practices."
good,This facility runs on auto-pilot based on the hourly employees tenure with the company. The product has not changed in many years which creates its own challenges.
good,Input production data on a regular basis as product is produced. Maintain accurate records of product in warehouse.
good,Driving a forklift around. Good co-workers. Ive learned to work in a very fast pace in a short amount of time.
good,"Mangers have a great friendly disposition, the staff are all team players a typical day was enjoyable and rewarding."
good,"Bom ambiente, otimos produtos e empresa em crescimento e fundamentando marcas no Brasil,"
good,"A solid company with great brands and products. Currently undergoing a huge restructuring. Great co-workers and a challenging environment which provides great experience."
good,Newell Rubbermaid is a collaborative and open-office environment. Heavily focused on teamwork and cross-functional communications to move new products through its own stage gate process.  Most enjoyable part of the job was research and development and different laboratories involved to bring product through the design and development process. Rewarding to see an end-consumer product out in the market place.
good,"El trabajo es  muy bueno ya que aprendi muchas cosas, trabajos de mejora, administracion, manejo de personal, ahi conoci la mayoria de mis amigos que ahora tengo lo que mas me gusto es que me dieron la oportunidad de crecer "
good,Rubbermaid is a good places to work the people are nice the companys great
good,"Structured starting time."
good,Allowed me to use my educational experience and turned it into hands on experience.
good,"Fun in safe workplace,and loved my all of my co-worker.in learn a lot by been out there."
good,"Durante las estancias, me senti como una empleada mas en la empresa, realizaba los trabajos en el area de compra igual que las trabajadoras que estaban antes. Aprendi a utilizar sistemas nuevos y a tratar con los directivos."
good,I have had an excellent experience while working at Newell Rubbermaid
good,Fast pace environment focusing on launching new products and continuous improvement. Great teamwork and benefits
good,"Fast pace, exciting environment with opportunity for continuous improvement and new experiences."
good,"As an intern I valued being located in a large manufacturing facility and being exposed to many different product lines such as fragrance, roll-ons, and gift packs. Summer hours weren't too bad either!"
good,"O lançamento das marcas Rubbermaid e Graco no mesmo ano (2010) e mês com uma equipe muito pequena, demonstra o elevado grau de autonomia dado à equipe de Marketing. Muitas decisões precisavam ser tomadas com muita agilidade para que fossem alcançados os prazos de lançamento."
good,"Pretty decent company to work, however, they do have a reputation for hiring and then letting those same people go."
good,This company was great for a short time due to moving out of state.  The pay and benefits were wonderful.  It just lacked mutual respect of fellow co-workers.
good,"lots of loading and unloading of trucks, paid pretty well, 12 hour shifts were pretty rough. Benefits were pretty good for employee and family. Longevity is very good there."
good,"not a bad place to work. Rubbermaid use to be a hard place to get on at. now through Newell, they have lowered the standard for the hiring process. you have to work trough a temp service to work at Rubbermaid."
good,"Some supervisors OK same as leads. Quarterbacks need to be paid more. Tools need to be offered , not employees buying them. Clean lunchrooms. Employer was very generous with company shirts , blankets , and meals."
good,Working as a temp for rubbermaid consisted of long twelve hour shifts with minimal wage compensation.  Very quick paced collaborative competitive work environment.
good,"many opportunities to work on the floor with technicians, participate in system design, travel to work with vendors, support and troubleshoot new systems."
good,"A usual day at work consist of a very strong team willing to work together to accomplish a common goal. Since I was one of the only two males at the time, my task often came with a shorter time to complete as well as more complicated due for various reasons such as the weight of the product and or its size. As for the management of this company, there were flaws beyond the buildings management the i feel trickled down to the employees. Although there were issues throughout the company, my co-workers and i were always ready to take on a challenge making the day run much smoother."
good,Diversidade de marcas e negócios colaboram para um conhecimento global.
good,"Call volume can be high at times. Consumer comes first at all times."
good,Long hours and hard to understand the workers  for training...need to speak better English. Very  safe environment to work in and great team behind you!
good,Newell Brands had it ups and down just like with any company. There was just alot of non communication with important things within the company due to the manager having her favorites and upper management.
good,I loved my job at Newell and was sad to leave.  I was with them for 25 years in all and held various levels of roles.  I loved the Brand Management/Product Development role and I managed top accounts product roadmap development for NPD on Strollers & Car Seats.
good,You work a lot of over time based on customer demand for products.Being a maintenance technician meant when ever  production worked you had to.Production personnel had people they could switch time off with.We in maintenance did not have that privilege.So I looked for a new job.
good,If your looking to work alot of hours and stack money then this is the job for you. I really enjoyed my experience working here. If i move back to Virginia i would work there again.
good,"Under the leadership of the CEO, Newell Brands continues to cement its leadership status as manufacturer of commercial and consumer products. Working in the eCommerce department has given me the opportunity to see the company at the macro and micro level and it's hard to find much to criticize. The company is highly successful at leveraging its products with online retailers for maximum benefit. The department itself is growing and poised to become, if not the sole driver of enterprise success, at least one of the most important drivers."
good,"Its a Great Company to work for, but there is no room for advancement and looking for a company I can make a career in; Management,and Business operations."
good,Work there was extremely easy. Never did I have to worry about the warehouse needs. Management was always late to tell us if we were working weekends or if those hours were going to be 8 or 12. Also had to be ready to work abnormal hours. Regular hours were 3pm till 11p every so overnights were not expected but mandated to meet goals. Pay was consistent until overtime came into play. Overall I hated the experience. Never will I do it again.
good,Rubbermaid had its ups and downs as far a management goes. I worked there for 10 years so naturally I got to know a lot of people pretty well. Rubbermaid was pretty good about tool replacement and advancement within the company.
good,"Assist and take control when needed Good interpersonal, organizational skills and able to deal professionally with all levels of management with the ability to work independently and in a team in a fast-paced environment"
good,"There have been a lot of changes at NR over the last few years, but things are starting to settle down. The culture has changed drastically but corporate is attacking the issue head on and taking the opportunity to lead a new culture and develop an ""I want to work here"" culture and attitude. The hardest part of the job is training all the new hires and working through the expected bumps that occur when new people are learning their job.  The best part of the job is being a part of something so big, and getting to say, ""yeah, I worked on that project""."
good,"A typical day was checking over the forklift in the morning, then unloading/ loading semi trucks throughout the day. The hardest part about this job were the twelve hour work days from 6am to 6pm. Overall good job to have."
good,"the conditions were unbelievably hot with few to no fans, but everything else was very safe. some managers very helpful and some completely unapproachable, just luck of the draw. regardless of manager's personal opinions though it is very easy to advance or change positions within the company. The company store is fantastic. Never a shortage of hours. Very diverse workforce. Hard to have much of a life outside of work though. Shifts are a 2-2-3 set up and 12 hours. makes it hard to set up anything outside of work because you will only have any set day off every 2 weeks."
good,"Informeel bedrijf waar met respect en waardering voor elkaar werd gewerkt. Collega's van uiteenlopende nationaliteiten. Mogelijkheid om zowel zelfstandig als in teamverband te werken, te reizen in je baan, pro-actief te zijn, en bij te dragen. Goede werk-prive balans. Veel contact met verschillende afdelingen, verschillende lagen in de organisatie, en buitenlandse kantoren."
good,Stocked boxes onto the racks. Had to jump 3 floors with harness and stock boxes. Also help pick the light to cut boxes and install into new boxes mixed with goods. Helped truck loaders.
good,"As part of the Phoenix Program within the company, I was able to work closely with a group of wonderful peers, and also create discipline that would serve me later in my career. The work was very self-guided, but close management was always extremely supportive and provided wonderful insight and goals."
good,Long shifts but a good place to work. Learned how to make different products and learned to work as a team.
good,"I worked 12 hour shifts packing things. Management seemed a little mean, but they knew what they were doing. My co-workers were generally nice, but the majority of them were foreign, and I did not understand them. The hardest part was being on my feet for that long."
good,"Time spent with Newell was enjoyable and eye opening."
good,Great place to work with a good culture and work/life balance. The projects were plenty and there was opportunity to travel. Great culture and weekly fun activities organized for the teams
good,Solid corporation. Able to advance and competitive salaries. Newell offers an array of brands departments to be a part of so never a dull moment. People are great there.
good,Was a good job. I raised my 3 children working there. It's fast paced. Never planned on leaving but my mother got sick. Plus I needed surgery so I took a leave of absence and was not able to return. But I enjoyed the people the most. Very nice people. Was a line associate for 13 years. Enjoyed my time working there. Plus a lot of overtime. I liked the schedule the most. Was 12 hour shifts. So we worked 4 days a week and then 3 days the following week.  And we got paid every week. So it was 36 hours one week and 48 hours the next week.
good,"Buena empresa dentro de lo que cabe, le hacen falta programas de produccion para mantener a sus personal empleado durante todo el año."
good,There is always room for advancement. Seniority is not a factor when trying to advance. There are several perks to working at newell. The schedule can be hard to get used.
good,"Good company, but you have to stand up for yourself. They have been slow adopting newer technology, but are getting better. New IT management, certainly favored their own rather than objectively using those they already had in place."
good,Very hard work especially in SF1. I learned a lot of different aspects of this company and was trained in both shipping and receiving. I actually really enjoyed this job.
good,"Job Work/Life Balance - Good, Compensation/Benefits - Good, Job Security/Advancement - Good, Management - Good, Job Culture - Good. Newell was a great learning experience from the Team Lead aspect of the job."
good,The best part of working here is the ability to have a flexible schedule.  They try to create a work/life balance.  I have been able to improve upon my customer service skills.
good,I think this is a good company to work all around. Good culture and people. The advancement part could be a little better from temp to full time. Management could step up in some areas where people are standing around too much.
good,This company treats its employees well and is family oriented.They give you time off for family events even with little notice.They have a good open door polices.
good,"Newell es una excelente empresa para trabajar. Buen ambiente laboral , existe mucha colaboración por parte de los compañeros de trabajo."
good,"Great people with a fun culture. If you are hard working and personable, the opportunity for advancement is plentiful.  A very diverse company with endless opportunities."
good,"Company going through tons of changes, so the company constantly requires change. Fast paced and have to be able to adapt to change with a positive attitude"
good,Good pay. Steady hours. Very understanding when a family emergency happens. Sometimes 2nd shift gets sent home a lot but that's just because there's not enough work.
good,"Not a bad place to work, however, there is not any room for advancement no matter how long the service. Immediate supervisors are simpathetic while upper management does not believe your professional oppinion."
good,laid back job ok to work at came in did job and left overtime wasn't mandatory and management was laid back long as job was completetd
good,I was a picker and also load and unload trucks made sure the drivers had to leave in a certain amount of time. I am good a warehouse jobs I think it's where I did outshine the most.
good,It was a good started job to get your foot in the door and to understand how to manage a job with your personal life. It helped me learn money management also.
good,"Se aprende de todos los equipos en general ya que es una competencia sana, me gusto llevar a cabo proyectos de productividad asi como en la calidad del producto."
good,"Growth based culture which is shifting the way the company operates by focusing on the consumer through marketing and advertising great products. "
good,"Get to work at 7:30 am, go straight to work. We had a 15 minute break at 10:15am. Another 30 minute break at 12:30. Another 15 minute break at 3:15 then left at 5pm. I learned how to work machines. Management we strict. My coworkers were nice. The hardest part was learning how to machines worked. The most enjoyable was being able to wear what i wanted to wear."
good,"Wonderful work atmosphere with little to no micro management. "
good,"A typical day would be getting UPS and Fed Ex orders ready by printing labels for the shipping personal to pull and put on the proper trucks to ship to customers."
good,"overall is a good company , good people to work with , I am currently the back up lead so there are many tasks I have to help with during a day and that makes my day go fast, one thing I enjoy a lot is meeting the deadlines for that day and helping my team to meet theirs. Management could do better when it come to motivating the associates and hiring more temps to be part of the company. In this company I have learned to be more detailed oriented and to operate all the warehouse machinery.  good job, good people, I wish my paycheck reflected that."
good,"fast pace work environment"
good,"NR is a great place to develop professionally. There are plenty of on-site training opportunities.  In my experience, I was never restricted to participate in off-site training. "
good,Enjoyed everyday that i worked there. You always knew what the job was that was expected of you and never any surprises.Advancement was always available for those that wanted to apply themselves.
good,"A typical day at work starts at 8:00 am ends at 5:00 pm, sometimes your day is full of meetings, so if you are lucky not to have one in the entire day you have a lot of things to work on. "
good,"A typical day at work includes multitasking, shifting priorities on a regular basis. Friendly co-workers."
good,Engaging and challanging place to work. I have spent 10 years with Newell and was given opportunities to advance as far as my ambition would allow. We are a very seasonal company that is high speed high stress and high reward.
good,This is a good company to work for if you are willing to travel and move multiple times during your career.
good,"My passion is my work, but my best times was the interaction with the people. I loved interacting with the people on the line. They taught us Engineers a thing or two about production since they interact with the process all day long."
good,"Small group, lots of work to do. Involved with multiple projects at various locations."
good,I learned a lot from different people and it was a friendly atmosphere to work in. I liked working the 2on 2 off shift because you always could plan needed appointments or what you needed to do on your days off
good,"It was a great company with wonderful benefits, however the only issue was the manager I had.  She was let go due to the number of complaints regarding her actions"
good,"Newell offers everything to valued employees who show a strong desire to work. Management was wonderful and supportive across the board. Friendly coworkers, fair policies, excellent paid training programs. Newell promotes from within and was always very willing to work with their employees to keep us happy and complacent. Rubbermaid was a wonderful place to work (if you have a desire to work). Coworkers are supportive and incredibly knowlegable in their fields. Competetive weekly pay and Great benefits package upon being hired. I recomend Rubbermaid 100%."
good,Newell was a good company to work for but then they kept changing hands became other companies this is when things started going down hill running the company into the ground at the end they down size so bad after 11 years we lost our jobs
good,"Overall a great place to work.  Management and staff are very supportive and if you are goal driven and disciplined, you will advance quickly. The manufacturing sites are very focused on safety, which is a great thing to see in the work force."
good,Company treat employees with respect and fairness. Has competitive wages and benefit packages. Always willing to learn and train. Monthly meetings and updates
good,Company that is driven to get their customer's quality product in a timely manner. Continues to come out with new products and designs processes to best suit their customers and employees.
good,"Each day is different so I can't explain what a typical day is in the office.  I have nothing to really say about a day inside of Newell, we come to work, we do our jobs and we leave to go home"
good,"Good company to work. Lot of employee turnover so it gives impression of instability but it also means opportunity to grow. Offers a broad range of products & is in a good sector, consumer goods."
good,"It was great being able to work as hard as I did with my time here. The only drawback was that I didn't get hired on with the company, as I was working through a temp agency. Best part of the job was communicating with my coworkers while standing in our line doing the repetitive thing. A bunch of awesome people were there. Hardest part was making up for others mistakes on certain lines. It happens."
good,This company has a very high volume manufacturing and packaging demand. There are peak seasons and slow seasons that will regulate the work load and time. Overall a great company that makes great efforts to take care of their employees.
good,Not a bad place to get started but management is not all good. There is no comutacation in this place. There is so much drama with people some people do not like change here.
good,good place to work. just keep up and work hard. Had a high turnover rate..... but that was basically ppl that coyuldnt handle the pace. hard work but if you worked hard you made good money
good,I worked on the weekends so I did not see many people. those that I did see were very respectful and my direct supervisor was great. I would have kept the job if I could have worked regular hours.
good,"Mold tear down , hot runner repair (moldmaster,dme,universal) mold"
good,I love working here with all the constant changes with the growth of the company but would like a role work advancement potential and looking for a career where I can advance in my roles and responsibilities.
good,Great opportunity for advancement in your career due to the size of the company.  Opportunity to work with team members from various departments to improve efficiencies in the production of the final product.
good,Newell provides an excellent work/life balance. You are able to work with a huge variety of brands types and get nice exposure to not only B2C but also B2B types of commerce.
good,"Newell has a great work life balance, and has a lot of great people. There are some really exciting things for the company on the horizon with the recent acquisition of Jardin, a company twice the size of Newell."
good,"Throughout the positions I've held with Newell I've found an underlying theme of positive but constant pressure to improve and move forward. For many other companies, there are departments that have a fairly basic status quo of expectations with a list of responsibilities and performance metrics. At Newell that is only the beginning. "
good,A growing organization that created opportunity from within and without. A learning environment that allowed taking chances on stretch roles. A great place for trying out a variation to the core business model that provided growth opportunities.
good,"Bien que la société ait de nombreux avantages de part sa notoriété, un seul regret le manque d'évolution possible en interne, les seuls oppotunités étant de changer de marques. "
good,"fast paced, on your feet 10+ hours a day, constantly busy running a machine. Keeping it up for Best numbers of production."
good,"Fun work place with a good benefits."
good,Fun place to work! Everyone works very hard to achieve goals!!
good,"Recomendo a todos;"
good,"I loved working at Newell Rubbermaid, although it could get extremely hot in the plant, I loved the people I worked with, and enjoyed doing the work that I performed. I would still be working at Rubbermaid, if they hadn't closed down the plant."
good,I worked in the hand pack unit which consisted of jobs like putting sharpies in a mold and boxing them up at the end of the belt.
good,"Foi uma experiencia muito boa,pois somou muito e sou grato por ter tido a oportunidade de atuar nessa empresa"
good,"Newell has a stable of great brands that consumers know and use everyday, which made working there special."
good,"Loved it here. Wish the plant hadn't moved to Kansas."
good,Timely relief of last shift.Thankful for learning how to drive a forklift.Made many friends.Worked continental shifts.Lots of overtime.
good,"•	Managed labor and payroll for approximately 30 temporary associates "
good,I worked weekends 12 hour shifts from 7am-7pm. I learned how to make sharpees and how to operate machine. Managment was ok. No issues. My coworkers were fun do be around. Hardest part of job was the long hours with little sleep. Most enjoyable part was 5 days off in a row.
good,A solid company with great brands and products.  Currently undergoing a huge restructuring.  Great co-workers and a challenging environment which provides great experience.
good,"Had a good time working there. Management is young in age and at heart so having fun is as important as doing the job. Facility manager is very creative and is always looking for ways to add cool gatherings and events for team building. He also makes it a priority to communicate milestones and any other important relevant news to the entire work population through quarterly meetings and others as needed. Safety is a priority so strict safety policies and measures are in place and are monitored on a daily basis. Floor associates are great people who take pride in what they do but are not satisfied with company benefits and some management decisions. Upper management needs to do a better job addressing the issues to improve morale and avoid the gossiping that comes from people venting out their frustrations, promoting an undesirable work environment on the floor."
good,Learned how to manage supplies and basics of manufacturing operations
good,"Empresa a qual me ofereceu grandes oportunidades de crescimento profissional e pessoal. Proporcionando o desenvolvimento de duas frentes, lado técnico e comercial."
good,"I run the repair center a customer services postion with little supervison needed,Picking,packing,repairing and shipping products to customer.Deal with SAP , Fed Ex and the RMA system that requires answering emails and shipping over 70 packages daily."
good,as long as numbers met bosses left you alone very laid back work enviroment
good,"Newell Rubbermaid is a great place to work. The only reason I gave one star on the job security, is because they are shutting down my plant. But at the same time they are giving us the oppurtunity to go on to a different location. Overall, this has been a great place to work for, along side a crew of respectful, proffesional co-workers, unlike anywhere I have ever been."
good,"As in Security just show up on time everyday, it is easy work, but you will do a lot of walking for rounds and checking fire equipment, it is also more of a customer focus job making badges and checking in visitors, you will have to have decent computer skills as you will be doing a lot of computer work such as answering emails,giving access and making badges, You will work weekends and holidays with OT, they do give vacation days to take and are very flexible on giving time off, it is a decent job if you don't mind working weekends and holidays. Also to note this is an unarmed position the security here are not armed and we do not get psychical here, we just call 911 and show them where to go. It is more of a customer service approach to security"
good,I like the company it's a great place to work. Good pay and plenty of opportunities to grow in the company. Supervisors are caring and always available to help
good,I loved working there but they tend to have clicks. Groups of friends and god forbid you are not in one of their friend groups. Help is scarce and it makes for a long lonely day
good,"* very busy work day "
good,"Day/night starts by using your employee card to get into the building, walking to the back, clocking in, and waiting in the lunch area for your job; be it tugger (starting job), or one of the other two jobs. Tuggers go get their walkie-talkie, scan gun, label stack, and tugger, then get a train and start stacking boxes on pallets based on what the scanned labels say. There is a quota. Night shift is 115 boxes per hour, while day shift is 130 boxes per hour. Great place if you can keep up."
good,"Fantastic place for experience in your field - Newell Brands gives you a lot of opportunity to learn and grow in your function."
good,If you can stand the summer heat it’s ok ok benefits insurance was on the high side with astronomical deductible force you to use mail order pharmacy management ok
good,"The work at Newell is challenging and the teams I work with are engaged and responsive.  I enjoy my role, but since the merger with Jarden the company's direction has faltered. Management sometimes does not utilize people with skills where they should.  IT projects and focus tend to change frequently, with more attention paid to the ""Project Management"" aspect  instead of actual project work.  The pay is average, but with lower stock prices, bonuses and advancement opportunities have stagnated, and layoffs are needed to maintain profitability.  Newell does offer ""Work from Home"" and along with a decent medical plan are the biggest benefits. "
good,If you never worked at factory for you this isnt the job for you very fast paced keeps you busy. Anybody can learn if your a fast learner the pay is decent
good,Friendly people and fast paced work. Meeting people from various backgrounds expanded my mind. The hardest part of the job is probably being on my feet for ten hours.
good,"work with the DC, Sales,  Sales directors Strategic accounts to flow orders faster to meet monthly target and enhance our consumer and customer experi"
good,"Very structured atmosphere, with fun people to work with.  Room for advancement.  Typical work day was busy with a lot of variety.  Great annual Christmas party."
good,"The safest place on earth to work, some of the supervisors had attitudes but nothing you couldn't overlook, I do believe that the machines should be faster. Other than that great place to work."
good,"There are a lot a great people that work at Newell! With status of the company there is no room for advancement within. Very flexible with schedules, allows you to work from home sometimes"
good,"Overall is was a great experience. When the third party came in to take over, that's when a lot of things changed for the worse. We only have one break a day, no matter how many hours we work."
good,I enjoyed working for the company. I had to relocate for more money.. But i enjoyed everyone at the job. And i wish everyone the best at Rubbermaid0ly
good,This is a great company to work for always room to learn new skills and advance in different department  very flexible schedule  clean safe working environment  offers many promotions safety very big
good,This a great work environment. The workforce is very team oriented. There is really no hard part to this job. Tools needed to complete your daily duties are available.
good,a decent place to work with decent pay but long hours and work conditons were unpleasent. benefits were a real plus and the management staff were fair atleast.
good,"Based on my own experience and what i have heard, one will either LOVE or HATE Newell. I happen to be one that loves it. Many brands to play with, relaxed work environment, friendly and intelligent co-workers, weekly company events, big discounts on almost ALL products, etc. "
good,Every morning the supervisor hands out a paper with list of names of who was going where.Some lines are harder than others and some will have more people than others because it depends on the work you have to do.Sometimes you would have to go fast-paste and sometimes slow-paste.
good,You have to work fast paste and slow paste; it depends on the line that they put you on that it would be fast or slow.The work that we do there is putting plastic bowls and  lids in boxes or packing out and/or palletizing.
good,"With the Jaren acquisition, the company is a strong, growing company.  There are many benefits and growth opportunities.  I have visited many sites and found a vast need of broad skills."
good,"Excelente empresa, pautada pela transparência, gestão á vista, objetivos claros e definidos!"
good,"Aprendi muito na Newell Rubbermaid pois foi meu primerio estágio na área de Marketing. O meu papel como colaboradora era o controle de material promocional no ponto de venda, participação nas atividades de planejamento das ações de marketing e vendas e acompanhamento dos custos e orçamentos. A responsabilidade do cargo era grande, pois cuidava de todo o planejamento das ações de trade marketing. Resumindo: uma empresa agradável de trabalhar com uma equipe de funcionários excelente."
good,"I am currently working full time at Newell Brands as a Lead Security & Compliance Analyst (SAP GRC) and it is a great opportunity. I am able to meet deadlines because my manager doesn't mind getting her hands dirty. She is a big time help when it comes to doing the tedious tasks that require quite a bit of attention to detail. However, due to the way the team is structured, I am unable to advance and/or receive promotions."
good,"The people are fun to work with, the work is interesting and easy to do. The place is organized and detailed. This warehouse is large so you're able to find something to do when your department has ran out of work to do.  They also have temp agencies posted the as well to help you start working and you can also work there as a permanent worker as well."
good,"Les maîtres mots chez Newell sont polyvalence et autonomie."
good,"I was part of an amazing team of sales professionals. I learned a lot about sales, marketing, and the importance of cultivating relationships on a business environment."
good,"The work was super easy, I didn't like the fact that I was mostly standing in one spot. I like to be moving and having a steady rhythm."
good,"This job was a very good job, I really hated when it went out of business. I learned a lot of different duties while at this company and was great at it."
good,company current lost contracts to 3 different departments. hours went down and could not guarantee 40 hours a week. other than that was a great place to work.
good,I really enjoyed my time at NR but have seen the company go thorough a lot of changes in the last couple of years. I left due to a better opportunity. There are a lot of really great people who work at Newell.

good,The past 3 years has have been pretty rewarding at Newell Rubbermaid. My supervisor as well as co-workers are all good people and fun to work around.
good,"A typical day is full of problem solving and excitement. I answer phone calls and emails to assist distributors with product questions, warrant defects, placing and editing orders and assisting customers with their account details. The company provided a lot a room for growth and I enjoyed learning all the little behind the scene details of how the stock brands and the DC's interact. "
good,"Newell -Rubbermaid DC in Atlanta,Ga overall is a good company to work for but they lack consistency and there is no work life balance."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is working with different departments. By working with other departments I am learning how my job effects their department.
good,"Ambiente y entorno agradable"
good,Great company and they care about the people. Great work/life balance. I really enjoy working for this company.
good,"The typical day at work was making sure all the orders were received and  shipped in a timely fashion."

Oversee various projects for continuous improvements to waste reduction.  Work with corporate engineers for new products releases, forecasts, and performance."
good,Diverse group of business units with many opportunities.  It is an environment that will challenge you every day.
good,DO to time again election time company get afraid and start lay-offs.I saw so many ppl. who had worked for years and getting older and close to retire and forced them to to leave. They would put them on jobs that a young person would have trouble doing day after day i have seen this many times they do this to break them so they will leave and not get there retirement that they worked for so many years.
good,"Es un buen lugar para trabajar, pero un tanto inestable. Al finalizar la temporada alta, empiezan los recortes masivos de personal a todos los niveles."
good,"I was there for 17 years before I was laid off due to the moving of my department to another facility. I was able to start out on the Manufacturing floor and change to Shipping then to Office. I was in HR as Receptionist/Activity Director, then to Distribution Coordinator doing reports for the Distribution Manager. Also was able to work on the floor in Shipping or MFG for extra money when available. GREAT JOB!"
good,Make sure machines stayed running and making good parts. Learned how to process machine to get a good quality part. I worked with some great people that taught me a lot.
good,Performed Daily Cycle counts: counting various SKU’s (item numbers) in random locations to verify count in inventory database
good,Hours were 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. or til the job was done.
good,Newell-Rubbermaid was a wonderful company to work for.  The employer had a great work life balance.  The company treated their employees nicely.  It was a great work experience.
good,"Great place to work, however, not enough opportunity for advancement. Everyone pretty much gets along. Co-workers almost feel like extended family. Compared to other factory jobs in the area, the pay is not the worst but not the greatest, falling somewhere in the middle. If the job paid more, I'd want to stay until retirement."
good,"Job was fast pace and challenging. Ran two machines at once. Didnt like running back and forward. Got breaks every 2 hours but they didn't pay us for our half hour lunch, I didnt like that."
good,"Fair management and willing to listen to ideas at all levels. Organization prided itself on being the leader in the industry.  Collaboration between divisions was a key element for the companies success.  Although some new hire positions were strictly external, at times, internal promotions helped with morale and the day to day business growth."
good,Great management understand and will to work with you on any situation.  I have have learn a lot of different assembly line skills thats help me with my experience
good,"mi primer trabajo en Planta Maquiladora, buenas prestaciones."
good,My review is irrelevant due to the fact that this company does not even exist in the town where I worked. The call center I worked for was moved to South Carolina.
good,I really like that I was able to move up in my first few days there because I was noticed as a hard worker and problem solver. This is the reason i decided to continue to work as hard as i could for them. I felt appreciated.

He complimented  a good frequently which is anyways  nice. Nobody wants to only hate criticism.  The facility and machines are in very  bad shape and  due to their low pay rate and expensive  benefits  turn over is high which causes a lot of OT. 12 hour shifts 5 or 6 days a week  is just too taxing on your body. With some salary improvements and cheaper benefits I'm sure turnover would definitely go down and the ot  wouldn't be so excessive. That would make rubbermaid a career company."

good,Newell is an outstanding company constantly adding companies to its portfolio. With Nationwide Name Brands that consumers depend upon makes Newell a valued Vendor.

Haviam clientes que a 10, 15, 20 anos não recebiam visita da empresa, sendo que havia um representante na região."
good,"fun"
good,"8am-5pm hours "
good,"Newell Rubbermaid è sicuramente un'azienda attenta allo sviluppo della carriera lavorativa della persona diretta a creare un ambiente positivo sul posto di lavoro."
good,I enjoyed going to work and seeing what the day will bring. The management works great together and is very focused. Every one here really brings the  lets get it done attitude and strives for success. Except one English chap but he is ok in my book. But now there is no more Graco. Newell Rubbermaid closed the facility in Macedonia and move the operation to Rubbermaid in Mogador. They really tried there best to run the products but just could not come close to the production numbers of the Macedonia facility. It only took them a year of failure to finally ship it all to China.  Just another company Newell Rubbermaid has run in the ground and failed to manage properly and played lets get richer faster and screw the American worker.
good,"Strong company with several structural changes lately."
good,This company has awesome team work. Everyone helps each other and no one gets behind.
good,"Newell-Rubbermaid is a fantastic company whose employees come first, and our office reflects that in so many ways. As part of the Activities Committee, I am able to creatively plan events such as holiday parties, luncheons, and retirement gatherings for my colleagues that bring us all together on a personal level. Our hard work and dedication is always recognized and often rewarded (I received a 'Ruby Award' for going above and beyond which came with a certificate and points to use on the company website). Even though the fast-pasted environment is often stressful, I know that my team is right with me. I have never encountered teamwork to this degree with any other company. The most difficult part of the job is letting go. Newell-Rubbermaid has been in restructure mode for the past couple of years on a grand scale. In order to streamline and tighten up, jobs have been eliminated. Mine will be lost as of 10/31/2013."
good,"disassemble molds to clean & repair . learned to run mills, lathes grinders , harden steel & repair complex runner systems . worked graveyard so management was not around much . working on molds in the injection machine . working in the shop with all the equipment"
good,"Working part-time in a small Chef's Outlet store within an outlet mall provides an easy atmosphere and a tight-knit family of co-workers. Safety and training are high priority, and one is always improving and learning new things. Daily tasks include customer service, working the cash register, demostrating electrics and cookware in store by cooking, cleaning the store, and stocking and taking inventory. Making sales and learning the differences and nuances of products is the most difficult part of the job, but the friendly yet professional atmosphere, good customer service, and constant training is the most enjoyable part. It's easy to remain inspired and involved in this company since one is constantly learning and improving his or her customer service."
good,"This was the best job i had ever had and i HATED that my assignment was only Temporary. I worked with great people who worked super hard. I think because i made a fair amount of money to survive it made me work harder. I would stay late off the clock to finish things even though it was not required of me. I loved this job and the small office of people i worked with in Statesville,NC."
good,I love this company because there was room for growth and development. The compensation and incentives were emaculant. Management was grade A and amazing at helping their associates become successful.
good,"Mejorar el ambiente de trabajo y los descansos, manejar mas la comunicación verbal en tiempo y forma"

good,"Arriving at work was always a jittering feeling. I was always anxious to see what my work had set out for me.  I learned how to torch plastic bowls , and trim trash cans. I enjoyed applying the labels to the product that seem like my most easiest job. The difficult part about work was working in the heat and stacking the trash cans to a certain height. With my size that seem like my most hardest job. My co- workers were always a good help when it came to showing me the different techniques. The management was always in good sight , always made sure we were work ready ."

good,"I love working for Newell.   They have great benefits,  great vacation time,  alot of resources for the workers, "
good,"Newell Brands is a great place to kick start your career. I started with the company in 2013 as a temp making 10$ an hour and now, 5 years later make nearly 30 an hour as a technician. You can really branch off into a lot of different areas in the company, as long as you have the ambition."
good,"A great place to work."
good,"Newell gave me the chance to become quarterback within my first month, basically i had to be there 30min earlier to attend our daily meeting. Basic math was required to do our daily paper work. I as quarterback had to line up my group in a specific spot they felt comfortable in, our main focus was to make sure the job fit the person."
good,Lots of growth and change with the acquisition of various brands and companies! Environment seems to be always changing (a good thing for most folks)!
good,"I have been working there a month and I have been trained to drive four different pieces of equipment, something I begged to do at other warehouses for years. I see an equal amount of women and men doing a varied amount of jobs and my supervisors are great. Whenever we finish our work early, they give me the opportunity to learn something new and fun. I have added so many useful skills to my resume already. The hours can be long but the money is great for my level of experience. My only complaint would be that it is a tad bit cold in there but this is by far the best company I have ever worked at."
good,"Working at rubbermaid it was like leaving home to go to another home. Management team was excellent. You felt, appreciated when you get a thank you for the good job you've done"
good,"A typical work day for me would be to collaborate with our engineers about a car seat to be crash tested. We would review the different testing modes as well as the critical modes."
good,"During my employment at Newell Rubbermaid, the hardest part of working in the factory during the summer was the heat. Of course the plant was hot due to the machines, and having to wear the safety equipment meant for our jobs- however, the management did their best to ensure worker safety. They would make sure employees had ample water, frequent cool-down breaks, and on the hottest days, they would bring in industrial fans to create an indoor-breeze."

Managements was good although we change many times during my reign. Co-workers were very close, like your second family away from home. The hardest part of the job was the language barrier.The most enjoyable part was helping co-workers through their issues, whether it be job-related or personal."
good,One of the best places I've worked at. Great people. Very friendly. Job itself wasnt bad. Co workers and supervisors were easy going and easy to talk to.

good,"a typical day at work consists of washing,folding and taking all the clean laundry to the floors."
good,"Each day at Rubbermaid was not very fun, some days its too hot or too cold, some days the items on the belt are moving a little too fast. I learned that before you buy a item that use to eat or drink with you must really wash it out before using it.  The supervisors were all nice people until you break the rules, then they become upset, but me personally I am not a rule breaker, I do my job and go home.  My co workers were all nice, but some had childish ways.  The hardest part of the job was when about 80 bowls come at you at one time and you have to either clip the bottom or put 40 stickers on before the other batch came down the line.  The most enjoyable part of working at Rubbermaid is when they rotate you to a different machine especially one that you enjoy working on."
