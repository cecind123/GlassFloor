good,"My area has a fast paced and challenging work environment.  My manager is excellent at encouraging work-life balance and avoiding burn out or over-allocation of work assignments.  There are times when working over 40 hours may be necessary, but those times are infrequent.  There are many opportunities within The Hartford, and employees are encouraged to develop their skills both to support their current role and position themselves to move into other roles or other areas of the company.  Recent changes have made the dress code more casual, with a ""dress for your day"" focus that allows more jeans and other casual wear in the office (within reason, i.e. no shorts and tanks/t-shirts).  The Hartford has a strong focus on work/life balance.  The new benefits for 2020 have increased benefits around family life including enhanced fertility coverage, adoption benefits, increased parental leave.  They are also concerned about the impact of student loan debt on an employee's life so the company is introducing a benefit to help defray some of an employee's student loan debt.  I am too old to make use of these benefits, but this is a good step to becoming a more attractive employer to the younger employee pool.  The employees I work with have a wide variety of backgrounds and The Hartford is a diverse and inclusive employer in all areas.  I have worked for The Hartford for nearly 30 years, and there have been times when I would not have strongly recommended the company as an employer of choice.  That has changed, and I am happier working for The Hartford now than I have ever been.  I would"
bad,"A lot of inconsistency as far as policies go. Managers need to get educated on the system more.when it came down to needing a manager on the phone , no one wanted to take the call and didn’t care then if customer was on hold long ."
bad,This place is a joke. They allow people to call out everyday and you have to pick up the slack. They have an employee who talks to stuffed animals at their desk. They had another employee who tried to attack other employees and fired those employees but kept the attacker. Mgmt is awful and they favor people who have issues. Good employees don't get rewarded. Mgmt talks about everyone ans are backstabbers. Good luck if you work here... Not worth it.
bad,They really don’t care about anything but your survey numbers. You can get a promotion if your leader likes you and I’d you join on of their frat clubs or like 4.
bad,It was not fun place very poitcal because I was not in boys and girl club I did not advance I would never want anyone deal with what I felt with crop America sucks
bad,"job barely pays livable wages, when eligible for commission they find reasons to not pay you. a lot if talk about growth but no actual change. good benefits a guess great lunch room"
bad,"Refused to train me for a position that I was asked to take. They are always looking for 3rd party liability so they can recoop the money that was paid to claimants. If you have a claim with them, please know your policy."
bad,I really don't have an opinion. At this point I work for The Hartford because I need a job. I really don't feel that there's room for advancement.  I don't want to sound negative at all.
bad,Over worked with hundreds of calls each day. Not enough reps on the phone. Claim handlers would take days to weeks to get to a member. They would call back upset and frustrated
bad,"I've been fortunate enough to have worked for some really great companies, companies that actually invested in my success.  The Hartford, IS NOT THAT TYPE OF COMPANY."
bad,"Very unrealistic expectationsof work load.  Not worth the stress. The volume of work is not realistic.  The pay is decent, but if you breakit down per hour it's less than minimum wage."
bad,"Some team leads are better than others. Depending on whose team you are on will make or break your career at The Hartford. The childish high school environment is created by team leaders that are childish and immature themselves all viying for a higher position that they will never be able to attain and our management team knows and sees all of this drama unfold and does nothing about it. It is a very catty environment with emotions balled up in office drama. Take The Office but instead of paper replace it with insurance and throw in a little Game Of Thrones with each team and each division of the Hartford as a different house. Some houses will support other houses or they will become life long enemies. All houses will eventually battle it out to find out who will sit on the Iron Throne. All of this will take place while a dragon is constantly killing everyone (the phone calls from claimants will never stop). ""Winter is coming."""
bad,Stay away from sales.   Customer service is highly scripted.  Sales leads are provided  in the call center AARP program but calls are routed  to the “best sellers “ and favoritism applies.  I had seen to many employees get married and the partner would get promoted into a different area but with better pay every time.
bad,"I would not refer this company there is no work life balance, the company under pay employees. It is a stressful work environment, This is a call center base job."
bad,"As a customer service inbound call center rep, you will have all the responsibility and expected to be perfect but have no support, horrible technology to deal with, and pay that is not commensurate."
bad,"Assist members with their auto insurance needs, and sales opportunities. I learned that I was not a good candidate for sales to members that could barely afford their insurance"
bad,I did not enjoy working at The Hartford. Expectations on sales were only attainable by intentionally ignoring set rules or by lying to customers. That is not the type of person I am.
bad,Hands down the most negative job I’ve ever had. Big brother type management and culture. You will be scrutinized for everything. Claims is not a place to advance. You’ll work at least 45+ hours a week and still be behind. Case loads are unrealistic and you’re always given way more than you should handle. Negative work environment and miserable colleagues.

bad,"Horrible repore/dynamics across deparments. Compensation/workload not balanced. Never enough time to explore other opportunities within the company. Numbers drvien culture,as metrics are based on numbers, as opposed to being outcome based and whether you were able to meet client's needs."
bad,"The management lies and sets the Call Agent up for termination. The Hartford lacks vision for prosperity. Although, they talk about helping employees The Hartford management team deceives about an agent they need to take out of employment. "
bad,Don’t waste your time unless you enjoy being micro managed down to the fact that you’re breathing! Claims is awful. The insured and Claimants are awful.  There are so man6 rules and regulations that you spend all day drowning then get yelled at for not keeping up. Management is sneaky and plays favorites. PTO has to be given months in advance. If you take a day off you’re going to spend a week catching up. Do yourself a favor and don’t bother working at The Hartford in Claims.
bad,"not very much to say - it became all about the numbers and how many calls you could take and less and less about the customers - suddenly all of the folks I looked up to were being let go -I think there intention was to fill spots with younger folks and pay them less , and now they are constantly hiring because no one wants to stay there  - what a shame"
bad,Call center has very high turnover ratio for a insurance company and is very inconsistent in keeping up with what they promise from a company standpoint from the first day.
bad,"Not what it use to be. Focus shifted in the wrong direction, too many losses feeding too many restrictions, and no understanding towards employees who need to use FMLA for their children's disabilities. You can use it, but the repercussions are tremendous."
bad,"They do not value quality work, extra effort from employees, work life balance, pay accurately based on work requirements, or care about their employees."
bad,"For a call center this one is pretty strict and when it comes to family matters, they don't care if it is an emergency, they expect you to work. I wouldn't recommend working here"
bad,"We were there like if nobody cares about the account or the customer.Sorry to say. nothing more to say , nothing more , ok, nothing more to say, you can not make people write more than nec."
bad,"Management plays favoritism, they don't care about your experience and knowledge. It is all about numbers. They don't care if you do it right or wrong as long as your production is in 100s. No room for advancement. This place sucks. I would never recommend this company to work for."
bad,So much stress in this place that I ended up leaving. Completely unrealistic expectations of employees. Management doesn't have any idea how to rectify and just spin their wheels. Will NEVER recommend.
bad,"Management are all for themselves. They have no ethics, even though they expect you to have ethics. They have unstable people working for them. Talk of layoffs before I left."
bad,"The people that I worked with were very nice. The work pace was steady. Overall, as long as you completed your work and maintained good attendance, the job was good"
bad,I learned to rely on my self and my coworkers to resolve issues.  The work expected exceeds the time allowed.  Difficult to maintain a work life balance.  Very poor benefit package.
bad,"The Company and the Management are only there for themselves, they get the benefits, they get the perks, the recognition. The rules do not apply to them, especially their Ethics and Workplace violence policy."
bad,"Horrible place to work, no work life balance, and no team environment.  Management takes no responsibility, company will on write what everyone else wants, underwriters have no say."
bad,Lower management is let free to harass the employees and miss manage at will. To manipulate and create a poor working environment. A short term disability manager tortured and unfairly treated employees until they quit or went out on leave. Several employees under this manager left or were forced out.
bad,conpany continues to struggle financially and it is forced to nickel and dime it's employees to death.  The are cutting all benefits and recently tried to pull a big negative change on the 401k but got so much pushback from employees that it was reversed.   The folks at the top are well compensated for ruining a 200 year old company.   Layoffs are continuous.

bad,"This company has the worst medical insurance coverage to be an insurance company. High deductible plans offered. Not ideal for a family.  For the best plan you will have you spend half of your pay check. Very high stress workload. Never experienced anything like this in my life. Training is horrible. Sit in front of a computer for 8hrs. Barely get a break. In the beginning it seems nice but when you finally get on your own, you are overloaded with work. They dont even tell you when something new is coming, they just dump it on your.  Was constantly reminded that this job required more than 40 hours. I was asked to put in 60hrs on the same salary. If you have a family this job is not for you. This job is only okay for single people with no children or people with grown children. You have to make this your life with no hobbies or room for family.  Run run run away from this company.  Over heard management talking so poorly of people in a public area on several occasions. When they noticed I was around they would switch to spanish. I watched 8 people quit in the 4 months I was there. Not worth the time to it out."
bad,"Take my word for it: DO NOT work for The Hartford. They will spend a lot of money training you because they focus on development - which is great! But, they do not care about their employees as humans."
bad,"While the company promotes a promising work environment, it certainly does not have that atmosphere."
bad,"Management is incompetent & does not understand what ""coaching""means. No room for advancement. Management ignores or disregards request for assistance & has no idea what daily job consists of while minimizing how hard you work.  Couldn't wait to leave. Suggesting ideas for improvement leads to no results. Projects are not well thought through by management during implementing and the underdogs have to clean up the mess for several years after. Instead of doing things correctly first, time & resources are wasted because everything is reactive instead of proactive."
bad,"This is absolutely the worst job I've ever had. First, they hire in new employees with better day hours with weekends off and give existing employees sorry hours with every other weekend, they don't care about employees, not flexible about anything, and managers are never around when you need them and don't take supervisor calls.....Can't wait to find a new career"
bad,out of business - schedule appts for incoming and out going deliveries
bad,"Upper managements only focus is on making the numbers. Employee feedback is asked for, but is a waste of time. FLM's are so busy with the work they get from upper management that they often have to work from home and barely any time to effectively coach their team."
bad,"I worked for the Hartford for 13 years, with dedications, loyalty and pride.  Working with a company for those many years I have had my up and downs but I was always able to survive. However not this time, and it had all to with customer's surveys.  Yes I do admit I did do something wrong but it was joked about in the office and I did not think it was all that bad because the customer survey was prejudice from the beginning.  I thought it was just as bad as not getting to a return phone call, sometimes you just can't return all phone calls in one day being a claim adjuster, it's impossible some days, especially on Mondays or after a holiday, even if you have the greatest intention to do your best. Anyway, the customer's that have an email address counted on a survey but the customer that did not have a email address did not count on a survey and in my opinion that is prejudice.  You should treat all customers the same. However, if the customer that does not have an email address does not count, who will you tend to first? Probably the customer that has an email address rather than the customer without the email address.  Well I deleted a email address with a customer that did not like my outcome, when I explained to them my determination and they got disgruntled, then I had to discuss the survey with them and they are already upset with me, and it was not because I treated the customer wrongfully, it was because I couldn't give them exactly what they wanted on their total loss or a liability decision I made. However then I get customer that loved me but they did not have a email"
bad,This company is antiquated from many perspectives. They are not a partner to their agents or customers. Would not recommend.
bad,They do not care at all for employees. Dollar-driven with no culture.
bad,"When I first applied online the add stated that they were looking for full time employees. After getting hired and starting the training, we were all told that they were starting us off at part-time with chance to then go full time. The information is very misleading. The chances to get time off and the pay are not worth the hassle."
bad,"The abuse by management in Worker's Compensation  to the Nurse Case Management employees was awful. I was a full time NCM. Full time required 80 to 90 hrs per week to work the ridiculous caseload. If you tried to only work 60 hrs per week, you were written up and denied bonus. After 8 tortured years there, 75% of all the NCM nationwide also left within 60 days of my leaving. The competent NCM who remained transferred to other business lines.dadaysdays.memleaving.my quitting."
bad,"Immediate manager openly criticizes and shames employees in front of others , is petty and overly critical, thin-skinned.  Mgr plays favorites and punishes those who know more than she does.  Although complaints made to  HR by many employees, those employees are viewed as low level bodies who are replaceable.  Low morale, bad corporate culture."
bad,"Schedule time 8 hours I was working 12 hours per day plus 8 hours and Saturday told that a manager is not good enough"

bad,"Poor Management "
bad,"This company used to be about providing great customer service and treating employees with respect....no longer. While customer service remains a focus, management has created nearly unattainable, constantly changing metrics that push good employees to look elsewhere for employment. Turnover is much higher than admitted. Managers play favorites and give the impression they are only focused on looking out for their bonuses. Any positive reviews are planted by corporate HR."
bad,"It seems like every day we are given more bad news or more of our benefits being taken away. Recently it was overtime being very limited even though it is impossible to complete this job in a 40 hour work week and still produce the numbers they want to see.  Upper management is constantly changing and we aren't going to be receiving bonuses this year.  "
bad,"They do not value the employee especially with the high ratio of management to employees.  They practice the Theory X management style where employees are viewed as non-productive unless they are micro managed.  They keep track of how much time is spent using the restrooms for example and are quick to use the Written Warning system to try to motivate with dire consequences if you are perceived as not succumbing to their Management by Intimidation model!"
bad,"Call center environment with favoritism, female pettiness, and not team oriented. If you don't look like you are struggling than you don't fit in."
bad,Typical work day is very fast paced. If you don't know how to do something you were better off asking a peer than your manager. Manager's were too busy to ever assist or you were made to feel like you were bothering them. Salary was very good and co-workers were very friendly
bad,"This company plays with people lively hood. They hire without even completing a background check first. They only complete your criminal background before you start. If your employment dates are off, they terminate you. Dont you think before someone leaves their prior job, you should at least have their background done. People are not friendly and they dont care if you are jobless. That's why a lot people don't have jobs now, because of stupid companies like this one. If you ask me DON'T WASTE your time with this company. And they dont even pay good."
bad,Very little benefits. Company preaches good culture and values but never shows. NOT A PLACE FOR HARD WORKERS OR MINORITIES! Only way to advance is to completely let down the customer and back stab everyone and anyone. This place makes Alcatraz look safe. Management is a poor excuse of people who want numbers but don't work to make them happen. I spent 6 months wiping the rears of everyone above me including many seasoned reps who made me wonder how they even got dressed in the morning. Work and life balance is ok except you get so sick of the drama you wake up every day literally wanting to throw up and call out sick. The trainers are so ignorant they ask you to do one thing then totally forget and tell you that you've done it wrong after you've done it their way. Half of them don't even know the basics.
bad,There is no work/life balance. Underpaid and overworked. Upper management has the most unrealistic expectations from their employees.
bad,"I have worked for this company twice in 7 years and I must say that it is one of the worst I have worked for. For such a large company, their systems are lousy. I spend most of my day shutting off and logging back so just so I can enter 3-4 cases. In 1 1/2 years with this office, I have only learned how to open cases, open & distribute mail, & electronically file documents. My co-workers are older women whom are EXTREMELY petty and gossips. Management is too relaxed and lets these people get away with everything."
bad,Supervisors don't like older employees don't want to waste time working with you if your not on the top of the sales team they will work to get rid of you.they discriminate against you. The top management doesn't care
bad,"at one point The Hartford was a great place to work at now they are all about numbers and no longer care about the employees, very hard to advance within the companies especially if you work in a customer service role as job shadowing is almost impossible due to the needs for phone coverage"
bad,I’m a sales rep for personal lines and they treat the sales staff horrible! Extremely micromanaged and your “bonus” for selling will go to zero if you take too many calls and don’t convert them into sales (overall conversion rate is too low) So even if you do sell policies there’s a large chance you will not receive any incentive.So why should I even care to sell anything? With that being said you will average about 40 calls per day and you will be asked where you went for 6 minutes to get a cup of water. So if you want every minute of your day micromanaged apply here!
bad,"Was very excited to start my job at the Hartford until I very quickly learned how manipulative management was. Team leaders are very childish, they would sit in a circle behind the call center reps and talk about their personal business for hours. I overheard MULTIPLE team leads discussing other co workers personal business. No one was trained properly, results regarding calls and metrics varied from team to team, most times you would have to spend time reading through your own call reviews because 9/10 they were downgrading you for something they shouldn’t have, then they’d want you to resubmit the call to be regraded all while being upset that you took time off the phone to do all of the above. The only way to advance is to suck up to management. They would discipline particular people and not others for the same actions. I witnessed multiple people be fired during my time here. Most if not all of my coworkers were looking for work due to the lack of advancement. I can’t say enough bad things about the company. Do not waste your time."
bad,"I truly had hoped that I had found a place of employment that was far different from any other contact center I have ever worked in. Up until week 6 of a 10 week training I believed I had. That's when the hammer came down and I found out that they're NO different, in fact, the micromanaging and critiquing of employee calls is far Worse than anywhere else I have ever been employed. During my first week of taking live calls, while getting up to take a non scheduled bathroom break, i was stopped by 2 different managers asking me what I thought I was doing! Outside of 2 breaks and one 30 minute lunch which isn't really a full 30 minutes it's more like 20, you are expected to sit and hold it if necessary until you do yourself bodily harm. The training is 10 weeks which is far too short of a time for the physical amount of information they expect you to learn in Auto Servicing. The time frame before you are even able to try to post out of that department is 2 years (was told 1 year in the interview process, yet another lie). If you are looking for a relaxed atmosphere, this is not the place for you. Calls coming in are nonstop, back to back. Unless you are going into After Call Work, there is no time to even take a sip of water before the next call is coming in right behind the one you just finished. The customer calls that you do take are usually pretty mild; i have only encountered a few customers calling in that were so upset that they were yelling at me or cussing. The Customer Service Representatives are responsible for the lions share of the company's Underwriting-while on the"
bad,"Awful management team. Culture is very exclusive and the management team is not very friendly or accepting of those who are not ""like"" them. Treating employees who are not similar in race and age very poorly."
bad,"Extremely stressful job.  Grossly underpaid, horrible culture.  Tremendous turnover.  Very difficult to advance. Micromanaged.  Leadership is aware of problems and does nothing to curtail issues."
bad,"Worst job I’ve ever had. Extreme micromanagement that’s getting worse with the Hartford way. They put everyone’s everything out there for all to see. Team leaders lead by fear and anger. Unrealistic expectations and constant case reassignments.  Favoritism runs rampant and if you want to grow your career forget about it, you won’t get anywhere. I wish I would have read the reviews prior to taking this job."

There are times when working over 40 hours may be necessary, but those times are infrequent.  There are many opportunities within The Hartford, and employees are encouraged to develop their skills both to support their current role and position themselves to move into other roles or other areas of the company.

The new benefits for 2020 have increased benefits around family life including enhanced fertility coverage, adoption benefits, increased parental leave.

bad,"Extreme metrics from the moment you start your day (you better start/be logged onto everything by your start time) until the very end of your day. Everything is tracked and you will hear from your manager if you are not on top of everything. Unfortunately, you don't hear from your manager when you do anything well....rarely even hear if a customer wants to compliment you. Recognition and Awards programs are a joke - unless you are one of the favored company ""yes"" people. Career advancements/opportunities are rare. Management tries to put a positive spin on everything negative that they throw your way. Marketing does anything to get the phones to ring. Your phone will ring constantly all day long. Many very nasty, hostile callers to you have to deal with. Management will not take escalation calls. Even after a horrible call, you better be ready to take the next call immediately. I KNOW not all call centers are run this way, but The Hartford insists that they are. You are just a number or warm body doing what they tell you. Management will just tell you to find another job."
bad,Arrogant management in auto physical damage department. Management and supervisor were bossy and didn't respect workers knowledge when workers knowledge far exceeded there experience in the industry. Management promotions was not based on knowledge but a popularity contest
bad,"Very poor management and unethical, Threaten with termination unless job performance improves which is untrue. Put pressure to finish assignments with little warning of time of job completion. Management is very disorganized and poor planning in projects. System for testing often doesn't work and difficult to test changes in programs. Employees don't trust management as often dishonest. Very poor training and often training not available. Not up on latest technology and doesn't want to spend any money to upgrade systems."
bad,"Horrible work environment, No leadership Lack of promotion opportunities. This company has the worst morale of any company I've worked for. I would not recommend going to work for them"
bad,"Don’t know what loyalty is. Very impersonal. You are a number. They don’t care about the customer.  At the beginning was good , but has gone way down hill in the past 2 years."
bad,"not interested in giving a review."
bad,"You begin with a stafff so energetic and willing to assist and once your trained and on the phones the management is horrible!!!  "
bad,"Very stressful, not a lot of opportunities for advancement, work environment was fair and didn't get the proper training needed to perform the task at hand."
bad,Management is incompetent. Advancement is a challenge if you do not suck up to your Team Lead. DO not take this position if you are overqualified for it! You will become bored quickly. You will take at least 80 calls per day.
bad,"Disgusting place to work especially with PL IT and the new leader doesn't understands the culture and it's more of ""My way or No way"". Very rude and political, no room for growth."
bad,"If you enjoy working late hours with two (very closely monitored) 15 minute breaks and a half hour lunch, feel free to give up every ounce of humanity and happiness you once had. Management is horrible. They are selfish, loud and do not care about your needs. Call-center reps are treated below average. Quality reviews phone calls and bonuses are quickly taken away on a matter of a few percentages. Imagine working hard all month for a bonus then having it wiped away the day before the end of the month because of 0/003%. Maddening."
bad,"The managers are super demanding.. The applications that the company uses are older than computers. Management provide ""coaching"" which is essentially just a way for them to tell you what you're doing wrong so you can correct it so that they can make their bonus while you may receive a 3% raise if that. The training is poor and good luck finding anyone in management knowledgable enough to assist you with any questions you may have. Overall I was very unhappy while here and am super glad to be gone. It's a modern day slave ship"
bad,the hours for Hartford are not for someone who has a family.  The call center is micromanaged and very high volume.  There is no to very little advancement.
bad,"Absolutely no work/life balance. Benefits are bad, especially considering this is an insurance company. You are micro-managed to death. Have actually seen other employees cry. Management for the most part incompetent. Mostly people with no management experience. If you disagree with them start looking for the nearest exit. You cannot express any concerns without repercussions. Lasted 7 years. My doctor actually pressed me to leave based on stress level."
bad,"I have started working here since May ,first thing I have observed is lots and lots of rude people and lots of politics . The management is very stingy to pay ,they wanted me to learn 30 year old application in 3 months ."
bad,This is a job. Co-workers are great. Training was very good. Pay could be better. No room for advancement.
bad,"I can definitely say the only decent thing about this place was the pay & benefits. Mgrs constantly play favorites, gossip more  than doing their job & engage in relations with employees. realistic goals are never given  bc they dont want them met. Software is outdated. There is no room for advancement or schedule changes w/o ridiculous waiting period."
bad,"At first it was rewarding but as I continued with the company I felt like a robot. I didn't get paid enough to be yelled at by customers daily. The job was repetitive, the culture was cliquey and it seems like the building was full of people who peaked in high school. If you played along with the culture and knew people in higher positions you'd be promoted first (this happened several times). The managers treated you like children otherwise, rewarding high metrics with cake or other sweets. When other employees left or were fired, management acted like they never existed in the first place. Bonuses were nothing to write about seeing as the company makes millions on profit every year. They also wouldn't allow me to get any car insurance through them for unknown reasons (clean driving record). The insurance industry doesn't care about its customers, it only cares about the money they are making."
good,"My area has a fast paced and challenging work environment.  My manager is excellent at encouraging work-life balance and avoiding burn out or over-allocation of work assignments.  There are times when working over 40 hours may be necessary, but those times are infrequent.  There are many opportunities within The Hartford, and employees are encouraged to develop their skills both to support their current role and position themselves to move into other roles or other areas of the company.  Recent changes have made the dress code more casual, with a ""dress for your day"" focus that allows more jeans and other casual wear in the office (within reason, i.e. no shorts and tanks/t-shirts).  The Hartford has a strong focus on work/life balance.  The new benefits for 2020 have increased benefits around family life including enhanced fertility coverage, adoption benefits, increased parental leave.  They are also concerned about the impact of student loan debt on an employee's life so the company is introducing a benefit to help defray some of an employee's student loan debt.  I am too old to make use of these benefits, but this is a good step to becoming a more attractive employer to the younger employee pool.  The employees I work with have a wide variety of backgrounds and The Hartford is a diverse and inclusive employer in all areas.  I have worked for The Hartford for nearly 30 years, and there have been times when I would not have strongly recommended the company as an employer of choice.  That has changed, and I am happier working for The Hartford now than I have ever been.  I would"
bad,"This is an awful company. They lied about the intensity of the job and about the call volume. I answered 75-80 calls a day with people SCREAMING into the phone. I was given a 30 minute lunch. The pay is barely above the federal poverty line. The work is monotonous and boring. I was interviewed for an upper position and told that the ONLY reason I didn't get it was because I hadn't worked there for a year. They knew this information BEFORE THE INTERVIEW. SO WHY HAVE ME GO THROUGH THE INTERVIEW PROCESS? Terrible, awful job. I had to go on extra medication to deal with the stress. DO NOT WORK FOR THIS COMPANY."
bad,Every year workload increases and demands get worse and worse. Anything for employees is all talk. No one actually cares about the entry level employees and treats them as such.
bad,"No longer a good employer. Horrible culture, high case load, massive backlog, micromanaging, low pay, fear of retaliation, dishonest managers, and nasty claimants"
bad,"Not a pleasant experience.  I was lied to during my interview.  The position that I have and the position/working environment that was ""sold"" to me during the interview process are not the same thing."
bad,"My personality has completely changed working here, I feel like this place over the last four years has completely sucked the soul out of my body. Claims handling is perhaps the worst job you can have, and HIG does nothing to make it easier on you. The managers, who are supposed to be there to HELP you, only micromanage and make your job more difficult than it needs to be. I was given ONE promotion right at the beginning, and now cannot move in the company (even with the highest ratings in the department). Think you can just say to them I can't take this anymore, I quit? There are 50 more ready to take your place, and the management makes sure you know it."
bad,I worked with the customer service area and then the short terms disability area.  The call volumes were very high and at the time ratings were based on the number of calls you took.  not the service provided.  Same can be said about the disability claims.  It was more volume over quality
bad,The pay is great.. management micromanages to the extreme.. high stress... literally youre just a number... the shifts are terrible.. the benefits are the only good thing.
bad,"Worst company ever. Stay far far away. Management is a complete & total joke. All team leaders are lazy, rude, incapable of helping you & have bad attitudes. If you question a team leader you are automatically put on their list & once your own that list you may as well quit because they are going to do any and everything to get ride of you. You have to be a brown noser to work there. Call volume is ridiculous. Metrics are a complete joke."
bad,Not a great place to work. There is no opportunities for career advancement. Management is unfair and not in touch with reality. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.
bad,"The requirements of the position were to fill out a production worksheet, which was on Excel.  The worksheet was 5000 lines long. I was working from home and every minute of my day needed to be accounted for.  My supervisor received a weekly report of how long my computer was inactive. The expectations were very high, and after working there ten years, my salary increase was minimal.  My salary was going to daycare, so I decided it was time for me to leave to raise my daughter."
bad,The management was terrible. Upper management was worse. Some managers were great but others were not helpful and unethical. The benefits were decent.
bad,"If this company recognized my need for growth to do more challenging work, I would have stayed."
bad,"... why the ad for CRS is always running.  When everything including a potty break is timed, micromanagement hts a new level.  There is constant ""voluntary"" mandatory overtime (ie:  if you don't do the OT you are branded).  Employees who offer ideas that differ from the corporate speak are targeted and management builds a file for the most minor offense until they can get rid of that employee.  The other option is they just make life so miserable you leave."
bad,"Daily expectations unrealistic which caused a lot of undue stress and employees to go out on medical leave. "
bad,"If you never have any personal issues, this may be a good place to work.  I had medical issues as a new hire and received little to no support or guidance from any member of management.  In addition, because my view on customer service differs from theirs in that I don't want to rush a customer off the phone if they still need assistance just so I can make my quota, this was not a good fit for me.  I will never again work for any insurance company because of my horrible experience with The Hartford."
bad,"They have a culture of denying internal employees promotions multiple times regardless of status. They care more about tenure when you start from the bottom. The call center can only be compared to slavery, they switch breaks and lunches everyday at their convenience and will cancel any personal development time, meetings, and basically anything to do with you being off the phone if call volume is heavy. Also lunch is only 30 minutes for call center employees everyone else’s job seems to be a breeze and have much more freedom."
bad,"I really disliked this job with all my heart. They really did not care about their employees at all. It's very very sad. I'm an scarred for life after working here. They are not family oriented, management is brutal."
bad,"I worked in the STD call center. The management was unreal. They were bullies, micro managing and treat employees with favoritism. The calls were a nightmare, if I wasn't being cursed out and screamed at because the analyst didn't do their job I was in tears because about 75% of the callers were terminally ill and destitute because they had no pay. The pay for this position initially was great, after realizing the position it was no where near enough. This job was horrible and I couldn't be happier no longer working there."
bad,"This company outsources their human resources, and once tried to fire me for having a miscarriage. They pass over talent on a regular basis in order to create the most mundane and uninspired work place to ever sit."

bad,"If you get hired for the AARP position be prepared to learn every aspect of P&C Insurance in only 2 weeks with NO help from The Hartford. You get an online course, an outdated book and you basically teach yourself insurance. No trainers at all - just ""Facilitators"" that won't help you whatsoever. They do not care about you... You get treated like a number from day #1 - and when you get your cubicle your name tag will actually have a barcode underneath it. After 2 weeks of non-stop trying to teach yourself this insurance you will have to take the state exam. And if you fail - even by 1 point - they WILL fire you. You are lead into thinking that they are investing in you and there's no way they would fire you - but they will. The perks about this place is that they do offer a great benefit / PTO package, and if you work in the Windsor, CT office you get all the BIG bells and whistles - a huge ""casino-like"" cafeteria with actual chefs to serve you and every food you could imagine, A Starbucks inside the building, Countless Vending Machines, ATM's on premises, Various vendors who sell there goods on certain days of the week, A nurse's office in you don't feel good (yeah - like a school nurse) a state of the art gym with a trainer and various fitness classes, oh - and can't forget the massage therapist. So yeah - the Perks are high, but to me it's like they are just trying to ""buy"" you with all of this... If you are down with that, than more power to you... but if you have a heart and want to be looked at as a person - than go apply somewhere else.... this place is not for you."
bad,"This was the most bizarre place I’ve ever worked. Poor culture with an “us vs. them” mentality. And the upper management acts very professional but you’d better watch your back because if you become a threat by advancing relationships with colleagues they’ll cut you down in a second. Terrible, terrible environment and I would never recommend working there to a friend."
bad,"There is no money to make here, assume you will be paid your base pay only. Hours and day scheduled are at the pleasure of management. The culture is great, but they are stingy and want people to work hard for no commission. This is a sales job but you are not paid as salespeople. If you want to make money, stay away from here. Do not accept any promises of commission, they are lies."
bad,"On the positive side it's a very diverse environment and typically promotes low level managerial positions internally.  Mostly a positive environment with friendly coworkers. Has a large bulk of PTO offered early in employment.   However, the working environment is stressful and takes micro management to a new level."
bad,"Servicing AAPR customers auto/home policies with phone metrics and strict call monitoring.  Enjoyed establishing rapport and assisting customers with bill payments, changes to policies."
bad,This company stated that I was a liability to them and when they put to y-cord with other senior reps they were doing the same things I did and so were even worse than me.
bad,The manager I worked for did not support her staff or have their backs.  She would throw anyone under the bus to advance her career.  I witnessed this in how she treated my team members.  Team members felt they had no recourse (including one African American team member to whom she would brag about having confederate flags hanging in her home )
bad,"A typical day at the Hartford, You will be taken around 25 calls a day."
bad,"In a call center, being on time, taking calls fast and not using time off in between calls in ideal. But The Hartford also will fully take people from one department and move them without notice or permission due to their long term ideas for improvement. They are very quick to provide warnings and write-ups but are inconsistent when it comes to answering questions or providing help with shadowing or making efforts to advance in your career."
bad,"I would not recommend working for The Hartford. Hard work is rarely rewarded and employees are made to feel as if they are ""just a number."""
bad,"If you want a temp job while attending school this is probably the job for you.  My experience with this company was less then stellar, pay was the lowest pay for the amount of workload that is expected of you. Schedule for vacation time or time off overall is the worst I've experienced. If you like to be micromanaged every single minute of your day this is the job for you. Opportunities for advancement well let's just say good luck!"
bad,"Local management is good.  We can dress for our day.  We can come and go as needed.  However, the company utilizes highly centralized and bureaucratic management and decision making."
bad,I worked on the phones and was never able to reach goals to get a raise we were not able to take our hands of keyboard in between calls and were reprimanded for taking bathroom breaks when needed
bad,"Ten years ago this was the destination. Today the risk Engineering/loss control Dept is a dumpster fire. New operating system demands 30% more effort to get less done each week. REO management is comprised of yes-men and led by a bully. Any criticism or dissention is met by discipline or termination.  I hope that HIG leadership realizes that this type of leadership has failed at all of this director's previous carriers and it will fail here. I fear that all the amazing talent here may get driven out before that happens.  As for the company as a whole, it is a pale comparison to the days of the last two CEOs. Just copying what other carriers do is not leadership. No vision or path. Focus is on expense ratio and sales, but UW mgt is too rigid to allow professionals to do their jobs. We are now looking under seat cushions for spare change to affect exp ratio.  Lay off all admin staff.  Send IT to Bangalore. Stop paying for cell phones for field staff.  Then wonder why morale is low and operations are inefficient.   Classic case of tripping over dollars to get to the pennies."
bad,"Manager and upper management were unethical and are now no longer with The Hartford.  Hours of up to 10 per day were expected.  The company stood firm on ethics and required numerous on line trainings on it.  Ironically, now both managers are gone...."
bad,"Terrible medical benefits, employees are under paid for the amount work require, would not recommend this place to anyone."
bad,this was by far the worst job ive ever had. extremely stressful and promised raise after graduating from training was never received. they promise opportunity for advancement but you have to stay in one position for a long time before you can find something you enjoy
bad,"I was sent an interest email from a recruiter at the Hartford/AARP call center here in Oklahoma City, OK in February 2013."
bad,Hartford was a great place to work and it turned upside down in a short period of time! The management is a joke and they don’t help you at all. People cheat and manipulate numbers and management doesn’t care because it makes the numbers that report to home office look better than they really are.

bad,"The Hartford used to be a great place to work. When I started everybody was always happy and smiling. Today, it is quite the opposite. A few years ago, the company outsourced most of their transactional work and went 100% phones in claims customer service and merged Personal Lines with Commercial Lines. HUGE MISTAKE AND MANAGEMENT DOES  NOT SEE THIS. They are all about numbers and watch your every move including bathroom breaks. The phone queues are non stop and you are tied to your desk. They also solicit the help of other departments to assist with phone calls and hardly ever hire to replace the turnover for the reps that run for the hills or get pushed out due to low stats. They don't see that as a problem. If that doesn't make you run after reading this, maybe this will... We recently began having huddles everyday to tell management how we are feeling. Are you sad, happy, angry, tired? No, really. This is their new thing!  So, I hope you see this and run as fast as you can. The Hartford is not a great place to work."
bad,"the training was ok they said it would be 3 months turned out to be longer. I had a computer that would freeze up. IT built a new one but the old laptop was better then the rebuilt one that I was given,"
bad,They don't take risk. Happy doing the same things they were doing 100 years ago. Very laid back and lazy attitude. Scared of new technologies. Not recommended.
bad,Grading systems for taking claims was inconsistent and unfair. Taking claims was a downer but the only job responsibility.
bad,This job requires a lot of training for very little pay and horrible benefits.
bad,Excellent company to work with. Great work space and excellent managers.  The salary is great and the benefits are outstanding.  I would recommend The Hartford to others for employment.
bad,"You should work here if you are single, have no friends or life. They claim to be about work life balance, although their actions speak differently. You will be underpaid and over worked. You are given PTO, but if you use it, you will be jeopardizing your job."
bad,Very difficult environment to work in. I was given a lot of opportunity to learn different products but no one felt like their job was ever safe. There was a concern with the WAH.
bad,"I enjoyed the work for the first few years I was there, and I liked some of the people, but the culture changed for the worse."

bad,Call center - limited restroom time - company concentrates on mistakes verses quality of work
bad,"Every Manager is different at the Hartford, some are cool some are complete jerks. Pay was fair but not as competitive as other companies. Don't expect to move up unless you do a lot of butt kissing."
bad,"Being at a satellite office, it's hard to advance. The Hartford tries to promote work life balance but it's only words. If you get your work done you are expected to do and help others."
bad,"My experience with The Hartford consisted of a lack of training a company lagging behind in technology , low pay and total disregard for their employees."
bad,Absolutely no outside conversation.  Call center environment.  You had to explain every restroom break and why it took a certain amount of time.  You absolutely could not step away from your work area without permission.
bad,"Local management demonstrates favoritism beyond comparison.  So long as you brown nose with the branch manager  i.e. buy Girl Scout cookies, fawn over his kids, you are recognized and promoted - regardless of performance.  "
bad,"Customer service rep at that job is an extremely hard and stressful job and the pay does not make up for it. The hours are also hard to have a life around as well. Poor management, really competitive to move up."

bad,"I worked in a high volume call center for the Hartford Personal Lines.  Scheduled breaks were never at the same time, made it difficult to plan your day and to get lunch."
bad,"There is no work/life balance at the Hartford. You may be paid well, but then they end up pushing you to your absolute limit and you realize that you should be earning far more than they pay. They ask so much for their employees but give so little back. They have a strict attendance policy, and if you exceed it, no matter what, you are automatically fired. If you have a life threatening medical condition, no one cares if you need to go to the hospital or have surgery, it's coming out of your absences, and if you don't have any left to use, you get fired. "
bad,"Nice to work from home but NCM workload high, requires more than a 40 HR work week to complete.  Customer satisfaction always trumps employee satisfaction. The company goal is to get the best customer survey reviews, not to keep employees feeling like they are valued. Some nurse's have half as many files as others but if questioned, this is due to company needs, not about how the company can make the workload more fair. All calls are recorded, e-mails and Skype conversations can be read by managers. If you want to be micromanaged then you won't mind this environment."
bad,"Overworked, stressed, management cares more about the bottom line, meeting metrics than employees well being. Hourly employee working overtime nevertheless not paid for it. Constast fear of being written up on warning for not meeting goals. Not worth the stress!"
bad,Majority of managers are stuck in their way and have been there for 15 plus years. Avoid the personal lines department like the plague and thank me later. Promotion opportunities are also bleak. Save yourself and look elsewhere.
bad,this position allowed me to transition and was not as expected from the interview to the job process. The leadership showed favoritism even though it was never stated.
bad,"With accepting the offer my position at The Hartford ( inbound customer service rep, group benefits ) I expected to learn and grow in a field that I was not much experienced in but the reputation of the company made me eager for a new challenge.  Training lasted three months which after the dust settled and true colors started to show, I was able to see the lack of care and inconsistency management and training coordinators provided. Other employees in the department were not willing to assist you and often had a terrible attitude when reaching out.  New hires were thrown onto the phones with little to no support other than reaching out to LNEX, Which depending on which representative you spoke to provided you their interpretation of what you should  relay to customers. Management is very cliquey and constantly invading the personal lives of employees, I recommend never sharing any tidbits of your personal life as that smallest things will it be used against you. Phone lines are out of control on most days due to these sites going down and customers calling in most times the sites would go down without any indication of when the issue would be resolved. Metrics are highly shoved down your throat most times were forced to sit in unattainable goal for yourself as a way to please your managers. Not what I expected from this fortune 500 company at all you’re definitely just another number and not a person."
bad,I actually work for another company and it was acquired by The Hartford. I saw my self confidence go down the hill after starting at The Hartford. Nothing was ever enough and there was a constant breath over my shoulders while working there.
bad,A lot of the elder employees were lax in their work and a lot of the responsibilities were left to newer hires. There was no adequate training and job shadowing did not provide enough experience for new hires to be left alone. Direct management rarely held meetings to update employees and most of us were left in the dark when new rules and policies were being implemented.
bad,"The people at the company are great and very hard-working and dedicated but I don't believe that management gives the employees that same sense of security and dedication to it's employees. Home office employees are treated much better than field office employees so there tends to be a disconnect. Other than that, they do compensate nicely and have nice incentive awards."
bad,I worked for a manager who retaliated against me for being right about something. She asked me if I thought I really fit in there and made every effort to make me feel like I was an outcast. I talked to several of my teammates which were producing similar numbers based on our production goals and they did not have the same experience as I did. We were all adjusting to a new claims handling model and we were all having issue but I was singled out.
bad,The company tries to portray itself as being all about making the employees better and allowing them to grow. They have unrealistically high expectations and ask a lot more of their employees than the support they provide.
bad,"The company is so concerned with political correctness, that advancement is proportioned to less qualified candidates.  19 out of 20 new hires are gone within a year.  They could be a great company again, but closing of facilities and certain divisions seem to suggest they are not heading in the right direction."
bad,If you are young and want an advanced career this is not the opportunity to make it happen. It is a good job to pay the bills for the time being.
bad,"This used to be a wonderful place to work. Unfortunately, the current senior management of the call centers have made work unbearable. Vacation time, though very abundant, is impossible to schedule. For managers, all are expected to work 60+ hours weekly, and that was mandated. I cannot in good conscience recommend this company to anyone, despite the adequate pay & abundant vacation time. It's not worth the soul sucking that is happening, especially at the OKC site."
bad,"I love my co-workers, however the department I'm in is very poorly managed. I am constantly having to chase down my team leader for things, senior leadership likes to play pass the buck, teams do not function as teams- they compete against each other.  My coworkers in my office are amazing, but there is a lot left to be desired in the rest of the company and claims as a whole."
bad,"No additional comments.I really have nothing more to share..........."

bad,The department and company direction and my bosses changed so many times I lost count. I was there when the company almost went under but stayed loyal. Worked very hard but could not keep up with the politics.
bad,No room for advancement. I took the job with a view to transfer into their claim department but their claims department never gave me an opportunity to interview despite multiple applications while I was an employee there.
bad,Absolutely no energy in the office.  Management does not exist.  Constant meetings and unable to give any direction.  No consistancy in procedures.  Nobody knows what they are doing nor who to go to.  Everyone just wings it.
bad,"If your not licensed they have a trainer who doesn't help you get your license then learn the system which they expect you to have down in 3 days, there were constant changes and I had a manager for 10 months while I was there and the rest of the time we had rotating managers with the last one being incredibly clueless to the insurance world and had us do most of his work the most enjoyable part of the job was your group huddles or what they call town hall, when corporate comes down and talks to the company then you can voice and speak with them about what is going on"

Technology is not industry standard and too many limited systems they work with that cause many customer service nightmares. Haven't fixed known issues in over a decade. . They put on a big show of how much they love their new employees but they are losing tenored reps right and left because they don't feel appreciated and aren't going anywhere in their careers."
bad,Lack of direction from the supervisor; very fast pace work environment; high stress level to complete new business turn around times; not a team environment.

bad,"the place  was like high school. In a bad way, lots of gossiping, improper relations among co workers, then very awkward environments  after the fact. Bosses didn't listen. Work volume over quality, then fixing other peoples mistakes. Sub-par benefits, considering the are an insurance company."
bad,They have no problem outsourcing employees to save a few bucks
bad,"Management here is always reacting and is very rarely if ever proactive in making a decision. They do not listen to their employees and get very turned off whenyou try and advise them of an improvement to the work process. They expect the world of their employees, but are not willing to pay for it and are not active in trying to help their employees succeed."
bad,"Hard pace work environment with poor work life balance. "
bad,"The position comes with great pay and amazing benefits, including a lot of paid time off.  However, positions are frequently understaffed and employees are faced with unreasonable work loads on a daily basis.  Management that does little to remove obstacles to success and while more than 40% of the company works remotely, management will not consider remote workers for advancement opportunities."
bad,"Great benefits! Work/life balance is a little non existent with the large workload you have to manage. Rewarded for doing your work timely and efficient with more work. Trickle-down management style, lower level managers answer questions with ""it is what it is"""
bad,Basically great job to help someone that wants to get into a professional environment but seemingly it is not a place for advancement.
bad,"Every day was an experience. My co-workers were great to work with, very friendly and willing to answer any questions you had."
bad,"The company may be rated one of the most ethical companies but that is only to the customer. Absolutely not to the employee. They layoff in small groups to stay out of the news, but that should change with the talks around reporting to the state by quarter instead."
bad,"Thought this would be a nice, laid back position. The company hires many older workers, and people that you might not see hired at other companies. The local people at work have been great, but all training is done remotely with management and trainers in CT. From the start they have a military type attitude. You have to pass multiple tests or you get fired. The training goes on forever. 3 1/2 months plus for a simple customer service job. The micro managing is the worst I've ever experienced. Unreasonable metrics including a customer survey where you have to score a 10 or it is considered failure. Pay is low. Quarterly bonuses offered if you meet the metrics, but the metrics are almost impossible to meet. Morale is bad. Not sure how this company wins the ethics award every year. They don't seem to treat their employees in an ethical way. Think twice before working at this company. They are old school with outdated systems and processes and authoritarian management style thinking they have to crack the whip to keep employees in line."
good,"My area has a fast paced and challenging work environment.  My manager is excellent at encouraging work-life balance and avoiding burn out or over-allocation of work assignments.  There are times when working over 40 hours may be necessary, but those times are infrequent.  There are many opportunities within The Hartford, and employees are encouraged to develop their skills both to support their current role and position themselves to move into other roles or other areas of the company.  Recent changes have made the dress code more casual, with a ""dress for your day"" focus that allows more jeans and other casual wear in the office (within reason, i.e. no shorts and tanks/t-shirts).  The Hartford has a strong focus on work/life balance.  The new benefits for 2020 have increased benefits around family life including enhanced fertility coverage, adoption benefits, increased parental leave.  They are also concerned about the impact of student loan debt on an employee's life so the company is introducing a benefit to help defray some of an employee's student loan debt.  I am too old to make use of these benefits, but this is a good step to becoming a more attractive employer to the younger employee pool.  The employees I work with have a wide variety of backgrounds and The Hartford is a diverse and inclusive employer in all areas.  I have worked for The Hartford for nearly 30 years, and there have been times when I would not have strongly recommended the company as an employer of choice.  That has changed, and I am happier working for The Hartford now than I have ever been.  I would"
bad,"They have a Big Brother culture, where how long you spend on the phone each day is more important than the amount of business you write.  Huge on micro-managing, and very low on employee recognition."
bad,Was promised career advancement or additional skills to add to repertoire.  Was never provided the opportunity to do anything but answer phones in 2+ yrs of work.
bad,Mgmt had unlimited meetings which never accomplished anything specific. The company liked to post individual job performance publicly for the entire offfice to see.
bad,They were always looking for ways to cut staff or take away any type of benefit in IT.  You had to provide your own phone for on call support.  On call was expected
bad,"Very little chance for advancement, they were not flexible with work hours.  Great compensation  and benefits, also this is a company that really cares about volunteering"
bad,I did not want to leave.  Literally 60% of the Houston workforce has resigned due to management decision that consistent come to find out were not properly vetted.  These mistakes have put a tremendous burden on the adjuster requiring extended works hours to reach goals that are unreasonable.  Adjuster's are penalized for mistakes made by others that were out of the adjuster's realm of control.  This blanket accountability policy has cause me to loose bonus after bonus... resulting in minimal raises...while being a top producer.  I value working hard & smart.... I have been loyal to a fault.   But i cannot continue to LIGHT MYSELF ON FIRE TO KEEP THE HARTFORD WARM.  I wish The Hartford Insurance Group much success... I simply cannot allow myself to be burned in the process...while upper management tries to figure it out.  When a company show you who they really are....BELIEVE THEM  !
bad,"Whenever I asked my manager (of almost four years) a question he 90% of the time had to go ask other managers the answer."
bad,New management has unrealistic expectations regarding work load .  High pressure during major catastrophic weather events exacerbated by lack of foresight in need of personnel.
bad,day is very structured very little freedom. most employee work remotely. metric are based on call times more so than quality. processes can be very ambiguous
bad,"Lack of structure, policy forms, depth of knowledge for all territories cripple productivity."
bad,"Daily meetings were focused on primarily production and how to push direct reports to produce more with an increased turnaround time.  The content of the work demands a high level of quality to ensure compliance with regulatory standards but balancing those demands with the increased production expectations was very challenging.  My direct reports were very advanced and experienced analysts and were in fact manger-level employees.  "
bad,"Management is easy going but dont know how to manage, claim files are everywhere, turn over is high, expectations are unchievable, ability to work from home is a plus but its hard to keep up with your desk"
bad,"slammed with call after call, micro managed, there is no enjoyable part of the job the work is too cumbersome for the pay, and the turn over rate is ridiculous"
bad,"Very conservative company, trying to bring itself into the modern time. It's a typical call center with typical micro-mangers and unrealistic expectations"
bad,I have been working in this company via vendor for almost 8 years.
bad,Claims. When the market goes up everyone gets a bonus. When the market goes down - layoffs.
bad,a typical day at work
bad,Often felt insignificant due to the size of the department. Very limited room for growth and they made me work for a minimum of 2 years before I could even apply for another position within the company.

bad,"The Hartford has been the hardest organization to step into and be a part of as a new employee. It is filled with overwhelming amount of cumbersome processes with very tenured employees that created them.  "
bad,"The Hartford pays well, has good benefits and a good work-life balance. However training is lacking, and there is little support from management to try new things and be innovative. They talk a good game about having a progressive culture, but bottom line is that it's a typical conservative insurance environment."
bad,Learned that customer service in call center with unattainable metrics was something that could be corrected if management took the initiative to make changes
bad,There's no work/life balance. It's not a happy work environment. The stress level is always on a 10. It doesn't appear that upper management values their employees.
bad,The hartford has great benefits and decent pay.For the area I live in you definitely are not make low pay but for the work you do you are under paid.  When it comes to management/leadership they are not the best. They have high turner over due to terrible work culture and all of the work is passed on to all of the employees who are left on top of the already high work load.
bad,"The company lacks structure for facilitating job success and individual development. Management is well-intentioned and generally supportive, but the experience level is low."
bad,"Expect to have too much work to complete with constant changing expectations. Inept people promoted, especially if you are buddies with the upper management."
bad,intense fast paced job where your told that you will have time to get adjusted to the learning curves yet limited employee resources do not allow time for assistance if your not a fast learner.
bad,"I have been in the loss control Dept for the past ten years and had hopes to end up spending my career there. However, new risk control leadership has changed that view. An operating system was implemented that adds an extra ten hours a week was implemented without any consultation with the field staff. Morale is the lowest I have ever seen in any company I have worked.  RCO leadership is consists of yes-men and a leader who refuses to believe he can be wrong. The new culture of micromanagement, long hours, and contempt for field staff is here to stay. They no longer pay for cell phones or Internet service for field staff.  Very sad as my team and manager are great to work with as well as my underwriters, clients, and claims people. "
bad,ok place to work. Salary and bonus are below average. Work life balance is flexible. Had some great managers and had some horrible managers.
bad,"Working for the Hartford is challenging and not always in a positive sense. There is a high level of customer service and for the most part the job is enjoyable. The difficulty in working there arises in the lack of support. Adjusters carry very high case loads and have very little avenue to obtain support for more minor functions, many of them provide functions of two to three of their counterparts. Service expectations are becoming unattainable as the scoring requirements are near to perfection. Adjusters struggle to get their work done in a timely manner and within expectations."
bad,"Not the greatest place to work. Unattainable standards, difficult to move up. Management plays favorites"
bad,"Most Co-workers are wonderful to work with. Vacation Time is Great! Medical Benefits are so/so, not as good as previous years or other companies. Company management changes are too constant - Most Managers don't even know the job, only by book reference."
bad,"I worked for the company for 17 years. I started in customer service and progressed to my position in Home Office. For the first few years  I never heard of anyone losing their job. About 5 years in layoffs came. 30 people were laid off with no warning in one day. When that happens, it means everything changes. Your responsibilities change, your boss could change. They moved us from office to office without approaching any of the employees who may have a live/work balance with the change."
bad,This is not a place for working mothers.  They do not promote a good work/life balance.  Leaving for a sick child is difficult.  Hartford micro manages every detail
bad,"I worked doing inside property and casualty sales for AARP specific clients. We adhered to call metrics and followed a strict schedule."
bad,Very poor/incomplete training provided to those working in the call center environment.   Employees are put on live calls with no idea how to respond to the questions/services being requested as information was not covered in training.
bad,"You have to have thick skin to deal with the customers.  Enjoyed the co workers.  The company gives you a lot of work to do, you have to be able to multi task and meet high expectations.  "
bad,I believe the Hartford is a good company and with the right manager could be a good place to work.  The stress level is over the top and unless you are a CA resident the hours are well over 40 per week.  Salary does not take the hours into consideration.

bad,"management failed to protect its employees when treated poorly by people from other companies, no room for advancement, management was not good. however, The employees were all good people."
bad,"The Hartford is a good company but there isnt suppport from management. Micro Management is a huge issue, The training is good but there isnt positive feedback from direct managers like you would hope."
bad,"The people you work with for the most part are friendly. There are times where the company is not so organized and there are a lot of questions pertaining to rules that are unanswered, It is hard to advance there unless you have a degree, Certain health issues are not accepted and will get you fired. Great pay but very stressful."
bad,"Working for The Hartford can be good as long as you're not a rep in the call center. If you happen to be in the call center you will experience a company that lies to you. That are unable to handle it's own call volume. That cares very little for you or your input regarding problems with the work environment. You will take back to back calls all day long. You will be monitored by management if you happen to take a minute or two longer break you will be called out on it. If you stop taking calls to correct a file for longer than a minute or to you will be called out on it."
bad,"I loved my job and the team i was working with. However, upper level management wasn't supportive of the quality assurance team and made it appear that ""we were the bad guys."" Claim procedures were changed daily and was difficult to follow. Many employees voiced concern and burn-out.  When I departed in 2010 there was allot of confusion and dissatifaction."
bad,Did not enjoy my time with this company.  Terrible management!!!
bad,"This company struggles with keeping their top talent. They have unreasonable requirements of their employees. Outdated computer programs, managers that play favorites, and an ever tightening budget."
bad,Working on the phones servicing customers. Very little time away from the phones.
bad,My experience in my early years at The Hartford was very positve. The overal culture and HR policies were very employee friendly. The atmosphere was incredible as well as many fellow employees experienced a high level of happiness in the work environment.
bad,"Former CEO pillaged the company, now retired. New CEO is great but the organization is plagued with ineptness - horrible pricing decisions, out of touch with the market place, endless bureaucracy, silo'd decision-making."
bad,Very Stressful The customer service scoring was done unfairly. My coworkers were excellent but some in management wasn't. The hardest part of the job was so many people involved in the claim process. But you would be the only one held responsible when the customer complained.
bad,"The pay was decent, but they had a rating system for bonuses and raises. you were ranked 1 to 5 in your unit and everyone had to be rated one of the numbers. More and more demands and berating management (upper)"
bad,"The benefits and pay are very good for a call center job.  If you are willing to put up with constant notifications being sent to customers that you are not told about and old systems that management doesn't seem to want to change, then you will enjoy the job."
bad,"I think The Hartford is a great place to work and when i first started HFP it was great and than we had new management and management turnover and HFP has gone down hill. I still like The Hartford, however not HFP."
bad,"I am unsure of what the culture is like I have not worked there in a long time, While i was there the culture was very cut throat. I did make a lot of friends there ."
bad,"Great first job to learn corporate environment, company culture, products, and customer service with clients and agents in a fast paced culture."
bad,"I enjoy my job overall, however this job is very high demand and I feel that not being 'perfect' is blown out of proportion and could definitely use some improvement in assisting their employees to succeed rather than emphasizing on everything that an employee needs to improve on without recognition of things done well. Co-workers are great. The work environment is good, however I feel that a lot of employees feel the same way and there could be some improvement in management and how things are handled. The most enjoyable part of my job are the people. I am very outgoing and being able to have constant interaction with claimants and co-workers is great. The hardest part of my job is just simply living up the the expectations. There is more than enough work to go around and a fast turn around time on employees is my department, sometimes making it difficult to manage the work load. I have learned so much from this job experience and feel I have grown in my career."
bad,I hated it! You are just a number and managers do not care about anyone but themselves. Felt like I was walking on egg shells everyday. The job is super stressful and they track your every move. From going to the bathroom to lunch breaks. The pay is horrible and the times are extensive. Hours are from 11-9. You must keep your metrics down or you will get in trouble.
bad,"Great company to work for. Stressful, but rewarding. A lot of great managers working hard to set you up for success. But there are some issues with workload and understaffing."

bad,"A typical day for me was answering inbound calls, and quoting potential customers on home and auto insurance. More of a call center atmosphere, which I didnt necessarily enjoy. The co-workers were a lot of fun. Hardest part of the job was the repetitiveness off the dailys work. The best part of the job, was the benefits the company offered."
bad,"This job, is good for those with no prior experience. It will prep you for the future rush of customer service over the phone, but I would not look at this job as a permanent station."
bad,Overall company was fine.  Looking for a new challanging position.
bad,Various positons in sales ans service. Included audit position and other supervisory functions.
bad,"The Hartford Financial Services (HFS) is a division of The Hartford. And, that being said, just like AIG, HFS has hurt The Hartford overall. The people here are wonderful, hard-working and dedicated to the client. Upper management has been focused on the shareholder. Thus the classic design for miss-management! For years now, senior management has played musical chairs. Each year brought new initiatives, new matrices, new scalability, new acronyms, and new confusion. When the dust settled, senior management did the proverbial “pat on the back” and started the process all over again. In the end, the employees where void of direction, cost of capital had spiraled out of control and shareholders had been left with the short end of the stick. It should be no wonder why the stock price is well below book value."
bad,"Unless you are in a clique or are pulled under a manager's wing upon starting, it is very tough to advance. I thought that my work ethic and working 65 hours a week would get me ahead, it did not."
bad,"they respond on time in terms of giving you updates on the interview. "
bad,Good Experience at The Hartford. Tough work life balance. Company loosing business every quarter to competition. Cost cutting is pretty much the norm here.
bad,"it was awesomeworking for the hartford, had to have a lot of patience with the customers that call, but i really liked it."
bad,"The Hartford was a great job to have, but the advancement opportunities are few and far between. The managers aren't top quality and make bad decisions a lot of the time. The upper management can be ruthless. The time off the company gives is the best, the benefits were fair but the dental plan was terrible. The company has been outsourcing its labor force for years, so there's no safety or security in any job there. There is a lot of stress to make your sales and service goals."
bad,"A great job, but due to the sale, there was no future because the finance team was not hired by Sedgwick CMS. The Hartford is currently going through a Financial Transformation/Reorganization (aka: outsourcing to India)."
bad,"The Hartford started out as a great company when I first started there. However, it has steadily declined in the last year. The company continually loses business and thus downsizes on employees. Things are constantly changing at the workplace and the workers are rarely told what changes are being made until they are already in place."
bad,This was a miserable place for me. This job mad me severely depressed and stressed out. Worst job I ever had. A complete nightmare. The work was unbearable and barely any training or support. I was set up for failure right when I walked in the door. Just a terrible job overall. Stay far away!
bad,"In this role, accountable for developing HR solutions designed to meet specific business objectives with a focus on employee satisfaction and staff retention; leadership development and executive coaching; organizational development and strategic planning; recruiting and hiring of top talent; and as change management expert, continually evaluate how cultural and process changes impact operational objectives and the needs of a diverse call center of 600 and remote workers."
bad,"fast paced, heavy work loads minimal growth.....same job day to day can get a little mundane at times. you can work from home on occasion if you meet your metrics."
bad,It was a good place to work and had lots of opportunities for people to choose from. They were willing to work with you to find positions. Especially good for developers.
bad,"The management in short sighted.  The management is strictly numbers driven.  Customer service is not a priority, simply rush the customer off the phone."

bad,they fire you for medical and health related reasons. many times they just are worried about quotas and not that you are doing your best.
bad,"Typical work day would consist of 3-4 days in the office taking inbound sales calls from AARP members regarding auto and home insurance.  1-2 days in the field selling the Hartford product to brokers. I learned all aspects of the orginization, including training new hires, coaching new hires while in our Sales Academy on the Hartford Sales Model. I also was in management. The hardest part of the job was the flexibility.  The job consisted of 7.5 hours on the phone each day.  There was no time to take a breather after lengthy calls or multiple calls back to back. I really enjoyed the generation of clients I was able to work with and customize policies to fit their needs."

bad,Fast paced call center. Received inbound phone calls. Partnered with AARP.
bad,"I found it very hard to meet, maintain or even exceed the metrix they had in place."
bad,The Hartford was my lease favorite place to work. Management does not treat their employees well and employee morale is low.
bad,the company itself was great. the training was thorough and extensive. however the managers only care about numbers and will put much stress on you and bring you down to make you try to quit incase they feel you will not make it. even as i was a top performer they always wanted more and was always trying to stress us out to meet the manager goals to make them look good. too much competition between the managers
bad,"The company tries to reach the #1 status at any cost.  The stress level is high for maintaining the matrix quotas which change frequently.  "
bad,"Inbound customer call center. Same thing daily. Like any call center calls are monitored and time is watched closely. Advancement is based on performance. Management is available at almost any time. The training is terrible. Touches briefly on the most common points and skips others completely. They consider ""adult learning"" as you should figure it out. Quality reviews reflect lack of training rather than lack of effort. Can be frustrating. Co-workers are incredible. Benefits are tops! The schedules and pay-scale don't seem very honorable as the training groups just entering employment with no tenure or seniority are working M-F 8-4:30 and making more annually."
good,"Extremely busy"
good,"There was little feedback from my manager. Upper management stayed out of middle management concerns and did not act as if they cared the front line employees were inundated with work. Emails and voicemails were maxed out. They will give you food so you stay at work during lunch hours. Customers will act as if their lives have ended if you go on vacation or are sick when other adjusters can help them. Many people worked off the clock. They don't drug test. You will probably have to do drugs to end up staying here and then wont be eligible for hire anywhere else. I did have some very nice co-workers; otherwise, it is like any other office environment."
good,"I have a supervisor that makes work difficult. She favors certain employees, and treats others on her team with disdain. My supervisor started out acknowledging everyone has different personalities and then acted as if everyone should respond the same in meetings and in day-to-day interactions."
good,I can't speak for Hartford in general. I work at a remote location that is like a foster child to the big brother Hartford. Our office is on the brink of extinction.
good,"Applied for customer service, asked several times in extensive traing of simply customer service, then forced into upsales and pressured daily. Manager was awesome, their manager is horrible. I was basically told I didnt matter because I didn't sell anything the previous day. Was also told to go in my car to pump milk"
good,"Micro management, hard to get days off, you have to bid on vacation days you are at the bottom so you will never have the days off you would like. Poor training."
good,"Rude customers, rude employees.  Managers were not caring or willing to assist. Training was laughable. High turnaround as the model for sales was not successful."
good,My area was very close knit so coming in from the outside was a challenge.  Unfortunately the director had leadership issues and flew off the handle.  She had been there for over 30 years and no one would challenge her.  This made the work environment not very hospitable.  What it did for me was teach me how to adapt and I learned what type of leader I didn't want to be.
good,It was a nice place to work and the benefits were decent. The management and effective training was lacking. It is not a place where there is much room to grow. Most people move on to other companies.

good,"1.The salary was great."
good,"Mixed reviews on performance one manager told me that I was doing great job, and the next day got in trouble for not meeting expectations. Being friends with certain management members gets along further than you think.... Just don't expose it, or else you will be fired due to back feedback on not bring a team player."
good,Only upper management would get raises. Never got to get any overtime. But they had the ice cream machine near the upper management and we were not allowed to buy anything from the machine.
good,The Hartford has great brand recognition however they do not have competitive rates and have been very inconsistent over the years. A lot of change in management as well
good,There was a lot of overtime involved. It was nice to have but every weekend got really old. Not much time for family when you work 7 days a week 10 hours a day.
good,I'm at the Hartford temping and handling a lot of work only to find out my coworker gets more than me and we are doing the same job. not happy but I am happy to be working.
good,it's hard for black people to get off the phones unless you in the military or a kiss a?? to your manager.  They do not want you to get licensed.  This is a sloppy work environment
good,"Changing procedures without any training.  No back up from front line managers.  The pay is not quite up to competitors, and lead management made from of employees religious objections to working on Sundays."
good,I manage a portfolio of projects for Enterprise Risk Management and identify areas for process improvement.  I am also the lead financial person within our group.  I am a relationship liaison between our Enterprise Risk Management Organization and our business partners.
good,a typical day would include taking continuous calls outside of your breaks and lunch.  Management was focused on results but not always willing to provide proper coaching to help the team succeed.
good,"Servicing an average of 50 calls per day, from partner agents and insured’s in regard to existing policies. Processing endorsements for Small Businesses and some Middle Market type policies to ensure the policies are covering the business appropriately. Extensive training with processing verbal or written requests on Commercial Property & Liability, Workers Compensation, and Commercial Auto policies within a given time frame to meet insured’s needs. Fielding high risk based questions and concerns to underwriters, premium adjustment concerns to audit, and loss concerns/work comp medical payments to claims. This role requires understanding direct notice of cancellations, non-renewals, payroll minimums, inclusion/exclusions on workers compensation policies, vehicle suspensions and minimum premium policies."
good,"not a great place to work.  No real advancement oppurtunity unless you are a ""favorite""."
good,Whatever you do don't work in the SEA Legal Department.  The workplace is very territorial and little if any help from Management.  The manager is never there and does not listen.  If you are a hard worker you will go unnoticed.  
good,Productivity a must in position held. Not easy to participate in extra activities without being rushed. Team Managers not supportive of most employees; favorites shown alot.
good,I enjoyed the people that I worked with but was never able to advance beyond a sales coach after multiple attempts. The management was good and the training was excellent.
good,"While working at 'The Hartford,'I'd have to say that I realize the corporate culture is all the same. Regardless of what kind of smile they have on their face, it'll be exactly as it was at many other big companies. While I have to say the training teacher was amazing as were my co-workers. This place (for being around 200+ years) just doesn't seem to know it's head from it's elbows. My first boss was really nice and attentive, while the one i received after working from home left a lot to be desired. They tend to show some care for their reps, but only just so. You get little assistance, many think they know everything, rules change constantly, and any mess up on their part will result in little to no communication on how you should deal with it. It's ""pay for performance"" but those who are new after you, still get paid more than you do regardless of how you do. It makes absolutely no sense, and they hire tons of people because everyone leaves pretty much within a year. Also, the relocation process is an absolute headache and you may not even get the job after going through all the steps that was to guarantee you said job. I wanted to like the place, but like many others, it's just not for me."
good,"A very corporate culture. Clicky management, and it's more about who you know vs your work contribution. Benefits are some of the worst in the industry as well."
good,"Because management often revolves, there is little time for them to get to know processes and constructively contribute to changes.  Pay is awarded on a tier-basis that feels out-dated,"
good,"Great place to work, pay is not great Lots of great people but overall, a type of high school atmosphere which can be frustrating. Culture is changing there, but the pace of that change is slow."
good,"My area has a fast paced and challenging work environment.  My manager is excellent at encouraging work-life balance and avoiding burn out or over-allocation of work assignments.  There are times when working over 40 hours may be necessary, but those times are infrequent.  There are many opportunities within The Hartford, and employees are encouraged to develop their skills both to support their current role and position themselves to move into other roles or other areas of the company.  Recent changes have made the dress code more casual, with a ""dress for your day"" focus that allows more jeans and other casual wear in the office (within reason, i.e. no shorts and tanks/t-shirts).

good,"In my case I was straight out of college and did not have many offers. I was able to advance through the company quickly  and have various roles. It is a typical corporate environment. Those that can make friends and maintain relationships and don't mind keeping their opinions to themselves tend to do well. Also, do not ever say no to anything. Once you do that you are done! I had a few good years and would still be there if I had better management. When I was there, there was a major disconnect between those on the front of the line and those in higher positions. I literally almost stoked out of there. However, everyone is different. If you can get in, get out and network you will be fine."
good,doesn't seem to let claims adjusters make lateral moves within the company. my immediate manager was great. corporate leadership seemed out of touch. The pay was really good though.
good,"The work balance and processes (at that time, I cannot speak for now) were wonderful.  There was a perfect work flow and balance.  The team environment was wonderful and there was always help if needed."
good,"The management in the WC department needs work.  Most of the time your team leader is in meetings so there is no time to help or guide their groups.  The workload is extreme!  Handling 185 - 200 claims consistently.  You are basically trying to put out fires all day instead of actually being able to think deeper into your plan of action for your cases.  The company seems itself seems like it would rather look for new opportunities to expand on some random piece of claims than concentrate on their employees.  The WC department has also been understaffed since day 1 that I had started.  Management always lets us know they have openings posted, when you go and check them online, they are no where to be seen.  Sad..."
good,"Company as a whole had a lot to offer fun and lots of opportunities to learn. Became well versed in AGILE methodologies and planning, Task management and development. My coworkers are very resourceful and easygoing. The only drawback I was told going in this was a contract to hire opportunity. Unfortunately, the MIS Manager/Scrum Master brought me into the office and informed me I was only going till the second week of September at the most due to budget. Had I known from the offset, probably would have turned down the contract as I did have other offers at the time. This may change however I feel uneasy at the whole month to month thing so I rather start looking now."
good,"Overworked, underpaid, under appreciated. Extremely high level of turnover within the department so it is always understaffed, which means the adjusters all have more work than they can handle. Very stressful job with minimal reward."
good,The demands of this employer required working 24 hours a day. They had high expectations of their employee and made them accountable and they took ownership of their work product.
good,Not a fun position of taking inbound calls all day with minimal support from management.
good,"Productive Work Environment. High paced, and high quality oriented with emphasis on customers."
good,"Although The Hartford does have good benefits.  There are several areas that take away from the peace of mind that good benefits bring.  1)  It is sad to say, but The Hartford values numbers more that the safety and well being of their employees.  2)  There is a tremendous amount of miscommunication among managers and non-management staff. 3) The Hartford is very pro-management.  The actions of managers are placed on a higher level than non-management staff."
good,The best part is the recognition when goals are met. Via compensation but as well as acknowledgement from manager and peers.
good,This is an average call center job where you are micro managed. It's not that hard but you just have to be resourceful and use the information The Hartford provides you.
good,Need a day off...not gonna happen. Need to leave early to get your kid from work....nope. they fired all their sales staff to cut their commissions program payout in half and rehire all new people starting them at 5k less a year. You need a permanent smile on your face and be willing to lick shoes in order to advance.
good,"Call center agent: full time remote employee. Was tied to phone for at least 8 hours a day filing claims for customers. Very repetitive work, same types of calls, same scenarios, same questions. Fast paced, not staffed appropriately."
good,Management practices micro management. Lack of peers collaboration. The hardest part of the lack of work-life balance. The most enjoyable part of the job is ability to work remotely.
good,"This is your typical 9-5 job.  You come in, do your work and leave.  Nothing really incredible stands out besides they're time off.  They do offer generous time off."
good,Management has changed quite frequently over the past six months. I have had 3 different direct supervisors and two different second level leaders. It makes getting to know your leadership difficult and does not breed confidence in the organization.
good,"The company has a willingness to strive to be better, but the amount of hours expected have been too high.  Being salaried and working for them makes your hourly rate seem miniscule."
good,"My area has a fast paced and challenging work environment.  My manager is excellent at encouraging work-life balance and avoiding burn out or over-allocation of work assignments.

good,"Good place/company to work.  Our territory was always an underchiever.  That made the big boss in no. Hollywood permanently suspicious."
good,"Hartford will take the time to train you, but compensation is comparable to call centers not insurance agency.  They have had to restructure their business model numerous times in 5 years and has almost gone bankrupt several times.  They seem to be on solid ground now.  Their focus on Political correctness and social opinions of the day sometimes detracts from there business focus.  There is a time and place for everything and they seem to get tangled in the details.  Overall the training and support makes them worth working for."
good,"I worked at The Hartford in phone sales for home and auto insurance.  If you're into sales it's good because there are no outbounds, but you are tethered to the phone for call after call.  It's very, very repetitive. Hey, it's a call center.  You are expected to make a good amount of sales, but the only way you make extra money is sell a ton.  Just meeting goal doesn't get you much.  The problem is their pricing not competitive at all, and their underwriting is extremely restrictive on who they will accept. They coach you to sell on benefits instead, but it's very hard to convince someone to buy a policy that is hundreds more than their current one.  I had good vacation, but I had to use a good portion of it on the weekends because I had to work every Sunday.  They are open 7 days a week, and you will have to work some weekends at least.  Advancement is tough unless you're a superstar.  It's easier to make lateral moves, but what's the incentive in that?"
good,"this was an ok place to start a career, but they didn't seem at all interested in providing opportunities to advance, and didn't seem to value their employees."
good,Experienced may years of different workplace cultures and enjoyed learning more about the insurance industry. The management used to be great but recently has been through many different changes creating a not so friendly and comfortable work place environment.
good,"company with a great reputation, but AARP department is difficult to work in. constant internal change, and many customers are awful to work with . have to have thick skin and a lot of patience"
good,"Very busy as I was hired for the tax season. Various work assigned on a day to day basis, mostly telephone work receiving incoming calls from customers."
good,Worked hand in hand with brokers and clients regarding their retirement vehicles. Participated in the mentorship program. As well as including the company's customer strategy where I worked closely co-workers and upper management to implement innovative ideas for the company.
good,"No leadership, expectations too high. No jobs description and training is non existent if it is not on a webinar. You are on your own to learn as you go.  No room for advancement, raises are minimal."
good,Provided analysis for commutations and contracts with reinsurers.
good,I was a Claim Processor in the office in Farmington. A typical day involved adjusting small Auto & Homeowners claims. I learned how to adjust claims here. Management varied greatly from excellent to poor. My co-workers were some of the most dedicated I ever worked with. The hardest part of the job was the sheer volume of work we were expected to do. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with my co-workers.
good,"Learned territory management, financial objectives, commercial insurance, with hard work and perseverance, my advice is learn from all the tools given."
good,Relaxed dress code and good company to get your foot in the door. Pay is not comparable within the industry but the work environment is relaxed depending on your department.
good,Assisting other departments daily and unable to focus on current  daily role. No overtime offered when covering other departments to complete immediate workload.
good,"HIG is a big company, but my group in particular had a nepotism issue.  At one point during my tenure, my SVP's son was my direct manager.  It created a toxic work environment.  At the same time, HIG offers great education and training, top-notch work-life balance, and has without a doubt the best Wellness Program I have ever seen."
good,"The culture was very cliquish when I was there, if you weren't a favorite of management, you were a second class citizen that got no respect.  I hope it's different now"
good,Good company. Very behind the times with technology systems and methods are very out dated and frustrating. Turnover and retention suffers from this its the biggest negative.

good,"Headquarters is in CT and the groups in Charlotte tend to be isolated from decisions made in CT. "
good,The job was great for 8 hours spent in a cubicle. Great contests for earning cash. Opportunity to work from home is available. they have a great staff that trains you telecommuters
good,Great opportunity to gain experience and then transition to a competitor.  Management needs to focus more on execution and less on image.  At one point we were forced to participate with an internal social network that took time from performing our claims duties.
good,"Claims Management team lacking supervisory skills, no flexibility, terrible work hours. Micro-managed to the minute and not enough pay for the job. Benefits good."
good,"n/a n/a n/a n/a very little to say about the position.......Very controlling. "
good,"Jobs were ""promised"" that never came to fruition. I worked a 6 month project and was not paid a penny for all the time and effort I put into the project.  As a result, I lost out on other opportunities that could have made a big change in my life."
good,"You interact with 40-80+ customers per day. A very sedentary job, but the managers are supportive and laid back. I'd say customer service rep retention is their main focus and therefore there is job security as long as you hit your metrics."
good,"Working as a call center service representative at the Hartford is fast-paced and certainly never boring.  However, it is also not encouraging for work-life balance despite their very generous paid-vacation time package.  The company stance/handling of the call center business has changed significantly in the time since I started and, while I was once proud to work there and felt like a valued employee, we have become warm bodies with high expectations that never end.  Some of the floor managers are fantastic and do their best to build our skills and knowledge but the corporate entity works against them many times.  Other departments in the company do not seem to suffer the same issues as the call center for whatever reason.  The company is rightly known for ethics in business and giving donations to humanitarian causes."
good,This company has been in business for over 200 years and let us know that we were going to be closing the Okc office and that we could find another job if needed.
good,"Pro's of working for The Hartford: industry standard pay and benefits, decent work life balance."
good,"In my department (Small Commercial), you must be willing to put in hours upon hours, just for management to accept you as an equal. Cut-throat environment, to say the least."
good,"Great Benefits and PTO. However, standard corporate culture that makes it difficult to move up or at least receive compensated promotions. Company has also just changed their metric culture and transferred to new system which has caused numerous negative changes."
good,Large caseloads with tight restrictions on time to achieve timeliness goals. Work/life balance is difficult to maintain given amount of work needed to complete in order to be timely.
good,"Take 60-80 calls daily, assist with questions regarding billing for auto and home insurance, as well as provide policy holders with an explanation of their policy coverage's."
good,Used to work for this company and left due to no room for advancement and strict guidelines and policies being enforced weekly making it harder for the insureds. Employee morale noticeably getting negative among the majority.
good,"The office is small, but the people are amazing. If you're looking to start your insurance career this is a good place to begin. Management is pretty involved in day to day aspects of the office and communication is open."
good,I am a licensed underwriter and a typical day at work is reviewing and analyzing information to decide whether to provide insurance for these risks. As an underwriter I am the main link between our company and the insurance agent. I enjoy my job due to the fast pace and I'm also very analytical and can multi-task in a slow or fast pace environment. I am looking for a position that will allow me to utilize my skills and allow me to grow professionally.

good,"Overall the job was great. The only complaint i have is the it was all cold calling and the list given to us were generated using older data thus not allowing our team to use current market data to its fullest potential. The computer system could definitely use an upgrade as their current method of data input and data retrieval is very arcane and needs to be updated,"
good,"Depending on what my job function at the time was, it was a customer focused company working with AARP members. I  had worked in customer service taking inbound calls in a call center. "
good,"My typical day was working with the customer base to determine their information needs and develop an efficient automated process.  I spent time working directly with the customer to determine their requirements and then provide timely and accurate solutions.  Many times it would require working with many teams where information was captured and stored and determine how to extract, transform and then either load or report on the results."
good,I work in a call center environment. The company is solid but if you are looking for good pay and advancement this is not the place.  This is  the only company I know who base your performance on how long you talk on the phone and base the quality of your work on whether or not you rvw'd notes before answering the clients question and whether or not  you asked another rep if they are  transfering  a call to you .. like come on.. you can do everythng correct in terms making the correct financial decisions yet get a low score just because you forgot to say thank you. They are a walking contradiction.. they want you to make the client feel warm and fuzzy but do so in under 5 minutes.  As for wage.. don't expect to make 40k even after 6 years on the job.  The only redeeming thing about working her is that you can work from home which was more or less a cost cutting measure vs a perk.
good,"Typical day would begin by logging into systems and then beginning to work. some meetings and a productive environment with great co-workers. Learned that communication is key in most jobs and how to use several computer systems including Siebel, MS Office w/Outlook, Word and some Excel. Also learned the procedures required to resolve the issues associated with the job done by the Workers' Compensation Bureau Criticism Team which was to resolve non-compliance issues and to have fines reduced or rescinded for both the company and the insured. The hardest part of the job was computer systems problems and getting those fixed and the most enjoyable was the work itself and my co-workers. The work also allowed you to establish contacts and working relationships outside the company (EX. with the Workers' Compensation bureaus in each state)  in order to get job done and teamwork allowed us to reach any goals set for us as a team."
good,"Noticed that there was a high amount of turnover.  Company was very results driven, and that's what mattered."
good,"a lot of promise initially not so much anymore. hours and shift time stays the same, no nights or weekends, paid holidays. advancement seems more based on who your friends with than tenure or ability and knowledge."
good,"The company continues to try and transition with the ever changing insurance job market, but does not effectively do so."
good,I learned a great deal about myself and growing at the Hartford. It is a shame that they were not able to realize the value of their employees.
good,Management does not have a clue and makes bad decisions constantly.
good,The Hartford is a well known company that has a contract with AARP. The Hartford offered insurance for AARP members who were Medicare eligible. I look at the company as business is business. they really did not care about there employees or clients. They expected you to sale memberships and rush elderly people off the phone. the calls were allotted at no more than 5 minute increments and if you went over you were penalized. All calls were monitor(supposedly) yet I never see the company change to benefit the elderly. They allowed United Health Care to dictate what we were to do or there contract would not be renewed. The guidelines we were to follow was outlandish and quota we had caused many people to lose there job and we change the next day. Not a great company to work for and I would never purchase the insurance.
good,"I do a variety of tasks. "
good,"The Hartford has many remote employees, and that is a great thing! The only issue with that model is that actual advancement, while possible in a remote environment, is not as attainable as one would think. The real obstacle that one faces is that there simply isn't face time with coworkers, management, or higher ups. This makes getting the word out for a great employee much more difficult, and tough act to balance with regular work duties."
good,"Typical day is very busy with challenges to face and Impediments to solve."
good,The major issue at The Hartford is their systems do not work properly which makes it difficult to complete your work. They launch new procedures and update systems even though testing has shown improvements are needed. Each time they make a change to the system it adds to the procedure. So what may have taken one step to do now takes 4. Constant error messages while in systems. They hold so many meetings it's hard to get work done. It's difficult to move up in your role.
good,"In the beginning of my employment I would say this was a great company to work for, then middle to upper management changed and the whole company policy changed. The new structure was very fast paced."
good,"The days are very similar, since it's a call center with heavy data entry and customer service skills. Not much room for advancement, very low raises, unfair expectations on sales, commissions were rarely paid out"
good,"The Hartford was an excellent place to work.  However, when our department was acquired by UHG, the environment changed dramatically in a downward motion."

good,"Claims adjuster, investigated auto and homeowners claims from start to finish.  The claim load was manageable."
good,"Company went through a culture change when I arrived about two years back.  It has not been the same since, and turnover is now through the roof.  I learned more about an office setting than I wanted to (politics), but it did teach me good values and to stay self motivated."
good,The Hartford was a decient place to work.  The work load was too much.  You were expected to work from home when you were not in the office.  The pay was fair.
good,Took incoming calls from participants and brokers about 401ks.Sometimes being tied to a headset and phone after a while was boring. Brokers can be a pain to deal with at times. When the stock is going down you have participants calling about them losing their money. So there was good calls and bad. Educating people about there 401ks was the best part. Learned to be careful where I invest my money.
good,"Process all lines of business based on policy claims on a daily basis that included investigation to get the fact and details of the loss, determining coverage and settlement or denial of the claim.  Supervisors were very supportive, and  patient, co-workers were very helpful.  The hardest part of the job was the volume of claims and sometimes working with difficult claimants. The most enjoyable part  of the job was learning and growing, becoming independent to handle my clients. "
good,"I've worked at the Hartford as a seasonal rep twice and must say people are.extremely friendly, however i felt like management did not know what they.were doing.. They were not all on the same page and.it.was.annoying because you'd get several different answers..."
good,"Struggling to find it's Corporate culture and identity. Used to be a very strong employee-oriented company. Was a lot of fun to work at during the 90's and early 2000's. Economic downturn almost destroyed the company, which has been reeling since."
good,"Overall, good people to work wit who cared about doing a good job."
good,"Once was a good place to work, that is no longer the case. Far too much micromanagment. Most of the middle managment is terrible. We revamped our claim approach to how another part of the company did it. That part of the compmany lost money for the last 5 years, and in 2011 so did we for the first time in 5 years. Thats the type of logic being applied these days."
good,"If you deliver results, you are mostly compensated. The PTO can outshine any company as well as the work/life flexibility. Over time compensation, ALL major holidays off including floating holidays. Bonus/yearly raise. Ability to excel in your role."
good,I found The Hartford to be penney wise and pound foolish for many subjects.  The marketing items that were given to Agents were sometimes cheap junk!!
good,"This is a big company in every sense of the word. Every process moves through the giant bureaucratic cogs which makes any changes very slow and gradual. Good for stability, but frustrating in almost every other aspect."
good,"Worked for The Hartford for 1 1/2 years. Very challenging business structure, very strict expence tracking. Learn through trail and error.  Minimal life balance."
good,"This period of employment expanded my professional skills.  It was a great learning experience.  The co-workers in the Breas, CA office were a pleasure to work with.  The office was across the street from my home."
good,Good place to work . Friendly at ospbere very corporate. Plenty of opportunities to move in the company.  Annual bonuses and competitive pay for area.
good,"Overall, the company was in a huge flux when I joined. However, this was my first job out of college and taught me many things about the corporate world."
good,"Worked at Hartford for two years as a stop gap employment.   Enjoyed my time there, but did not see environment as a long term answer in the insurance industry."
good,"My area has a fast paced and challenging work environment.  My manager is excellent at encouraging work-life balance and avoiding burn out or over-allocation of work assignments.  There are times when working over 40 hours may be necessary, but those times are infrequent.  There are many opportunities within The Hartford, and employees are encouraged to develop their skills both to support their current role and position themselves to move into other roles or other areas of the company.  Recent changes have made the dress code more casual, with a ""dress for your day"" focus that allows more jeans and other casual wear in the office (within reason, i.e. no shorts and tanks/t-shirts).  The Hartford has a strong focus on work/life balance.  The new benefits for 2020 have increased benefits around family life including enhanced fertility coverage, adoption benefits, increased parental leave.  They are also concerned about the impact of student loan debt on an employee's life so the company is introducing a benefit to help defray some of an employee's student loan debt.  I am too old to make use of these benefits, but this is a good step to becoming a more attractive employer to the younger employee pool.  The employees I work with have a wide variety of backgrounds and The Hartford is a diverse and inclusive employer in all areas.  I have worked for The Hartford for nearly 30 years, and there have been times when I would not have strongly recommended the company as an employer of choice.  That has changed, and I am happier working for The Hartford now than I have ever been.  I would"
good,The Job is Okay. Its a lot of work and very little appreciation. Great pay for the amount of responsibility. You just have to be okay with letting the company screw people over by just never doing what it promises.
good,"Great people, very flexible, unreasonable workload that requires 50-60 hours of work typing at a desk per week.  The company went through the management changes and 1/2 of my department went running. I expressed interest for over a year of my desire to learn a new line of business or challenge however there was no effort on my department or several of my managers' ends to help me transition into a different department. I felt stuck so I decided to move on."
good,"sales/service you are tied to phone, very impersonal.  Nice at first if don't meet goals that stops. Deal with customers that aren't very nice over free gifts from ads received"
good,Very conservative but strong insurance company.  I liked working in the Loss Control department but unfortunately they undervalued scientists.  A lot of employee services.
good,"Hartford is primarily a Small Business Company now.  It is a much different company that when I was there, so my review is not really valid at this point."
good,"Very busy.  Work with clients, brokers, and internal areas.  Business growing too rapidly for new staff to be up to steed on position.  Team Lead is outstanding."
good,"The Hartford is an amazing company that invests on quality and intensive training, provides great benefits, good PTO hours, and flexibility when it comes to work schedule. However, the work environment is too stressful. Management doesn't take their time in easing someone into the job before building up the workload. Once training is over, you are functioning at a full capacity even if you are still under mentorship. Work-Life balance is never achieved, since you will never feel fulfilled with the work you do. People always work more than 40 hours a week due to the crazy amount of workload that needs to be accomplished. Team Leaders are helpful and really supportive, other analysts are encouraging, but there is an immense amount of pressure and negativity in the work culture. There are different layers to the job. At the end of the day, you are just one person and the job is really impossible to manage. It can do some damage if you are unable to find some balance and draw proper boundaries."
good,"I have been with Hartford for close to 12 years. When I first started this job was awesome. Due to the re-organization and management jumping over the last year or so the department has gone downhill fast. "
good,Good company to start out in. Provide good training for insurance exam. They do require you to read from a script with selling insurance which I did not like.
good,The job was extremely difficult and stressful.  Non stop calls from possible customers.  Had to quote as many as customers as possible and sale the products.  Constantly being in meetings with immediate supervisor on my monthly numbers.
good,No response in reference to this job. It is a great option for people looking for an insurance corporate issue. People are not friendly enough in the work environment.
good,I was rehired as a consultant for the Life division when they announced the Sale to Prudential. The job was to maintain the existing org and handle any changes needed for Prudential.
good,Worked in Medicare Supplemental Claims units; got laid office; started in Simsbury office then moved to Windsor office; great team work; gave back to community
good,"I was introduced to insurance while employed for The Hartford. I moved up the ranks quickly but once that stopped, I got bored fast. I had become too used to moving around that being stagnant made me feel trapped."
good,"The hours are good, but the job is frustrating because they don't hold everyone to the same standards. Sometimes some people get away with things other people do not. Some of the stats they focus on you maintaining go against helping the customer, which id what they claim they focus on."
good,"Great place to work, work was always completed on a timely manner due to pleasant environment.This company has good work ethics and  everyone worked as a team. Very flexible schedule was also convenient."
good,It's a great place to work. They a  re very precise when it comes to training. They have the best trainers in the Lehigh valley. Overall they are a great company and would recommend as long as your qualified to join the Hartford team.
good,"Sales is a tough job so you have to like what you are doing if not you will fail.  I like people and challenges so it was a fun place to work, but I didn't like the hours."
good,"Good Benefits, Poor Work Culture. If your looking to start here and advance through the ranks quickly this is not the company for you. However, The Hartford is very involved in the community and you'll find lots of good people here while your in your current role."

good,Did not feel valued in 2017. Did not feel customers were treated fairly. Could not tell customers the truth but had to follow a script. Training was great in 2008 but over time training became less and less important to the company and it showed.
good,"The hartford descriminated against me. I was profiled. I was one of there top sellers and the way i was treated was unacceptable, I would not  work for this company."
good,fast paced and competitive culture
good,"Overall they are a good place to work, good benefits and pay.  I left because they sold off the business segment I worked in, but I'd definitely work for them again"
good,"Great place to work for. great, place to work at. great place to work at, nice environment. Training class was great. Benefits offered medical, vision, 401k."
good,"Answering calls from customers regarding their insurance quote, learned to work in a fast pace environment where you are monitored constantly. My manager was nice and personable. The compensation benefits were not competitive, but overall I enjoyed working at this company."
good,I enjoyed my time there but there were massive changes due to financial crisis. It is a strong underwriting driven company that I can see some positive change
good,"During my time at the Hartford, I worked in both the cat department and the GL dept. Both offered challenges consistent with the respective discipline."
good,"Working as an attorney at the Hartford provided the opportunity for an attorney to utilize a variety of different skills, including written, verbal, research, analytical, administrative  and social."
good,"Was a long time ago, but my interview was professional and relevant.  In the 10 years following my hire, I always felt valued and my contributions were rewarded.  Great company."
good,Call center - Answer calls from people interested in health insurance. Sell memberships in AARP. Learned the importance of being available to receive continuous calls.
good,Left for a better job and to work for a personal lines company.  The TPA portion of the company was sold and a transfer would have to take place  Did not want to move
good,"I started as a work study student in my last year of high school and  promoted to different positions through the 32 years at The Hartford."
good,"Worker's Compensation is not an easy field but it comes with plenty of benefits. As an adjuster, you learn how to work well under pressure. Also, there are many deadlines you have to hit, being an adjuster, you learn how to get things done early so you're able to focus on other parts of the job."
good,"I didnot directly work for Hartford."
good,"Monday through Friday 10:30-7:00  is a typical work schedule. Management is terrible, they are all about numbers, even when they say they aren't. Usually unlimited OT."
good,I found The Hartford a good place to work with a moderate amount of stress.  Overall management was pretty good with politics being less than other places.
good,well...i left the job so you decide on if it was a good place to work or not.   lots of high school back stabbing stuff going on and I am way to old for that
good,The Innovation Room has lots of couches and a ping pong table. Only some have key card access. A different food truck comes each Tuesday to the visitor's lot.

good,The work environment was relaxed but steady in handling inbound phone calls.  They offered the adjustable desk so you could stand while working instead of sitting all day long.
good,"Benefit of working from home but hours were from noon to nine pacific standard time and working every other saturday from seven to three pm pacific standard time.  Old system, no manager assistance, built to punish employees using resources confusing practices of pushing quick pace call after call while desiring lengthy personal interactions."
good,"no advancement opportunities, high stress with little to no reward for extra hard work. good positions are given to people from other locations and there is no hope to move up unless you move to another state"
good,"The Hartford is a well known, established company therefore job security is all but guaranteed.  It was a comfortable place to work and the pay at the time was great."
good,Working as a Group Benefits underwriter requires constant 55-60  hour per week regardless or peak/non-peak times.  It feels like it is peak 10+ months out of the year.  The company is trying to save $250 Million dollars and staffing seems to be their primary focus for cuts.
good,I worked there for almost 20 years. It was a good place to work. They offered classes so we can grow and advance in the company. I've learned so much with The Hartford.
good,Not many opportunities to grow and the benefits are ok and it is a challenge to measure your growth and your future. Would really be helpful if the objectives are aligned for the growth of an persons career.
good,Upper management does not know how to run the company. Stressful work day. Management does  not know how to coach. ERG's are good resources for employees.
good,"The Hartford provided me with a good foundation in and understanding of Commercial Property and Casualty Insurance for my next employer, PDP Group, Inc."
good,"Its a nice place to work, however to go anywhere you have to know people. It's not based on what you can do. The phone beeps all day in your ear so if you don't want to take on average 60 calls a day, this isn't the job for you."
good,The Hartford is a busy workplace. I took between 60- 100 calls a day. being apart of this company has helped me learn so much about AARP and the benefits of health care.
good,"start day with going in to distribution room and collect letters as they come off printers, fold and place in envelopes, then file folders in file room that have been used by adjusters. Then back to distribution room for more letters to fold and mail out. Fax letters that need to go to others offices and lawyers."
good,Company was decent and provided competitive pay.  Not much room for growth in some offices unless you are willing to relocate or travel extensively. Some positions are allowed to work from home which is a great benefit.
good,"Filed court documents, typing, filing, answering telephones, proofread documents for errors, kept supplies stocked, receptionist and secretarial relief"
good,"I used to work here for all of my professional career (11 years). The culture was good but got stressful over time. The the company changed course over the years. The change was for the good but a bad pay scale and insufficient leads lead to a lot of long time agents going elsewhere or getting fired. You know, out the old and in with the new."
good,"Corporate setting, didn't take nonsense from employees.  Ethical and demanding, at times a bit competitive and difficult to  advance in.  Some managers would have benefitted from more training."
good,"These offices no longer exist in Southington. It was at one time a very high volume call center. I worked there for 17 years. I did have the opportunity to provide supervisor backup, and work on a quality review team."
good,"High traffic call center with environment that encouraged teamwork. However, they often focused on the quantity of work that you could produce over the quality. They constantly stressed the quotas that needed to be met."
good,Day to day operations at The Hartford were stressful and very fast-paced.  You needed to make sure that a certain amount of work was completed each day and that the correct reports were completed.  We worked with all of the departments to ensure that the product that was going out to the customer was perfect.  At times the managers do micro manage the staff which brings down morale.  I enjoyed working with everyone and I have built a great relationship with them
good,This was a temporary position. So I do not have a lot to say about this corporation. It was one of training and passing certain tests. And You did not fit their culture. You were not around very long.

good,The short amount of time I worked with The Hartford it was an excellent company to learn from. I learned to deal with different types of people and how to be a problem solver on many different occasions. A typical day at work consisted of writing up damage reports on many different types of automobiles.
good,Left for personal reasons  Their compensation package was ideal.  Would work for the company again. Many opportunities to advance. I enjoyed the work.
good,If you are analytical and good at math this is the perfect job for you. I enjoyed working there because I had more personal space to allow for more interaction with agents and policyholders.
good,Meeting and email culture means that it is very difficult to find time in the day to manage your daily responsibilities.  A lot of opportunities to move up and lateral.
good,"This was Customer Service for auto and home policies.  As long as you followed the required guidelines, anyone could do the job.  I met alot of good people here.  The work atmosphere was fun & light.  Not stressful."
good,I enjoyed being an underwriter. I had to leave this role because I had to move across the country. I wish I could still be an underwriter. I miss it a lot! I had wonderful peers.
good,productive and fun work place. management is excellent to work with. working environment is very light all co-worker are hardworking and very helping. i have learnt a lot from them.
good,Over management and unrealistic metric goals makes it difficult for employees to have realistic advancement opportunities within the company. Work life balance is good since most of the employees are   remote workers
good,The pay in Gwinnett County Schools was a little better. Still  they required workshops in the summer without compensation.
good,The Hartford felt like a community.  The typical day was typically a-typical with the odd tasks you would handle.  The management I had was more of a clique than actual management/leadership.
good,I learned a lot about medical claims. It was interesting learning about a different line of insurance. I enjoyed the job and met a lot of good people working there.
good,Good work environment with opportunity to lean and grow your experience. There is a good work live balance. You will have the ability to grow your experience if you are willing to put in the effort. Take control of your career and the company will give you the tools necessary to reach your personal goals.
good,"Overall a good company to work for, competitive benefits and structured new hire training. Opportunities for advancement to upper level positions are few and far between."
good,I cannot recall anything sensational about working for this company. It was a call center with basic call center culture.
good,Day is taking phone calls and try to sell policies on your first contact. All phone calls are recorded and a lot of time is spent reviewing those calls and  evaluating  what could be done better. There is a lot of feedback and at times very helpful it is over the top.
good,Assignments of many varied projects plus working with Executive Management made this a very exciting and intense  time to be in the P & C business.  Learned many new skill sets while work for The Hartford.
good,"I enjoyed working at the company. I just did not like the hours that we were expected to work. Although, the company did provide good benefits and treated there employees fairly"
good,Enjoyed my 19 years with them & would have retired from them had they not consolidated & moved out of state.  Best years of my career

good,"Fast paced work enviroment. "
good,"Hartford is a average workplace nothing special. "
good,"This was a very long time ago and one of my first Jobs. The company was fair to all employees, the co workers were very friendly."
good,great working environment with tons of room for growth. co-workers are friendly and always helpful. i would recommend The Hartford to anyone interested.
good,Working in the customer service field for a financial institution became mind numbing.  The supervisors are under strict SEC guidelines to make sure all criteria is met.
good,Very helpful senior management. Friendly leaders that will help you grow as long as you want it. Very low pay comparing to competitors. Most start their career in one of the call centers. Limited room to grow depending on a department.. Decent benefits and PTO policy. Very old building that is not appealing. Consolidating and merging are the most recent actions taken by management. Would recommend.
good,"Not a satisfying job, boring and stressful. Taking calls.  Lots of metrics.  Poor management."
good,"Museum, face pace at times, not much cleaning, standing during your shift"
good,"Inputting complaints and inqueries and answering phone, taking complaints as well as referring caller to different areas of the company."
good,Good Place to work and good work environment. You can be happy here in this project and learn more in your technologies.
good,"Great environment to work in, supportive peers and management."
good,You can expect to be behind a desk for 8 hours a day with no time between calls.   Managers like to micro manage.  It's hard to get time off unless you're able to request it way in advance.  Pay is decent and incentives are good. Career progression at this company is a joke unless you're able to relocate.
good,Great learning experience. Helped build my customer service and management skills while working here.
good,The Hartford has been around for many years and that is for a reason. They are able to forecast the changes in the industry pretty accurately and are able to change with the ever changing industry
good,Excellent training in Auto and some Home Owners insurance.  My supervisor Trey Williams is the greatest.  My co-workers were great very dependable.  The hardest part of the job was the hours 11:30 to 8:00 pm.  The most enjoyable part of the job was talking and helping customers.
good,Great place to work for the last 14 years but looking for other opportunities as the room for advancement at my level has really flattended.
good,"a typical day at work"

good,Very flat organization with minimal amount of managers. Not there that long for obtain indepth feeling for the organization.
good,"The Hartford has delivered on its promises to customers for more than 200 years—a point of pride for our dedicated, talented teammates.

good,co-workers are easy to get along with. hardest part of job is production. flexibility of work hours.
good,"Hartford enjoys a rich 200 yr history, and has many seasoned professionals who support their teammates and their customers, taking pride in their work.  It's a good environment to gain experience."
good,A typical workday includes answering inbound calls from shareholders/reps.

good,"Last two years worked from home which was wonderful! Handled approx. 45-70 incoming calls per day. Gained throrough knowledge of Hartford product, able to assist customers and co-workers due to in-depth knowledge and communication skills."
good,Good people but poor leadership. Offer remote work opportunities. Santee is a satelite office so have no real say in company decisions. Manual rating department has been and will continue to be outsourced so don't look for work in that department.
good,I conducted research and developed technical specification for systems changes that was made in India by the Hartford's sourcing partners.

good,Great employees and management little room for advancement
good,The management team and the co-workers were great. We were all about team management. The hardest part of the job was not being able to do more as overtime was very seldom. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping my peers.
good,I learned quite a great deal about insurance and the financial services industry during my tenure at The Hartford. It is a great place to work with great managers and staff. There was a lot of opportunity for advancement and to experience other roles within the organization.

good,"Considering the average wages for an entry level position in the state of NC, compensation is really really good & includes great benefits!!! This is great job if you need to pay the bills."
good,"The Hartford is an insurance company that has been around 200 plus years, and not going anywhere any time soon. However The Hartford is just another political corporation, where you need to know the right people to get where you need to go. As well suck up to your direct reporting manager. A ton of favoritism, and typical the wrong individuals being hired while the hard workers get held bac."
good,I was extremely excited to work at Hartford. At Hartford there will never be a dull moment or a moment you do not learn something new. Hartford is a great company to work however the transition of The Hartford taking over Aetna was a challenge. Training is very poorly done there and the case load is thrown at you without proper training.
good,"call center environment. very stressful. they won't advance you without a degree even if you do the work of 3 people. they listen in on everything, a lot of bickering."
good,"my manager was on me constantly about getting the correct numbers... work too fast, they up their daily standard, work too slow, and you get reprimanded. There is very little opportunity to change departments.. if you start in customer service, it will be YEARS before you are able to move up."
good,It was a good company to work for but I didn't enjoy the fast-paced call center environment. You are required to stay at your desk and not able to move around much.
good,"Experiences vary greatly across the GB Sales organization.  The company culture is a good one and the company is making investments in implementing Lean Six Sigma process protocols."
good,This was my first job out of college and my intro to insurance. This was also 13 years ago. Cannot remember everything or my day to day but I liked working there and only left because to get into the SIU department I had to wait 2 years and found a PI gig elsewhere.
good,Working here can be stressful management will say everything you say on a phone is wrong because the wording changes all the time but they don't tell you that it is a metric system so you are dinged a lot on your bonus they want you on and off the phone in 5 mins which at times you cannot do you are working with a customer it should not be rushed.
good,"Worked in the claims dept. for wc claim, property liability and no fault claim services.  Handled claims from start to finish to make sure that all customers recd all services needed."
good,Great iconic Company.  Significant struggles hiring and keeping quality leadership.  The Company wants to do the right thing but has numerous set backs due to poor leadership and misguided strategies.
good,"The culture is very collaborative and management truly has your back.  The systems are quick and efficient.  The pay is okay, but lots of restructuring going on."
good,Not looking for sales or a customer service job that has stats and quotas to meet. Not interested in a call center environment as well. There was a lot of unnecessary training and expectations that were not reachable. The job was about micro-managing and making you feel bad if you did not hit quotas.
good,"11 years with The Hartford was enough time to witness the good and the bad. Normal progression, and raises through yearly reviews were poor. The only way to increase one's salary to a respectable level was to post for different jobs, or to leave the company, and then return for more money. Reviews that I received were fair, and the caliber of employees was very decent. But my one question about The Hartford was whether they really knew which direction they were going. There was a lot of trial and error. It wasn't that we were adverse to change, it was more that they didn't know which path to take, and many decisions, that seemed good at the time, ended up being reversed."
good,"over all review is that Aetna has to many work from employees that nobody wants to take responsibility for anything, on the client provider side customer service was great but on the provider credentialing side the provider service was not good at all."
good,"Not bad for a first job, but quickly realized there was little room for advancement. May have just been the area i was working in - other friends that have worked there enjoy it."
good,"During my 7 years at HLI, i found my satisfaction with the company to decline, quickly towards the end. I found favoritism, cut-throat managers who were turf-building, and a company that became very unbalanced and slowly fell apart, resulting in major lay offs that were not handled professionally.  I was relieved to separate from them and found a job better suited to me where I was/am happy and fullfilled."
good,"Good Benefits, medical dental vision, Long Term Disability Short Term Disability 401K Paid Time Off Flexible Working Hours Good Location Large company with a lot of opportunity for advancement"
good,"My area has a fast paced and challenging work environment.  My manager is excellent at encouraging work-life balance and avoiding burn out or over-allocation of work assignments.  There are times when working over 40 hours may be necessary, but those times are infrequent.  There are many opportunities within The Hartford, and employees are encouraged to develop their skills both to support their current role and position themselves to move into other roles or other areas of the company.  Recent changes have made the dress code more casual, with a ""dress for your day"" focus that allows more jeans and other casual wear in the office (within reason, i.e. no shorts and tanks/t-shirts).  The Hartford has a strong focus on work/life balance.  The new benefits for 2020 have increased benefits around family life including enhanced fertility coverage, adoption benefits, increased parental leave.  They are also concerned about the impact of student loan debt on an employee's life so the company is introducing a benefit to help defray some of an employee's student loan debt.  I am too old to make use of these benefits, but this is a good step to becoming a more attractive employer to the younger employee pool.  The employees I work with have a wide variety of backgrounds and The Hartford is a diverse and inclusive employer in all areas.  I have worked for The Hartford for nearly 30 years, and there have been times when I would not have strongly recommended the company as an employer of choice.  That has changed, and I am happier working for The Hartford now than I have ever been.  I would"
good,"depending on business area the hartford is a great company to work for.  management in most areas are proactive with employees careers. the hartford encourages community/charity involvement, vacation package is good, work/life balance is very accommodating in most areas."
good,"The overall job was rewarding working in a team environment that promoted encouragement, best practice sharing, and engagement. The staff was given opportunities to share they options of the work, management, and company overall through regular surveys. I learned a lot of management and coaching techniques during my tenure. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping my staff to grow in their knowledge, ability to serve our customer, and skill development."
good,Always busy within incoming leads. I learned a lot from dealing with people from all over the country.  I thought it made me a more skilled person and advanced my career.
good,Excellent environment to work; until you require short term disability. Then you become a risk... Company pigeon holes you to specific role and hampers career development.  Truly a struggle to position oneself for advancement.
good,"If willing to relocate, opportunities are available for advancement. Great benefits. Generous PTO policy can't be beat. Have gained much insight into the corporate life and how a culture can really have an impact on the company's success."
good,"A typical day at work is taking incoming calls for Personal Auto, and Home. As well as commercial auto and home, plus Workers Compensation."
good,"Generous time off program"
good,"work environment is good, everyone gets along great and we help each other they're easy to communicate with and very flexible"
good,"The people here are very pleasurable. The Hartford is very diverse with their hiring and that makes coming to work enjoyable for me. However the responsibilities are endless with new jobs and responsibilities added weekly to your job description. With all the added responsibility there are no pay increases. I can easily say The Hartford when it comes to valuing the employee and paying someone their true worth, is easily the worst company I've worked for in this area."
good,no comment no comment since i am still a current employee. Team Leaders and local mgmt are sympathetic to the lack of work/life balance but do not have the latitude to improve it.
good,Started in a an entry level position and was able to move into varies position.  Great opportunities.  If you can move then you can have tons of chances with advancement if you're a hard worker.
good,Learned a lot and enjoyed my time with the company--some management issues related to incompetence and lack of leadership skills
good,"•	Maintained daily automotive claim log. "
good,Overall a pretty good place to work but managers have little training at managing people. Also very slow in career advancement.
good,"The company is a great introductory opporunity for anyone trying to break into the insurance field. Comes with extensive training, and good benefits."
good,"Great co-workers, there is always work to be done here. I like being able to manage my day at my own pace and prioritize my work. It does have its busy times where you feel like there are not enough hours in the day to finish what you need to get done, this is the hardest part, to walk away from your desk at the end of the day knowing you have a lot of work that didn't get finished."
good,"Would take inbound calls from people over 65 years of age , inquiring about medicare supplemental insurance plans"
good,The average day for the past 21 months was 9-11 hours long. The Theft ICR position was new to the region and has never been what it was supposed to be. There have been many changes in management and leadership since I started working at The Hartford which also brought changes in philosophy. The co-workers are the best part of the job as they are all there to support you as much as they can. The most difficult part of the job was the claim volume due to the department not being staffed properly and high turnover. You are provided ample paid time off but are immediately behind once you come back as each employee on your team is too busy working their claims to be able to assist your claims while you are away.
good,"Not really much to enjoy, typical day is very busy. Management is friendly but lacks direction."
good,I would make changes to customers' stocks per them or their stock manager. I learned that Brokers' can be very rude. Management was ok. the hardest part of the job was dealing with the Brokers' that would call in close to the time the stock market was about to close to make changes and then explaining that the 4 o'clock deadline was missed. the most enjoyable part of that job was the end of my shift.

good,"Receiving inbound calls for health insurance throughout the day. I've learned a lot about health insurance and customer service. The management team mainly was excellent when getting questions asked and assistance needed to succeed. The co-workers were mostly friendly, and always felt comfortable approaching me with any questions. The hardest part of the job was to deal with irate customers. The most enjoyable part for the job was at the end of the day, I had no doubt I helped many people solve their issues/questions and assisted them with a very important part of their evey day life."
good,"In LTD, prepare for long days. The benefits are good and the coworkers are great. Will work more than 40 hours per week."
good,"I enjoyed going to work at The Hartford. I had a great staff and very hard working staff. The outsourcing and the selling off of some business areas has stretched the overall employee hours and confidence that they can continue on working there. Layoffs have been the norm, every 6 months another downsizing and reorganization. Sometimes not indicating what the direction of the company is going."
good,Co-workers are great
good,"Metrics were hardly given but reprimanded for performance."
good,"Good work/life balance. Flexible hours. Pleasant people. Two cafeterias on site. Deadlines, but not too stressful. Nice campus. Free parking. They let you take the ball and run with it."
good,"Similar to any like company I have worked for The Hartford has an aggressive portfolio of work.  The environment is collaborative but stressful and most key resources are overloaded.  Compensation from a Base Salary perspective is fair, but the bonus structure is weak.  Employee Benefits changed in 2018 and while the new plans saved The Hartford money - the fact is that any employee leveraging the health care benefit took a significant pay cut.  Unfortunate that while they strive to be a leading Group Benefits provider in the market- they cut their own employee benefits.  Maybe a new way of the world.."
good,You really need to come into the company with a reasonable salary because they are not great about compensation bumps internally. Often times we are told that if we want to make more money that we need to leave the company and then come back.
good,"Working in the personal lines call center for The Hartford AARP was probably the most stressful job I’ve taken on. It’s constant verbal abuse from customers, high micro-management and low pay. "
good,Management is great; very supportive in your career aspirations. Very supportive in allowing you to move within the company. Work-life balance could be better. You will have to work hours until your required work is done. Though flexibility is great in most positions.
good,"Very bottom heavy structure. There are opportunities within Claims for those who stay, but overall upward mobility is limited."
good,Overall the company is really good. The management is genuinely interested in making you the best that you can be at what you do.  Some of the draw backs are the metrics and adherence. If that is something that you are used to then it may be a great fit.
good,This is an excellent company to grow in however hours can be tough when you have family to do things with. The days off are split up. The management is great and the positive flow within the company to grow is quite nice.
good,"Overall, initially, this was a good company to work for.  There were regular hours, excellent pay and benefits.  One drawback was the constant adding of additional jobs to the one hired for, and constant changing of employees from one department and to other buildings."
good,"I have transitioned from this type of work because I was looking for something I could be passionate about. I have found it as a health care work. "
good,Workplace that moving forward into 2017- some of the best people I've met through working there- had a lot of positive experiences within the organization

good,My experience at the Hartford for the most part has been good but I'm not one for being micro managed and told what I'm doing wrong more often then what I'm doing right. The people there are very nice but I do better in an office environment.
good,"Production and quality environment"
good,I have performed a variety of job functions for Hartford. I have gained knowledge about the Commercial side of the insurance business. I enjoy the interaction that I have with customers and agents on a daily basis.
good,This company offers many opportunities for advancement. The compensation culture is pay for performance with annual increases and bonuses.  The company offers a generous paid time off and holiday package. Health insurance benefits are sub par as the company switched to only High Deductible plans.  Many workers complain about high work loads and difficulty with work-life balance.
good,"I enjoyed working here.  Layoffs and downsizing a constant.  The Hartford is working to make their organization more lean, offshoring jobs."
good,The Hartford wasn't a bad company. I just felt that they really didn't care about the life situations of their employees and some of the management staff didn't care about anything other than the bottom line.
good,Case manager for billing of benefits for companies offering Prudential Ins
good,A typical day at The Hartford would be logging into my computer system making sure I have everything I need to assist my customers. Once I have everything I need I would then start answering all incoming calls. My incoming calls varied from questions about their policies to taking monthly payments for their health insurance to terminating policies. Policy terminations were voluntary or due to a deceased member. My coworkers were wonderful. They were so helpful whenever I was unsure about a policy they would always point me in the right direction to find the correct answer. I also had an amazing manager. She did everything in her power to help me succeed.
good,"Assisted the Sales Practices & Training Team of the Sales Excellence division in coordinating training programs and provided training coordination support for a variety of training sessions to internal employees (New Manager On-Boarding Training, Core New Hire Training for Middle Market & Small Commercial segments)."
good,"Simply put, customers are not happy when they call you most of the time. A typical day from 8am until 5pm is constantly putting out fires, and that feels good-knowing you are helping people. However it just does not outweigh the anxiety and angst that preceeds it.The stress levels and metrics associates are judged by often seem unreasonable."
good,"I started as a work study student in my senior year in high school. I love all the benefits the ""The Hartford"" had to offer at the time. I enjoyed doing my job and like my co-workers. I met and made a lot of new friends. Of course benefits changed over the years! But I was comfortable with changes until we started hearing about laid off. Then more laid off overtime going overseas. But it did not bother me until our department was hit with outsourcing our jobs going  overseas that was a shock to me!  So now it very hard to find full time employment at 50 years old with no college degree and a lot of competition with younger adults. Plus other employers have move out of state or outsource too!  So looking for work is been a very difficult stage in my life right now!"
good,The Hartford is a great place to start your career but has limited options for advancement. Management is determined to keep employees in work horse positions and limit advancement. Great place to learn and gain experience for a large insurance carrier but to be promoted you most likely will need to leave the company.
good,You are responsible for a lot and spend a lot of time putting out fires

good,"It is a very fast paced work environment and the training is excellent as it is a very in depth curriculum. "
good,"The Hartford has devoted a great deal of effort to be a leader in work/life balance. Since it is a multi-line insurer, there is never a lack of interesting things to learn and problems to solve."
good,"The job location was in Simsbury, CT, and I just did not feel comfortable working there. Although I have to admit, it was the beginning of my Mother's illness - however, I did not feel comfortable speaking to any of my Supervisors or co-workers about my feelings."
good,"due to managing problems this WAS a great place to work.  worked in many different departments, and learned many things.  loved knowing about all ares of the insurance business.  co-workers were the best.  the hardest part was letting go, and leaving.  most enjoyable was finding lost people."
good,The Hartford is a great company to work for as far as benefits and time off. They need to get back to putting the customers first.
good,"I work in the billing call center. The best thing about the job is that they're more relaxed than Geico; You get 6 minutes to load your computers; They pay you for everything like checking your email because they don't want to be sued; They pay a couple of dollars less than Geico, but you aren't as micromanage; They also allow you 6 minutes grace period to get back from work; They're PTO time is around 14 days a year and you get 6 holidays off. My co-workers are wonderful - the best part of the job!

good,"great pay and benefits. management is very approachable. "
good,"I loved my job working at The Hartford Insurance,  I knew my job like a book.  I had a personal connection with every customer and agent that would call in.  I always went over and beyond to make sure my job I was doing as a customer service representative was 100%."
good,The Hartford is a great place to work especiallly for people who enjoy talking and working with others. Being helpful and courteous is a must as it makes the job that much easier and more beneficial to the customers. Management always encourages promotion from within and it can be extra motivation to perform to best of one's abilities
good,"Overall a good experience, great benefits, decent pay. Managers slightly out of touch with sales force, though there is a good atmosphere. There is a decent base pay, but commissions are low so it may not be best company for top producers."
good,"I very much enjoyed the perks that came with the job, such as time off and pay. I did not want to be on the phones for 8 hours straight"
good,"Caseload is relatively balanced. "
good,I am happy working with and there is productive in work and all staff or colleagues are more supportive and will enjoy the task which is given by client.
good,"I have a dual job title: Escalation/Customer Loyalty Advocate. A typical day as such involves handling matters that may be difficult or challenging for the typical customer service representative. It also involves reaching out to customers to address questions. My immediate coworkers and manager are all fantastic people with a real knack for teamwork. We truly help and support one another all day every day. If one of us needs to take a few minutes to handle a task, another team member steps up in our place. The hardest part of my job is sitting ALL DAY. It wears on my back. I also work from home, which may sound great...but you tend to miss human interaction. You do have to deal with angry customers from time to time (in my case a lot, hence the ""Escalation part"") but this comes as no surprise in the customer service industry as a whole. I've been here 6 years and I'm open to other options. However, it would be hard to match the benefits, professionalism, job security and vacation time that this company gives to it's employees. i.e. I have just over a month of vacation time.

good,"Most managers are great. You can work from home, which may be a benefit to some. Some of the metrics are a bit difficult to achieve. Good benefits. Very repetitive work, and almost no career progression available, although the pay is good."
good,I work remotely and i hate it just because im so outgoing! I really loved working at the office due to the environment but i had to move out of state and they gave me the option to work from home
good,Love the work I do at The Hartford.  The Hartford is very flexible with work/life balance.  The Hartford has been proven to be a place to grow my career.
good,"A day in the life at the hartford... log in sign onto your phone and never leave your seat. you are only allowed off the phones during your breaks and lunch .. The managers are micromanagers and do no promote advances. The company is no longer lead with a caring and employee focused way , its all about the numbers and the employees are treated the same."
good,I manage commercial & residential property claims ranging from $0 - 100K and enjoy assisting my customers in a time of need.
good,Working at the Hartford was a competitive and stressful environment.  Making sales was the primary goal for all employees. The job was demanding and lacked a conducive environment for productive employee engagement.

good,I liked my job at The Hartford Insurance.  I knew exactly what I was doing.  Unfortunately they outsourced the job. It was a pleasant work place.  My team leader was an excellent leader but she passed away this year.
good,"I worked as a temp for this agency.  At the time it was a new kind of experience, and I enjoyed it.  It gave me a sense, that all of the medical I have learned, I could finally use."
good,"Held to unreasonable metrics, all upper management cares about and they've never taken phone calls so they have no idea what the job is actually like. You take 60+ phone calls a daily no in between phone call time just call after call and it's expected you do in between call work."
good,Please ak for additional information pertaining to my current position and the company as a whole.
good,"If you are a high-end sales agent.  But if you need support and assistance it is not there.  Verbal dressing downs at your desk, harsh words, and negative response to questions is common."

good,"The Hartford acquired the disability clients from Aetna. The acquisition of UPS was a challenge for management as products were added without adequate infrastructure and changes to adequately support the client were slow in being implemented. Claims managers were required to perform functions well outside the job description, and while it is expected all team members support the client, management did not make any moves to properly support the additional business. It is a shame because prior to the changes,  Aetna/The Hartford was a very supportive place to work."
good,You are not a sales agent but an underwriter.  The compensation plan is complicated and not for sales agents who are money driven but for those who only want to collect an hourly pay. You will average $500 per month if that on bonuses.
good,"Required high energy. Very competitive but collaborative. Long hours, little recognition. Stressful environment to meet deadlines. I was involved with Board of Directors reporting and the review process was over blown."
good,Company needs to figure out what it is besides being an insurance company. 
good,Too many hours required to complete job assignments.  Work/Life balance is preached but not honored.  Management is not supportive of employees outside responsibilities
good,The Hartford is an outstanding company from a cultural perspective. There 210 year old roots within the insurance industry have been validated by an outstanding reputation for Customer Service and the ability to pay claims.
good,They expected me personally to have a higher amount of claimants I had to work on at one time.  For example instead of working on the average of 250 claims I had 400.
good,Enjoy my time working with Hartford it was also room to grown in learning new things It was a place were you could grow. Great place to work.
good,"Great vacation, health benefits. Low Compensation. Dress is casual and people are friendly. Great amenities like cafe, gym, tech support and walk areas"
good,I was at The Hartford for 4 1/2 years. I had never worked in a call center prior to this and I feel that they trained me well. They also paid for my lisencing to take place. There were great benefits that included health insurance and paid time off. It really is a great company to work for.
good,Great company to work with great benefits. I learned alot and management always trys to further your opportunities.
good,"Work life balance was a struggle for many, and seems to be proving more difficult to manage than in the past"
good,Good place to work but call center work is not for me. I had several years on the phones both in customer service and sales. Gained and improved communication skills.
good,"Overal good company, however advancement opportunitites were limited."
good,The Hartford is a great company to work for. They are trying to bring in younger workers and the culture and technology is a little behind but catching up.
good,Ok to work there but can be stressful.  Management too involved with some things and less involved with other things.  Inconsistent involvement and unsupportive of compliance related issues
good,"Central Recovery Office  - I found my voice at The Hartford & I appreciated that my voice was heard.  The local management was always evolving & the environment changed with every new manager.  It was not always a good thing.  Growth potential was always possible. Co-workers were supporting both personally & professionally. "
good,The hardest part of the job was dealing with the irate customers and no support from management and unable to move forward. The company had no loyalty to its employees.
good,It has been several years since in worked for The Hartford so I cannot provide an accurate assessment of the company at this point.  I enjoy working there.
good,"My area has a fast paced and challenging work environment.  My manager is excellent at encouraging work-life balance and avoiding burn out or over-allocation of work assignments.  There are times when working over 40 hours may be necessary, but those times are infrequent.  There are many opportunities within The Hartford, and employees are encouraged to develop their skills both to support their current role and position themselves to move into other roles or other areas of the company.  Recent changes have made the dress code more casual, with a ""dress for your day"" focus that allows more jeans and other casual wear in the office (within reason, i.e. no shorts and tanks/t-shirts).  The Hartford has a strong focus on work/life balance.  The new benefits for 2020 have increased benefits around family life including enhanced fertility coverage, adoption benefits, increased parental leave.  They are also concerned about the impact of student loan debt on an employee's life so the company is introducing a benefit to help defray some of an employee's student loan debt.  I am too old to make use of these benefits, but this is a good step to becoming a more attractive employer to the younger employee pool.  The employees I work with have a wide variety of backgrounds and The Hartford is a diverse and inclusive employer in all areas.  I have worked for The Hartford for nearly 30 years, and there have been times when I would not have strongly recommended the company as an employer of choice.  That has changed, and I am happier working for The Hartford now than I have ever been.  I would"
good,"The Hartford is a good place to work as long as you have the right manager.  They offer great vacation time, good pay, remote work.  I have found if the manager like you, you will go places. If not the room for growth is minimum.  The use to be lots of flexibility for work/home life for people who were not on the phones but that seems to have gone away"
good,The Hartford was a great place to work for the most part.  I really enjoyed my time there.  Every day I did something new and different.  Once day was always filled with tasks different than the previous day.  I learned alot about working collaboratively.  The culture was very relaxed and the people were a pleasure to work with.
good,"The Hartford has a culture of acceptance.  My job was challenging, and I worked with good people.  I was paid well and got fair bonuses.  During my time there there were waves of job eliminations and lots of work sent offshore."
good,The hardest part of the job was the quantity of claims or case load I had.  That did make the job stressful though I learned a lot. The most enjoyable part was the people and career advancement.
good,Good company to work for. Like the culture and business focus. Company has done a great work around. Good Collaboration and partnership within teams . Good people.
good,"The Hartford demands a lot of its employees. I was regularly required to work 10-12 hour days and I had to travel extensively for my job. I was relocated for my job which was an excellent opportunity but when it came time for me to return to CT, which was home, at the end of the agreed upon three years they refused to bring me home and blocked my attempts to transfer to other divisions. I ended up having to leave the company in order to be with my family again."
good,Good company to work for.. good pay and benefits. The call center mentality and environment can be very tough to work in at times but the benefits make it worth it
good,"The Hartford kept up with the latest software technologies, developers were given the necessary tools to perform their tasks. The work environment was set up to be very productive."
good,"the days after the 2008 meltdown were dismal at HIG. Cut back after cutback and the company has continued to downsize. For those who survive you will work a lot. All that said the company has survived hundred of years, literally, and will continue to survive. If you can do the hours lots of people that go there retire from there for good reason. Cultures and CEOs will change. What ever was there when I left it different by now and will change again and again. But HIG will go on"
good,"My typical day would be signing in to my computer, logging into the call queue and taking anywhere from 60 to 90 calls/day. This was a very fast paced job."
good,"good place work"
good,Worked for The Hartford for several years unfortunately my job was eliminated in June 2017. I currently work for the postal service but I am looking to get back into the Insurance field.
good,"Excellent products, good teams, good benefits and compensation. It is a big organization with so many projects, hence, many opportunities. I would highly recommend this workplace."
good,"SS&C is a great company to work for. They treat you with respect. However, it is a stressful and face pace environment to work for. Great people working with you as well."
good,"They pay well, salary was good if you work fast but job was stressful, pressure from management for performance standards would vary by manager, ok job with a good boss, very stressful with a bad one."
good,"* Management is good"
good,Worked as a consultant and good fun place to work. Was part of family for long period and company was employee pro to a large extend. Had good work force in US.
good,"The Hartford provides many opportunities to learn and grow throughout your career, you only need to be willing to stretch.  They value a proper work / life balance."
good,Micro-managed.  Time restrictions placed on staff to perform tasks greater than hours needed to perform them correctly.  Cut backs on Call center personnel left Analysts the added responsibility of answering incoming calls.

good,There are good people that work there--and upper management used to care about the staff.  As the company restructures--the daily call requirements become more and more difficult.  Instead of the company caring about it's employees and how they make the customers feel--the company now cares more about their profit.
good,Excellent position for someone interested in research and not afraid to learn about health insurance.  Good on the job training provided.  There are many opportunities for entry level customer service representatives and there was potential to advance.
good,The Hartford offers a great place to work and is known as one of the most ethical companies. Inclusion and diversity is a constant throughout every department.
good,"The most enjoyable part of The Hartford is the people I work with and the flexibility. I have the option to work from home if needed, the people I interact are always friendly and welcoming. The hardest part would be the work/life balance. I sometimes work over 50hrs a week, including weekends, and don't get much time for myself."
good,Good Company to work for. Room for advancement. Good work life balance. Very ethical. Competitive Pay. Diversity and Inclusion is a lifestyle.
good,Work life balance is very good. Exposure on cutting edge technologies and atmosphere for innovation is excellent. Products that shipped are large enterprise scale.
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,"The best part of my job is having the freedom to express myself – to laugh when I need to de-stress; to speak and actually be heard, and to perform not just because I’m paid to do it but because I’m inspired to be the best."
good,The company is developing and growing talent internally. They are investing in employees future and nurturing their personal and professional growth.
good,"•	Involved in requirement gathering and document reporting requirements."
good,Great Place to work.  Offers competitive salary and flexible workplace environment. If you like fast paced with constantly changing priorities this is a wonder place to be.
good,"Fast paced business."
good,"I have learned great multi tasking, and customer service skills on this job. My co workers are kind, and always supportive and helpful. We are able to collaborate together to learn from one another when needed. Management is always willing to assist and help guide employee's career goals. The hardest part of this position is the high inventory. The most enjoyable part is when you are able to assist someone to make their recovery period easier financially for them."
good,"I loved working at Hartford. I was proud of my work and always wanted to do better, learn more and be more. Your work environment is only as good and together as leadership makes it and continues it."
good,"Overall I am thankful for the time I had with Hartford Life.  I was very successful in customer service by winning their Presidents and Chairmans award - to which I am still very proud of.  "
good,Working at The Hartford was a great job. I enjoyed my job and the people I got to see everyday. We were always encouraged by management to succeed and given incentives. The part I enjoyed the most was the bond that was created with my coworkers/team. The hardest part was balancing my home life with my changing schedule.
good,"Very depressing environment within the office life there, to many rules that hold you back from advancing and they don’t hire from within, they hire externally then outsource to India."
good,"I started working in an area where we received faxes with supporting documentation for disability cases. I had to enter all the information in the system and deliver the documents to the adjusters. "
good,"I work in a face paced environment handling weather related events. I have a span of control of 7 direct reports, responsible for coaching development, expense disicplines,focusing on providing best in class customer service and ensuring quality and regional compliance licensing and claims handling.

good,I did love to work with my customers help them with any questions that they had and updated all there information’s on the company systems. I was very helpful to my co-workers helping and training them how to process and useing new systems.The most enjoyable part of the job it was to finish my work on time and to help every one that needed help.
good,"A typical day at work was phone-heavy.  The majority of the time it seemed like a customer service position rather than coverage analysis.  At times it seemed impossible to get through the weeds and get things done because the phone just wouldn't stop ringing.  That was definitely the hardest part."
good,Was a call center environment. Good company to work for. Did not care very much for call center environment. Management could do a lot more hands on.
good,"I enjoyed my time of service with the company, but the time for travel to and from work just became a bit too much. As far as typical day... and most enjoyable is and always will be assisting the customer, which was my first priority and the hardest part is when there were times beyond my or the company,s control that I couldn't.  I also made a lot of lasting relationships with co-workers as well as Management.great"
good,"The Hartford was a decent job with uncompetitive pay, great benefits and terrible work life balance."
good,"A typical day at work is very busy on the phones as well as managing your work manager. I have learned to handle non-injury claims , investigate liability as well as settle total loss claims. My immediate supervisor is positive and encouraging. My co-workers are great people and friends. The hardest part of my job is delivering bad news such as placing liability against someone or going thru a total loss. The most enjoyable part is helping those that truly feel lost and stressed because of their claim. It is a great feeling to know I made a difference for someone to carry on in their life as normal and as quickly as possible."
good,The Hartford is going thru a lot of change in many areas.  It is a great place to work and once the change is completed they will have a lot of room for advancement of their employees
good,"A great place to work.  Co-workers are amazing, a true team enviroment, while also being independent."
good,Job was fairly repetitive in a call center environment.  Performance is all about numbers  Strong company that is respected and looks good on a resume.  
good,Answered in coming calls regarding billing.  I took payments over the phone and made payment arrangements with customers.  Set up automatice electronic payments for customers. I enjoyed being able to help customers pay their bill. The hardest part of job was when I was unable to help due to their pay history or not having enough time in the policy term to extend payment.
good,This is where I learned how to handle work comp claims. Great team enviroment. Hardest part of the job was leaving the team and working from home.
good,"The company has seen many changes in the last 10 years, primarily by reducing its workforce through outsourcing and selling off many lines of business"
good,The Company has a solid reputation in the marketplace. A fast paced & varied work environment is a plus. Education is supported. Teamwork and diversity in staff is strongly valued.
good,"Good company. A lot of change right now, but it will also lead to good opportunities."
good,"This job was a temporary placement for me until I found a full-time job in the teaching profession. People I worked with were great! Somewhat mudane work for me, with very little change day to day. Overall, a positive experience!"
good,"• a typical day at work - every day was a new day, never old"
good,"Computer Factory and Neeco are now gone, as they were bought out by bigger companies. CompuCom Systems is still around and it was a great place to be. I just needed to be working closer to home for my family at the time that I worked for CompuCom Systems."
good,"I have gained a wealth of knowledge in call center operations, entry level and advanced claims inlcuding first and third party property damage and third party injury claims."
good,The company is great to the employees and the balance is great! The only downfall is being in a call center and not much movement away from the desk. All depends on who your manager is if you are actually treated good or not.
good,"typical day at the Hartford. I was a licensed insurance agent, writing property and casualty insurance in 45 states. It was an inbound call center, where I took typically 50 calls a day helping customers with their current policies, and writing new ones. There were difficult calls, and it was back to back calls all day. So, there wasn't much time away from my cubicle other than my 3 breaks a day."

good,I started off my position in the call center fielding 150-200 calls per day in regards to life insurance and annuity products. I learned a lot about investments and basic computer systems. I learned how to be flexible and had great training. The hardest part of the job was turnover. Being in a call center I spent many hours training in new hires only to have them decide this was not the position for them. The most enjoyable part of my job was the team morale. The management provided great encouragement and made sure to have 2 events per year to keep their employees engaged. I was also promoted rather quickly.
good,"The organization is deeply routed on previous experience. Leadership has rotated continuously, with a strong preference to those whom have grown up within the culture. Emphasis on women in leadership, but has not come to fruition."
good,I enjoyed working for The Hartford.  Would've stayed longer if there were more opportunities for advancement or career path for individuals operating at a higher level.
good,"You were made to feel like you mattered.  This was a new area of insurance for me, but the training was really good.  There was a lot of interaction between the different departments.   I got to interact with other departments and learn what they did in each department.  There a very diverse culture at Hartford Omni."
good,"UW is a well paid customer service role."
good,The Hartford has pretty good managers. Its compensation program (bonus/raises) is better than other companies in the same field. The Hartford has an excellent training program to help you get off on the right foot.
good,"The property department was great from 2004-2015. In 2015 the leadership changed and really damaged the in ternal working dynamic for the employees. Although there were some positive things added like a ""Holdback Team"", the positive changes did not outweigh the damage to morale that had taken place. Very unfortunate because it was at one pint a fantastic place to work and overall still is. Property is not the only department there! I do recommend applying in another department, you can be very successful. "
good,"Good place to work; flexible schedule with accommodating managers but high paced, stressful work environment with low pay.  Great benefits and opportunities for mobile advancement."
good,"Great culture and coworkers, really no advancement.  They tell you they don't care about stats but it's brought up on every manager meeting and you're given ""goals"" if you fall below."
good,I worked in handling STD/LTD claims in which required significant amounts of overtime.    It is a good company to start with after graduating college.
good,Many long term employees.  New employees may struggle with office dynamics.  Strong preference to traditional thinking and adherence to conservative underwriting.
good,"It was good experience to work. Day to day role is interesting management support was good, more over workplace and culture is enjoyable part for me for this project."
good,I loved the people and atmosphere at the Hartford but only took the position due to the limited job market when I graduated college. I was greatly underpaid for the position but my manager was very easy to work with. Overall it was a good learning experience.
good,"The culture at The Hartford is going through changes, but I enjoyed my time there. The work/life balance is possible there under the right manager. There is room to grow if you start there as a college graduate. Many employees stay long-term 10+ years.  I think that speaks volumes!"
good,"Extremely fast paced, stressful; however, many great people. Learned many skills/coverage in Commercial Insurance. Management- hit or miss, there were some amazing/supportive managers, then there are some that will not provide support. The most difficult part of the job was that your Family life was out the door, position require 12+ hrs per day, plus work weekends to clear out some work, you're never ""caught up"". The most enjoyable part of working for The Hartford, the fact that it's a big company, and there is much opportunity, it all falls on you and what/where you want to go in the company."
good,"A good to start a career in the insurance field. Office politics and a shift in the culture has hurt morale. Upper management has begun to undervalue employees and more concerned about stock. Taking away from the core, employees, will hurt the company bottom line in the long run."
good,"It was one of the jobs that I liked the least, very stressful and very unrealistic goals to meet. I would not recommend this job to anyone."
good,This company is great as a whole. I love my co-workers and my department. I also love the office setup and vibe. Everyone is super helpful and attentive.
good,"The Hartford name comes with a lot of positive history and opportunity, however, my experience was a difficult one during a difficult time. Volatile market conditions and pricing pressures in the business drove a lot of tough decisions that directly impacted the workforce on a day to day basis. Uncertainty in the business coupled with limited communications from leadership made working at The Hartford less positive then I believe it could be."

good,"I have learned quite a bit about the Mortgage Industry working for Hartford Financial Services.  My co-Workers are among the best in the industry.  "
good,working under customer service setting & time management being the hardest part of the job. Continuous phone/computers speaking with patients regarding their medical condition
good,Limited opportunities for advancement.  Minimum raises - $2.00 over six years. Very good training and assistance obtaining licenses.
good,"I was responsible for answering incoming calls and emails from various types of customers.  This includes participants, policyholder, and insurance agents. My role was primarily in Commercial Market Life Insurance, and long and short-term disability.  I processed Medical Underwriting inquiries, prepared documents, and responded to various question by phone and email.  I utilized dual monitors and multiple systems simultaneously to resolve inquiries as quickly as possible."
good,The only real reason I left this job is due to more money. In hindsight I realized the grass is not always greener. This job was a good job with good management (at least in my department) designation programs to advance your skills and even a pension. Although I am not sure if all that still remains today.  There was however sometimes high turnover resulting in higher case loads and high stress.
good,There are many career opportunities coming out of college. Upper management does run the show and do not step on their toes. Conflicting messages may leave something else to be desired.
good,"This company invested in the employees; providing onsite training, tuition reimbursement, and seminars.  Everyday was a new learning experience."
good,"Haven't worked there long, but from what I did experience was a nice work environment. People were very nice and enjoyable to work with. The Hartford took the time out to appreciate their employees and you felt cared about"
good,My typical day at work was receiving inbound calls and customizing auto and home insurance quotes for customers.  I learned many customer service and sales skills at my time with Hartford Insurance also learned how to work as a team.  The most enjoyable part of my job there was communicating with my teammates and also helping out my customers and providing them coverage that will protect them and their assets instead of just providing them a cheaper quote.
good,"I feel the environment is a great work place with great co workers. The pro's are the casual days the team parties and the management staff. The con's are the unfair practice of grading and evaluating quality scores with out proper training of the CSR. The breaks could be longer and the pay could be slightly better."
good,See resume for detailed career and job responsibilities.  Learned instructional design methods.  Increased leadership and project management techniques.
good,"I was at the Hartford last year during open enrollment. During my time there I handled payments, claims, death calls, inbound and outbound calls. I worked from 10-630 M-F and made 11.50 a hour and I was very happy. I did weekends and overtime whenever it was offered so I was bringing home good money! I never called off during my time there but I soon got the flu and eventually it lead to pneumonia and I was in the hospital for a week and a half. I texted my boss and she said ""I hope you feel better, cannot wait to see you come back."" But when I came back, my desk was cleared out and I was told my service was done. I was so upset! I loved my job and now I am not allowed to come back at all. The Hartford is not a place to work for if you are looking for a place with good job security. If you want to make some extra cash, then go for it!! Because they will most likely let you go within three months even though they tell you how much they like you and what a great job you are doing."
good,"A typical work day is reviewing your daily files, making investigation on auto accidents and making calls to insured customers, attorneys and insurance companies."
good,"Call center work where I had to display my organizational skills and multi-tasking ability on a daily basis. I learned that being proactive is essential while performing a task at hand. My manager was very helpful and provided constructive critisim when needed with a supportive attitude. I enjoyed my co-workers the most...our team was like a little family. To this day, I am still in contact with the bulk of them. The hardest part of the job was explaining indepth information about medicare supplemental plans to the older age groups. But the reward was knowing that they were able to retain the information and to hear them compliment my efforts in doing so, was the most enjoyable part of the job!"
good,"The company worked hard to come back from the financial downturn in investment markets. "
good,"It’s a pretty good job, flexible hours, pays well & the benefits are really good. Have to be able to multitask. Basic computer skills. Be friendly with customers, show empathy."

good,"Great benefits, great job security. Promotional opportunities may be limited and management has been lacking as far as development and positive reinforcement."
good,"To each its own but technology at the Hartford is like prehistoric dial up systems. In sales i want timely responses for questions that arise. i should be confident in having a team who can guide you thru the bible of information! Omg  so much work but very little efficiency with payment systems .in a month  I lost 6 deals bc I couldnt take a payment because of system errors and the customers wanted to call back. Im all for a fast paced environment but make sure you have the technical support and advancement of modern apps and accesibility, the Hartford lack modern anything..computers are old,,the building is dusty, and the cafeteria came with the lease obviously because they over charge for everything and half the time everything is buried in cheese and an uneven colored gravy. I eventually just started getting de energized , complete burn out and  oh if its not the cafeteria, all they do is order pizza as if as an adult im supposed to get excited about getting PIZZA as recognition?? Seriously id consider if it was restaruant quality, but Im not getting excited over food my five year eats. if you practice a healthier approach to life..good luck because management will have you starved because all potlucks are pizza or tacos...no offerings of alternative meals when they were part of recognition programs. So over and irritated with this place."
good,"steady flow of work, multi-tasking necessary, good team to work with, constantly learning new culture of the company, management was not flexible with the needs (work/life balance) of the employees"
good,"I worked for The Hartford for twelve years. Beginning at an entry level position, I was giving learning & growth opportunities to learn the business, work/life balance and decision empowerment. The most difficult part of working at The Hartford was networking as many departments are siloed.  The most enjoyable part was helping others develop and achieve their professional goals."
good,"overall good company to work for "
good,"the company has top-down work / life balance culture while promoting work ethics.  Company values and recognizes employees, and encourages career development.  Numerous forums give employees plenty of opportunities to learn new initiatives."
good,This was my first job out  of college. I received comprehensive training related to the job. Hours were fixed though some overtime was available. Work life balance was great as was management.
good,"While I appreciate the idea of diversity and inclusion, the issue with Hartford is that they put so much emphasis on it that it can create an uneasiness with others.  This is the struggle with corporations keeping their employees engaged and productive.  However, in our competitive markets of insurance, they must find a way to keep and attaint quality talent.  Some.talent is derived from all walks of life but in the manner in which they wish to obtain, seems out of balance and comes at the cost of losing talent in areas of culture that make up the majority."
good,"Consistent ""finger on the pulse"" on the market...competitors, industries served, and quite nimble at anticipating needs as a result. Excellent cross-business information sharing."
good,"The job itself was great, I just had a problem with the supervisor and manager.  Not easy to get along with and very rude. The work environment was great though."

good,"The Hartford was a quick paced place and the employees were very competitive. It was a very nice place to work and the management worked very hard to make sure everything went smoothly. I worked at the actual call center for the first 6 years, and then became a remote worker working from home. I worked 8 hours a day working on the phone and computer to sell property and casualty insurance to the public. "
good,"The Hartford is a good company, with many good qualities, they are ethical, understanding of family dynamics, and filled with very talented people who work well as a team of professionals. "

good,Great community involvement and good at promoting a diverse and inclusive environment.  For a large company they do well at supporting and developing their employees.
good,"My area has a fast paced and challenging work environment.  My manager is excellent at encouraging work-life balance and avoiding burn out or over-allocation of work assignments.  There are times when working over 40 hours may be necessary, but those times are infrequent.  There are many opportunities within The Hartford, and employees are encouraged to develop their skills both to support their current role and position themselves to move into other roles or other areas of the company.  Recent changes have made the dress code more casual, with a ""dress for your day"" focus that allows more jeans and other casual wear in the office (within reason, i.e. no shorts and tanks/t-shirts).  The Hartford has a strong focus on work/life balance.  The new benefits for 2020 have increased benefits around family life including enhanced fertility coverage, adoption benefits, increased parental leave.  They are also concerned about the impact of student loan debt on an employee's life so the company is introducing a benefit to help defray some of an employee's student loan debt.  I am too old to make use of these benefits, but this is a good step to becoming a more attractive employer to the younger employee pool.  The employees I work with have a wide variety of backgrounds and The Hartford is a diverse and inclusive employer in all areas.  I have worked for The Hartford for nearly 30 years, and there have been times when I would not have strongly recommended the company as an employer of choice.  That has changed, and I am happier working for The Hartford now than I have ever been.  I would"

good,Enjoyed my career at The Hartford very much !People take their time to train you properly. Nice people. Great management. Miss Simsbury location. Great benefits.
good,The best part of the job is my daily interactions with my co-workers.  The Hartford does a good job of hiring people who fit in with the company's job culture. The company is inclusive and advancement is available.  The job is rather demanding and many struggle to maintain a good work-life balance.
good,"I began as entry level Retirement Plan Consultant and promoted to Team Lead Senior Consultant managing a team of four to five employees within the Western Region of US."
good,"I supported executives in Human Resource & Payroll Departments."

good,The Hartford was and excellent learning experience. It provided a fast paced environment and knowledgeable leaders.
good,"The best part of my day is when I can organize our staff to give back to the community.  I organized over 2000 volunteer hours in 2014 and participated in over 200 myself.  This not only allows for a great balance in the work space, our staff has positively impacted the city around them.  It's truly an honor to have this as a job requirement!"
good,The most enjoyable was taking care of my mother myself and making sure all her needs were met

good,This company is run properly by people who know the business and it seems that very few people ever leave unless they retire or they pass away suddenly (unfortunately).   The only issue with this company is they do not pay enough and the bonuses are scant.  I guess they don't have to since no one really leaves and everyone seems to be satisfied with the 30-40% more work you get saddled with during your 10-12 hour day and weekends.
good,"It's a great company to work for but very regimented and goal oriented. Great from a Management perspective perhaps but can be cumbersome and sometimes a burden to frontline sales force, who need a measure  of autonomy to succeed."
good,Good place to work.  Talented Management that are good mentors for their reports. Great atmosphere.  Helpful teammates. Positive career growth opportunities.

good,"Very stressful with micro management, which made a typical day unbearable.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with management.  The most enjoyable part was talking with multiple people from within and outside of the company."
good,"Big wheels turn slowly. The Hartford is not good at making quick decisions, but they are a stable and productive place to work. There is a collaborative culture. I do thin that Group Benefits needs to split off from the P&C business. These two areas of the company have different goals and culture and would function better if they were autonomous."
good,I loved what I did as an underwriter but my territory was too big and my brain could not take it.  The stress started taking a toll on my physical health especially my neurological health and I had no choice but to quit to get my health back.
good,"The Hartford is a good company to work for among the constellation of large companies out there. Employees are granted professional leeway if they are professionally adept, so, in most cases, you are left alone if it is known that you can deliver. It is a collaborative environment and the company makes decisions slowly, but it also offers training and a quality work environment so that you can build your skills and your way into the company culture at a reasonable pace."
good,A really nice company to work for.  It was a very relaxed job with accommodating part-time evening hours.  My training was excellent. Friendly coworkers.

good,"I only left because my position was eliminated due to a restructure. Overall the company is exceptional, there are a few bad managers, my last one was one of the bad ones, but i had several good before that one."
good,"Everything you want in a company just poor management. Great benefits, a lot of vacation time for family oriented people. Lot of different low level jobs to do through the company hard to get into upper management."
good,Great team of claims professionals who were frequently challenged. Network of claims specialists who worked well together to increase positive claim outcomes.
good,"The company has many opportunities to advance your career. The culture is positive and good work/life balance. They have trimmed their benefits for the sake of ""competitiveness"" but the benefits are still pretty good. I would work there again if I could get them to hire me. :-)"

The management seems to have the company going in a good direction and the culture is very diverse and inclusive (however, this can vary by department).  The company is slow moving and behind the curve in may aspects including but not limited to technology and employee benefits.  Overall, it is a fine company, but nothing to write home about."

good,The job was very interesting and rewarding as there were many function to perform  and many challenges that offered many learning advantages. It was easy to work with my co-workers because I enjoy people and I had and have God on my side.  I lean on God for my direction in difficult situations and it always work out.  The hardest part of the job was to learn new system changes.  The easiest part was to come to work as I enjoy accomplishing many tasks.
good,I've worked for this company for a short time but I can truly say that they genuinely care for the employees of the company. Its not only about the customers being satisfied but the inside staff as well.
good,Very rewarding and intellectually stimulating.  Great job with experienced management within the industry.

good,Great corporate environment..... a typical day is usually home officed reviewing independent adjuster claims and subsequent management. The remainder (aprox 50%) is travel to catastrophic disaster regions and performing property adjustments. Both direct management and co-workers are all treated as one unit and at the same tier. The single most hardship is the heavy and lengthy travel to CAT sites with low industry standard CAT pay. THe work is rewarding but demanding and overall a great fit for the adventurous type. The most enjoyable part of the position is positive customer feedback and knowing you helped a policy holder bring their property loss to a fair closure.

good,"My area has a fast paced and challenging work environment.  My manager is excellent at encouraging work-life balance and avoiding burn out or over-allocation of work assignments.

good,"The Hartford's greatest advantage is its internal promise to do right by their customers as much as possible. Internally, the specialty products divisions train new agents and put them in the reduced-hostile environment of warm-call sales.

As the training, marketing, and underwriting processes became more and more standardized, less talented representation was needed."

good,"The Hartford is a great place to work if you love insurance and want to grow in the insurance industry I would strongly recommend it. But if you do not like insurance or you are unsure about it, I wouldn't recommend working there because it is very very very demanding when it comes to getting what insureds and agents need. It is a high paced job and though the benefits are great, when you don't actively see yourself working in the insurance field it doesn't really help. This job is not easy, but again, if you see yourself in the insurance community it is an excellent  place to work. But it is not for everybody."

I learned a lot about Small Commercial insurance, ranging in coverage(s) provided, what factors into how the premiums are calculated, the many departments are necessary to aid customers and their businesses' protection effectively, as well as state guidelines and how they may or may not effect coverage. Understanding the Worker's Compensation and the various procedures necessary to endorse policies may have been one of my strongest growth opportunities, but with the help of call coaches, mentors, and documents provided, it became one of my easier changes to make. One of my favorite things about The Hartford is referred to as an ERG, which allows you to partake in groups that interest you personally. Sometimes work can make you feel as though you are just a number, but The Hartford makes you feel as though you actually have a name, and that name matters. I enjoy assisting customers, as well as learning the wide industry of Insurance, I am just unhappy with the work schedule and how it effects my personal life in regards to my children."

They even had a come to work in your pajamas day (decent attire of course), during the summer contests to wear shorts for a month, this REALLY boosted morale."
good,"As a customer service rep, your days are spent taking back to back calls servicing auto and homeowners insurance policies. It is very fast paced. The hardest part is that you would receive bonuses for achieving high statistics but then the company took that away from being individual stats to making it harder to achieve them by making you fall into a certain percentile country wide. Based on your skill set your bonus was determined based on where you fell in within other people in your skill sets. So if you scored a 90% and others scored 70% you were measured against them as a whole therefore your score was brought down...... so bye bye bonus. I felt that was not very fair. The morale was always up though due to great management."

good,I enjoyed working at The Hartford and regret leaving. They cared for their employees.
good,"Advancement means remote teams which makes communication more challenging. Outside of work activities were common in my office in Allentown, PA but eventually became non-existent the longer i was there."
good,Working for the Hartford was a fun experience. The Hartford culture is very accepting and informative. I would have continued working for the Hartford if it weren't for the distance from my home.
good,"Hartford has opportunities for degrees and non-degreed employees it supports careers in the us arm forces, especially heavy with naval returnees.  They are an inclusive company all around offering opportunities to continue education and certification training.  Company benefits were outstanding with accommodations for travel provided if needed."
good,I enjoyed working at The Hartford my department was like a family. It was a friendly and respectable environment to work in even with in a productive and fast pace department.
good,Plenty of opportunities to learn more and do more that what is expected. Being able to assist claimants and clients regarding the benefits and policies is very rewarding. Hopefully that are able to fully understand their query.
good,The Hartford Financial Services company is a great company to work for as they promote diversity and inclusion and work/life balance. Also provides for upward mobility.
good,"The Hartford is a great, well managed company that likes to promote from within. If you do your job well you will receive appropriate recognition that is encouraged and felt from upper management and on down. Very flexible work arrangements, many employees are able to work from home at least 1 day a week if not more. Pay is appropriate and commensurate with performance."
good,Amazing company to work for. Caseloads can be hard to manage with the amount of claims that you receive at one time. Would highly recommend the company.
good,They are good to work for but once you're hired for a schedule they are not very flexible with time changes. In sales there's generous compensation with plenty of opportunity for bonus.
good,Id say the work was very appealing to me along with the pay. The culture is a bit slow but expected in the insurance industry. There are areas where you could be involved in innovation
good,"Hartford was a great company. Had the company remained in San Diego I would likely still be employed there. Great people, great advancement opportunities, great company."
good,"The Hartford is a fast paced place to work especially within IT. "
good,"My area has a fast paced and challenging work environment.  My manager is excellent at encouraging work-life balance and avoiding burn out or over-allocation of work assignments.  There are times when working over 40 hours may be necessary, but those times are infrequent.  There are many opportunities within The Hartford, and employees are encouraged to develop their skills both to support their current role and position themselves to move into other roles or other areas of the company.  Recent changes have made the dress code more casual, with a ""dress for your day"" focus that allows more jeans and other casual wear in the office (within reason, i.e. no shorts and tanks/t-shirts).  The Hartford has a strong focus on work/life balance.  The new benefits for 2020 have increased benefits around family life including enhanced fertility coverage, adoption benefits, increased parental leave.  They are also concerned about the impact of student loan debt on an employee's life so the company is introducing a benefit to help defray some of an employee's student loan debt.  I am too old to make use of these benefits, but this is a good step to becoming a more attractive employer to the younger employee pool.  The employees I work with have a wide variety of backgrounds and The Hartford is a diverse and inclusive employer in all areas.  I have worked for The Hartford for nearly 30 years, and there have been times when I would not have strongly recommended the company as an employer of choice.  That has changed, and I am happier working for The Hartford now than I have ever been.  I would"
good,"I was lucky to always have good bosses during my tenure at The Hartford.  As long as you were doing your job, you were well compensated.  The only downfall was QA.  They operated as mostly a ""Got you"" dept pointing out things wrong in files instead of being the training ground it was supposed to be, and often times, this dept controlled whether or not you got a bonus.  Most of the people in this dept couldn't cut it on a production desk, and I think there was a lot of animosity toward those underwriters who were very successful in their production roles.  Otherwise, it was a great company."
good,"The Hartford is a long standing company with a good reputation. The workplace was upbeat and provided many growth opportunities. I took away some wonderful skills when working for this company. Unfortunately, our area was sold off in 2012."
good,Got good experience and paid fairly for a summer internship. Worked with a team and was able to travel with the company. I would highly recommend this company.
good,"i unfortunately had to leave The Hartford, but is is an amazing place to work and the people are great. They set you up for a job that is not going to fail you."
good,The only issue I had was that they didn't understand that people have a life outside of work. What I did like is that my co workers were friendly and there was room for advancement.
good,Very micromanaged company who rates employees by production and numbers. Management was very compassionate and always dedicated to help build employees.
good,"A typical day at work was very busy, fast paced,  rewarding.  I learned how to cancel and rewrite workers compensation, commercial auto, and liability insurance policies, work alone as well as with others on various think tank projects, and how to be an advocate for the policy holders with their business needs. "
good,"Every day is different and interesting. It's a fast-paced job with a lot of work, but there's a good management team and culture."
good,"Call center is like any other, very fast paced and little to no time in between calls. If you exceed certain metrics you will be eligible for monthly bonuses. They invest ALOT into training and actually value their employees. Advancement is attainable especially with the backing of management. They really want you to have a career and will help you get to the position that you want."
good,"A typical day entails processing claims, speaking to employers, claimants, and medical personnel regarding policies."
good,The Hartford is a great company.  Excellent PTO and compensation packages. Work/Life balance is incredible.  Very flexible with when you work.
good,Excellent product portfolio backed by well managed underwriting!
good,My co-workers where the best. I have learn amazing information in regards to the insurance field. The hardest part was leaving.
good,"We always had enough work to keep us busy and that made the day go by very quickly.  We were always thoroughly trained to perform our duties excellently and if there was something that you didn't understand, there was always someone you could contact.  My manager was one of the best managers I have had at The Hartford.  My coworkers were super to work with.  We were always willing to help out each other. "
good,"A typical day would be receiving calls from customers who needed to file worker's compensation claims. They would describe their injuries and then I would code the injury and the body part that was affected. I learned there are all types of injuries that can occur on jobs."
good,"The work was interesting, but a bit overwhelming at times. Corporate attitude toward staffing meant that you always had just a little more on your plate than you could accomplish each day, but overall, it wasn't a complete madhouse. Management is very corporate but workable. Compensation is excellent."
good,"Pleasant office setting. Managers and supervisors are friendly, fair and respectful. Good amount of PTO and good recognition of the need for work/life balance. Decent salary and benefits. Very trusting environment and emphasis placed on self-regulating success and efficiency (managers don't hover over you, looking for every little mistake)."
good,Very Good Company to work
good,"Customer service, processing claims for damages for customers. enjoyed helping smoothing the customers attitude."

good,Good company to work for  training is good   Management in my department was very good and easy to speak with  the only reason I left was the department I worked in was being closed
good,Great company but should invest in new ways to implement work-life balance. Also should require leadership training with team leaders. They also have the opportunity to work from home if your work ethics are achieving.
good,"The Hartford, and the insurance industry as a whole, offer all different types of roles including data, analytics, technology and innovation.  While the pace can be tough to keep up with, the overall culture is great.  Don't expect to work 40 hrs a week, but expect to have a challenging career and for your contributions to be appreciated.  The ELT asks for feedback and listens - they take the employee survey seriously and work to implement changes. Great benefits."
good,"The Hartford was a good place for me, a good fit.  Great unity among team mates.  Management was willing to work with you. One on one coaching with your manager once every two weeks helped with great feedback."
good,"The company has great benefits, and goes out of their way to help you.  My biggest problem was having to work every other Saturday, and the software they use is very antiquated, and is NOT user friendly, it took 15 minutes for a simple Zipcode change."
good,Managers are trained to lead effective teams and coach their team members.  Employees meet frequently with their managers to focus on personal development.  The company has an extensive library of learning materials to create self-directed learning plans.  Internal transfers are encouraged to promote skill development and provide additional career opportunities.
good,Worked there for a little over a year. It was a great place to work. Work schedules vary but most are Monday thru Friday. It's fast paced and high stress. They do recognize hard work.
good,very professional and caring only issue i ever had with this company was that i did not want to answer phones anymore. You only are on the phones for a certain period of time before you can begin to do more.
good,Hartford spent the last few years developing software and system management. At this time they focusing on employee and management development. Hartford has received many aware for quality work environment.
good,"Overall the company fosters a positive work environment where employees respect each other.  Through the years I have seen things that have made me shake my head; employee favoritism, employees taking advantage of the freedom they had in their roles, and selfish leaders.  On a positive note the company highly encourages internal growth and promotions so if you work hard and network with the right people, it does not go unnoticed."
good,"Excellent place to work "
good,"Healthy working culture, believes in team effort, cooperative teams."
good,"The Hartford Insurance Group has a concerted effort in focusing on the development of the individual contributor.  This is found not just at the Senior Management level, but also with the Front Line staff.  I retired from The Hartford after 21 years, and can say that this is what was most outstanding about the company."
good,"The Hartford is a great company to grow and be promoted.  The Hartfords staff consistently provides the training regularly to promote growth for each employee.  My typical day of work at the Hartford included but not limited to answering the phone, assisting customers with changes to their policies while underwriting the changes.  I was also cross trained in the billing so I was able to assist customers in changing their bill plan and make any necessary payments or payment arrangements."
good,"New management and leadership has a strong strategy and facilitates strong environment of passion for the people and winning in the marketplace.  Sometime this experience can get lost in middle management but that's to be expected in a company this size.  "
good,Provided excellent customer service to all AARP members & Hartford policyholders (internal/external)
good,"As with any large corporation, surrounding yourself with good peers and maangement is key to success.  I believe this exists for the most part."

good,"Worked here for over a decade. This company puts significant emphasis on continued education for employees and providing exceptional customer service in an effort to remain elite in the industry. "
good,I am happy working for The Hartford.  The Hartford provides the tools needed and a positive place to work.  Management is fair and if you need additional training it always given to the employee with no negative feedback.  I work with a bunch of positive like minded people and enjoy going to work with them on a daily basis.  The hardest part of the job is being tied to the phone and being on such a ridged schedule.  The most enjoyable part of my job is helping the patients telephonic and making the short term disability process less stressful for the injured or sick patient.  I am looking for a job that is closer to my parents because my father is not in good health.  The Hartford does not have a job available in the area for me to transfer to at this time.  I hope to find another employer that is as wonderful as The Hartford.

good,"This was a fast paced environment with great teamwork. The opportunities for advancement there was awesome. I promoted up every 6 months during the first year of my employment there. At that time they had a retirement plan in place.  Caseloads were high for most adjusters, only lower when the client on dedicates accounts required it.  The hardest part of the job was the high case loads and the strict California laws and handling requirement. There was always good teamwork and a general overall working environment."

I would be passed over for better positions due to the fact that I was such a value as an examiner. But being that  was such a high producer in the end didn't help me it hindered me as team leader didn't want to lose me.Syracuse Hartford but they actually brought it other work from other offices I had no issue taking on this work however monetarily it would have been nice 3 recognized as the top producer in the company"

They are also concerned about the impact of student loan debt on an employee's life so the company is introducing a benefit to help defray some of an employee's student loan debt.  I am too old to make use of these benefits, but this is a good step to becoming a more attractive employer to the younger employee pool.  The employees I work with have a wide variety of backgrounds and The Hartford is a diverse and inclusive employer in all areas.  I have worked for The Hartford for nearly 30 years, and there have been times when I would not have strongly recommended the company as an employer of choice.

good,"My area has a fast paced and challenging work environment.  My manager is excellent at encouraging work-life balance and avoiding burn out or over-allocation of work assignments.  There are times when working over 40 hours may be necessary, but those times are infrequent.  There are many opportunities within The Hartford, and employees are encouraged to develop their skills both to support their current role and position themselves to move into other roles or other areas of the company.

good,"I love working at The Hartford.  However,  I need more than a temp position at this time.  "

You will learn how to make changes to insurance policies and to some extent how to read the policies.

The only hard part of the job was learning to live with the repetitiveness of the tasks that you perform.

I have to say that going remote has allowed me to be a better mother, which has made me a better employee.  As a remote employee, I actually work more hours than I did when in the office but I don't mind.  With the Hartford being a large company you have the ability to expand your knowledge and change job functions within the company if you choose.  The drawback, because it's a large company, it takes a while to learn all the intricacies of the company.  My managers, co-workers and agents are the reason I love to come to work every day.  The Hartford does take it’s time to fill empty positions, that is because they ensure the hire is a good fit for the team."

good,I have have nothing but great things to say about the company itself. The managers are great and the company as a whole spends a lot of time training you to do your job. Unfortunately there are rather high expectations in your role. Moving up in the company seems to be rather hard as well.
good,I enjoyed my employment with the company. you would come in get started and feel a sense of achievement at the end of the day. Managers would compensate jobs well done with merit raises and bonuses.
good,"Being surrounded by good co-workers with a team like mentality makes working and learning easy. With opportunities throughout my years with the company have made me a ""one stop shop"" for our customers. Management was always involved with their employees displaying genuine concern when things were not quit right and our voice for the company at times. The hardest part of the job at times were the calls during our busiest times of the year. The company did always work to make their employees feel appreciated often times celebrating the customer services environment with pizza parties and fun days making what we do feel like we really make a difference."

The management is very professional. My coworkers are very talented an interesting. The hardest part of the job is being flexible and still meeting all of the deadlines. Travel is the most enjoyable
good,"I have worked in various departments within this organization however my current position as a Direct Sales Commercial Underwriter is by far the best decision I have made in my career to date. The people I work with (locally) are AMAZING. They feel like a family and are truly supportive. In what you would think would be a cut throat sales environment, everyone reaches out and supports eachother. They are supportive, appreciative and are congratulatory when you do well. I enjoy the non- Politically Correct feel the team has. I am not afraid to voice my opinion or to officr solutions. The company takes ideas to heart and they easily go as far as the CEO of the company. I feel as though management for the most part have open ears. They hear us. Change takes FOREVER to happen but eventually it does. HIG is conservative in their approach to EVERYTHING. That is probably my only complaint. "
good,Since I have worked here as a contractor I have seen plenty of reasons why I would say this is the place to work the people who work here are some of the best to work with and every body is treated well across the board.
good,i was able to learn a wide variety of jobs and able to move from one department to another in the beginning. When I left there was not as many departments.

good,"As a business analyst my job was to assure projects were released on time and without errors.  I wrote specifications that included all departments that were impacted by the project, which could be between 5-12 different departments.  At times this could be challenging because I would be working on several other projects at the same time.   My roll was not only that of a business analyst, but I was also the project manager.

My co-workers are great and try to be as helpful as they can.  The job is demanding, competitive, and can be stressful at times.

good,I've been with the Hartford for over 15 years now.  During this time the company has changed it's culture and the way we work.  There are quite a few remote positions available and the employees really do have a say in how some of our roles are done.  The benefits are great also.

good,"A typical day of work depends on your working style. There are people who work from 7am to 7pm, and other who work from 8:30am to 4:30pm. The company values your time and there is a strong culture of working hard and leaving when your work is done. They treat employees very well and have a good compensation package. The workplace culture promotes collaborative work and projects. Lateral movements are common and encouraged. Recent acquisitions have given an uplifting sentiment in the office about the future prospects and is a vote of confidence from management."
good,"There is a balance of project style work with rate reviews. They provide a great deal of training. "
good,Pay is below market.  Make sure to check carefully pay ranges before accepting the job. Management is sincere and will support your growth.  Great place to start.

good,"Review medical information to determine weather to approve or deny disability claims.  Provide claims management for existing ongoing claims to determine continued disability in accordance to company guidelines.  Provide customer service to claimants over the telephone  to advise of medical information needed to extend disability claim.  During the 8 years i worked for Hartford, I gained an extensive knowledge of the claims management process, medical terminology, codes and proper protocol for the treatment of various medical conditions.  I would say the hardest part of the job was advising claimants of the denial of there claims."
good,"The Hartford is a great company to work for offering a good work/life balance through flexible work arrangements and remote worker options. The benefits are great and very competitive. You work hard but you are compensated for your efforts so you can move up the corporate ladder quickly, or be in a position you enjoy for a long time. The choice is yours."

good,"Incredibly challenging and diverse working environment.  Management & staff incredibly supportive but there are large amounts of workload.  Believe it or not work life balance was great, how/where you get the work completed."
good,"The Hartford is a great place to work. The culture is like no other I have ever experienced. Since transitioning to a behavior based performance model there is so much more collaboration and support from all angles. No one is out to ""pad their numbers"" as performance objectives are merely indicators and not final performance evaluations. This allows everyone to focus on the task at hand rather than their ""numbers."" Managers and senior leadership are committed to coaching and developing their people which creates a higher level of engagement and accountability. Unfortunately, the Hartford does not have clearly defined career pathways at the entry level which leads to the ""more work, less pay"" mentality. Roles have a very broad spectrum of knowledge and accountability which can be frustrating when you are required to know so much. Being that Hartford has been around for so long they understand how costs can be an impact to sustainability. That can lead to increased workloads at all levels which can be frustrating."
good,"I enjoy working for The Hartford. It is good place with great staff. At the same time, with the shift I have had now for over a year, there is no work life balance."

good,"The Hartford was flexible & understanding when I had a family emergency and then suffered a mild heart attack. They allowed me to scale back my hours and migrate to a less stressful job task requested by my doctor. My compensation remained the same which was appreciated. My only disappointment with the company was their decision to outsource some of the jobs to foreign countries thereby costing American's jobs. And in the name of progress, outsourcing cost me my perfect job and I was truly disappointed. The most enjoyable part of my job was that I worked at my own pace and routine and ALWAYS completed my work. It was stress free and I enjoyed what I did. I made many friends over the years and could make conversation with almost anyone."

Management was very particular about report writing and was always there to help you with any questions that you might have.. You were always presented with additional training to help you in your career success.
good,Planco was a great success story as the founders created an environment where hard work would lead to success in ways you could never have imagined. When The Hartford purchased Planco and the resources and product offers grew rapidly with the sales force the company was #1 in all distribution channels.

Although, my original career goals did not include working for an insurance company, I did need something that provided stable and predictable work hours along with benefits, so I applied to The Hartford.

I interact with people of all levels, from peers to executives; no matter the job title, everyone I've dealt with is respectful of one another and values differing ideas.

good,"A typical day at work for me is to clock in,clock into the phones and help customers with their auto needs. i.e. buying a new car, getting rid of an old car. What i didn't like about the jon is when the rates went up and having to explain why. If you have never has an insurance background it can be very confusing with all of the factors that go in to rating a policy and the risks involved. But the best part of the day is being able to explain and really go over each rating policy so the client understands why rates go up and down. r. The hardest part of my day is when a co worker promises a customer something that is totally out of range and I am stuck having to fix the mistake. Although it isn't a problem for me, and I always retain my report with my customers to keep them with us. At times that can be frustrating. I love dealing with irate customers, because at the end of the day it's not you they are worried about, it's usually something they're going through and they just need someone to listen. Listening is one of my strongest qualities, working with people is something I've always done and am happy to do. I have always been praised by customers on what a great job I am doing. It's things like that, that make me proud of my work because i always give over 100% in everything that I do. I would love to share my experience and help a company grow with my foot in the door and my chance to show my skills you will see the changes as we grow together."

good,"My area has a fast paced and challenging work environment.  My manager is excellent at encouraging work-life balance and avoiding burn out or over-allocation of work assignments.

The new benefits for 2020 have increased benefits around family life including enhanced fertility coverage, adoption benefits, increased parental leave.

I am too old to make use of these benefits, but this is a good step to becoming a more attractive employer to the younger employee pool.  The employees I work with have a wide variety of backgrounds and The Hartford is a diverse and inclusive employer in all areas.

There are many opportunities within The Hartford, and employees are encouraged to develop their skills both to support their current role and position themselves to move into other roles or other areas of the company.  Recent changes have made the dress code more casual, with a ""dress for your day"" focus that allows more jeans and other casual wear in the office (within reason, i.e. no shorts and tanks/t-shirts).  The Hartford has a strong focus on work/life balance.  The new benefits for 2020 have increased benefits around family life including enhanced fertility coverage, adoption benefits, increased parental leave.  They are also concerned about the impact of student loan debt on an employee's life so the company is introducing a benefit to help defray some of an employee's student loan debt.  I am too old to make use of these benefits, but this is a good step to becoming a more attractive employer to the younger employee pool.  The employees I work with have a wide variety of backgrounds and The Hartford is a diverse and inclusive employer in all areas.  I have worked for The Hartford for nearly 30 years, and there have been times when I would not have strongly recommended the company as an employer of choice.  That has changed, and I am happier working for The Hartford now than I have ever been.  I would"
