rating,review
bad,Management/Ownership is in it for themselves with zero regard for employees. As an employee you do not matter and are compensated as such. Be prepared for a corporate environment where the least logical decisions are the ones made.
bad,No chance of promotion unless you are popular with upper management. Too much focus on pitching the credit card no one wants. Dumb decisions by the Bass Pro overlords constantly. Constantly overworked and underpaid.
bad,"I worked as a gun vault specialist, responsible for all ATF paperwork, receiving guns, selling guns, shipping gun, ect."
bad,I did not enjoy working at Cabela's.  Very difficult times there under the BassPro acquisition.  Long hours are required; open availability if you are a full time employee.
bad,"Bad management "
bad,Horrible place to work and you are treated like cattle! There goal is 100 percent turnover! When you figure out they want all your labor and skills for free you are simply replaces! Don’t waste your time!!
bad,"Looking for a place where you’ll never get to socialize with anyone? Looking for a place where you’ll be inside a long truck, with little to no light for 7+ hours? Or not get provided a dusk mask when there is so much dust flying around and into your nose ? This is the place. Management doesn’t care about It’s employees, especially temporary. They won’t bother getting to know your name, or having any manners when they’re talking to you, they never show you the proper way of stacking until you mess up and get yelled at for something that wasn’t even your fault. I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone, but if you’re in financial crisis then it’s understandable ."
bad,"Helped opened the store. Made quota on getting credit cards. Was the first person to let go. There were other workers that didn't do what they needed to do, but kept them. A bit of racism went on there. Glad I had a back up job when they let me go. That's why their business isn't doing well. Their Moto doesn't match up with their business."
bad,"I worked for Cabela's for over a year. During that time I saw turn-over faster than any company that I've worked for. Management play favorites and will cover-up misconduct by those that are favored. Almost everyone that works there is unsatisfied and over worked due chronic understaffing. You will be hired for one job, paid for one job, and expected to work many jobs. Outfitters that work the floor are also harassed on a daily basis to sell credit cards. I sold over 150 cards this past year and that still wasn't enough. The store manager finds it acceptable to yell and dress-down to employees at all levels. The only training you receive is on how to sell club cards, diversity training, and harassment training. No product training is done whatsoever: you are expected to learn about products on you own time at home. The store lacks integrity with how they deal with customers and employees."
bad,"My experience working for Cabelas in Utah was poor. Their employees are dispensable and are treated as such. The hours are horrendous and pay/benefits unfair, especially for the ‘bottom end’ workers.  Management was inexperienced and didn’t know how to run a company or take care of their workers. What appeared to be an honorable and successful company to be a part of, turned out to be a horrible mistake."
bad,I recommend working here if you want to make minimum wage as a first job. The managers have multiple pending EEOC complaints about them so diverse groups need not apply if looking for ethical pay and treatment.
bad,"No set place to work.  Rampant favoritism among the supervisors.  No help with mental health issues.  Micromanaging!!!!!  Difficult commute for me.  Discount was not applicable.  Thanksgiving work, Black Friday.  micromanaging.  Eavesdropping."
bad,"The management section shouldn’t even receive a star. There is a lot of favoritism here. People who hardly worked got to move up because of favoritism. Those of us who worked our butts off for the company got told we weren’t “qualified” enough to move into different areas of the building. Managers will talk to you like you are dirt on the bottom of their shoes. And if you really like making the public mad, work here! You are required to get a credit card every shift. Management is more concerned about getting credit cards rather then making sales. Many customers walk out angry without anything because they are tired of being bothered. This place is PATHETIC! I would suggest going anywhere else but here. If only corporate saw how the managers treated the workers. I quit after a manager pulled me aside and was completely rude and when I tried to defend myself he told me to shut up! Do yourself a favor and don’t apply here!"
bad,Went for 3 interviews I have many years of retail experience.I was interviewed for boat and marina the department management wanted to hire me.Then I interviewed with the store manager and he acted like I was lying about my experience.He wanted to.put me in the back room unloading truck.Was a total waste of time as this guy was just being rude the whole time..
bad,"Think of the management/employee life of wal-mart, mixed with a sporting goods store. Don't get me wrong, i met some very competent  people who were kind hearted, intelligent, passionate about outdoor life that were customers and co-workers... however, they were the exception and not the rule. Management drove a lot of problems, and have no issue throwing subordinates under the bus or cutting employee hours to achieve bonuses. Management seemed to treat bonuses like an expectation of their salary, not an incentive for quality work. If drama between sales floor staff was bad, between management departments it's worse. It's okay, if it's a seasonal, temp, or part time gig, but don't commit. applicants talents will be recognized in great degree in other companies."
bad,It was a decent place to work the pay was ok the people where the best part it just changed after bass pro bought them out and so it just became a different company
bad,"Someone please help us! HR lying to new hires and blaming them quitting after a week on outfits not being  ""nice"" is no way to run a company.  Maybe if you told people they would be working an extra one to two days a week for the foreseeable future when you hire them they could decide before they accept the job if they can work that schedule.  Making loyal employees feel like they are replaceable ""bodies"" and have no value kills morale. I feel stupid for still working there."
bad,They lie about your job title and and they lie to try and fire you they don’t care if you get hurt at work they will fire you for it even if your doctor says your not medically clear management bases there trust in you on rumors they make you work 5 12 hour shifts some weeks they over work you tell you can’t do it anymore more people are quitting and no one is applying do not apply for here
bad,Already answered under the cons category. The new management as of 2019 including leadouts do not have a clue whats going on. I was laid off for a mo due to being pt although i was interested in ft. After working a week from being laid off i never did get a phone call back informing me if i had to work or not.
bad,"no way to advance or get a raise after 4years. (only raise I received after my 4th year was 3 cents, and didn't have another one after that) the only reason I stayed as long as I did was because I was going to school and the manager they managed not to fire for 2 years worked with my school schedule. they could never keep a manager staffed in the department and they let them go for stupid reasons. the department went a year and a half without a manager."
bad,Over the year and a half of working there I went through 3 mangers. The management could care less about you as employee. Upper management would always hide in their offices and would only come out when they have tasks to divvy out. This especially happened when you where with customers or at the end of your shift and they would come up to you and ask you to get the task done. Front end was also very disorganized as the company could not hold a cashier to save their lives. The mangers were very rude to the employees forcing them to quit or walk out. By the end of my employment the CLUB card became such a nuisance that none of the other outfitters wanted to promote. CLUB was virtually shoved down the customers throats as soon as they would walk into the door.
bad,"Management only cares about keeping their jobs as managers and are not apt to be managers. They ask everyone to do their job for them, and will go out of their way to make sure someone else does it. Including but not limited to, stuff out of our pay and without professional aid to replace carpet, electric, computer hardware, software and paint! They expect associates to do absolutely everything that is asked of them knowing full well it is meant to ""make it look like you are busy"". Not only do they not care about their employees but they are blatant about it, they also flaunt having extra money and authority over people based on their credit card sales and personal bonuses because of each credit card sale. Lastly, not a single manager is familiar with the products the store sells."
bad,The employees and management are overly disorganized. They don't understand their own system and overambition leads to backstabbing within the workplace.
bad,"It was a great place to work at first, New management took over and everything went down hill, wages aren't enough, they started firing people who worked hard and kept people who couldn't be bothered to help out their team the firearms lead was lazy, management saw it and didn't do anything about it. Would not recommend working for this place at all unless your part time. turn over rate is so high its crazy."
bad,"The management was absolutely horrible. They are all a bunch of liars and manipulative. Rare and few times they actually help the outfitters, they mostly hide in their offices and don't face any of the customer concerns."
bad,"I worked hard for 8 yrs at the gun counter. It was good for the most part. People I worked with, customers, and the ability to work deals. But, the pay sucked and the managers were horrible to work with and lied a lot until most were fired upon the BP takeover.(only good thing to happen) Store manager scott johns was not productive and atayed away from most departments. He only cared about club cards and bragged that he went to NASCAR with the BP owner and he's being treated well. That's all he talked about in the meeting. Then we lost employee perks. Then hours were being reduced. Gotta put trigger locks on all guns. Cant dry fire or we'll be terminated. Many new rules were implemented and It became difficult to provide salesmanship. It was hard to work there any longer. I hear that ALL firearms have to be put in the vault every night and brought out in the morning. That's a ton of bs work and I feel bad for them."
bad,"The Managers especially the hunting manager, are incompetent, all they care about is club cards they constantly lie to employees and customers. They don't care what they say you are treated like dirt, it's only about club cards which is a total scam."
bad,"I did not feel valued, overloaded with unattainable goals with no work/life balance. I did not feel that I had any opportunity to promote and the managers did not seem to care about the company or productivity achievement."
bad,"In my position I had to answer the phones and direct them to the proper department. I disbursed equipment to employees and was responsible for turning in equipment every night."
bad,"Poor managers, it was great before the store opened, once the doors where open to the public the management went down hill. They did not care about you or your family."
bad,Basically I was told it would be a year-and-a-half almost before I could take a day off. They said I was hired full-time. That used to mean something. Back in the day. Now all it means is that you are committed to them full-time and they don't have to give you anything in return. Told there was opportunity for overtime but then when I got there was told it was mandatory. You will get home have to go to bed  and turn around and get up in a few hours before you even had any sleep.  Do this for 4 or 5 days. So tired on your day off that you will sleep all day then turn around and start all over again. As soon as you're hired they will try to start getting rid of you for some reason. They act like they wants people to work for them but then when you get there they act like they want to get rid of you and you can't get rid of you fast enough. They run constant ads on the radio to hire people but guess what it runs all the time. Which tells me that no one really stays there worse than a revolving door. They think if they feed you they own you. Everyone's worried about losing their jobs. They're all uptight and scared about their future. It's a big secret as to what is expected of you. Some closely guarded secret because if they tell you then you will know how to do your job and you will be able to compete with the long term employees. No vacation days. No paid time off. No unpaid leave. You have to be there and on time or else! Expensive health insurance. No 401k. The only difference between this place and a concentration camp is the fact that you have to drive yourself back and forth
bad,"You can be fired for another department that isn't your responsibility or designated position and title. I learned how to become self sufficient hunting,fishing,camping and live like a hermit. This is retail not culture.Management is Poor!!!The job is not enjoyable!!!!"
bad,I was maintenance and my boss  wanted to look good so you had to bust your back to make him and the higher managers look great the rest of the crew will talk about you and the crew to better them Don’t work for them Low pay and they don’t care about you or anybody just money
bad,"It was a nice job, but manager were just unjust and unfair. I was told I was going to be able to switch departments, but then I was stripped of that for no reason, and other people (non African American) were switch right away. Just seemed a little fishy to me."
bad,Very disappointing to be with a company for almost 6 years to have my position dissolved out of the blue. I was very upset and new management did not care. I would NEVER give them a good review and I do not even shop there any longer. They lost a lot of amazing employees.
bad,The company doesn’t like employees that have a life after work. So they will change the schedule without notice. They don’t care if your life doesn’t work out with the schedule.
bad,"Open availability is a must, no exceptions.  Discount went downhill by a lot when BassPro took the company over.  They removed the discount on many things and also removed the military discount on the same things.  Total disrespect towards the employees and the Military community."
bad,"Not great for people trying to make a career out of it. They promise you in the beginning that you are family, but push comes to shove, they do not. Its all upper management. Unstable, and shifty."
bad,Everything about this place was horrible. the management was a bunch of fat lazy pigs. They over worked and under paid their people. The employees were a bunch of temp to perm hires.
bad,Low pay for so much testing training and nonsense ....4 different boss saying 4 different things. ..no co-workers have experience in hunting big game...witch I thought was a joke...they always talk down on cheaper items and up sell thier brand name junk.. cabelas club card is a joke on employees and customers...cabelas is a hire and fire program to cut over head costs. The discount employees get is nice but who can afford it with such low pay.
bad,"Should be a fun place to work if you are looking for something to do, and don't need to make a living. Unfortunately Cabela's thinks they are something they are not. It is a low level retail job at best!"
bad,"Se*ual harassment at its finest. screamed at on a daily basis then showered with lotions, flowers. this happened only to the female employees, mind you. I lasted 9 months"
bad,This is a very stressful place to work I would not recommend this place to work to even my worst enemy the management was not able to perform their jobs
bad,Very mom and pops management team. Promote only friends. Have a homophobic culture and a hatred for ethnic people. Do not be desperate enough to have to work for these people.
bad,"Managers do zero work. They are to busy in their office watching sports or surfing the web. They constantly want you to push their credit card on customers. If you are a brown noser and suck up to the managers, this is the place to be. Most employees are hard workers just trying to get by and good people."
bad,"I have had multiple retail and customer service jobs, but this job has challenged me the most. Working with people can be such an exciting and rewarding job, but can also be one of the most difficult. I have experienced a lot of segregation and racism while working at Cabelas. I have a positive energy that I hoped to share, but Cabelas is not the company that cares for its employees. I would love to move on from Cabelas to share my positive energy and make a difference."
bad,"thanks to the off seasons you will have anywhere from 8-20 hours a week. if you're lucky enough you could have 30, but it doesn't happen very often. too be blunt it was the worst job i ever held."
bad,"Scheduling is awful. You can book one single day off 3+ months in advance and you won't get the day off. "
bad,"Carpooled down to Wheeling to work, they'd only have us work 2 to 4 hours some days then ship us off. Had us sweeping constantly because they couldn't find things for us to do. Pay was low and they had a weekly ""pay cap"" for employees. I was promised multiple times that I would be moved to another area, but it never happened. One day I just woke up and decided I never wanted to go back."
bad,The people who do the least or not up to expectations seem to be rewarded the most. Senior leaders value only those who can make themselves look good without appreciation to the workers.
bad,"Work environment is very poor, management is also very very poor on keeping employees. I like the people I work with but can't stand the way I am treated from day to day."
bad,"Your peers are all hourly and only work 40 hrs for the same pay you make working 50hrs. Don't stop someone from stealing because they will fire you (why do you think there is an opening in Reno now?) The managers above you are the typical backstabbers who say one thing to your face or nothing at all, and then lie about you when they get the chance."
bad,Terrible place to work. General manager is a coward and just worthless. Human resource manager you would think they would be in the store to assist employees but you'll never find her there or if she is there it's for an hour here or there but spend her time gossiping. Structure is terrible customer service isn't terrible drown the customers with the club card. I feel bad for the employees still there most if not all dread going to work there bc of the terrible upper management. The rest of the supervisors just gossip and don't work at all. Makes you wonder why bass pro would want to buy this dying company.
bad,great place to work but very unorganized there are favorites and its very obvious to see it. the management is very disorganized  and often struggle to schedule.
bad,"HORRIBLE.....HORRIBLE....structured with NO ""outside of the box"" thinking.  Trained rats running the maze for NO  cheese prize. Swearing...in the midst of training"
bad,"Work Prairie du chien and it's absolutely  horrible.  The 2am and 4am groups are horrible  to work with and the female coordinator has her total favorites especially  if your male. I hate working there. They pressure you to do things you are comfortable  with.  And their seasonals getbabiedon't have to do anything while their regulars have to do the work. I highly recommend  no body  work there. Lies, lies, lies. Their 4 am lead is horrific.  Very bossy."
bad,I was able to utilize my experience with fly fishing. It was fun to teach and learn about the different outdoor products that were available. The co-workers were fun and knowledgeable.
bad,"Worst management team I have ever worked for in 40 years of experience. They seemed to take excessive pride in the fact that most had worked previously for a whole year at a now defunct Target. I saw no evidence of training, education or leadership abilities. Open door policy and being part of the ""Cabela's Family"" was laughable. I watched as mature, experienced and capable  ""outfitters"" were ""laid off"" or hours cut so sharply they had no choice but to move on. (Can you survive on 8 hours a week?), of course not,but teenage students sure can.I believe that Cabela's was once a decent company to work for, now I advise you to stay far far away....."
bad,"When in a role where you ""work along side managers"", they take advantage of you when they know you won't/can't tell them no."
bad,"Great people to work with except management, they never could get their act together, and they really didn't care about their employees."
bad,I would never recommend anyone to work there. They treat their employees poorly. There is a lot of drama. The bosses show favoritism.
bad,"Corporate culture is modeled on middle-school cliques.  You're also monitored how many times you get up to stretch your legs or go to the bathroom.  (Not good if you suffer from poor digestion and/or cramped legs!)"
bad,The only good thing about working here was the people I met and worked with otherwise you get horrible hours if you get any hours at all. The merchandise is so over priced that when the sale goals are not met they cut hours. They fired full time people and brought some back part time so they can use them as they see please. The management shows favoritism and they don't really care about you at all. You'll work every weekend too so good luck trying to see your family. They are short staffed so good luck getting a break or lunch. Definately overworked for the little pay and little hours that you get.
bad,"unpack truck, restock shelves, and back stock excessive products. I learned absolutely nothing from this co-workers are very rude, gossip about each other, also don't work as a team."
bad,"I am not going talk bad about Cabela's as a whole because I don't know about other stores but I do know Cabela's in Rogers Minnesota is the worst place I have ever worked for. I have worked for a few places and I have never see such bad management from every angle. The store manager is hardly there and has favorites and honestly looks down on outfitters. I have seen him literally yell at people and have put them down, including myself. You have managers having relations and not approptiate with outfitters or each other, which is against policy. You have managers favoring outfitters that than don't have to work as hard but have the hard workers either get bad shifts or great treated like nothing. I was a lead and I seen a lot of things happen. I was there for three years and can honestly say it wore me down physically and mentally. The communication is horrific and than is blamed on you as a lead because you're under the manager. Managers hardly work and just hang out in their bullpen (cubical's). All they want is money, sales, and club cards. They focus on club cards way too much and customers get angry for being bothered in every department. There is a lot of standing around and talking instead of working. Since I've left the I've noticed the lack of staffing due to people quitting, including a lot of my friends. It's dirty and not organized at all from when I first started three years ago. Amy Wolfe was the GM when I started and she was amazing!!! I also had Corry for my corp manager and she was amazing as well. These new management is the worst and they have no heart into"
bad,"horrible place to work, horrible benefits, horrible pay, cant move up in company very fast"
bad,Spent four months with micromanagement supervisor having poor sales skills. She spent most of the time on the computer trying to understand the system. Did every job including stocking and selling merchandise. Was the best sales person they ever had. Rude and ignorant supervisor with poor management skills; got tired of her yelling at me in front of customers when I took my scheduled breaks. The management needs stress management training. Upper management attitude does not filter down to lower management. Too much price changing for friends and favorite employees.
bad,"I really liked my job, but none of my bosses knew what they were doing."
bad,I enjoy working at Cabela's but I feel there is no future there. When the rush is over your hours are cut.
bad,I learned how to operate more than just a forlift so I liked that.
bad,"I experienced very little support from upper management. And don't plan on support from human resources, they are completely incompetent.  They are only out for themselves. It's a numbers game. Being employed there you will not be unique or special. Everyone was replaceable. And if you have an opinion you will be replaced before you even see it coming. Beware......this is not a company to build your future with. "
bad,"I was very unimpressed with the Cabelas managemnt. The management at Cabelas doesn't seem to accept any responsibility for problems with their operation, but instead they punish employees who are struggling to make things work in a flawed organization."
bad,"They had me working all the time, all weekend, 52 hours a week with no flexibility for when I was thinking about going back to school and I did not feel comfortable with anyone that was there."
bad,"Can be a fun place to work, however if you are looking for security run away fast. Management is out for themselves and do not support outfitters. Numbers is their only concern. They talk a good game but have no idea how to treat others with respect and dignity. If you have a problem that would require HR assistance don't bother do it yourself because of the extreme level of incompetence. The lead position is to be on a rotating schedule having every third weekend off but that is a myth. If you do decide to accept a position there do not trust anyone."
bad,felt very uncomfortable working for cabelas as an african american =(
bad,"This is not the best place to work, employees are great, management sucks. No communication, and too much favoritism. If you kiss butt in this company you will get ahead, everyone else will be escorted out. Pay is not great either."
bad,This company is a horrible to place to work if you have a family. The demands placed upon full-time outfitters for a work schedule is unreasonable. Management is clueless as to how to run a store or the business. Communication leaves a lot to be desired. Too often outfitters that should get fired often get rewards and recognition while the good employees get fired. Outfitters are asked to help numerous customers at one time because of a lack of payroll to staff a store. Way too much focus put on the Club and CXP programs. Not a fun place to work.
bad,This store hasn't even opened yet and its bad VERY BAD!!! DO NOT! WORK here! Long list of problems I don't have enough space on here to type them all. Managers don't know there head from a hole in the ground. If you work here I will be praying for you. God help all those workers!
bad,This place is a joke. I learned nothing from leads or management. A typical day at cabelas....there are times where there are spurts of customers then it slows down the there's another spurt. I feel bad fro the closing cashiers cuz they either leave late or early(cuz theres noting to do and the cleaning's all done). The management is horrible. My co-workers i loved. Whomever does the scheduling does a horrible job because some departments are ALWAYS understaffed. The health benefits suck. The hardest part of the job...theres not one for a cashier. all you do is stand around and ring people out. my favorite part of the job there wasnt really anything. all i looked forward to were seeing my coworkers and thats it. i could care less about management or anything else. as long as you have a smile on and are helpful and nice to customers.
bad,"When I first started working at the call center in Lincoln NE it was great. My manager was wonderful! Then after my manager had worked for the company for over 20 years, she was forced to step down and take another position in a different department because of some people that were allowed to bully her and her boss's would not help her. Once she left and new management came in, the department went down hill. The philosophy of the management now is ""how is this going to benefit me?"" It is a terrible place to work if you want benefits, being told you are doing a good job, rewarded for doing extra or getting promoted on merit."
bad,Micromanaging environment.  Pay is low.  No benefits.  You sit all day at a terminal.  You get dinged if you go to the bathroom more than once during your shift.
bad,Over all the company and some mangers at cabelas are rude to staff. And will show favorites so much so they have shooved good hard working members out they have threatened to the point some have had to leave with no choice I would never tell anyone to work there. And to those who want to move up its very unlikely because the management choose people from the outside more then those who have been there for years
bad,"Worked as the Fishing Lead for 7 months,  worst job I've ever had.  I'll never forget my first day going to the morning pep talk in which the GM was basically threatening folks to sell more club cards or else.  I should have ran right there.  For what I heard that first day was truly the meat of it all. CLUB. Terrible job. Terrible pay, Management was horrible. Run!!"
bad,"Customers and coworkers are great.  Managers are horrible, play favorites & ignore everyone else.  There’s a reason there are 20 positions open right now."
bad,"Learned all about the world of retail thy cut your hours after the  holidays, so you financially struggle, I wouldn't  reccomend  this job to anyone that I know"
bad,"Fights everyday, physical and verbal.  Employees walked all over management all day long.  I worked with several employees that were either drunk or stoned.  I witnessed many smoking pot on breaks and lunches. Management said it was okay. A lot of employees got injured and was told to continue to work. Not a good place if you care about your job or your physical well being."
bad,"I started at Cabela's abt 6 months before the takeover and just in time for their peak season.  Peak season was hard running nearly six-twelves, but it only lasted a couple months before it alleviated for the new year.  They verbally recognized the importance of employees having a work-life balance and promised that we would have that balance accounted for in the new regime, they even split the shift to cover the whole week claiming it would level the daily workloads across the week, they lied."
bad,"the manger at Cabela’s in the deli will treat you like your nothing  , she will get in your face , bully you and treat you so wrong she will put her hands on you , bad pay , bad management!. I wouldn’t want anyone treated like that"
bad,"Cabela's in Sidney, NE was one of the worst companies I have worked for in 40 years. Dysfunctional management, very low pay, and didn't treat their employees well at all. After Bass Pro Shops bought them, the quality of merchandise decreased dramatically and I was always apologizing to customers. The whole attitude and atmosphere of the store changed for the worst.I quit after 16 months, even without another job prospect. Terrible work conditions."
bad,"I have been with the company for two and a half years. There is no moral, no opportunity for advancement, and management only focuses on what you do wrong."
bad,When the store opened up everything was running very nice. After the store manager got fired and they hired the new one it became a very stressful work environment.
bad,"Went into this job thinking it’d be a lot more competitive and have the ability to work your way up easily. Have better benefits, and decent pay. Everyone is severely underpaid, moving up is more like moving side ways, have to be part time for 30 days before you can go full time. No raises, management doesn’t know what they are doing. Lots of disagreements and unfriendliness amongst coworkers. Over all a poor company to work for"
bad,"Since merged with Bass Pro Shops, became a very bad place to work. If you want a company that cares about you, go elsewhere! Poor management, poor supervisors, too regulated work requirements."
bad,"If you don't get a lot of club credit cards you can't move up in the company, I had the mangers tell me I was easy to replace, if your a cashier and you are standing at the registers they will tell you to go and help with something and then yell at you for leaving your station they will give you full time hours and then pay you part time if they can get away with it they only thing good hear is the pay check"
bad,"They over work you with the promise of help that never comes. Older men are aloud to talk down and treat women like they are stupid for being female. A few work hard, most dont and they yell at the working ones for it."
bad,"Title says it all, managers there have little to no experience in the outdoors and zero knowledge about their products. Employees that provide customers with expert knowledge are not valued because the only measure of your worth to that company is how many people you sign up for their horrible credit card. The skill, knowledge, and merit of your work mean absolutly nothing to this company do not waste your time."
bad,"The job itself was fun. Talking with customers and all, but when the schedule came out it was a mad house. They would schedule you for a shift you couldn't work, then they "" only"" way to change the time, you had to find another co worker to switch shifts with you. They were very in organized with the scheduling and the management was very rude and ugly. I would not refer this job to anyone. The turnover rate it crazy!"
bad,Since a college kid can make more at McDonald's it's hardly worth a drive from any nearby campus.  Looking for a carrier?  They have regular layoffs for the sole purpose of reducing payroll.  Get rid of anyone beginning to make a living wage.  They preach that the only important things in the company are the employees and the customers.  The exact opposite.  The company has no interest in the employees and the policies make it difficult to give good customer service on any given day.
bad,Over all the management had no clue what they were doing and would only move up the people who would stroke their egos. Pay was a joke and hours were always being cut but then they were upset when they would try to call you in and you had already made plans. I wouldn't go back there for anything.
bad,"in the end I really hated the job. The management could care less about anyone, and would hide from the employees during ""peak"", so they wouldn't have to answer any questions, leaving everyone to do their jobs too."
bad,"Working at the store I thought it would be a new adventure. I learned that there is no communication from management to the outfitters. The outfitters were great and dedicated but management was all about themselves, cutting hours, and credit card sales. They pushed the outfitters to sell the credit card more than they did to sell their product."
bad,Managers are not respectful and not at all positive towards employees! Low rate of pay would make more working literally anywhere else! They don't hire off knowledge they hire wether or no you meet time requirements which results in uneducated sales people and misinformed and unhappy customers
bad,I builded  a lot of relationships with my customers got lots of referrals was number #1 in the Hunting Dept..Management is very still very poor employees are come and go from always short on help....The most enjoyable part of working there are the discounts you get
bad,"It's a retail environment. If you don't ask for a good starting wage in the beginning, you'll never get the opportunity again. After being there for a few years, I was making just as much or even less than new hires. Nothing screams motivation like having to attend a morning rally to hear daily sales figures and not getting paid a living wage."
bad,"I'll be honest when I first started working here I loved it but that quickly faded as time went on. The coworkers I work closely with are the only reason I still work here, if it wasn't for them I would've quit months ago. That being said the managers are rude. Some managers use their job title to talk down on outfitters like they're less than them. All they do is want you to push credit cards to customers (and they remind you multiple times throughout the hour) who OBVIOUSLY do not want one. The managers also want you to sell fun but want the outfitters to be miserable in the process. I've had multiple conversations about management scheduling me outside of my availability but they don't care. If you don't show up there is a penalty even if you are not available at that time. Job life/ Social life balance=ridiculous. I didn't know what a social life was until I changed my availability to only being able to work one weekend day (best decision ever). Some of the customers are very rude but that is expected with a retail job. Maintenance doesn't do their job, so the managers tell the outfitters to pick up their slack (I don't get paid enough to do that). We get paid $10/hour which is good but is that enough when you have to deal with so much stress? The employee discount is okay but if the sale item is better than the employee discount we pay the same price as the customer :( "
bad,"Where should i start, for the amount of work that you are expected to complete it is extremely under payed. the majority of backroom outfitters making under $12/hr. there is a lot of harassment and sometimes assault between coworkers. ive seen coworkers come to work drunk,hung over, high and they never get in trouble due to the obvious favoritism from managers. the scheduling is terrible, sometimes i went almost a week and a half with no shifts then come back to schedule changes that no one tells you about. i have only seen two people advance in this store, but usually they will hire an outside person first. there is minimal training given and when you ask for training to learn different things you get ignored. there is bad communication between backroom and sales associates. As someone who has worked there since it opened, im surprised its still in business. the discount was terrible and the products are overpriced. when i recently quit the manager seemed enthused about it, which it felt like they wanted me gone."
bad,"I was very happy when I got the job at Cabela's but very soon I found out that this was just another big box retail store. The worst part is the pay, I was told we would get a raise but that never happened. Management is unfair, favouritism is something very visible and known in the store (As a manager you should not have ""friends"" in the store), there are different pay rates for the same job titles, most get paid minimum wage unless you are one of the favourites. Scheduling is unfair and I had to work every weekend while other employees got to take the weekends off another example of the favouritism . The worst part of my time there was dealing with my manager who was the worst manager I have ever had, she is very difficult to get along with, everyone in the store dislikes her, she changed her mind constantly and liked to blame things that were her responsibility on the employees. The manager did ask a lot and it was definitely NOT worth the minimum wage they were paying me. I felt under-trained in my position;The part I most enjoyed were the people I worked with, I made some good friends and most people are really great and truly deserve more than minimum wage for all the knowledge and excellent costumer service they provide, maybe if I had a better pay and a better schedule that worked with my other job and family life balance I would still work there, even putting up with all the unfairness and the horrible manager, the store is a fun place a lot of cool stuff, but high prices even with the employee discount."
bad,Long drive for 8 hours of hard work and low pay. Not a friendly place to work. Too many bosses and not enough workers.  Manual labor required.  Forced to work hours I was not interested in working. I wanted a morning/afternoon job and I was forced to work late evenings for the holidays. 
bad,"I didn't honestly meet many people working here, but there were people EVERYWHERE. I was a stocker/replenisher and in order to come close to making rate I needed to be rushing around and in a hurry at all times. This made the environment very stressful, negative, and hazardous. I had a florescent light fall out of it's holder and shatter behind me and when I told management about it I was told to just clean it up. Later I was on a ladder and it collapsed. And finally I was in an aisle with a pallet and a pallet jack and a forklift driver tried to move my pallet out of my way with his machine because he didn't see me behind it. He was in too much of a hurry trying to make the rate to even get off his machine or try to yell and see if anyone was behind the pallet. I decided that was enough for me. I was working 12 hour days, 6 days a week. The only really decent thing about this job was the pay. "
bad,"If your reading this review it is because you are interested in advancing your career in the field of Loss Prevention. The position that is posted was last held by myself. I was the Assistant Asset Protection Manager in the Hamburg,Pa store. Please don't make the same mistake i did. I left a job making 50,000+ to work for what i thought was a family oriented company and i am here to tell you they are not. They will tell you what you want to hear to get you in and then you will see the lies and false representation they gave you during the interview process. They pay you 35,000 for a 45hr work week but what they don't tell you is that they expect you to live their and work 60 hour work weeks and never give your time back. If you have a family or girlfriend you can plan on being single real soon if you take this job. They expect you to know what your doing even though cabelas operates completely different then any other retail loss prevention company. They do not understand what the word training means so you just do what you know how to do from previous LP jobs. The main reason why they can't keep managers working with cabelas is because the management that is their has been their since day one and they don't like new people. The senior managers treat the assistant asset protection manager like dirt. For instance when we are at morning meetings but the store manager never lets or ask the assistant asset protection manager if they have anything to say when they know we are supposed to talk in every meeting. The management their has no boundaries either because they will burst"
bad,"Cabela's is not a family friendly place, nor is it something you can make a career out of. Long and unfair hours are given and part time employees rule the roost when it comes to when they are available. In doing this full time outfitters must work the hours that the part time outfitters refuse to work, which is a lot of weekends, especially Sundays. You are required 1 weekend off a month as a full time outfitters but that DOES NOT HAPPEN, unless you request those days off in advance."
bad,"Overall I cannot recommend working here. Constantly being given the run around by management, predatory practices around the club card, wrong people getting promoted and the basic lack of any leadership or ability to fulfill basic tasks such as scheduling is disappointing to say the least."
bad,Cabela's was bought out by bass pro .everything started changing fast and not for the good .cut positions people lost their jobs .pay cuts .this company does not care about it's people .if you are looking for a temporary job it's not bad but don't plan on staying .
bad,"In my short time at the Cabela's in Sun Prairie, I saw about five people quit. While working we were so understaffed, some of us worked double shifts, first shift in one department, and then in another. There were people working 10 days in a row, because they had no one. There was a huge lack of communication between management and staff. Advancing was essentially pointless, because the pay was still so little for 10x the work. The Club Manager was awful, and walked around all day being a tyrant. I liked most of my coworkers, but I do not recommend working here at all."
bad,"Low pay.  Scheduling sucks.  Workers not treated very well by management.  New owner has made Cabelas a place you don’t want to work at.  It used to be a fun place to work, not anymore.  Employee discount is pathetic, unless you buy their brand that is junk.  It is not worth buying it, even at the discounted price.  You are barely a number to them.  I can’t recommend Cabelas as a good place to work."
bad,Poor communication with everyone. They don't work with you. Even if you just want to change your schedule. They change it to where it work for them...
bad,Disappointed because when hired talk of getting the help needed . Never happened. Not proper tools or equipment either. Begged constantly for help . Very stressed out . Near the end of employment things only happy because owner got angry and then came help for two weeks. Then when left the actual help requested was happening.
bad,"Unfortunately, Cabelas started off as a great place to work but then changed their whole foundation of what made them great. They made many false promises and hurt a lot of people who had worked for the company for years. Poor management at the  corporate level."
bad,"The work is based on selling their credit card. You can be  busy doing your work operations and a manager will come up to you asking if you got a club card today. If not you're obligated to get one. They'd say why haven't you been asking because I've been working dealing with customers managers say its no excuse you can still be asking. But my job title was to take care of customers and help them out the best way I can, which I did I'd stay over when they had no one. And yet my work was never good enough . You would be doing mangers work in other departments and they would receive your credit for their work."
bad,"they hire far from qualified personnel to run things, at least at the location i worked at. inexperience and favoritism were very prominent. products from here are great and i will continue to shop here, however i will never recommend working here to anyone."
bad,"Cabelas was a good place to work till Bass Pro started implementing there policies. They took away personal days,  then about 5 months later brought in sick days for full time employees and part time got no sick days. Changed the point system for days off missed. Part time benefits will almost be non existent now that the new year has started. Loved the people I worked with, don't like Bass Pro and what they are doing to Cabelas and employees.  Wages are below what they expect from you and what you can give. You are not that valuable to your employer. Cabelas cared about there employees,  Bass Pro doesn't."
bad,"Pathetic excuse for hourly wages, incompetent managers all around and poorly trained ""leads"" in the department only scrathes the surfaces of Cabelas ever expanding laundry list of problems. Employees are expected to push Club Cards down the throats of their customers for no added benefit or commission. Leads are appointed but fail to show any more knowledge or will to accept added responsibilty over that of regular outfitters. Managers could not care less about how their empolyees are treated and display an annoyed attitude when asked for assistance. To top it all off, the merger with Bass Pro has stripped employees and customers of the many benefits and discounts once offered. This is a great job if you live at home with your parents and need some spending money or you're retired and just want to be out of the house but do not seek employment here if you need to pay bills."
bad,"If you are a younger person looking to work here, stay away. Pay is awful, older employees treat you poorly, and They will assign you all the shifts no one else wants to take. I personally felt like I was being discriminated against because of my age at the time. Hands down the laziest bunch of people I ever worked with for a job at the gun counter, I could be busy helping multiple customers at once while the lazier older employees would do nothing to help or even run away!  Only worked part time, yet they treated me as full time without the benefits. You also are expected to work holidays and don't get anything extra for working holidays such as time and half like every other job I've had. The store hardly makes a profit and they only care if you sell enough credit cards to people. Its hilarious to see, even after years of quitting this job, they're still trying to get people to work at the gun counter, desperate much? Store should just close down."
bad,"I enjoyed the staff except the management. Absolutely no room for growth. They assigned your breaks and you couldn't just go whenever which isn't that bad, but the supervisors always were busy at customer service that they were late giving you your breaks frequently sometimes like an hr and a half late. Customers were rude with giving their postal codes for flyers in the mail, and when purchasing ammunition and presenting their PAL. The supervisors also got mad if you stood at your till or talked to other associates because you always have to be ""doing something"" like cleaning or restocking."
bad,Management has good old boys mentality. If you are good at your job but don't like games not the job for you.  Employees who choose not to work are priority. Do not enforce policies or procedures with them.
bad,"not much more than that to say, small-time family developed company trying to function in the big time business world.  Don't expect advancement or even job security, if you don't know someone or kiss a lot of butt.  The pay and benefits were terrible and I have heard have not improved relatively speaking."
bad,The main reason I quit was because the lack of management. They would play favorites. I worked there for 2 months and was picked on by managers. Was not a happy place to work at all.
bad,"I worked at Cabela's for almost 4 years part-time and ran as soon as a different job opportunity presented itself. The management was only concerned with the numbers and profits and the moral of the employees greatly suffered for it. This was before the company was bought out by Bass Pro Shops. The departments were consistently short staffed which made the long term folks take on more responsibilities out of necessity without receiving any adjustment in compensation. The turn around rates speak for the quality of care the management prioritizes toward its employees. I watched many loyal long term employees that had been with the company since it had launched in our town get burnt out, exhausted, and lose interest in the passion that had inspired them to work there in the first place."
bad,"Good work environment, Interesting and rewarding field of retail business, Lots of technical stuff for someone who is interested in the outdoors activity. Lots of language practice for a new immigrant. But a very low pay that does not attract to make a carrier within this company."
bad,"They conducted interviews,  told me that they wanted to bring me on board,  and they would let me know in a week,  as that wanted to get all interviews conducted and have everyone have the same start day..... well 10 days go by,  and I reached out, was informed they they filled all of their positions from within.... thanks for wasting my time! Don't offer nne a job and then reel it back in! Don't bother to apply!"
bad,"After working in the warehouse at the Waco location I realized that I didn't even want to finish my degree in management because their management team ruined it for me. The warehouse is a department they pretty much trap you in so there is no room for advancing within the store if you start in warehouse unless you transfer to another store. The management at the Waco location is a joke. They sit in the office the entire day and only come out long enough to gripe at outfitters about the creditcard they require you to push or how they aren't making sales. I could go on for days, but I can tell you it's a dog eat dog world there. Good luck."
bad,The workload I received far outmatched the level of pay I was given. In my time there i was responsible for shipping firearms to many out of state FFL dealers throughout the Untied States. I shipped nearly 3000 firearms without error during that time. Many days the number of firearms to be shipped was staggering and it was necessary to skip my breaks and lunch to insure that the shipping was able to gt done.
bad,Managment was very poor working for Cabela's.  Employees were treated differently by management.  Certain people could get away with anything while others would get in trouble over the same thing.
bad,"This is the worse managed DC  I have ever worked for from the Director down to the Inbound/Outbound managers and department managers .  They have NO plan in place and are a reactive management team rather pro active planning, they like to live day to day and react to various increase in orders even though they have previous years history to improve planning, They are a Distribution Center that is new but managed by old school management, afraid to change or adjust.  It was sad to work there, I brought idea's that I could validate would save them millions including improving performance.    The management team is not visionary.  Its managed as a sweat shop.  They say a lot and do very little. "
bad,"Very poor leadership in this company, top to bottom. Product Assortment never right for Regional stores, leadership treats subordinates very poorly. The lowest paying job I've ever had for the amount of hard work, nights, weekends, holidays I put in. "
bad,"Management is what is found in the absence of leadership."
bad,you dont get credit there for anything unless you are one of the favorites there was way to much drama and personal stuff going on there and everything was just priced to high..
bad,"I was not impressed with Cabela's at all. They didn't listen when it came to scheduling, didn't know who was working, and didn't give their employees the right amountt of respect. Overall, wasn't happy working there."
bad,"It was a wonderful place to work before the buyout.  Don’t call it a merger because it was not.  I genuinely enjoyed coming to work each day before the culture was taken away.  See the changes to warehousing. Things that ran well we’re done away with and the employees left in droves.  I felt my salary was fair. That said, the hourly folks are severely underpaid.  There’s no incentive for any of them to do more when they are paid the same as a fast food worker"
bad,I hated working at Cabela's because there was not enough hours for any of my co-workers to get what we need to get done. When we brought up all that we needed to get done it was brushed off and it was brought to our attention about something else that we didn't have time or people to get done.
bad,"I will never work at another cabelas again, that place didnt care if you was dying they wanted you to be at work. They are rude and disrepectful. The employees were great just not the leads or mangers."
bad,"They put a heavy emphasis on club cards and stoped focusing on product knowledge for the customer and over all customer satisfaction, training went down hill significantly and overall employees Morale is at a all time low. But if you love the outdoors and wouldnt mind discounts they are the place for you!"
bad,"Management can say the right things but when it comes down to their actions, far from it.  Preach dedication and loyalty but those traits are never to be found.  Demand and expect integrity, not even close.  Every Outfitter soon learns they need to be politically correct, not speak the truth, agree with Corporate and never, never innovate.  The Corporate mentality is that if they didn't think it up, it can't be good or work.  Management will outright lie to your face if they think it will save their butt.  Don't get me wrong, there may be one or two people there that are worth working for but I seriously doubt they will be there for long.  The culture is at they view Outfitters are blood bags... as soon as they suck you dry you're tossed aside.  It really is a shame because it could be a fun place to work."
bad,Working with cables is a joke. They expect you to do everything under the sun with a smile on your face and expect you to  except low pay.The only good thing about working here is the discount. Stay away from the cabelas in fortmill SC!
bad,"discount in store,I am a happy individual I enjoy going to work and speak in the people and brighten their day if I can some kind of way these people that work in this particular store seemed very unhappy and I've never in my life seen manager that could be so rude it's not all of the managers but there are some in there that are very rude"
bad,"My first years with the company were excellent. Compensation was sub-par but I enjoyed what I did. A new manager in my department totally destroyed the team that the previous manager had built. Morale declined and experienced Outfitters moved on to new employment, resulting in lowered customer and employee satisfaction."
bad,"I really enjoyed working for Cabela's at first. Since being opened for the first year, the moral wentdown hill fast. Some management had a superiority complex. Some management was hard to deal with and work with. They do not like to pay overtime no matter how much is left to be done. They make you shave hours to avoid overtime. Was always left short staffed and couldn't get extra help. Since we were short staffed, the ones of us that were there were strectched very thin. I didn't mind helping at all but it got quite aggravating and frustrating. Sometimes you may have gotten a kudos for your hard work but most of the time you weren't.  Too focused on club cards. Extra compensation for your hard work was not given even though you did extra tasks that weren't asked of you. I did enjoying helping others out and teaching them whenever they asked questions. I also enjoyed that everyday wasn't the same."
bad,Enjoyable environment with pleasant relationships with coworkers. I enjoyed my 7 months working in In-bounds Operations but I did not enjoy the new Motorola system that was installed in November. There was no opportunity to learn the equipment because nobody understood it in the first place.
bad,I absolutely loved the people I worked with everyday but management was some of the worst I had ever experienced. The job itself was extremely simple and not physically or mentally challenging.
bad,The company changed. It became very stressful and the leadership failed. I was responsible for all training and certifications. I completed Operation Walks and supervised the Safety committee.
bad,"The overall atmosphere wasn't so bad. It was the people working there. They all acted like they were better than everyone else. "
bad,"The understaffing is a huge problem. Due to constant turnover there is neither A. Enough people in a department nor B. Enough inventory to actually sell a customer what they want. Pushing a credit card all day to every customer is nonsensical as they have already been asked as soon as they walk through the door. Most customers are asked 2-3 times during each visit and get frustrated, yet corporate seems to only care about signing people up. Management is (except for a rare few) awful by and large, a group of self promoting individuals who are there only because they can show up to work on time and spew the company propaganda about whatever issue is happening. Most can’t manage individuals nor the required tasked they perform, however somehow they have a position of authority over them while they are totally inept themselves. Turnover is massive. Rarely will there be any decent leadership or direction given to you other than your co-workers. By and large the only perk of working here is your co-workers. Pay and hours are average for retail. Discount is ok. The physical work itself isn’t bad at all, sort of fun at times. Management just makes it unbearable."
bad,"I worked here for almost a year and never received a review or a raise. The management was a joke, they treated me like i was at the bottom of the bottom. Our store hired a new lead position for the warehouse which we had needed, except for the fact that the lead had no prior experience and nothing to say but rude comments and an attitude slamming things around. and both of our leads work mornings so we don’t have a lead working night shifts. I was constantly going behind people fixing mistakes and doing things nobody else wanted to do. i was given dirty looks and the lead had not definitely been disrespectful and was definitely one of the reasons i left that day. I put my 2 weeks notice in and they fired me the same day without reason."
bad,"Poor management "
bad,"Went completely down hill after Bass Pro took over. Was a great place to work for years, but new management has killed the moral of the leadership team and the workers."
bad,"Cabela's is a great company, just not to work at. From the day I started, it felt like they were trying to make us into retail robots. Everything was scripted and if you didn't ask the customer if they would like to sign up for the Cabela's credit card you were reprimanded over your earpiece and told to start pressing the customer more. When I was working here I was still in Highschool with a full workload of homework. I had told Cabela's during the highering process that I could only work part-time for about 20 hours a week. Every consecutive week they would add more and more hours onto my schedule until I was working 38 hours/week. Just enough to where they wouldn""t have to consider me a full-time employee. I finally had to quit because of these and other various reasons."
bad,"Do yourself a favor and don't even consider it."
bad,"In all my experience in retail, this has been the worst management I have ever dealt with.  My coworkers were the only somewhat enjoyable part of being employed there.  "
bad,It wasn't always this way. My old job used to be okay. But since the merger and actually even slightly beforehand my job made me more and more miserable. I dreaded going to work. The supervisors are not very helpful and it seemed that bad behavior was rewarded. I tried my hardest and I did my job but I got punished  for things like my call times which were slightly long but were for the benefit of the customer. When someone else did something bad it was overlooked. There is definitely favoritism at work there and I am happy to wash my hands of that mess. Good riddance.
bad,"Too much micro management. talked down to as if I were a 5 year old child. now credit for my knowledge and years of know how."
bad,Environemnt was very racist. If youre black don't work here. Customers arwe very mean and employees will ignore you. Its a good place of white people.
bad,"1/2 of the equipment for cash lanes don't work. "
bad,"I worked at the Deli department in the East Hartford store. Most of the time we were understaffed and overwhelmed, borderline slave labor. I would be the only one on the grill line, serving a line of 60 customers by myself. I worked hard, came in early, came in on my free time to prep when we switched to a new menu and there was so much to do. Being a culinary student, I enjoyed my job a lot. I was dedicated and knowledgeable, showed up on time, stayed late. Did any task assigned to me. "
bad,I worked for cabelas for four years first two years were fun but after that things went downhill. Management is horrible. They don’t know what their doing. When asked what to do in certain situations they are clueless. They use favoritism way too much. It’s why all the good workers leave. The only pros would be discounts and flexibility if you’re in school.
bad,"Difficult place to work. Management has no training. Instead of wanting to help you, they only help themselves. "
bad,"There are good managers, but out of 12 I've had I'd only want to work with 2 again, most of them are just not very helpful and expect everything to be done even if they cut your hours in half. They don't understand that it litteraly takes time to sort, stack, clean things and often want 3-4 hour projects done in 10-20 minutes."
bad,"The Bass Pro buyout has been terrible for morale and customer service overall. Tons of positions eliminated, other positions stagnant and not able to advance. Management keep pushing the selling of the credit card and if you don’t get your numbers up, you get written up. No work life balance. Short staffed. The only reason to work here is for the great health benefits for families. Otherwise, stay away."
bad,"During training they hyped up the experience of working there pretty well. But when the store actually opened the reality set in and it became like any other retail job: rude customers, menial tasks, mindless promotion, and long periods of standing. Even the store itself wasn't what we'd expected, way smaller than the others. Worst part was the management. The communication with the outfitters was very poor. Things weren't relayed properly, statements were conflicting, guilty tripping, and condescending comments at time."
bad,"The cabelas in Lexington KY is horrible, the managers put on a good front like they care about you and your well being but its a complete farce.  The managers expect you to know how to do everything in the store but they cant even do half the jobs required. Theres no help and overall its an incredibly negative environment.  If you ever want to get ahead, you better have a pretty face and a nice body because thats the only way anything gets done"
bad,"Unprofessional Manager.  Cannot say the same for the other departments though!"
bad,"Loved the people i worked with, but no one was treated fair for what jobs we had to do work extra things we helped with. Tell have a few people in management that shouldn't be"
bad,"They like to micro manage everyone, short breaks and on some days, you only get a 20 minute break with no lunch for a 7-8 hour day. They treat you like you are little kids and for the amount they pay you, it is not worth your time. Job is easy, but you put up with a lot of crud with management. There is also no set schedule. It is either feast or famine. You start at either 5 or 6 in the morning, and go home when you don't have any work left. Some days you go home around 10 am."
bad,"My job itself was very enjoyable, the people that I worked directly with in my department were amazing, however, the management team within this location is lacking, along with the people in place at a corporate level. This company doesnt care how hard you work or how good you are at your job its about who you know and what you can do for them if they decide to promote you."
bad,"I worked as a seasonal and quickly made friends with co-workers and customers alike.  I studied and utilized resources to learn product knowledge.  I was able to articulate words well with customers and co-workers alike.  Unfortunately, there is a tight nit clique of managers and leads that have poor communication and high expectations.  The imposed stress, poor communication and low pay led to lack of desire to be there and pick up the slack.  If you can shed the drama and still show up ready every day then you might pass the evaluation to became someone other than a seasonal employee even if you don't know what you're doing.  Just being there is what they project they want most, per my evaluation feedback which I received."
bad,"The only thing really good about working at cabelas is the discount. The hours are not good at all (you get no more than 20/week) so you can't survive (it's really hard to pay bills on this job). They say they work with people who have a second job but they don't, there's always a conflict somewhere. The only time of the year to get more hours is during the holiday season. The pay is horrible for the amount of work you have to do and the rude customers that you have to deal with. Also when other employees give a customer false information and you have to clean up the mess, definitely not worth $10/hour. Raises are not worth it, you only get a raise on your anniversary date and it's not even worth it. There is no way to make a living off cabelas, once your part time, you will never advance to full time. Cabelas cares too much about the money, credit card accounts and numbers than they do their own employees. The managers are lazy and you will never see them on a register to help get lines down or working on the floor, you will most likely find them eating in their office. overall, it's only a job to gain experience to move on somewhere better, there is zero advancement in this company and they make promises they don't keep. get everything in writing so you can throw it back at them when things don't happen. They don't follow policies, if a customer throws a temper tantrum they will cave in not caring about policies and procedures. The only thing good I can say is I have two cahier leads who bust their butt to make employees happy when others are screwing up the schedule. There"
bad,"Some of the management does not listen to their department employees, who are the boots on the ground employees who truly help make the money for the company."
bad,Seems like a nice place at first but management are passive-aggressive. They want you to work hard to only get paid $10 and work at most 8hrs at least 4hrs a day some coworkers are cool and one manager out of the handful is really nice and cool
bad,"This job was the worst place I had ever worked.  They required deadlines to achieve and when we met those it was never good enough.  The training was horrible to the point where I just came up with my own job routine as they would never answer my questions of what they wanted or expected.  Once I made the step by step outline of what my job entailed my supervisor stole it and took it to the manager as if she was the one who did the work to come up with it."
bad,"Not much pay, your opinions and ideas don't matter.  Management stays upstairs and has no idea what goes on in the store.  Store manager recently left.  Hopeful there will be changes in the future."
bad,"It was a great company but since Bass Pro took over it has gone down hill drastically. No longer customer svc oriented. "
bad,"Many biases based on who you know, not what you know. Advancement was only possible if you know someone in the department you are going into. This is probably why they had to sell out."
bad,"My love of the outdoors, love of customer service and belief in ""team,"" was not rewarded at Cabela's. This is company with so many problems since the passing of Dick Cabela, that it had to be sold to its competitor. Thousands of great outfitters were kicked out to ""right size"" the payroll and benefits as the corporate culture changed."
bad,"By far the worst retail job I've ever worked. They force customers' crazy wants over the physical health of their employees. It's a regular to be told you cannot take a break or lunch or leave on time because they don't schedule enough people. Higher-level employees get away with everything wrong while lower level/new employees deal with the backlash from no work done by their supervisors/coworkers. If you're a college student, they expect your low-paying part time retail job should come before your academics. Horrible training. Typically, you're shown a thing or two and then left completely alone."
bad,"I worked long hours in the clothing department and received no recognition for the work I did. I was punished for just trying to help out in other departments, nobody ever helped me.  I was constantly harassed and verbally abused by the clothing manager who was prejudiced against me. My co-workers had their own cliques and were not very friendly."
bad,"Worked at cabelas for almost six months and had a GREAT supervisor in the gun library, helpful, informative and willing to teach new employees his knowledge! Sadly it ended there as upper management was just interested in selling credit cards! Its a bank that pretends to be a sporting goods company that only wants pliable robots that don't think for themselves. Great customers for the most part and I made a lot of friends but its an entry level job that pays small and trains very poorly. No information is printed out just verbalized once and then you expected to remember it ALL. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the changes in rules. After a month or so all part time employees had their hours changed and many left fast after that. Very poor documentation of any mistakes you made so no learning ever occurs. This in turn makes the job WAY more stressful and mistakes MORE prevalent. I would not recommend this job to any human being. In reality I wouldn't shop there even if it was the last place to buy the things they sell."
bad,"I worked in the call center in Lincoln, NE for two years. I started out really enjoying the job. It was a comfortable, family oriented work environment.  If you had questions you felt comfortable asking your manager for help. If you needed days off they were very flexible working with you, weather it be for school or personal reasons.   After the manager quit and they brought on 3 new managers about a year later is where it went down hill.  The managers were power hungry. If they felt an employee was not doing things the correct way, they would have you move your seat right next to their office for 3 weeks so they could observe you.  They did not coach you and tell you how to correct the mistake, instead they made an example out of you.  They treated the whole department like a 2nd grade classroom.  We were not allowed to leave our seats to ask questions to other employees.  If we were away from our desk a manger was quick to tell us to get back on the phones (even if we were in a personal idle).  Whenever employees had questions for the mangers they were no where to be found.  Or if you did find one they would more often then not tell you to come back at a later time or they would not give you an answer to your question.  Managers also had multiple complaints brought against them for how they were treating employees.  One key complaint that kept arising was race.  Supervisors were quick to overlook these complaints brought up and told employees “We will have a talk with them, but right now its best to move on”.  I’ve never been a manager with any company, but in my eyes this"
bad,"This is a good place to work for the merchandise discount if you hunt, fish or anything outdoors."
bad,"over all not as stressful, they did have more chiefs than indians sort of speak.  needed to hire supervisors that worked, with experience.  The department had to much work load"
bad,"I was a sales coach at Cabela's, walked into work February 1st, 2018 and was told my job was eliminated with no warning. Then asked to come back and apply as a lead doing same job but with less pay! They let 9 coaches go to hire 14 leads. Very unfair and very saddening to those of us who put our heart and soul into our positions."
bad,The management team here is the worst management I have ever seen. There is no way to move up in the company without someone getting fired. There is no communication between management and leads or associates
bad,"I worked there for a year and never got recognized for any of the hard work I did. Many of my co-workers would goof around, making me pick up all the slack and somehow they would get rewarded for doing hardly any work. The managers pushed the club credit card every single day and made us seem like bad workers if we didn't get at least 1 person a day to sign up for the credit card. This was difficult to do since most customers already have the card or aren't interested since a lot of other stores in the area have their own credit cards. The managers and leads looked down on you if you didn't sign up a lot of people for the club card. Also our hours were severely cut (for part time) and we barely got more than 18 hours a week. If you told them you couldn't work a certain day of the week or time of day, 9 times out of 10 they would schedule you for the days you'd asked not to work. It was very frustrating and they made it difficult to change shifts with other co-workers (unless it was an emergency or dire circumstance). Weekdays are usually VERY slow and they will most likely only schedule 1 or 2 people during each shift which makes it difficult for lunch breaks. Weekends are crazy busy, but they never have enough people working so it can get stressful quite easily."
bad,Don't count on having a job if you are sick even with a doctor's note. The tell you that you must have one then say it doesn't cover your absent. So not sure how I was supposed to get it excused
bad,"Whoever gave this place a positive review must be in management. This is the worst company to work for and depressing like the other reviewer said. The place is run by a bunch of amiture managers that do not know how to run a business. A lot of favoritism, politics & racism. I myself am Caucasian & I witness a lot of what goes on and what a shame."
bad,"The GM and management team is very disconnected.  Training was, by far, the worst I received at any company I worked for.  The trainer talks to you like you are a two year old.  New HR is nothing more than a yes man and does not support the employees when they approach with a concern/issue."
bad,"People are just a number here. Doesn't matter what your skill set is, it's all about pushing their club card anymore. It's honestly a terrible place to work. As a supervisor, I barely make it with my bills and that, plus the added frustration of how the company operates is not worth the time."
bad,I wouldn't recommend working there if you want to be part time. They don't give set schedules. The upside is that most of the people you work with share an interest in the outdoors.
bad,"Since Cabela's was acquired by Bass Pro Shops, the quality of the company and the morale there has plummeted.  What used to be an environment of a culture that represented hunting and outdoor life has since turned into a joke."
bad,I already reviewed this company. Lack of direction and real long work weeks with little pay compared to the work load that was given to you. If you like buying guns is great
bad,During this time they called the interview this man who somehow made it to a manager position wanted me to tell them about hunting and fishing trips i came prepared for a retail interview.  In short if you want to work here they want you to be a avid hunter or fisherman and have worked at cabelas i do fish so no problems here. But Apparently if you have no job experience in retail but you still can perform the duties they wont hire an 18-26 year old. They want older people only. This was the worst interview process and poorly administered i was perfectly capable of this job and live .5 miles away and in short i would never recommend APPLYING AT THE DUNDEE MICHIGAN LOCATION OR ANY CABELAS OUTFITTERS. Again if you have no experience. They apparently will not train you!!! Also the employees are not very friendly upstairs. It is all an act put on for customers.  This place is like a factory and they have to have a police station inside due to so many thefts. So not safe either.
bad,"The people made it fun, the management was stressful. Got weird stares and hated the managers. Helped build the store, but was too much stress. I like that I was in the bad a lot."
bad,Absolutely horrible management. Most of the managers are lazy and don't do their job. They give no hours to part time. I wouldn't ever recommend  anyone to work there. The general manager is never there. Just horrible.
bad,"Its a great company to work for. The supervisors are very nice and pretty easy to work with. They don't pressure any of the employees at all, which is nice! Most of the staff is very friendly!"
bad,"the best thing about working at Cabela's is the co-workers. A lot of good people are ther in the non- exempt status, all working for low wages. Management does not communicate well between departments. Sections are not well staffed because workers leave for better paying jobs."
bad,"It is a corporate ran company, and it really shows. Employees are told to learn and become experts in relation to their departments but then expected to be at work 45 plus hours a week and given zero incentive to become an expert or pursue any passion that is related to your department. Not that you could afford to anyways"
bad,I worked there a year and half and they didnt care how they treated their employees. they had their favorites and didnt care how are what they did to the other
bad,"If you are not in the management click, you will never advance nor even get an interview for a full time position. Outfitter are told we are one big family but, if you are seen talking with other outfitters in the store you are written up, yet you are to know the other areas of the store to help the customer."
bad,"I've never been this bored at any job in my life, cleaning goes by fast and you end up with a lot of down time. So be good at looking like you're busy and you'll be fine."
bad,I loved the store but did not so much enjoy my time there with the management and the really poor work atmosphere. management was never understanding and was not supportive of anyone.
bad,"The job was not for me. Even though I stuck it out and worked as long as I was able to, it was not the atmosphere I liked being in. I think the company needs to hire more employees to even out the work load."
bad,"They kept me on after seasonal but since then they have continuously reduced my hours then gave me more and then taken them away again, also then have changed me multiple times from working the morning shift the the nigh shift."
bad,Learned that with the company merge there is only corporate greed and poor management nothing geared in quality or integrity for professional employees.
bad,"Not the best place to work, the hours are all over the place and they screw up the schedule a lot, specially if you are in school. Your coworkers are great people but everything else is meh."
bad,"I help people outfit their boat. "
bad,"Bad management"
bad,Rude managers. I was excited to work there everything was relaxed a first then they ended up being really rude and gave us barely any breaks. Our typical break was 15 min and our lunch was only 30 min.
bad,"Management does not hold other managers accountable for their actions, only those employees below management. The workplace is unprofessional, employees do not respect management do to the opening statement. Weekends, holidays, employees are over worked, often times without opportunities to use facilities, eat, drink or take short breaks."
bad,Don't work there I think they were trying to be rude anytime don't really care I think I kind of a backstabber and they don't really care they're like you're harassing employees and get away with it
bad,"Don't work there.  To many hours for management.  No family time.  Work, work, work.  Good old boys club if you are a girl.  Work with kids that don't care about anything"
bad,"It was fun at first, but you quickly realize that management doesn't care about you. Demands everyone push credit card, but not understanding when you're stationed at the furthest corner of the store. Very cut-throat, looked for ways to cut hours even less than a day prior to scheduled day."
bad,This company is not a good place to work. They treat their employees like slaves. They don't understand that emergencies happen and will still right you up for missing work even though some situations are out of your control.
bad,Not a solid place of employment. A chilled work environment. Training department lacks any true involvement or effort. Store associates are cold shouldered. Management puts on the show but docent back the words.
bad,"Fellow employees are awesome to work with."
bad,CABELAS  was great to work for in the beginning then as they got money hungry & greedy cause of club cards it all went down hill. You can't advance even though they want u to apply whenever there is an opening but they always hire outside of CABELAS
bad,"I would never work there again, management doesn't care about you, they work you like a dog and pay sucks"
bad,"No family life, no real time off and the management team are like a bunch of high school kids. Not a good place to work. The Cabela's brothers should be very sad."
bad,If you like over worked and not getting paid for what your worth then this is the job for you or if you like working five 12 hour days and the six day is mandatory that everybody will show up for work and the point system that doesn’t work when they work so many hours they run people off as soon as they get them in the door they need to hire people in management with a brain span of a two year old andwhe andanthey didn’t
bad,I wasn't thr very long. it was a temporary position. I don't have much to say about the company. I was in the warehouse. I felt like the  time employees acted like we were a bother if asked a question.
bad,"Although it was fun to work there and you enjoy most everyone who works there, management wasn't the most professional. They had their own ""politics""."
bad,There was an overwhelming since that the management team believed that They were the only people in the store that mattered and anyone who was not part of the management team was disposable.
bad,"It is a good place to work if you are retired, in school or just looking for that four hour shift in the evening and extra on the weekend,"
bad,"I worked at the gun counter where the manager is useless. Never there, no guidance, and avoids responsibility by blaming others. Manager favorites become captains and make up reasons to deny customers gun purchases based on their personal prejudices. Older employees work while favorites hang out and suck up to the captains and manager. You are expected to sell the Cabelas credit card. Failure to sell the credit card can get you fired. No wonder hunting and guns are being marginalized under Bass Pro."
bad,"Was a fun great place at first. Then they change everything around on you without any notice and don’t work with you on anything , and for a place that has such a high turn over rate you would think they would be a little bit more accommodating to employees that actually were there for longer than 2 years."
bad,"- Upper management shows favorites. Schedule is unfair most of the time and communication is lacking."
bad,"It used to be a good place to work. There’s a lot of favoritism and people moving up that should not be there. They don’t train you properly, so if you like learning on your own and getting in trouble when you mess up, Cabelas is your place. Also, If you like to constantly bother people about credit cards, work here! And if you don’t get a certain amount each week, you’re in trouble. The pay is good but it’s no where near worth it, I suggest you get paid $2 less hourly then work here."
bad,"GM wouldn't stay around for long. Seems they would only stay for about 6 months and then move to another store.  The location I worked at was a training ground apparently for new managers.  Mid-level management was great for the most part, but didn't have much say in some matters."
bad,"2009 I was hired great company work with for two years. Since then ?????? Never go public ....Corporate, walk a day in our shoes before, you go off.  "
bad,"If you enjoy working for several people at one time and you kiss butt to get a head in a job. This place is for you. This place was a good place to work until too many management changes and people allowed to call shots when they shouldn't be calling any shots. This place become a joke to work for and the people didn't care about the customers only the customers who showed themselves that's when the outfitters were told to care for them..only worried about pushing that club card on everyone who walked in that place."
bad,"Upon hiring and opening a brand new store, a huge production was given to us by many outfitters from stores across the whole country. We were made to believe this was the greatest company to work for and at first, that was entirely true. Personally, I couldn't stop talking about it once I was hired. It was like I was coming to work for Disney World. We all became one huge family during the store setup and that has to be one of the only good things left in our building, all of the outfitters. Management in this store is so unbelievably poor. They are absolutely clueless when it comes to resolving problems (customer issues, policy/procedure changes, etc.) and leave outfitters to fend for themselves. I have seen management refuse to help outfitters and completely walk away from outfitters, in front of customers, and leave the outfitter to figure it out for themselves. The outfitters and sales coaches at this store run themselves ragged day in and day out. There is never a solid answer to any question, nor is there any sense of direction throughout the entire store. Communication is also something that is severely lacking there. I read another review that stated, ""if you're willing to sell your soul, Cabela's is for you."" I can not express how awfully true that is. This store needs a complete reset and restructure. Hoping the Bass Pro buyout will bring positive changes."
bad,"All about the bottom line and how many credit cards you can get people to sign up for. They will preach credit card lines to use on customers so much that it makes you want to vomit. Poor management decisions create more work for the employees, they manage from the office but have no clue about best practices or what works well. No loyalty even though they talk about employees being family.  Ok place to work if you fall into the leadership cliques but horrible if you don't like 90% of employees."
bad,"I used to love my job here ..not knowing when your getting off work is getting old I have a family outside of cabelas words from management they are our family ... I used to love the management before they let them go ..now management is a complete joke .... Our leads favor certain ppl also so does management ....the leads gossip to there friends about other employees I'm not sure this is allowed .it's a freak show there not enough time for breaks half to stand in line to get something to eat for like 5 min than to use microwave is 5 so you only end up getting 10 min to eat make daily calls .... This is a poorly ran company in tooele DC.... They don't reward employees for good work ..no bonus ,rewards,jobfun , this place sucks the life right out of you ! Soul belongs to cabelas once you sign your hire paperwork... HR ladie is absolutely ignorant talks down to you when you have concerns she has no care in her bone about anyone there .. my personal thinking clean management out start fresh along with a new HR person ... It's a high school all over !!"
bad,Untrained management. No communication through all of the departments. They will work you less than 28 hours a week. Very low wages for the area. I would not/ did not recommend this company to friends and family for employment or shopping.
bad,Cabelas has some of the best employees of any retail store I have ever seen.  That being said the Management ( retail transplants) will not listen to the experienced employees (mostly retired industry experts or subject matter amateur enthusiasts)  They expect superior customer service but spread out the employees to  the breaking point.  For a Christmas bonus they offered each employee an item at their best employee discount.  Sounds great until you realize that the company STILL makes a profit on the sale.  Way to say thank you: we will make less profit on that one item you bought WOW.
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers. The management has to be the worst part of the job. I learned a lot there in 6 years and had a lot of fun.
bad,"Outfitters are ""okay"" but a lot of gossip and back biting, management is horrible.  Managers are for themselves only and don't belittle themselves to talk with hourly outfitters, no positive feedback EVER.  Discount is so/so, pay is mediocre.  Rapid changes with the business that are not fully thought out, probably a knee jerk reaction to being sold to Bass Pro."
bad,"I went to work for Cabelas before the new store opening in Huntsville, AL. Some co-workers had the insight to know that all the hype and build-up by the management team would not last. One co-worker said he didn't know it would happen as fast as it did. The seasonal workers were all let go before the holiday season even started! This store has the most incompetent management team I have ever seen."
bad,"Worked for the company for many years.  Had a great time going out to conventions, and store openings.  The issue I faced was lack of communication, lack of training, lack of timely follow up.  Everything is secretive, the open door policy is a joke.  "
bad,"Management is poor and lacks major communication with each other and the staff. They seem to always look into what employees are doing wrong but fail to see what they do wrong as a management team and as individuals as well. You are easily replaced to them it seems and MANY wonderful employees hard work and dedication definitely goes unnoticed and unappreciated a lot. Being short staffed is a common occurrence and if you think you'll only do the job you were originally hired for, think again. You will be thrown around all over the place. Your opinions and problems do not seem to matter, although it is made out to appear they do, there was rarely action to solve anything. "
bad,"The title says it all. Some good co-workers. Benefits will try to take extra money for their mistakes. Management only cares about their ""bottom line""."
bad,"If you like standing on your feet for long periods of time, sign up. "
bad,I found Cabelas to be an overly stressful work environment filled with meaningless busy work. There is no opportunity for a raise unless you become a manager.
bad,Cabelas was fine until Bass Pro bought them out. Poor leadership. Quality of product diminished. Everything revolved around selling credit cards. Direction was confusing.
bad,"Was almost an enjoyable place to be. There are a select group of people that make it bearable, however management is highly typical retail attitude. High-volume movement is all that is important, whether it be products moving out the store or employees."
bad,"As a longer outfitter at the store, they accomadate schedules ok if your a student, however they give set schedules to certain people even though it isn’t supposed to be that way. Management is reactive and not proactive, with certain managers picking on the younger demographic of the store. The wage is terrible, and one year raises are an absolute joke."
bad,"I was hired temporary and I was pregnant and they were very not understanding when I went in to early labor, they fired me the day after I was hospitalized and told me not to apply for unemployment benefits as I wouldn't get any anyways,"
bad,Was hired seasonal and was asked to come on part time. Always on time and even showed up in the snow. No way for advancement because management has their favorites.
bad,The worst job I've ever had. You will be lied to by managers. Your work hours will be altered with little or no notice. If you are more educated and have a stronger work ethic then the supervisors and management they will see you as threat to their jobs and you will not be promoted. I've never worked anywhere in my life where so much pettiness and co-worker hostilities existed.
bad,Worked full time. Helped open the store. Employees have paid a big price for poor management decisions. If you can. Look elsewhere. Too many people telling you conflicting job tasks.   Confusion prevails older employees keep the place afloat.
bad,"It sounds like a great job. Working with all your favorite hunting and camping gear. Large firearms section too! But no, just no. The company does not care about you one bit. Your shift changes all the time. Rules and guidelines change at a moments notice. You never see a manager unless they are there to tell you to do something you already did."
bad,"Cabela's as a brand has an excellent business model and considerably competitive benefits. However, management is quick to turn on their workers and cut hours and aggressively understaff in order to meet corporate incentives. This caused significantly detrimental results for customers and outfitters alike."
bad,"fun employees sometimes"
bad,"The workload working here wasn't difficult, however, management did not have a clue what they were doing and was very disorganized hiring new employees and giving orders to current employees. My number one complaint was they did not give any hours as they hired too many people at once, so in a given week you MAY be given 4 hours FOR THE WEEK. They also really push you to get customers to sign up for 'Club Card', which is a credit card. Even though I had only 4 hours during the week in total they expected me to recruit 1 person for club card a week."
bad,Overall a fun place to work making fudge however policies and standards are not followed and therefore staff stand around and do nothing while other staff work very hard. Very hard to deal with management due to favoritism.
bad,Very disappointed how this company went down hill. I liked this company when I started working there bc they worked with all us employees with working or not working on certain days bc a lot of us had another job because Cabelas didn't hire many full time workers
bad,"Fast paced, no consistency, no job security, large work load, be prepared for layoffs or displacement.  You sell a credit card and not product. No on the job training on product.  No support from corporate."
bad,"Stick a fork in her, she is done! The management does not care about the ""outfitters"" unless they can help their bonus. The discount and the other employees are about the only good things that remain of a once proud company."
bad,"crazy about my co-workers. I am just tired of the long commute to and from work. I've been on the same schedule for about seven years and now a new one has been thrown at me. Some of the perks are no longer there because of the hiring of more part time employees  as opposed to full time. because of efficiency, more work is added and expected of myself and my co-worker. I am just plain tired of it all."
bad,"Low pay. no opportunities for raise or advancement. I take pride in my work but that was not appreciated   My supervisor/Manger were good to work for. They listened but could not help. Their hands were tied by ""corporate."""
bad,"Discuss and provide direction to like minded customers. Get paid for working your hobbie. Lower pay scales, with little room for advancement.Decent employee discounts available."
bad,good paying job but very demanding. always felt like you were on edge of getting fired when you goy up in pay and years. It seemed they were always looking for a knitpicking way to fire you if they could get away from you. There was no protection or backup from anybody you had to fight for yourself because there was no one going to fight for you.
bad,the employees are fantastic people i worked here for two years and everyone treats everyone like family. I had a good manager for my department that was like a second father to me and helped me out whenever i need it. everything went fine and dandy until we got a new senior hardlines. i know of three separate reports that were filed for his absolute lack of respect. The comments made were sexual and based at female employees and customers. I also witnessed how words that are not appropriate were used daily toward other employees directly to there faces. (people wouldn't say anything because they will write you up or fire you for it) A rude man by all means and crude in nature. Loud and pompous. his lack of the product ie firearms was absurd. His knowledge was based sorely on the most expensive gun he could purchase. Don't get me wrong. this is an awesome job that i really enjoyed. I just chose to make friends with a manager and then when i wasn't a member of the good ole boys club any more they hammered me. More work and less time to do and absolutely no help. the time management there is a joke. its not the GM's fault either that guy was gold i'll tell ya. The downside of this is that they hired a few people that talk behind everyone's back and make the place hell to work.as for the reports i'm sure got swept under the rug. In my final days there i was avoided and treated by sub par standards. you can bust your rear and your chances of moving up are slim to none if your not in with the higher ups. it took its toll on me and i felt like i had a black cloud following me around.
bad,"If you are a woman in the company, you did not excel or were taken seriously. The Manager was since released of his duties after I left the Company."
bad,"The best part of my job is my co-workers. Beyond that, Cabelas is a typical company that cares little about your contributions. You are only a number without a face. I was recently told that ""It is all about the company,"" by a senior membor of management."
bad,Both full time and part time workers get their hours cut often. Do not work here if you expect a consistent paycheck.
bad,"When I worked at Cabelas, you were required to sign up customers for the Cabelas Credit Card, or you were ""Coached"" by management. That means that you were transferred to another department were you had no contact with the shopping public."
bad,"When I was hired they were behind on pulling orders and already doing weekly mandatory overtime. I wasn't told of the overtime until I showed up for my first day of work. After being hired it quickly went from 1 day of overtime to 2. Morale was low, the work environment was stressful. Management was a mess. It felt like there was no communication between shift leads."
bad,"Cabela's, while recently bought by Bass Pro Shops has rapidly declined in appealment during it's almost 2 year transitional phase. While the employee discount and customer base is phenomenal; the management practices and procedures enacted have left the company a shell of it's former self. However, for part-time retail employees it does not get more fun than this incredible store."
bad,"Enjoyed the people I worked with, they where great to be around, very friendly."
bad,"I would not recommend anyone to work at Cabela’s, well this location because they are severely understaffed, want to you work constantly. The management treats you like dirt on their shoes, they don’t care what your life is outside of work, family, friends or whatever. If you can’t work weekends bye. There is no rotation of having weekends off, the only time you can get it is if you request off months in advance. Trrrible conpany to work for."
bad,"They expect open availability and will fire you if anything happens to change that, even if you are part time."
bad,Have to figure out and do many things that should have been done in the first place. None of the managers have will correct or punish employees if they do the wrong thing or break the rules.  Most of the managers do no lead by example and have do as say attitude not a do as I do attitude. Most of the employees that work there enjoy the job they do and enjoy working with there fellow co-workers. I feel if was not for the employees caring so much and enjoying the job they do the store would fall flat on its face.
bad,"when I started at cabelas distribution center it was the1st year ,we were putting in 10 to 15 hours a day 6 days a week @ 9.50 hr. it wasn't a job where you knew what time you were done you knew your start time and got done when all of the orders for that day were shipped tough way to work some people may like that it wasn't for me ."
bad,"Company takes advantage of Exempt staff, with no management support.  Far too many hours covering shifts because management was not interested to get needed employees recruited and hired into open requisitions."
bad,"Eh, I could honestly go either way. They said from the get go they are a family orientated company and will work with you. My first week, training was pretty lack luster. They wanted me to just sit around and watch for two whole days with nothing to do. Then the third day was work as fast as you can. When problems came up, you were told to wait. And wait. And wait. By the fourth day, I liked the job, but felt I was never trained properly."
bad,Cabela's used to be a fun place to work. Now they are telling us that we will be fired if we do not get one club card (Visa) a week. This to me makes it a hostile work environment. This was not the way it was before the bass pro merger. Management has no concept of what part-time means.
bad,"Decent discounts on Cabelas branded gear, mostly fun customers, Poor management, little real advancement, poor pay, terrible hours, no schedule flexibility."
bad,"As an employee of the World's Foremost Bank subsidiary of Cabela's, there was extensive pressure to sell credit cards to customers.  Rarely was there any support from corporate management, and turnover was high."
bad,Cabela's would purposely work more people at part time to not pay decent wages or benefits. There was no job security and managers constantly hovered over and judged your performance.
bad,Cabela's is not a place that I would recommend my worst enemy.  The culture and environment were great until Bass Pro Shops purchased Cabela's.  I highly advise to look other places for employment.
bad,"Absolutely loved what I done, however management from department manager up to corporate was very poor.  The individual was never a factor for this company."
bad,"Pros:"
bad,You are always at the mercy of people shopping at your store. You can have days where there are not much people shopping to a lot and its those low days where you are forced to go home and not work.
bad,"Management is sub par. No progression unless you are buddy-buddy with management. Must be a ""Yes"" man and not question anything you're told. No incentive to go above and beyond with performance. Yearly review has little impact on pay raise. Above average performance will receive the same pay raise as average performance."
bad,"I started as an Outfitter, moved into a management position and now they only care about the bottom dollar. They evolve around the Club Visa, and put people's jobs on the line if 8 cards are not obtained in a month. Upper management will not train you, but expect you to know what to do. I use to love my job, not so much."
bad,"The turnover rate for employees is ridiculous because the management was so poor.  The managers were not good at managing their responsibilities, so the duties were dumped on the leads.  The worst part was the lack of respect for their longer-term employees.  They took advantage of the people who had been there longer or worked harder than the rest.  I requested no more than 20 hours and they consistently had me working closer to 35."
bad,"I love Cabela's as a store. The displays are incredible and the product is honestly pretty good. However, I would recommend shopping here and not working here. "
bad,"This is a nice short-term PT job. The pay isn't bad for someone in college and they work with your schedule fairly well if you get a good manager. You do have to be open on the weekend and will almost always work the weekend so if you like the outdoors...you'll never see it again. "
bad,Working there is fun and i love the work but the management is poor and needs worked on.The hardest part about the job is the management the actual job is easy but dealing with poor management ruins every day.
bad,"I was proud to work at Cabelas until lately. They have been bought out by Bass Pro and since then, it has gone downhill. They have started cutting employee hours and now they are eliminating my position (for automation)."
bad,"I worked dish-washing. Hours cut and expected me to work for two. Aggressive Lead wouldn't stop screaming confusing ""Believe in yourself"" rhetoric at me. If you want me to work harder don't scream at me."
bad,They work you way more than you are available and do not give you all the requirements expected of the job. Even when you give your time available you end up having to put it in three more times before they finally work with it.
bad,"Overall the people were great but middle management is poorly trained, refuse to be flexible or recognize the front line staff needs and stress is really high with constant change and instability."
bad,"Stay away. It's a poorly run sinking ship. "
bad,"It is a fun place to work except for the lack of management and how much hours get cut. There is a high demand but little reward, it is a character building job."
bad,"i have been an outdoorsman all my life and when i found out cabelas was opening a store in my area i jumped at the oprotunity to get a job there. it started pretty fun and they took care of me quite well sending me on a week and a half completely paid for training program in a cabelas in another state. i only had 3 out of the 12 days there that actually had usable training advise for my position the rest of the time i was only used for muscle to move heavy stuff for them. they proceeded with their normally brainwashing and the typical ""we are a family"" speaches once i got back. the lack of comunication skills in this company is amazing and im surprised the store is still running. once cabelas got a new CEO the changed everything with the company. the double the amount of stores they had and made them half of the size. now if anyone has been inside an original cabelas they know how beautiful it is and breathtaking. these stores make cabelas on the same level as dicks or gander mountain, even bass pro. it is a high stress environment where managers are barely there and when they are they only bark half assed orders to make themselves look good. dont recomend"
bad,"Large amounts of nepotism, culture of the company restrictive to development"
bad,"Senior management team lacks focus on day to day business items.  The focus is more on a high school pep rally mentality rather than on managing key items and initiatives.  Often seem out of touch with basic principles of business operation.  Operations side, which includes warehouse, front end, and deli has lost 4 out the 5 managers under the direction of its' senior manager.  Promotions are handled through a system of being part of the ""good ol' boys club"".  Extremely politically correct atmosphere; no minor infractions allowed or tolerated unless done by senior management. Constant changes to existing procedures even those that are working very well. A lot of unnecessary daily items that take away from pressing issues and concerns.  They love to walk departments everyday, but are more focused on pet projects than major or obvious concerns.  Lots of long hours and the compensation is below average.  Benefits are decent, but expensive. The associates are hard working and a lot of fun.  They make it enjoyable, but fluid management situation is a cause for concern. Retail is a tough area, but Cabela's makes it even tougher.  Great company, trained at other stores, but this particular store's senior management team gives the rest of the company a bad name."
bad,It doesn't sound like the same place to work as the long time employees describe it.  They claim it used to be fun working there!
bad,"The job was fun, Customers gave me great feedback - Management was more concerned about making margin."
bad,"I felt EXTREMELY under appreciated by Cabela's. I have 7+ years in customer experience, my degree is in Sales, Marketing, and Management, and I was only a cashier. They promoted others without my level of experience and professionalism ahead of me largely due to favoritism. When I inquired about this, they informed me that there were things in my performance that were not up to par. No one had previously discussed this with me until I asked about this. This signified to me a SERIOUS lack of communication."
bad,the benefits are absolutely horrible for the part time employees and so are their business practices
bad,"Good for college students/people just joining the work force and Retirees wanting fo supplement. Do not recommend for full time employment. "
bad,"I do not care for ""the club"" Kool-Aid at each and every shift meaning.  being micromanaged is another spot of contention. even more so when that microscope is never used to reflect upon the management team."
bad,"Working on expense reports, booking travel, booking meeting, conference rooms, and video meetings."
bad,"Cabela's used to be an ideal place to work, however, recently there has been a move away from customer satisfaction to an emphasis on upselling the store credit card.  With the new merger between Cabela's and another large company, all focus has been on upselling the card and not at all on customer satisfaction.  Sales have dropped and hours are steadily decreasing."
bad,"I had been promised 40+ hours a week, I am currently working 27 hours a week! Promised incentive pay for anything over 80% work performance and it was took away. I am currently at 137%"
bad,good place to work poor management. i would reccomend for this job due to a fun  work day environment and good cowrkers and training. the majority of this place is good.
bad,"Many of the workers are overly passive aggressive, they will belittle you and talk bad about you behind your back. Not all of them were like this but the ones that were are terrible. Management seemed good at first until they fired two managers and another one quit. We got new incompetent managers, one of which would talk down to everyone and seemed unprofessional. Many people started quitting or getting fired. And they cut dozens of peoples hours to 5 per week without warning. All in all, it's not a good place to work at right now. Also, all the general manager of the store cares about is getting customers to get the credit card above anything else and will hound you to coerce customers to apply for it even though our card gives a huge hit to credit. I personally worked customer service and was told a set of rules and not to break them. But I found myself at the mercy of hateful customers who if they acted terribly, the manager would give them anything they wanted. I once had a customer throw his fishing rods in my direction so I went in the back room to tell my manager, instead of them trying to control the situation and make sure i was okay they wrote me up for cursing while talking to them even though no customers were around and proceeded to tell me I can't say no to customers, I am to always say yes. They ended up giving the customer everything he wanted even though it went directly against everything I was taught. Very inconsistent managers, people get fired a lot. Even if you throw up and are sent home by a manager you still get a point so you still get punished."
bad,"Morale at this location was consistently in the dumps. Management is NOT there to support you, they are there to push you to sell credit cards so they can reap all of the benefits while putting in minimal effort. Zero communication amongst management team and between managers and other employees. Leads in departments were bossy and lazy. Many employees were treated inappropriately by leads and complained, nothing was done. Management ignored availability and scheduled when employees were unavailable, then punished them for not coming in. Bass Pro Shops purchased Cabela's and has been restructuring everything, slashing benefits left and right. This location was never managed well, but having benefits slashed was the last straw."
bad,"It's been awhile since I worked here, it is my understanding that it has changed since they were bought by Bass Pro.  I cannot say.  When I worked there, there was no chance for full time and pushing the credit cards could be quite annoying.  All in all I liked the customer interaction."
bad,"Male dominant environment."
bad,"It can be expected to deal with a few difficult customers, but I was blindsided at how horrible management was. Coworkers were great, though."
bad,"Employee's used to enjoy a lot more discounts than they do now. Since Bass Pro bought Cabela's many products no longer qualify for an employee or military discount and many companies either ceased their retail worker incentive programs or Bass Pro terminated the programs. Pay was always fairly poor; however the employee pricing offset that a little."
bad,"When I first started at Cabelas I loved it. My co-workers were great. However, unless you are someone's favorite your not going anywhere no matter how hard you work or how much experience you have. "
bad,Conduct background checks on firearms. Stock the shelves with ammo. Clean the stations worked in. File paperwork in appropriate places. Sell firearms to customers.
bad,Focus is on the numbers instead of people. Need to put focus back on culture.  Moving further from what makes a great company to work for and shop at.
bad,"I was hired on as a part-time worker, but asked to work 40 hour during my time their and not reviving the benefits a full time employee gets. Asked to work 4 am one day and 4 pm the next."
bad,"Terrible store manager who terminates employees if they don't hound customers and sign them up for credit cards so he can earn a trip to Alaska.  Work hours were 50-60 a week, and was not allowed to take vacation.  Manager refused to hire associates to help in department."
bad,"I believe Cabela's would have been a nice and fun place to work if I had had better management. I think I just happened to be unlucky and have a bad manager, but as a girl in a place primarily run by males, I didn't always have a very good time. The security was bad, so it was primarily up to us outfitters to stop thieves, and my experience with management was really rough. I was lied to by a few managers, and taken advantage of. I do not recommend this job to any young females."
bad,Good place to work part time. Do not look to work full time here as they will make sure their employees work less than the minimum hours allowed for part time employees. They do not want to pay for benefits except for a handful of managers.
bad,"poor employee relation ship, everything is in the manual that you do not see, the employees are great to work with, hopefully thing will change when Bass Pro takes control"
bad,This company went from a  great  job to a very hard place to work due to the back stabbing after the merger with Bass Pro. Managers are cutthroat. The policy's are not followed very closely by managers but imposed very closely on the outfitters.
bad,"You work with a lot of cool people but it's really hard to make any advancements unless you start off working full time, you work harder than what you get paid for. the management wasn't really ever around, and would only be available if they didn't like something that was going on. it was really understaffed and you had to pick up way more projects than you were getting paid for."
bad,"Great workers. Awful management. Great benefits working there, but dealing with management is not worth it. They are more worried about selling club cards than satisfying customers or fixing problems."
bad,"No free time and no work/life balance, management could care less about you or your personal life. No one takes time to get to know employees and its work or die"
bad,"It is an okay place to work as long as you like not being paid well and not given many hours."
bad,"The new executive leadership put in place in 2015 have destroyed the culture of Cabela's.  There is no longer a focus on the employee, as only part time are hired outside of management.  Further, these part timers almost always have their hours cut mid-week."
bad,"This is a time where change is common. Jobs created other deleted. You must be aware of what is today may not be tomorrow. "
bad,"Store is matching staffing with sales and sales are down so less hours on the floor, that will change as the season continues so give it time to get better"
bad,"Worked for Cabela's for over 6 years in many capacities ranging from Seasonal Outfitter to Senior Manager.  My first few years with the company proved to be excited, encouraging, and family  oriented which made it a great place to be.  The last 3 years the company began to struggle due to poor management, overly aggressive expansion, and cost cutting that heavily impacted our ability to do our jobs effectively.  Once Dick Cabela died the core culture of the company was virtually abandoned overnight and the downfall began.  If you are looking for a career opportunity I would seek that elsewhere as job security and the future of the company are going to be a gamble at the best."
bad,"Fun to shop here, but not so much to work. Advancing in the company is very difficult, many hard working employees are taken advantage of too often, and working in customer service is about as much fun as getting your teeth pulled out."
bad,Fun workplace with very little room for advancement unless you are willing to relocate. Pay is typical of any retail position. Most of employees are only part time.
bad,It was a typical retail store but they did not let me go to full time even though they hired others. The other employees  were friendly and helpful but management was never available to talk to.
bad,"This is a terrible company to work for and they have no morals."
bad,"low pay, poor benefits, discounts on products that is at times only equal to sale prices. The company has rapid ideas for grand expansion, but within the retail setting there is little room for advancement. Many (but not all) department managers see this as only a job, not a ""career"" and have no passion for the outdoors or the products being sold. Strategically the company is posed to become a wal-mart/ k-mart or the outdoors they do not value employees experience enough to pay them well, and as such end up with less passionate employees just stocking shelves."
bad,With all the news about the potential of Bass Pro purchasing Cabela's it is a very unreliable place to work.  Management are liars and only care about making the all mighty dollar.
bad,"Cabela's is not the greatest place to work. The turn over rate is unreal . Also, good luck with the managers because they really don't know how to do their jobs and they try to tell you constantly to do the same thing you've been doing for a year."
bad,When starting with Cabela's it was a family oriented company. It was a great place to work.  After about 4 months the company turned around and was more of a corporate place to work.  No more caring about their employees.
bad,"The store and customers were fun and interesting. BUT........Management is what made that place miserable. Because they are miserable, it rubs off. But, management can hide in their offices and relax while the workers have to force a smile on their faces. To the management.....why take a position that you cannot handle?? That place would be so much better if they had secret shoppers checking management out."
bad,"Negotiating, partnering and collaborating with major vendors for process improvements within Merchandising. Managed a team of 12 that effectively reduced which effectively reduced chargebacks impacting increased margin and bottom line results."
bad,"Greeting all customers, selling the Cabela's credir card.  Working the sales floor and the registers."
bad,"The job is what it is.  It's a warehouse job; fairly low pay, long hours, hot, noisy, no guarantee of getting 40 hours per week, and very little room for advancement."
bad,"I worked weekends their my first 2 years of college and the job was fun, working with hunting/outdoor gear other employees were fun and great people to learn from. Management seemed to not always be on top of things, and some were extremely rude. As far as I know most of the managers that were there when I was there are no longer employed. Overall, the discounts on gear made everything worth while."
bad,I was hired on just a month ago to help be a part of the team to open the store and be here for the next few months until they decide who's staying and going. Not an issue for me though as ill be leaving the place as soon as possible.
bad,"The job was alright, but in my mind there was to much slack in teenage and young workers and they took advantage of it and just chatted instead of doing there job. In my mind a good company needs people with a good work ethic to stay strong."
bad,"The company was quick to welcome yet slow to train, not a lot of hands on guidance but a lot 9f computer knowledge you had to learn which was fine if it wasn't so boring, HR was Friendly and very respectful, Management was distasteful in regards of training and explaining things fully on what they wanted out of there associates."
bad,"If you are not a favorite, you wont fit in at Cabelas. This store shows so much favoritism to certain outfitters and others feel worthless. Sometimes no matter how much work you put in, it's not ever recognized. Managers have relationships with outfitters below them. Its just like high school at this store. Too much drama and too ""cliquey""."
bad,Worked in the footwear department.  Manager was a nice guy and fair; far too much time on my feet and going up and down metal stairs to fetch and return shoes.
bad,"Cabela's started off so promising, they made it seem like a family and bragged about all of the activities they have for employees outside of work (picnics, Christmas parties, cookouts, etc). There were some really great people I met and had a wonderful time working with, but also just as many poor ones. I worked in a fairly small department and was practically bullied by another outfitter in it. HR definitely didnt make you feel like a report would do any good so I didnt even bother. The general manager at the time cared about nothing more than getting the store to sell club cards. Even when a customer would specifically ask for him to resolve a problem he wouldnt even know how to communicate with them. Was promised 20-25 hours per week when I first started and that was cut to 10 hrs per week after about 2 months of being there. Overall the store needs better management and they need to learn to punish the mean and lazy employees instead of the employees who actually work hard. Showed a lot of favoritism."
bad,Management does not really cultivate or motivate employees. Lacking in training and seem to be more reactive than proactive.  Management as individuals are great people but the whole company needs to revamp their processes in order to keep things running smoothly to help the customers and keep staff from becoming frustrated with programs.
bad,I'm a cashier there right now and it can get to be pretty ridiculous when half the people don't even know what there doing or what is going on... The requirements to push so hard to the credit card is so stupid by the time a customer has arrived and left they on average are asked to sign up for the card at least 3 times that is crazy. Leads are terrible managers are awesome currently. If your willing to work and you get fulltime they will let you work. The benefits are good if its a bass pro or cabala brand any other its just %15... Tax is %5.5  in WI... But other than that the people on your level are normally decent to work with.
bad,"Pay was alright before the Bass Pro Shop merge. Everyone making above what BPS was paying, were fired. A joke. Discounts were decent and we got access to a site which allowed us to get killer discounts on other brands such as timberland, trager, etc. Went on a few mini events we were paid for so that was a lot of fun. Coworkers were incredible, managers were always very grumpy and more bossy than anything. I was full time and was getting MAYBE around 10 hours a WEEK while they were hiring new people. Eventually left. Not worth the gas."
bad,"just another retail job. probably the same as working at any other store. the best part used to be the discount, but that is gone. just an average retail job. nothing special."
bad,"It used to be a great place to work until the CEO and major share holders decided to cash out and sell the company. We will see what the new owners will do, only time will tell."
bad,customer service focused on a daily basis. As a part of management I supported many of the decisions that were made that I did not agree on and was forced to make decisions based on others values and not for the benefit of the employees.Advancement is not based off of knowledge and experience!
bad,Cabelas was purchased by Bass Pro. Many changes were made and the transition was very disorganized. Positions were eliminated leaving many without employment. Management seems more interested in writing disciplinary notices for attendance (5 minutes late) than coaching and supporting associates.
bad,Very busy store. Good way to stay bust throughout day. higher management very nice and personable. Wish them the best through there merger. Outfitters really friendly also
bad,"Assist customers with Firearm Purchases"
bad,"We used to have a great time. Now it is all about selling the credit cards and doing the work of 2 or 3 people for low pay. Also, there is not much recognition or respect from upper management."
bad,"Cabelas is a good company in general. The wages are low but ideal for students and some one who is retired but not enough to support a family person. Management is reactive not proactive and is hindered by HR, as Hr is sourced out to another company and therefore has Cabelas inc.'s interests and not the employees' as prerogative."
bad,Its a great place to work if you don't mind getting yelled at all day because if you don't do things their way its wrong. The store manager is a satanist.
bad,"While most of the required tasks are not that difficult, you will never be working hard enough or completing enough of them to appease the management. Many of your coworkers may be awesome, but then there are some real duds who will hinder your daily progress, compounding the issue previously stated. In my tenure, morale was increasingly seeming to be an issue, and changes in the over-arching structure were leading long-time and loyal employees to finally call it quits. It may be just on the ""getting worse before it gets better"" swing, but we saw no real signs of it improving in the near future. It may very well slowly suck the life out of you."
bad,"Cabela's was like a second family to me despite extremely poor management and shady business practices. When I started with Cabela's it was a great place to work, training was fun and got you pumped for a great outdoor company. However Cabela's quickly changed to a credit card company that sells outdoor gear. Proformance and promotions are based solely on credit card numbers and not store proformance or customer service. It was bad enough that they send out teams of management into the worst parts of town to specifically target homeless to sign up for credit cards in return for a free shirt or hat. If you are willing to sell your soul, Cabela's is for you. The floor employees are truely great people, and so are some of the managers. However, the tactics from corporate to boost credit card numbers have made Cabela's miserable to work for."
bad,"Upper management always said that they were a family oriented company, but they are not. They don't care about employees by any means."
bad,"Boat sales Manager is commiting fraud with boat sales, and no one is doing anything about it. Managers at the store don't have a clue how to manage employees."
bad,Management is terrible and you will be watched and interrogated about everything you do. Human Resources looks out for the managers instead of the hourly employees and will throw anyone under the bus to save themselves. They will ask you to do more and more with less time and reprimand you when you cannot complete all your work. The pay is horrible for what most jobs entail. The only reason I stayed for so long was because of my decent hours I couldn't get anywhere else.
bad,"Everyone i worked with even my supervisors were awesome and fun to work with. Management, however, only cared about the bottom line and viewed all employees as replaceable."
bad,"management had no knowledge of products.cut employees to part time. treating store like its a wal-mart. hired people with no knowledge of firearms,ammo and firearm safety.enjoyed helping customers choose firearms,ammo and teaching personal protection"
bad,"The customers at Cabelas are great. The management or lack of was impossible. They are very degrading and belittling. They only look out for each other."
bad,I learned a lot while working there but the management was a little shotty so it made working there a little difficult at times. other then that working there was pretty cool you meet some interesting people who walk into the store.
bad,"Stressful, little management on the floor, older employees are allowed to ""intimidate"" , most enjoyable is working with customers and the products. Hardest part of the job is trying to learn the job, some employees do not want to ""teach"" new employees, there is no set form of training. I believe in the products they sell."
bad,A typical work day was slow at the start then it became more and more stressful because of the managers. I didn't learn to much considering how much experience i had in retail. The managers weren't above throwing your under the bus to protect their own butts and a lot of them talked down to team members. The work place culture was awful like I said before they (managers) thought about themselves and numbers than the people that worked for them. The hardest part of the job was the managers. Honestly there wasn't nothing really enjoyable about the company.
bad,"Management treated hourly employees like dirt.  They also intimidated employees on a daily basis and made employees feel like the next day they may not have a job.  Part of this was due to the company being sold and restructured.  The other part was in general poor management skills.  If management acted more like they cared about the hourlies lives then the turnover rate would not have been so high.  Also, pay needs to increase if you want to retain the staff that does work and work hard with no recognition."
bad,Everyone is really relaxed an nice. The Company is ran pretty smoothly an loves to get all the employees involved in everything. I would recommend it to people who love the outdoors.
bad,"When Bass Pro Shops came into the picture, things went downhill. Employees are told credit card referrals are more important than customer satisfaction. You can have the best customer comments, but if you get less than 4 referrals a week, then you are considered a poor employee."
bad,"This is a company that pretends it is high school. "
bad,"Data entry and working with customers of fraudulent charges and banks on charge backs.  Lots of computer work and helping customers by phone.  Workplace atmosphere was lots of tension.  Fast pace due to phones always ringing.  "
bad,"Was a great place to work with the best store manager that I have ever had the privilege to with but they were terminated without notice one day and their replacement is fairly difficult to work under."
bad,The management wasn't the nicest and i need better pay and a job closer to home. They have poor management and I don't get very many hours. Probably about 20 hours a week
bad,The schedule changes every other day. Management is unorganized. Push people to sign up for a credit card should be the job title. no matter how hard you work you will be treated like your worthless. You will not get breaks
bad,"My day would start with my clocking in to work and going to the technology room to receive my scan gun for the day, then I would head to my assigned area where the shift lead would gather our group together for announcements and stretches, after that I would head to the main desk to pick up my first task, scan it into my gun and then get going! "
bad,Great and fun place to work because of people and products. Pay and benefits leave much to be desired.  Fellow co-workers are fun to work with.  The training program is very brief and non-helpful.  Product training is nearly nonexistent.  Typical work day is serving customers and stock shelfs. It is good on the job experience for the outdoors.  I definitely enjoy the people I work with and being introduced to the products.  I have no opinion on management because you never have contact with them
bad,"great co-workers but  horrible management, favoritism was clearly shown. The workload itself was good, had opportunities for overtime that seemed to be not offered to everyone. limited opportunity for growth."
bad,"The job is ok.  I enjoy working with my co workers.  Management is very flaky, customers..........N-C.  Hardest part is covering 3 depts being the sole person there."
bad,"have some serious issues to work out with management, with little chance to move from seasonal to full time. 3 positions in 13 months"
bad,"Cabela’s was known for it’s dedication to outfitting customers with all of their outdoor needs. Knowledge and customer service was paramount when I first began  working for Cabela’s, but after the merger with Bass Pro, it became all about pushing the credit card. You’re better off working at a bank."
bad,"3 errors and you get fired. Clueless management, store manager hated me and went out of her way to criticize me and mock. Horrible hours and zero flexibility."
bad,"Come to work and that's it! Hope to make friends and conversations along the way!! Most customers are amazing though! Uniform is simple, but still fine!"
bad,"When I first started working back in Oct 2017 I was in love with everything about it. The people, the atmosphere, the customers. Honestly this was the best place I've ever worked at until the new owner took over."
bad,A lot of work put on you even when it's not in your responsibilities.  Bad management all the way to the top.  Would be a great place if upper management cared a little more of their employees.  We'll see how the bass pro buyout goes...
bad,Cabala's employees are obsessed with drama and suck everyone in.  The management is terrible.  The company runs on hot air and rifle-loving hillbillies.
bad,I enjoy working there until lots of changes came-schedule does not allow for any family time-undependable co workers so you are asked to stay longer in shift-nice coworkers
bad,"This was a great place to work until recently. "
bad,"This is a waterfall development shop and as such, developers will spend the majority of their time in meetings rather than writing code. They are very set in their ways, and make a point to dumb down their website for non-technical users. Supporting browsers such as IE7 and AOL Explorer make the use of any modern web technologies very difficult. The use of new technologies and practices are actually discouraged as most of the developers and management have never used anything other than Java EE. Developers have no say in implementations or architectures."
bad,I loved working at Cabelas I loved the events they had for the customers and the events they had for employees also.
bad,"If you enjoy pushing credit cards and having your entire job evening based on credit card performance with the option for management to fire you for poor credit card performance. ( they threaten it but can't actually fire you for not getting just for not asking)"
bad,"Upper management treats employees poorly, multiple deserving outfitters passed up for advancement opportunities. Lots of busy work that will be reversed the next day. Employees are nice and fun to work with besides upper management, constant patterns of disrespect shown. Lower management wonderful to work with. Good benefit opportunities."
bad,"There was lack of communication between day crew and nights, lack of management working with nights. Lack of good management and willing to listen to our ideas as of whole night crew and willing to put the actions. Good workers but not good management who's working with nights or with their workers."
bad,"while the whole basis of Cabelas core values is solid. i found that the store i worked with lacked drive and respect for employees under you. a GM that was disconnected from employees and other managers was a horrible experience. Training was so lacking on a whole scale that often people were just thrown to the wolves. the training that was received was so generic that often people had to do their own research to be better sales personal.in the Midwest district you had regional managers that were so out of touch that they had no clue on what was happening.In a store that is 89,000 square feet the turn over was way to high when employees filled out their employee survey it was perceived that no one in the whole organization cared to change things. the mentality that you are left with is quit or get fired we will replace you anyway ."
bad,company care more about making money then giving more benefits and incentives to the people who help run the company in the call centers
bad,"Laid most of corporate off after acquisition by Bass Pro.  Fell off after that.  Lacked candor, lacked vision, lacked leadership, and destroyed a town and corporate talent.  It was a pretty good place to be, but went down hill."
bad,"Since Cabela's was taken over by Bass Pro Shop, the product selection and quality has decreased so customers are not happy which leads to less traffic and higher stress for pushing credit card sign-ups."
bad,"Was a learning experience unloading trucks getting the store "
bad,"Originally was a fun and exciting place to work. Since the Bass Pro buyout it has become extremely stressful, with falling traffic and a constant push to sell credit cards and service contracts."
bad,"Not the same place to work as when Cabela's family owned this business.This company changes schedules too frequently, which makes it difficult to balance life. Morale is extremely low in this facility. Work load likely to increase as employees find alternate employment."
bad,I learned a lot of lessons in professionalism. It was an eye opening and valuable experience. Workplace Culture is country. hardest part of the job was being responsible for other departments that aren't your responsibility. The most enjoyable part of the job was the team work with coworkers.
bad,"A good place to go to when you are a customer. Not the greatest place to work. Give under the required amount of shifts "
bad,"Ever since Bass Pro took over there hasn't been a single thing that has been improved, everything has gone downhill. Discount has gotten MUCH worse (15% off everything except firearms/ammo/reloading supplies/anything to do with ammo & 45% anything Cabela's or Bass Pro branded), push workers to push the credit card too much (pushing the card seems to be more important than sales), absolutely no incentive for workers to stay there long term except for UP TO a 50 CENT raise per year (haven't heard of anyone getting higher than 40 cents), and forgot to mention you start at minimum wage(workers don't get commission). Can make them more profit in 1 month selling stuff than they will pay you for 6 months of work. Cabela's seemed to care about employees more, whereas Bass Pro seems more interested in making $$ and hurting employees morale slow and steady, all workers have highly disliked the treatment and takeover by Bass Pro and I'm sure its only going to downhill from here."
bad,"My managers were incompetent and didn't respect employees."
bad,I do not wish to participate in the survey.  This is something that I do not feel will beneficial as my position with my experiences with the company are not positive.
bad,this is a fun place to work if your an outdoors person. The management is ok. When I was there corp was coming down hard on all departments and managers.
bad,Company is more concerned with bottom dollar than taking care of the employee. the company would rather kiss the bottom of the customers butt whether right or wrong to keep them happy; even if the employee is correct and the customer is wrong.
bad,"Good environment to work in. Lots of training to prepare you for the job. Didn't give enough hours, rude lead. Extremely micro managed"
bad,Co-workers were great. Management was average. The main problem I had with Cabela's is that did not want full time employees an have to pay for benefits.
bad,"I was hired on part time and was told it was 20-23 hours a week, mostly evening shifts, and ocassional overnights.  It ended up being just under full time hours, and every shift was overnight and worked every single weekend"
bad,"A typical workday would involve handling phone calls from typically aggravated customers for at least a 5 hours a shift. Although the pay was decent and the immediate management were very kind, overall the job was monotonous. I learned a lot about patience and biting my tongue from this job. It is in an office setting where you will be required to sit still in one spot, typing and talking for hours at a time"
bad,Team members were good to each other and kept e=one another moving but some management was rude and very ill to understanding what a good staff needs and how to keep your staff instead of a rovolving door
bad,"Cabela's is loosing its identity since the Bass Pro buyout. There is still a great selection of products for customers but it has lost that ""something special."""
bad,This company acts like there employees are there best friends and that they are so important but they do nothing for them. The pay in very low and the benefits are a joke.
bad,My department is better slow during the week and winter time. I help out Customers that have questions. I've learned how to have patients and do whatever I can to make customers happy. The Management is very jacked up no one can make up their mind just very poor management. The hardest part of being there was dealing with unhappy customers and the lack of training on some items. i enjoyed when there was a lot of stock that came in and customers who know what its like to be in your shoes.
bad,"I clean bathrooms, break rooms, and offices. I buffed and waxed the entry ways. My manager was one anyone could get along with as long as the did their job."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company,  I really would have loved to stay and see where I could have gotten to me in different positions within the company"
good,The experience of working at Cabelas was ok but very stressful and not regular hours the boss of the warehouse had no social skills and it was the first time in thirty years of working I had to make a complaint to HR over the treatment from a supervisor
good,Cabela's is a hard company to get into unless you NEVER miss work and you great brown nosing skills.
good,"Managers were unavailable most of the time and scheduling didn’t care if you put in a request. They didn’t specify when or how often the schedule would be updated. If you’re an outsider working here, there’s a high chance you’ll feel very uncomfortable working here."
good,"Cabelas was a forward thinking company but tried to do IT cheaply sacrificing quality and dependability of the applications. Excessive ""user direction control"" contributing to IT platform and application sprawl. Too many platforms supported by minimal staff contributed to underperformance of the IT function."
good,"Working retail.  Low wages, extremely variable hours and job security.  At the whims of economy and management pressure.  Generally work with good people."
good,Very popular with a lot of people. If u need clothing for hunting or fishing they got it. Management can be helped a little. Maybe have more training. Its an amazing place to work because you get to meet people from all over and get to talk to people about the history of the workplace.
good,It is difficult to get time off to be with your family or get a schedule that fits for your families needs.  They cater to part timers and work the full timers bad schedules.
good,"You just have to see for yourself. you will find they have no respect for you or your time, clearly poor leadership here. They will have you show up to work ready to go and tell you to leave because the business is slow and they cant afford the payroll"
good,Typical day at work was always changing never staying the same something new happening each hour.  Learn lots from moving into different departments and new job postings. The co-workers are great to work with and the hardest part of the job crazy with it was busy in the store and stress management with the managers always looking over your shoulder.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers never a dull moment.
good,"It was a fun place to work, helped out customer's. I worked with lovely people, the hardest thing about my job was having to ask the customer's if they wanted to sign up for a credit card because the customer's thought it was invading their privacy when we had to ask them all these question."
good,I loved working there but they would not follow through with their promises. I requested off before I even started and was told I would get it off and then was told a week before that I was not able to get off for a family dinner which I was suppossed to bring food to. I ended up quiting.
good,"See above. ""Senior"" management is a serious issue. The Managers in general care. The work can be challenging but extra effort is not appreciated by senior managers. Forget exceeds, best you can expect is meets and only if you don't rock the boat."
good,There are really great people who work at Cabela's. The work environment is decent as long as you enjoy your job and what department you work in. The management is 50/50 depending on who you get put under.
good,"Manager pushes club cards over anything else. Good co-workers,but  no real section head. Enjoy working with the customers. Information is hard to obtain."
good,Weak training but somethings you pick up over time.  Employee knowledge is a bit all over with no consistency. Fellow workers can be fun.  The environment is ever changing with the staff  that mostly consists of college students
good,"Favouritism is rampant , management never on the floor. Scheduling always a problem. The constant Beratment of all employees when when did not make the outrageous credit card goals wore everyone one down to the point that attitudes were dismal."
good,"Over all I love the people I worked with,the higher ups have no clue how to run the place though. Unless you are stroking their egos you are not moving from your place. The reward people who do nothing (and admit it) while others who break their backs get over looked,all because the people who do nothing stand around and talk to them and make them feel good."
good,"Extremely difficult to work in culture of degradation. All expectations were placed on middle management who had no authority within the workplace. Employees are treated as expendable, even those who had tenure. Very big gaps in communication down the ladder."
good,Management would cause problems with in departments. Daily procedures would change. Extreme favoritism would be shown. Certain people would not have to follow procedures and management would groom who they choose. Matters that would be addressed to help the company and departments would not be heard. Management and HR work against outfitters if anything was brought to their attention. Working there felt like it was political only benefiting upper managment. Schedules were always incorrect and changed without notification after posted. Outfitters would be reprimanded for not being on shift after a change and outfitter would not know that schedule change from what was posted couple weeks in advance.
good,there are no benefits unless you are with in management. management isn't very supportive and the hours you work are never consistent. You can be a part time employee and they will schedule you full time with out the benefits. Not a good place to work if you have a family. they require you to work weekends as most retail positions do.
good,Its okay. Management is rough. Haven't learned much working there. Just a typical retail job. Some coworkers make it worth going to work everyday. Good first/summer job for students
good,The job was an excellent job.  Very good training for the most prt.  incividual store management overall is very porr.  A few department managers are great.  Store manager and softline manager are inept.
good,"I was in charge of opening up the In Store Pickup department.  All equipment that the employees used where handed out there also.  I made sure that the mulit-line phone system was up and working and made sure that the register was up and running."
good,"Drove a stock picker within the warehouse, and maintained a perfect safety record. Identified and retrieved the correct product from storage location and transported it to assigned location."
good,"Lot of COA, if you have a god father in IT you'll get promotion else just salary."
good,"A typical day as a Softlines Associate at Cabela's consists of scouting your department for anything out of place or any apparel that fell off the hangers or racks. The hardest part about the job is meeting the Cabela's Club Card quota. A lot of the customers that come into Cabela's already have a card, so it's hard to convince them to get another. You get penalties whenever you don't push a customer to get a Club Card."
good,I was only here a few months and witnessed a lot of unnecessary drama. I loved my manager I had(she has also left due to same issues) but too many bias people.
good,"Cabelas focuses too much on the club card, and not about the customer. There is so much red tape to anything. Unless you are upper management, there is no career advancement. They pay like dogs and do not give commission on selling any boats."
good,Loved working for the company but the management was poorly evaluated and assessed.  I would not work for this company again with this same management at this same location in short pump virginia
good,"its a very dramatic place to work "
good,"the customers can be rude. Everyone wants a discount. The management started off ok, but once that changed, it wasnt good. They dont value family the way they say they do."
good,"I love the atmosphere and I love how I get to work with firearms. The management doesn't know what it's doing, however, and the pay is terrible.  Managers like to tell me how to do my job even though I've been there longer than they have."
good,"I worked at Cabela's for a few years. The first ones were the best ones. Then the merger happened. There was so much that happened to too many good employees. There was favoritism across the board. I couldn't tell you how many hours I would put in during the holidays but that I worked very hard and it was never enough for them. If there was a different GM, I would apply again, given the core values haven't changed again."
good,"When I first started at Cabelas it was a caring, relaxed environment where management worked hard to help with flexible hours or time off. As  Cabelas began a buyout process, life there became about the bottom line. No overtime was allowed during Peak, we just had to work harder and be behind. Personnel shakeups were hard on us, and most of the management is now gone. Very stressful."
good,"I loved my job position. It made me feel like an important part of the company, The biggest downfall was management. It is what drove me and many others out the door. There was extremely high demands with absolutely no appreciation and lots of micromanaging. For a store manager who knows nothing about the department you are in to step in and give impossible deadlines that require much more time to do efficiently is ridiculous. He did not have the experience to be a store manager and the turn over rate because of him was unacceptable."
good,"Employees work together to provide great customer service to the customers and ensure orders go out as promised.  Management has some work to do to get organized.  Management thinks family comes last and they never say when you will be finished.  Refuse to work three shifts, so they work the two shifts they have to death."
good,"fun to work at but terribly managed"
good,The type of work takes a toll on the body. Bad sleeping habits. The only positive was the money. But not worth it otherwise.
good,The orientation was great with great expectations and together we would be a family doing FUN things but that is a bunch of hog wash by Upper Mgmt. The GM don't even acknowledges you're there.  The hiring turn over rate is very high.
good,"What started out as a great team atmosphere has been lost. Management is short term, and no longer same values as when the store opened. Don't look to work here and ""move up"". its not going to happen. The current management will only hire for management outside of store. Has done his best to get rid of almost all the original team, and brought moral into the toilet. Im not bitter, I enjoyed working there, up until the new management. I wasn't looking to move up, just watched many qualified, dedicated workers get passed over to outside resources. The people who work at outpost 1"
good,"So yeah just as it says, don't get sick ever, with anything. They don't care, they just say they do but the moment something happens they replace you, that simple."
good,"fun environment to work in"
good,"Enjoyable retail experience, like-minded co-workers with a passion for the outdoors. However, tough for company career advancement. There are few opportunities to move up the ladder."
good,"The typical day had a new challenge"
good,They say they hire full time but give you part time  hours so they  dont have to give you benefits. I got wrote up because my son was sent home early from daycare and couldnt go back for 24 hours (had a letter to proove it). I also got wrote up for missing work dur to a car accident (had a note from doctor too). If you areny sleeping with some one or know someone you arent gonna get any advancement
good,"Loved meeting the customers that came in the store and the employees."
good,"You could be a perfect retail employee, but if you don't sell the credit cards then you mean nothing to management. They held a kids camp to teach kids range safety and fishing, but chose less experienced outfitters to supervise because they sold credit cards. "
good,"Great to get into retail and lots of fun people to work with, but underpaid to other stores in area by noticeable amount. New corporate management is poor"
good,"It was a good opportunity. Very thankfully for the exposure. Would be a good part time position for a college student or retired individual. "
good,"Most outfitters have an extremely low opinion of the section manager. Not the friendliest fellow. Makes you feel inferior for asking questions, and does not like showing you the ropes."
good,"very strict job with very strict management. If you are a female employee, male customers will treat you like you don't know anything in your own department. overall good environment."
good,"My coworkers were excellent and fun to be with, but it really depended on which department of the store you worked in. Upper management were CONSTANTLY pushing for selling more credit cards and threatened punishment if you didn't make their goals.  Talking to customers about it became non genuine."
good,"The general feel of working in the store was okay until Bass Pro stepped in.  I worked in the Deli department which was awful but the rare occasion I helped other departments was okay.  Im technically Part-time but I work 8 or 9 hours a day.  People are great, super friendly easy to work with.  Some managers are great but others really don't seem to care.  As far as retail goes it's a pretty good temporary/high school/seasonal job."
good,"I didn't enjoy it, but it was VERY fast working environment. All the time we were moving. But we didn't get benefits even for full time employees. It sucked."
good,All of the employees are either retirees or college students who are there because they are bored at home but don't care about the advancement of the company.
good,"Typical day includes  hard labor, long hours. Management is discriminatory towards woman in the warehouse. There is little to no advancement opportunities in the Warehouse. Being a part time position medical and most benefits are not applicable."
good,Everything at Cabela's has changed since the announcement of the merger.  Continuously making bad decisions at the expense of the employee made for an overall low morale work environment. I highly recommend to stay away from Cabela's till the merger is solidified.
good,"Because managers are given so much autonomy, this can be a great place to work or an awful one. Getting the wrong manager means a horrible environment. Typical corporate culture; top heavy. Quite a few managers with less than 5 direct reports and too little to do so they spend all day micromanaging. Hourly employees are not allowed overtime very often. A little cult-ish."
good,"Overall, not a bad place to work. People are friendly. Management could use a few courses on respect,integrity and professionalism."
good,Long hours and hard work.  Heavy expectations.  Co-worker were great. Had some good benefits. Not very flexible.  Best part was not being there.
good,"I am a loyal and hard worker. I am looking for a job where I can use my clerical and customer service experience to the benefit of my new employer."
good,Cabela's is way too top heavy with management. You have to deal with too many bosses with differing ideas so you do not know who to listen to. They claim to care about their employees but never seem to deliver. The store is most always short staffed so you end up covering numerous departments.
good,Productive workplace with a nice break room. Enjoyed working with departmental co-workers.
good,Management are like most places. the inhouse incentives are good. the hours are good because they will sometimes allow you to work the hours you need if you have other jobs.
good,It is great to work in an industry surrounded by individuals with similar interests in their pastimes. It seems as though as fun as a place can be to work when there is a lack of structure and training it makes it hard to develop as a team.
good,My year at the company was filled with anxiety and fear as I was told by a direct supervisor regularly that my job wasn't secure and they wouldn't hesitate to find a replacement if I screwed up. Terrible management
good,"I was qualified in every department and that was a downfall because I was completely overworked and expected to do everything. Every time a promotion became available, you'd accept it then get laid off. There was no respect or appreciation for the employees."
good,"I worked here for a couple years and the bass pro take over played a huge role in killing employee morale. You're expected to push credit cards and punished if you don't. You're also given really good incentives for getting people to sign up. Overall it was a fun work place while it lasted with room for advancement within the company but Bass Pro ruined all employee incentives, discounts, and morale."
good,"I took what I could get. I was overqualified, and really would've preferred an entry-level managerial position. I couldn't manage to pay my bills or rent; I recognize this is my mistake, but new employee compensation wasn't close to enough to afford rent & bills."
good,"I cleaned the restrooms, used the floor scrubber (uncertified), and did other light cleaning for a year there. First off, restrooms,  especially men's,  were absolutely DISGUSTING.  pay was ok, but not much room to advance.  I was up for yearly review when Bass Pro did complete takeover and everything changed, for the worse. We, the very small cleaning crew we had,  started at 4am, to get everything,  which was ALOT, to get everything done before opening at 9am. When takeover happened,  we no longer were able to start at 4am, only at 6, and also lost a $2 an hour shift differential.  We needed alot more help to clean so as it was, and then less time, and less money. No thanks. Plus the benefits stank. Oh, and when we complained to try to get things fixed, it almost never happened.  Needs a whole new roof, tiles always falling down.  Surprisingly it's still standing..."
good,"You should just work at Walmart. Most of the discounts are gone, management is getting better, but still needs work. I hope you like pushing credit cards, cause sales don't matter but the credit cards do."
good,"The job itself isn't hard and is actually a great position to be apart of, I had a great supervisor and even better IT peers who were all based in different locations in the U.S. The main problem I had was with bass pro and when they took over, they made changes that were not agreeable to a lot of people. I also had issues with my home store a lot because they didn't follow standard procedure and acted like it was my fault when I didn't fix their issues right that sec. Some of the management for the stores are bad chose, mostly because they either don't know how to properly manage their people and make them happy, had a lot of temper that they expressed in a unprofessional manner, or both."
good,"Almost everyone at Cabela's is a joy to work with. Really pleasant people, many of whom are very knowledgeable in the very specific retail focus of the chain. "
good,Bass Pro Shops destroyed the work environment of Cabela's. It's all about credit referrals and customer service does not come first. You will get fired for not referring enough people to sign up for their credit card. In my experience their was a Department Lead that multiple people reported him for multiple things (verbal abuse mostly) and he was never disciplined.
good,"I love the products but due to sales philosophy of company we were always at odds with the customers. Poor compensation for the work."
good,"My time there was a fun experience. the only issue I really had there was when it came time to promote someone for a job, I was passed over. more then once. I worked way to hard to not be given a chance to prove my worth for the company I enjoyed so much."
good,Cabelas was a great place to work when I started 2 years ago as a department mgr. Now ever since bass pro has taken over they are ruining the cabelas culture of the customer first by cutting so many positions in each store!! It sad to see such a great company going to pot!!
good,"It being retail it was for the most part always busy, especially on the weekends and during the holidays.  With that being said you definitely needed to watch the drama that seemed to be consistent, along the side of favoritism, which is how you achieved advancement within the store."
good,"If you are to work at Cabelas, I would suggest staying away from customer service/cashiers. It was so stressful, customers are rude, supervisors/managers don't help you the way you need."
good,"During a typical day, I get the cash for the cash register.  I then order parts for boat repairs, take calls from customer to schedule boats for repair."
good,working there is long and difficult also everyone there is stressed out by the work long which makes them angry. also being a machine operator makes working there a little easier.
good,It was a fun place to work up until they started laying off ppl. Meeting new people everyday was a huge plus. Unfortunately i was one of the one who was laid off
good,"I worked both on the front cash registers and up in the deli. The lack of communication between management and staff is prevalent throughout the entire establishment. The managers treat lower staff extremely poor, and frequently expect to be treated better than any one else. On the other side, fellow coworkers are fun and friendly."
good,"Job security at the time was good. Management was so so. Was passed over for a position which I applied for someone they didn't want to lose, who ended up leaving anyway. No advancement when you do a good job."
good,Managers cared too much for selling credit cards and for spending their free time in the break room getting drunk and watching tv. would not recommend
good,"The typical day is doing the required job and try to make rate, sometimes more difficult than expected. The work can be fast paced or even slow at times.  I have learned patience, perseverance, team work, and working with difficult people. Some of the management are really helpful and will always be there; but some management cares more about their image in the company. The workplace culture promotes team work but there are always some employees that do not get along with many people. The hardest part of the job is keeping up the pace over an eight hour day. It is physical labor and peak season can be very long.  The most enjoyable part of the job is enjoying talking with other coworkers. Most of my coworkers are very kind."
good,"Upper management is running a great company into the ground.  Upper management continues to make poor choices  daily.  Long hours, and management changing the rules daily.  They do not want people to succeed.  There is a very high turnover in the senior store management.  The district manager is very poor, but keeps blaming it on the store managers.  The sale to Bass Pro is going to be a disaster for them."
good,"I did real well because i do not buy into drama.  Store is great.  Discounts are a pleasant perk, some just work and focus too much on that sort of thing.  Management seems to have quite the burden placed upon their heads and the turn over is baffling.  It is because of this instability that this job lacks is score for me.  The corporation expectations seems stiff and our local of 15000 hardly satisfies a diverse application pool to meet retail needs.  So I had my job and I did it well and I just kept to myself and had a good time with fellow friends."
good,"No hours, especially in slow season.  In the busy season they do not want you to take breaks or lunches. The job itself was enjoyable and fulfilling, the customers were great, and so are the workers.  No benefits."
good,"Managment is very unsatisfactory. Benefits are pretty good. The store was much better before it became so corporate controlled. I would say as long as the entire upper managment was replaced the it would be a better place to work. Wages start at $9/hr. Each employee is only allowed up to a 3% raise per year, so dont expect to be able to take care of your family while working here. Would only recommend this job to someone looking for a first job or someone who is retired and looking for something to do."
good,"The hardest part of the job was knowing it wasn't going to help me grow in the business world. I met some great people. I Learned management skills by shadowing those around me. I had a vast knowledge of most of the products in the store so I was constantly busy. I was entrusted with money runs and closing down registers. My co-workers were a very diverse group of people and that is what made it an enjoyable environment. I was very easy to get along with. Anything that I didn't knowhow to do, I was eager to learn."
good,The work hours did not meet the work and home balance as the regular full time hours were not consistant.  Enjoyed working with other employees.  But found some management clicky.
good,"Everyone is very friendly expect for management, they don't know what they are doing nor will help you in time of need, they like to pin jobs on everyone else so they can hang out in the office, if they don't like you your pretty much not getting any shifts and they will push you out regardless of a good job you do."
good,"Management is ok, they don't like outsiders in Sidney.  But if you're a small towner, with mediocre expectations of yourself, you'll be ok.  This is an old school company, with men running the joint and a small town mentality.  Too bad, it could really be a great company!"
good,"Mid size company no freedoms high call volume, there strict on time management you could get wrote up for taking bathroom breaks frequently or emergency situations they dictate when you use the restroom and break times no freedoms at all, there unwillingness to work with employees in handing time off requests, They often refuse to accept doctors notes for illness they don't often value employees to them you are a number they often make the job more difficult then necessary in changing schedules without notice, policies change monthly they often treat some employees better then others, letting some employees get away with things that others would get fired for. I would avoid this company there pay is low for the area with little to no advancement unless you play there silly games they base promotions on personal favoritism over productivity or guest satisfaction with call quality."
good,"Being the Retail Marketing Manager at Cabela's Acworth is dynamic, fun and rewarding.  Each day, I am challenged to increase Cabela's visibility by connecting with key business leaders, conservation partners, and leveraging opportunities to collaborate to help our community.  "
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,Learned how to solve customer concerns and problems. The Management could be more supportive. Co-workers were amazing.
good,"Good company, however this store wasn't a full size cabela's.  The management wasn't trained well."
good,"1. Prep for the days work"
good,I love working with our customers and enjoy my coworkers.  I have learned some new job skills.
good,A typical work day would be full of customers and managers yelling at you and insulting my intelligence. the workplace itself was not that safe. there were too many managers telling you what to do at the same time and expected large tasks to be finished in minutes. customers were extremely disrespectful along with fellow employees. it felt like working at a high school with all of the cliques that were formed between departments.
good,Management is terrible. No one communicates. Expects you to work your butt off and get nothing in return. Wouldnt recommend this job to anyone
good,There was good management and flow in place here and they did try to treat and work fairly with employees. They do train well and offer uniforms and good benefits for their staff.
good,Management not the best  most supervisors didn’t care about the team  it’s a job you want to make some money but not a career just a lack of friendlyness from management
good,"When I applied and got hired on, I said I could do about 20-25 hours a week, and management said that was perfectly fine, yet I’ve been getting roughly 38 hours every single week, and I am not able to work that much... but if I call in more than three times i’m automatically terminated.. don’t expect to get the hours you’re wanting. As for the rest, it’s about the same as all other retail stores, there is a lot of favoritism and gossiping in this store. The job itself is very easy and fun though, and you get a great employee discount!!"
good,I worked customer service there and didn’t mind it when Cabela’s wasn’t  owned by Bass Pro Shops. Every since they took over everything went down hill. Management was poor and cared very little for employees. I did the work of a supervisor but still only got payed the same as a cashier. In my opinion customer service should definitely make more than a cashier. Good for shot time job but terrible for long term or during school. Hours were not consistent and I was constantly overworked during school.
good,"Company is floundering with the the merger of Bass Pro Shops and Cabela's.  Direction of the hunting and shooting sports has taken a back seat to the fishing and clothing departments.  More, less expensive and lesser quality clothing has been added to the stores and key portions of the Cabela's branded clothing have been removed and discontinued.  Customers are not happy with those changes, nor the Club Card changing from Visa to Master card and other ad related woes."
good,"The management and staff teams here are made up of really great people whom I thoroughly enjoy working with. The hardest part of the job however is the scheduling, but that's retail for you."
good,"Working at Cabelas's allows for flexible opportunities depending on your situation, but communication via email or phone is almost impossible. Hardest part of the job is being on your feet almost all day, and promoting the Cabela's credit card. Staff is cut short. Easy to meet nice people, but favoritism is apparent. Breaks are acceptable with pretty good pay for retail."
good,"Cabela’s is now owned by Bass Pro and hours are cut to 15 hours a week, pay is low, and associate recognition has decreased. I love my co workers and management staff, but corporate has made it less fun and with so little hours and pay it’s difficult to stay if one needs income."
good,Managers don't tend to care much about their departments or the employees in them. There little to no communication on what is happening in your department. They enjoy being passive aggressive to their employees rather than being upfront and providing feedback.
good,Nice place to work and the people are friendly and helpful. I drive a stock picker and pull cases of merchandise for customers. I have met a lot of new people and made a lot of new friends. their is not a hard part of my job.
good,Management plays favorite on the daily. They allow a supervisor to come too work all the time. The let other supervisors call off work for stupid reasons like to go to a football game. They only care about themselves and do tasking during busy time because it’ll make them look good.
good,This company is the most poorly mismanaged operation I've seen of its size. It also offers nowhere near appropriate compensation to its hardest workers.
good,"All though Cabela's provides a better customer service than other outdoor stores, it does lack a few thing's. Like for instance; pay is under-par, advancement in the company is unlikely/like pulling teeth and lastly, at times can be (at times) an unprofessional work place."
good,My only foray in a retail store. Never again. No security in the retail industry and like most companies favoritism and nepotism ran rampant. Employees are forced to get customers to sign up for company issued credit card.
good,"Keeping shelves and pegs neat clean and straight, and flexing product to make inventory appear adequate. Assisting customers in any department that is needed. Providing personal knowledge about products that customers are interested in. Enjoyable if you enjoy the department you work in, but difficult when picking up slack left by other workers."
good,"Cabelas is an ""ok"" company to work for. There are a lot of good people that work there, everyone is alway so helpful. Some days are very slow while others are very busy.  I enjoy working with customers and assisting them with their needs. Bad thing is there is always a big turn over in management and lack of communication."
good,Was just a seasonal employee at the distribution center but it was a good paying seasonal job helped me earn some cash for the holidays and had good hours.
good,"not a good place to work anymore, it used to be a great place to work but cabelas has been doing poorly for the last 4 to 6 years, in fact they sold out to Bass pro and now re are under going a massive restructuring and many people who have worked here for years are being let go."
good,I enjoyed working at Cabelas and I have made many friends.  I worked closely with customers and developed relationships.  I learned a great deal about spreadsheets and many other office based programs.
good,"Really enjoy working in this industry, but not totally in love with the company. Poor management structure, and Bass Pro buyout is making things even harder. Little room for advancement, and inadequate pay for what is done on a day to day basis. Good discount program, and fun work environment if you enjoy the outdoors, hunting and fishing, and like sharing your passion with likeminded people."
good,"The management do not communicate well if at all. Instant benefits like discounts are very limited, medical denefits are with an almost unheard of company. The corprate offices put into place policies and rules that sometimes make no sense and show that all the “higher ups” have never worked a day of retail in their lives."
good,They don't pay enough and work to many hours they take away from your home life. The work is good if your an energetic person who likes to be on the move and get a good workout at work. Great people and management.
good,I felt they were very fair l. But i wanted other opportunities. I enjpy engaging with people. I am dedicated. I hv 30 years experience in office admin
good,the store just isn't what it once was and the workers their just don't care about the job anymore and people are always mad that workers don't know where stuff is or if its in stock. The worst part is I hear them talk bad about managers and other staff most the time I was there ! This is why Bass Pro Shop is buying them out since Cabala's is going under !
good,"With a recent pay raise across the DC the wages are better now, but the amount of disorganization, confusion, and lack of communication throughout the company makes the workday more complicated than it needs to be.  "
good,It’s a good people culture place to work.  As a sales outfitter your expected to provide legendary customer service to every customer you come across in the store and to keep your department neat and ready
good,"Typical day is going in and getting done a few things that need to get done."
good,"When I first started with the company, things seemed pretty good; the Cabela family seemed to care about how things were run; but then the company went public, and it was downhill from there.  In-house management blatantly abused authority at times for amusement or punishment."
good,The management is okay but the other employee's are amazing for the most part. It can be a tough place to work but it was a good experience working in retail.
good,"A typical day at work included 3rd shift, lots of products scattered everywhere and a confusing store layout. Got forklift certified. Good ideas but not issued properly."
good,When you first start it seems like an awesome job. They are very stingy with getting time off and managers are constantly changing departments they are in charge of. I would not recommend for a long term job.
good,"Its Retail.... what do you want, Under paid and over worked is the story from anyone that has ever worked in retail. The management at the Kanata Store are a little clueless."
good,"work is  fun and clean and a good environment, pay sucks, don't expect a lot of hours. decent employee discount. Management is engentic"
good,"Management is okay, but if you're a college student like I am and this job is just paying for tuition maybe not the best place. If you can live off of 12 hours a week, then this is a place for you. I do enjoy working here, but every big company has it's problem. Sometimes, the schedule doesn't get out until a day or two before the next week, so good luck actually planning your life out."
good,"Fun place to work, would be best for part time, not for someone with bills. Great products, but does not pay wages high enough to earn a living off of.... Too much micro-management."
good,"The people working there can sometimes be difficult to work with. I made enough to get buy while working there, though. The hrs can be difficult to predict most of the time and you often find out at the end of the shift that everyone is required to stay longer than was planned for."
good,"I spent entire days stationed in the break room, listening to other employees complain all day. I was the phone operator and for some reason, they put us there. The management, for the most part, were nice, and all but 2 of them goofed off constantly, just hanging out in the office in stead of helping the staff who were mostly part time. Pay was a joke. Cabela's should be better at technology considering their online store, but they really aren't very good at managing a brick and mortar."
good,"The wage is minimal as a sales associate. opportunity for advancement im told is reasonable, they hire internally if possible. The discount for the first few years in negligible. Not very accommodating with scheduling hours. Opportunity to learn is great."
good,It was fast paced. I was very happy with the people and the job.They are strict about being late. I packed boxes and got to learn different things. No one was mean and employees would help each other when they were needed.
good,"The culture at Cabelas was in every aspect of your day to day job. The people who work there are usually hard working knowledgeable people who love what they do. The management at the Anchorage Alaska branch however was terrible, distant and controlling are two ways to describe them. The fact that working Full Time at Cabelas eaves you with absolutely no options as to College lead me to leave the company. They will NOT give you two days off a week on the days of your choice so scheduled college classes are out."
good,"Employees are expected to learn the job quickly which wouldn't be difficult if they weren't expected to learn multiple other jobs as well. A normal work day involves being sent to different departments, sometimes for less than an hour yet still keep your expected rate. The other employees are nice and easy to get along with, as well as the direct supervisors. The biggest problem with this company is the upper management. It never seems like they know exactly what the regular employee's job entails. I've had bosses that didn't even know how to do the job of the employees they were in charge of at all. When I lost my job, it was due to missing work while a very close family member was in the hospital and then passed away."
good,"it was a good job while in school, great co workers besides they like to gossip about everything. discount is nice but half the managers are rude and have a chip on their shoulder even though they are 40 and still haven't go up very high but the company is good."
good,"Good place to work especially if you have passions for the outdoors, in which I certainly do. Diverse culture of employees and customers alike, there is always something new to learn. Best part of my job being that I am an Eagle scout, is helping the younger scouts when they come into the store. Good co-workers to work with and a lot to learn from and vice versa. There is always room for improvement in the store and everyone alike."
good,Since the GM left the store all the managers went into disarray and you had no idea who to listen to and the lower employees were constantly heckled to meet certain standards that the managers themselves wouldn't try to meet.
good,"I was handling order/complaints/billing issues as a CSR at Cabelas Canada from all across Canada. Taking orders for camping, hunting, fishing clothing, firearms.  It was shift work but no later than 9 p.m. and they were open on Sunday's."
good,"You do stock, floor sets, cover for other departments, clean up...For just above minimum wage. There is NO movement possibilities."
good,I was only hired for a seasonal time period. I loaded trucks with merchandise that was taken to various Cabela stores.
good,"Unfortunately with this company, even with the new store openings there was not a chance to be advanced unless you were ""one of the guys.""  Most often no matter how much you take on the gain more momentum and to be noticed, the attention and credit was given to a man doing a sub-par job compared to your own."
good,"Without sounding mad,just not a great future for folks that know anything.Have alot to offer,however no one will lisen,thanks you are not complying,staying in one place with no protenial to move upto much good old boy"
good,"I met a lot of different kinds of people from many different backgrounds. The paycheck put food on my table, but the work schedule and job assignments changed almost daily, making it difficult to establish a routine with my crew. The overall upper management atmosphere was often negative and perceptively threatening."
good,"A typical day of work started at 4 am and would involve checking over machine, filling out paperwork, checking inventory levels, pulling product for customers, proper placement of incoming inventory. The most I learned other than to operate equipment was do not take everything for granted. My management staff were very understanding to particular situations going on in my life and were eager to work with me. Developed many close relationships with fellow coworkers who were reliable and strong in their work areas. Hardest part of the job was having to deal with the stress of wondering if they were moving you around within the warehouse."
good,"Typical day at Cablea's was sitting in front of a monitor all day and being nice to customer and getting there order correct. I learned that there are a lot of different colors, shapes and sizes of fishing lures. There was no socializing with co-workers as we each had different breaks and such. The hardest part was making an irate customer happy by the end of an order. I enjoyed talking to people all over the world."
good,This is a company with great potential to provide exceptional customer service but is falling far short of the mark by running the store and the employees as if the store is a Walmart or Target.  Currently it is only suitable for students or as a second job.
good,"Everything was great when I first started, Then they went public and everything went bad then.Really went bad when bass pro took it over than closed the place down that I worked at."
good,One thing that sucked is that it is hard to work your way up I feel like. Management wasn't the best and I could not do what I wanted to do at this job. Only reason I liked the job is because the discount rocked and I love the outdoors.
good,"It is a great place to work, make relations with customers, friends in your department, great discounts. But the management does not work with your schedule. They seem to schedule you when you tell them you cant work. Management cares more about getting people to sign up for credit cards than anything else."
good,"The hardest part of the job is the lack of communication from corporate offices to store level management. It makes for a difficult workday all around. Most of the people are friendly and helpful. They just have an unhealthy level of stress. Nice breakroom. Management will provide snacks and meals for those working on holidays and will try to reward everyone for working so hard and having a high level of customer service. They do this with free meals, games, words of affirmation/encouragement, and televisions in the breakroom. They try very hard to keep up morale."
good,Exciting and rewarding work environment with the ability to meet  and work with alot of wonderful people. It truly is what you make of it the staff is amazing.
good,"They were fantastic discounts. The managers that I worked for were not reliable or employee oriented. While there is a business to run, employees will not work for people who are condescending."
good,Cabela’s is great with great people. Management only care for themselves and it can be hard to get their help. You do not have much of an opportunity to grow in the store.
good,"Great coworkers and a good overall atmosphere. Sometimes they give you free lunch. However, the management has been consistently going down the drain over the past few years after a number of excellent managers with fired with no notice. Bass Pro later bought Cabela's, which has led to some changes in benefits and management structure. The morale of the store has been in decay ever since. It's still a good place to work if you are a student, but if you need to cover living expenses, don't bother with Cabela's. The hours they schedule you are typically quite inconsistent from week to week, unless you find a full-time position, which is very unlikely."
good,Cabela's corporate headquarters has been closed and the Property Development department where I worked no longer exists.  Business Unit No Longer Exists!
good,Employees were always knowledgeable and helpful answering questions . Managers were very inconsistent . Getting any time off was like pulling teeth. Getting an hour for lunch was nice. Pushing the Store's Visa card seemed to be the most important thing in the whole store.
good,"Management is the worst thing about working here. They pressure you for no reason without any solution to the problem. No matter how you do it, it will be wrong and you'll have to do it again."
good,"While I am no stranger to hard work at times the job can be a little to demanding, they kind of pressure you to stay if there is a call off or call you in that is if you want to work. There have been some significant changes since I have been there but the pay is good for retail considering the minimum wage is $7.35 in Indiana."
good,"Retail work with responsibilities for people and decisions that I had no control over.  Often undermined by superiors. Most of my time there I had no direct report, and no overall store General Manager."
good,"Working for Cabela's is the place people come to find the things that make them happy. Cabela's is known for their customer service, unfortunately, it is sometimes achieved at the expense of its staff."
good,printed daily price change reports. scanned each department and made the necessary tags and signs. I've learned a lot about the outdoors. management could have been better. getting an ad set in a timely manner. people I work with.
good,I had an amazing time working for advantage it was a great experience I was glad I was able to work for them can't say enough good things about this place
good,"Nice people to work with, management issues with the Bass Pro take over. Repairs to the building were not being done in a proper manner. We had to go through a remote maintenance company for approval on repairs,they did a very poor job."
good,work with head sets and computers and a scan gun. fast pace. always moving and doing something. lots of different jobs.good people to work with. heavy lifting somethimes.
good,It's mostly laid back unless it's a holiday season. The employees are very friendly and impressionable. The atmosphere is mostly a relaxed feeling with people willing to help. Managment is mostly fun and energetic. The hardest part of the job would be the price tags never seem to be accurate a person will advise one thing and then the computer says something else. The most enjoyable part of the job is the different types of cinnamon glazed peanut nuts which taste great.
good,i liked my job very much and didn't want to leave but it wasn't my choice. bass pro came in and let all of the managers go. I enjoyed some of my employees and liked working with the customers
good,"If you really, really like the outdoors and a mediocre discount then you will like working here. Management is pretty terrible and constantly changing. Customers are decent, not including the holidays."
good,"The manager there was very poor beleived he only got job because he worked at Walmart,he was let go 3 months after I left. Store has gone through 5 managers since I`ve left.had a lot of ego,s"
good,Ok place to work for until being bought out by Bass Pro and then jobs were lost and there was little to no communication to all the teams. Did not agree with the direction.
good,"Im Seasonal part time, like the job but the push for store credit cards makes it a not so friendly place to work.  Club cards are just a fancy name for the store Visa card with high interest rates.  The store management has given the card department supervisor a position of authority which I think is beyond his limits.  You can be let go for not pushing the store cards which takes the job to another sad level."
good,"I routinely overheard my co-workers given inaccurate and misleading information to inexperienced and unknowing customers.  I spoke directly with my co-workers about the need to provide safe, accurate, and helpful advice to prospective firearms buyers, but changes were not forthcoming.  I then talked with my manager (a great guy to work for, by the way) but learned that my co-workers had been at Cabela's for a long time and his hands were tied.  i also talked with the floor manager and the store manager with no results.  I realized nothing was going to change...  I was not comfortable with the work ethic displayed by my co-workers, so I decided to leave Cabela's."
good,Good job. Hard to compete with younger kids willing to work for nothing. Some times to much work is expected to be done and it's hard to get normal duties done.
good,"I recommend working only part time. During peak season, which is Thanksgiving through December 22 it is very chaotic. Night Replenishment is very physical work, so you must take initiative and keep up a good pace. During peak season Night Replen works 7 days a week, anywhere from 8-12 hours a night. If you're hired on as a regular outfitter you will be expected to work holidays. In the summertime the warehouse is oppressively hot and uncomfortable, so be prepared to sweat!"
good,The Visual merchandising area of Cabelas is dedicated to making the retail stores look and feel like they do. The other employees are hard working and dedicated.
good,"Most of the few years I have worked at Cabela's, it has been very poor managed and very unbalanced. Most of the time, the managers didn't know what they were doing themselves but expected the outfitter to go even more above and beyond than what we were trained to do, without attempting to help us."
good,"Has the potential to be a great place to work, unsure about the merger between Bass Pro and Cabela's, could be a great thing. quite a bit of internal turmoil at my location. Great benefits internally with outfitter purchase programs. The biggest issue with Cabela's is they do not pay outfitters competitively."
good,"I worked hard from day one. I quit a full time job to work on the inventory job, because of the love to work with numbers. I hung on when just 7 months on the job, corporate cut us to part time. Worked my way to the lead postion over inventory. Worked overtime when needed, helped in other areas. The warehouse manager quit in november of 2015, because she was disallusioned how things were going. For the next 6 months, the vendor direct and myself pretty much ran the back room besides doing our jobs. I worked sometimes 55-60 hours in a five day stretch. Corporate comes in one day in May and eliminates all Inventory leads and two other inventory  positions and gave us a two day notice. This is unacceptable corporate abuse. I loved that job and just like that I no longer have one."
good,management chooses favorites. but other than that it is a fun place to work if you enjoy retail. scheduling is flexible to a point.
good,"Clearing, securing & transporting of all firearms that enter the store. High level of security when handling & working with firearms. Management is overwhelmed with responsibilities which makes it difficult to handle smaller issues. A wide range of co-workers of age & back ground. It was a pleasure to work with several who are experts in there field & constant professionals. The hardest part of the position is gaining consistent schedules & hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with several experts & professionals who became personal friends."
good,"I was told that job would be full time and then very unexpected we were told of lay offs. "
good,"Cabela's was an overall decent place to work.  The hours varied on the season and promotions were rare internally.  I had problems with the control on harassment.  Most complaints were ignored and many employees suffered because of it.  Management was also mainly hired externally and weren't considered with employees below them.  However, it was a fun place to work with a lot of emphasis on customer service.  I believe that job gave me much of the needed skills I now have for customer service work."
good,"This was a seasonal job. My job was very fast paced job. I enjoyed meeting the people I did. I enjoyed the job of retail filler, very detailed job, it was filling orders for other Cabela's, you could not make mistakes and I was proud of my time and filling these orders."
good,"This place is making bad choices and changing them often, floundering as they try to figure out how to stay afloat. A lot of that filters down to absolutely everyone, which is stressful. I don't see Cabela's as it is now lasting for much longer."
good,"I started with Cabela's before it opened in Huntsville, AL with full intention of moving up in the company. The store opened on September 31, 2015 and over half of the seasonal employees were let go within a month of the store opening to the public.  The management of the store started going downhill then.  They were constantly changing schedules (most of which was for that day) and were notifying half of the people of shift changes. The other half wouldn't show up because they weren't aware and would be given a strike for no call no show. I was let go in a mass reduction and was told to reapply once some positions opened up. To be completely honest, some of the management were rude to the outfitters.  I even had an incident with the public relations employee belittling me in front of many of my coworkers. I loved my coworkers and the job, but I will never work there again because of how unprofessional management is."
good,"My direct manager was awesome, the people I worked with were great. The only down fall was tough to get noticed because they only track the departments no real individual performance."
good,"Days either begin with the unloading of a truck or backstocking product in the warehouse. Later in the day, product will be picked and brought to customers as needed. Forklift and picker operation are needed throughout the day as well. My co-workers and I quickly became a solid team and went through our daily tasks with ease. This was due to great leadership and management. The hardest and most tedious part of the day was the unloading of trucks but also when they were completed it was a good feeling of accomplishment."
good,The hardest part of this job is always working by your self! But almost all co workers are nice ppl. I work in the Deli. And they have great food!
good,"Cabela's is not a bad place to work. It is, however, plagued with problems. The management offered to us is forgetful, ignorant, and sometimes actively counterproductive. The department leads neglect to take care of basic activities. Still, all things considered the discounts and breaks are pretty generous, and not a lot is expected from an average sales floor associate."
good,"As soon as I heard Cabelas was being built basically down the street from my house, I became ecstatic. I continuously scoured the internet for openings and job positions. After finding their mass hire interviewing deal-e-o, I jumped on the opportunity like a cat to a red laser pointer. I could not contain my excitement for a job their. With positions is firearms, archery, camping and more available, I wished for the best. And of course recieved the one thing I was hoping to avoid: footwear. But I didn't let that smolder my ambition, and pushed on as there was promise of movement opportunities. The mass training was extremely fun and I met now one of my greatest friends through it. They kept the information lively and entertaining. And I have never received that level of training. That only fueled my excitement for the job. They made a big ceremony to congratulate us and let us know when we will be able to see the store for the first time and set it up. Which was again, the most fun I have ever had at a job. The store set up was just pure fun, and was fucused on getting to know your peers and become a team, while also getting acquainted with the store itself. By far the best two months of employment anywhere. And then, there was the grand opening. As much as I wish I was the one shopping, I still enjoyed being a Cabelas Outfitter and wore my tan proudly. As the time progressed, the management efficiency and communication diminish. Slowly it became impossible to reach managers for customer concerns or personal reason. Even through record setting sales, the group reduced hours."
good,I was just a seasonal worker. they always reminded you that anyone could fill your position and that your job was on the line. it wasn't very friendly.
good,"On a typical day we have 80 -100 customer returns. We will have customers who come in happy and nice and also very angry upset customers. Making those customers leave in a different happy mood is  what it is all about. I love the one on one, face to face interaction. I was born to be in customer service. I live to help people and make people smile and laugh. My co workers were great. We had a good time together and worked well together."
good,I enjoy working with Cabela's customers as they are diverse and interesting to work with.  Opportunity for good hours during the holiday season.
good,working for the company is good but the management was not so nice in that place.
good,"Once the company went public, everything changed. Lost the 'personal touch'.  Now its all about the shareholders and profit."
good,Switchboard / Reception was a pleasant area to work. almost non stop busy days with lots of interruptions and interactions with employees. The hardest part of any day would be non stop phones and now way to get them answered by the departments. The best part of the day would be the interaction with the coworkers.
good,help the customers make there food do prep work for the day. the best part of the job is the coworkers.
good,"Forget full-time.....and unless you're a man forget any advancement. People are nice, but the administration is not concerned with the needs of the employees that keep it functioning. Work faster, with less people, so our numbers look good,"
good,Loved working at cabelas i work at the gift shop. An awesome place to work every morning i was the fudge helper were i learnd how to make fudge. Hardest part of the job was making the customer happy went we were out of their favorite fubge. Managent was awesome always very helpful and understanding.
good,Once the Holiday season is over you'll be lucky to get 10 hours a week out of the 25-30 you were promised. That's store wide not just my experience. In June and July it's not uncommon to get scheduled one day a pay period. My co-workers were all great and so was middle management. I got along with everyone very well and still socialize with several of my former coworkers.  Pay for my position was sub standard  for the industry.
good,"Nothing to say sorry enjoyed everyone except management need to always be fast and learn quick"
good,"They push the credit card like it’s the most important thing in the world, and it does not matter how many you get it won’t get you a promotion or hold your job, they also offer more to younger employees and pay the older ones less"
good,The job is good if you have enthusiasm for the outdoor lifestyle and activities and can find a department to which you have interest in.Good as a side of temporary job.
good,Management was terrible and the lack of customer service was even worse. Bit there was some good times. I can also say that its more for people who want a job that's dowant envolve teamwork. There's a lack of it.
good,"Its tough working here at times and i do think that the pay could be better but its an interesting place to work. I've learned how about the different outdoor activities, how to remove security tags off very expensive merchandise, and how to operate the advancements of the point of sales system"
good,"If you are not willing to work hard this isn't the job for you. During peak season you'll usually work 60 hours a week. The rest of the year it really depends on demand , right now we are working  2 shifts. A 3 days - 12 hours or 4days- 10 hours. You are required to weekend day. With the current merger with Bass Pro there are many changes being implimented."
good,I wish I could stay there but the pay is just not enough. The people are great. The job is easy and fun. THey push the credit card a lot but they are not crazy.
good,Great benefits. Good pay. Poor management made advancement nearly impossible. Bass Pro conversion was chaotic and stressful. The future of Cabela’s corporate is uncertain.
good,"Once I started working there everyone (including managers) were great and always a team. Everyone was always helping each other out and making the job loveable and fun. I LOVED helping the customers I did in the time I was there, many of them used to request for me to help them find certain items in the store. I feel as though once we ""Grand Opened"" the store I felt as if we didn't matter to the company anymore. I was always promised promotions and my driving work ethic was great but it took me 9 months after I was promised full time to achieve that status by going down into maintenance. I used to love my co-workers and they always made my day interesting and fun, as to me a workplace should be. I understand managers have a lot of stress or weight on their shoulders but they shouldn't disrespect or mistreat employees the way the majority of us were. What I learned was that you have to work together as a team, you have to be willing to go outside your comfort zones, you have to be willing to drive yourself at becoming not only a better employee but a better person. You have to keep an open mind to just about every possible situation."
good,"Very strict about getting a credit card goal achieved it seems like the company has become more of a bank/credit card issuer that sells a little bit of product inside. Employees are held accountable for getting credit cards which is entirely based off of a customer's desire of wanting said credit card. So job advancement, raises, or punishment can be affected if you just have the bad luck of asking and 100% say no."
good,They usually want open availability for even part time positions if you want any real hours. The people their for the most part are friendly with exception of a few bad apples that try to be nice to management to cover up for their poor behavior and disruptive attitude.
good,Like any business and or company there are rule and policies to uphold. Follow and you will have absolutely no issues what's so ever. It can be a very joyful place if you love the outdoors and love working with people. I love it there as management.
good,"For the most part working at cabelas is fun or at least as fun as retail can be, but a couple of the managers do not know how to properly operate certain departments.  Other employees are great to be around and are friendly."
good,Coworkers are nice and low drama. The pay and benefits aren't all that though unless you are a Lead or Manager.  They only employee Outfitters part-time and you can't make enough to live on.
good,"Cabela's sell fun and customers have fun shopping there. Products are interesting and the store environment is pleasing. Depending on the management, it can be an enjoyable job to have."
good,Very slow-paced.  The management was good.  The hardest part of the job was very little responsibilities.  I learned credit card responsibilities.  The enjoyable part of the job was the surroundings.
good,"I loved my job the first year, but things have changed.  Management is the main reason that I left. They are horrible at communication and clear direction. They all complain about each other and other employees. They give conflicting directions so you never know who to listen to. It became very stressful and I hated going to work. You had to promote the Visa Club card or get a write up. It was all about those numbers and not the customer."
good,"when started at cabelas was fun place to work but things changed and the fun of working there has diminished significantly, there are not enough people to work there and no applications coming in to cover the necessary job openings"
good,"Exceptionally poor pay! They justify this by giving you discounts on their product. I worked in the cash office and, despite my responsibilities, I was paid the same as the greeter at the front door. Our annual raise was a measly 13 cents per hour. I enjoyed the work and my co-workers, but couldn't get past the poor pay. If I was retiree and just looking for something to keep me busy I would consider this place to work."
good,"Since Bass Pro acquired Cabela's they have made policy changes that pushed away customers who regularly chose Cabela's over Bass Pro for those exact policies. Layaway on firearms made it a good option for people living on a limited income and the military discount, while not as much as other companies, was a contributing factor that drew business on a daily basis. Those same customers have come to expect these aspects and then suddenly with no warning they are taken away. All that does is push those customers to other businesses and in turn, loses Cabela's and Bass Pro Shops money and loyal customer base. Cabela's also seems to not care about taking care of the customer or not seeming overbearing, they only care how many accounts they can open in a day for their credit card and try to incentivize outfitters with discounts and rewards for getting said accounts, all this does is create an unhealthy environment where management sets unrealistic goals and pushes the card on the outfitters who don't produce. On the opposite end of the spectrum, those outfitters that get a lot of accounts but severely fail at other parts of their job description are given special treatment which is unfair to those doing well at everything but getting customers to sign up for an account."
good,"My experience here started out wonderful. it seemed like a great place to work, and that they truly valued their employees. That changed after a while. (higher up) management and HR could have been way better!"
good,"Most days are not super stressful, but during the holidays it is chaotic. Management isn't too bad, at least where I was. Most of the outfitters are friendly and I have no honest grudges against any one. I learned a lot about receiving and inventory management."
good,"Sad to see how management treats there empolyees and nothing is done about it.It seems they scope someone out and then attacks not good for business,Just sad"
good,At cabelas you have to be understanding of your surroundings. The management is in need of attention they are very rude and disrespectful to you and your peers.
good,Fun to work at but lacking pay. A retail job so cant expect much pay out of it. The people I worked with were negative and received special treatment. Great for the outdoorsy type.
good,"very slow paced,, not a fun work environment,, unrealistic standards for day to day operations,, unorganized procedures,, unorganized warehouse area,,"
good,Not happy with the pay after getting a review with all above target I managed to get a 3 percent raise.  The only way they work with work/life balance is if you drop down to part-time.  I am able to do all functions of the Warehouse.  The Management varies upon which one you are under.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with mis communication.  The most enjoyable part of the job is there are a lot of great co workers working together as a team.
good,"As a warehouse worker we would unload inbound trucks generally by hand and sort them after being received. After sorting product we would split it into what needed to be put in the warehouse and what needed to go to the retail store to replace sold product(generally done on night shift). Using RF equipment we would backstock inventory in the warehouse. Throughout the day we would run replenishment for the store floor and also keep up with customer rushes, which could be taken to the appropriate department or dealt with as a warehouse pick up. "
good,"Immediate managers were fine; the first one was superb."
good,"Co-workers were some of the best folks I've ever worked with, but Upper Management had issues with communication, respect, and making smart decisions. Luckily I had a great manager as my direct supervisor, but sadly some of the rest of the management team had numerous issue with keeping things productive and on track. Very much an ""in crowd"" style of management where you are either ""one of the good ol boys"" or you are not."
good,Cabela's stores are a sight to behold! Customers that shop here are mostly in a positive mood because it is such a fun place to be. My team mates where a pleasure to work with and the management team is ok. There are plenty of opportunities to climb the latter if you enjoy working in retail. Everyone gets along great for the most part. Only downside is the starting salary. But once you get promoted to team lead and beyond you could make good money. The other downside is that you have to work weekends and if you want a day off you have to notify management one month in advance.
good,"not bad, friendly atmosphere, always able to expand within your job field with cross training.  Hours are all over the place. Meaning you could get good hours one month then the next hardly any at all.  Unless you get full time. Mostly offered are just part time positions."
good,The emphasis is on customer service. Great for folks who like to talk and share outdoors experiences. A negative is the constant push to solicit credit cards on everyone including young adults which felt in moral.
good,"Team meetings, floor sales . A wide variety of merchandise. Moved around to various areas of the store . Training is provided in each department . Only about a third of workers were long term employees ."
good,It's a great place for people that need a job. Or someone that buy a lot of out door stuff. however they require weekends for part and full time and don't work with your schedule.
good,"Everyone of the outfitters in Saginaw work hard and we all get along well and have extensive knowledge wjere we can help one another.  However most of the managers don't realize the importance of us and don't acknowledge the work we do.  Overall, it's a decent place to work but could be a lot better."
good,"during my stay I had the pleasure to work with some amazing people, we had great events for employees which was much appreciated but some supervisors showed favoritism. at some point I witnessed people being discriminated and terminated for no real reason which labor laws were definitely violated."
good,I have a productive work day everyday i come to work. The other employees are fun and easy to work with. Management is fair most of the time with clear instructions on the job your supposed to do.
good,The hours were flexible for a college student and the culture was encouraging. Although the management was unprepared and felt stagnant in the same job position
good,Cabela's has great employees and fantastic benefits but the company seems to be heading in the wrong direction and is too focused on pushing credit cards.
good,Great experiance to work in a big companyt. I wish management kept their word and cared about employees. Will always be a customer here.
good,"The Company is growing by leaps and bounds. A good time to join the company but there is no work life balance. IF you can find a balance, you'll enjoy the company. If you're reloadable then you can really grow."
good,"On a normal day at work, there is usually one or two outfitters working in each department. I would check the warehouse for any freight that came in that morning or night before that needs to be put out. I would then bring back any freight to my department and begin putting it away in the warehouse while simultaneously watching the floor, unless there is coverage. Throughout the day we would stock the shelves, assist customers, check prices, create display tags, answer phone calls, do dock shipments/store-to-store transfers, etc.."
good,"Pull stock, place stock on sales floor, make and re-arrange work schedules. Management skills. CO- Workers were amazing. Hardest part of job was telling someone that I was unable to give them the time off they requested. Breaks"
good,It is a fun place to work.The hours are flexible.There is a lot of customer interaction which is interesting and makes the day go fast.
good,"The staff was great, for the most part.  People really wanted to do a good job and really enjoyed what they were doing.  Store management needed to get more creative with motivating the staff and keeping up morale."
good,"For being a family based company they don't work with families very well. I liked this job it was always interesting to see what type of customers you would be working with. At Cabelas there were a lot of incentive programs which was fun, like if you got a good monthly review you would get a ticket and then at the beginning of the next month you would be able to put that ticket into a drawing for pretty cool stuff. I did not like how they had training set up it was more about the background of the company then actual training on what you would be doing so I felt that it did not adequately prepare you for your actual duties as an employee; luckily I am a very quick learner."
good,"My days were spent overseeing a group of entry level staff who serviced our cardholders and participating in side projects to better the organization and the commitment to cardholders.  I enjoyed the challenging projects I worked on, the casual work environment, and the people I worked with."
good,"a typical day at work depends on what department you work for."
good,"I read a lot of reviews before I started there and every one of them was true. They make promises of a work place that is family oriented, understanding, and had excellent chances to advance. None of this is true. The management picks their favorites for who they would like to be the team leads and who got the awards and such for hard work. I would not recommend this place."
good,"Worked in warehouse, was clean and organized. Which made processing items from backstock too the floor a much more reasonable task. Fellow employees where easy too get along with, work hours where flexible enough."
good,I liked working there and was a good work environment . It was fun and a great learning experience. I made many friends and learned a great deal over there.
good,it was a cool place people there that worked there were very helpfully and its a big place and a lot to see and a lot of good clothes for all year round.
good,It was a great place to work in the beginning and there is an awesome employee discount around the holidays. It's not so great once they don't need you anymore.
good,The most enjoyable part of this job is helping customers to go out and enjoy nature.  You are encouraged to spend time with your customers and really help them to have a better time outdoors.
good,"If you are looking for work while going to school or need experience in customer service. I would recommend working for this company. Oh, and the discounts are awesome!"
good,Cabelas is a great place to work for short term and to use as a stepping stone to get to where you need to go. Pay isn’t that great now it used to be bi weekly pay but now it’s weekly
good,"Title says it all. Cabela's is a unique hardline specialty franchise to work for, but I enjoyed the location I worked for. I can;t say much more than that."
good,Company was bought out by basspro. Very standard warehouse environment. Good employee meal program and discounts. Felt like management was more worried about meeting numbers than employee welfare.
good,"The only constant is change. There were many restructures of the leadership teams while I was there, It was hard to build any continuity with your tea"
good,Pay’s not bad for what you’re doing. Gets hot in the summertime. Everyday is very repetitive. The schedule changed so you either work Sunday-Wednesday 7-5:30 or Thursday-Saturday 5-5:30.  When they hire you they don’t tell you that overtime is mandatory when volume is high.  You end up working an extra (required) almost every week.  During peak (thanksgiving-Christmas) you can’t take time off and work 6 days a week.
good,Customer service and getting customers to sign up for the Cabelas MasterCard is our number priority on the to-do list. They encourage us to check on all customers and push club cards.
good,Cabelas appreciated their employees.. It was a great place to work. I worked with great people and made many great friendships. I was responsible for cutting purchase orders and following  them to the final destination.
good,"Cabela's is a male dominant company. Ladies, don't expect advancement here. Don't expect customers to treat you like a knowledgeable employee, either. Management rarely puts themselves to work - spent more time standing and talking in the office, and then penalizing employees who were actually working for taking breaks. Management has free reign over you, but the job itself is easy."
good,"The company was a pleasure to work for and I enjoyed my time there."
good,"The work atmosphere was nice with friendly staff and a dog-friendly environment, but it can be hard working around guns if you were not raised around them. The pay could have been better with better raises, but chance for advancement was very limited."
good,"great place if you're one for the country, slightly cultic mentality working for cabelas but other then that, pay is fair, management is decent, and opportunities are at large"
good,"Working at Cabela's is like working outdoors while indoors with all the animal mounts the mountain in the center of the store, and the large aquarium. The hardest part lately is all the events that are now required without additional personnel to man it while manning each department."
good,Work life balance was difficult at times.   The retail business volumes dictated your day and were difficult to determine ahead of time.  DTC business primarily drove high volume during holiday seasons.
good,Very stressful kind of environment. A lot of upsales to promote and if you missed the upscales they will call attention and will be reprimanded. You have to do the things that you weren't trained and on  your own from day one.
good,"This is a great place to work if you’re out going and if the management likes you. It’s hard to get along with employees because they already have their little work friend group and they won’t look at you twice. The most enjoyable part of the job was the discount honestly, as well as the experience."
good,"Working at Cabelas was alright. Your coworkers, customers and overall feel of the store is great, very much like being part of the family. However since the sale to Bass Pro management has become a nightmare."
good,"Worked with staff that have extensive employment and are in retirement like myself. Sporting good store where public come to purchase sporting goods clothing and supplies. Boats, hunting fishing shooting, firearms archery camping etc."
good,"Cabelas isn't a bad place to work but for me there wasn't a lot of experience that transfers to any other place I could work at. The most practical experience I could have taken from them is driving their machines, but I was never taught how to drive any of them."
good,the most enjoyable is the fact that i get to meet new people and learn new things aboutso many different type of animals and fish i really liked my work schedule and some of the mangement
good,ever since cabelas was bought by bass pro it is becoming more and more only about margin where as before it was about helping people and taking care of employees
good,Peak season was very slow creating a very slow pace environment. Sometimes it was hard to find work to do. Important information such as scheduling changes would sometimes be lost in translation. Very poor communication between relevant parties.
good,a typical day at work what you learned management workplace culture the hardest part of the job the most enjoyable part of the job a typical day at work what y
good,I only worked at Cabela's for 1 year. All in all it wasn't a terrible place to work. It would have been better if management could solve under staffing issues.
good,"Learned project management and mentorship."
good,"Was a great place to work, but Bass Pro take over has made it very stressful. Still some great people, but not the same culture.  Not confident in the direction Bass Pro is taking Cabelas."
good,"Awesome discounts on all the fun outdoorsy equipment you want, but the compensation for the work is subpar. Since being acquired by Bass Pro, there have been many changes that have been frustrating; for me and the other early AM warehouse workers it was for the worst. We used to get $12/hour and have a consistent schedule getting a full eight hour shift over with by around noon, but after the merger our pay was cut to $10/hour and our schedules were completely jumbled. We all had to pick up extra shifts just to keep the same amount on our paycheck. It feels like the company just doesn’t care about it’s employees and have a ‘next in line’ mentality rather than doing their best to keep employees. Also it takes a year to actually earn PTO and get a small raise. They are also far more concerned with selling credit cards than selling quality outdoors equipment. If you are retired, want something to do with your spare time and get awesome discounts Cabela’s is a great place otherwise there are better places to be compensated more fairly."
good,at the warehouse you must be able to walk a lot or at least tolerate walking as the warehouse is huge and from time to time might require you to take items at another location. you must be able lift certain weights as some items or boxes are heavier than it looks.
good,"its your avg.retail role in consistency in hours and hard to get real full time. Not the best benefits for pt associates. Lots of ""procedures""changes . Upper management is nice but very strict, and so are the team leaders very strict as well. They are flexible to time off as long as its not a weekend . You pretty much are required to work on weekends all holidays and ot is provided during Christmas on a voluntary basis. Long breaks and fairly easy work over all. just not a career type job."
good,I loved my job and everything that came with it. But once they switched management and HR.  They started not caring about their employees.  If I could and there was different management I would love to go back.
good,"Great staff! Fun place to work! Ran by big corporate ideas and mentality, in the end made it hard to work. After take over with Bass pro, felt like a number and not a staff member"
good,"Work is not complicated, However as a result of working in a warehouse you are subject to accident prone conditions. Pay is nice"
good,I enjoyed the camaraderie of setting up the new store.  Everyone including management pulled together to make this an easy and exiting chore.  Working in the bargain cave was an interesting job.  The products that came into this department sometimes required research on their web page.  Between working in different departments and using the internet i learned a lot about the products.
good,"This company was Magnificat to work for, I was devastated when then sold to Bass Pro and we were all laid off. I have and will forever be grateful for my time at this company."
good,People are very friendly makes the work environment feel really comfortable. Work shifts would very time from time so it was always a good idea to keep an eye on the schedule.
good,This is a good first job for anyone that doesn't have a lot of bills to pay. It is fun if you are outgoing and can make friends easily. You get good discounts on items in the store.
good,it was a pretty good work place. i enjoyed working here while i did. the peak season was 6 12s and that was a good paycheck each time. but other than that it was pretty good. part time employees are recommended
good,its ok to work there food from restaurant is good but you have to push a credit card if you want to make your keep. Depending on what department you get will change the over head on things you have to do and how much you have to arrange things. I was in the clothing department and that was the face of the store so it was a lot of foot work.
good,Must be comfortable asking people to sign up for credit cards. Training provided in various technical outdoor fields that could provide opportunities for personal growth.
good,"Depending on what department, overall the work environment is very good.  Opportunities for advancement and change of roles are available, and pay is competitive."
good,The job itself is very easy. The problem with the company in my opinion is the Club Cards the employees are required to promote. I don't think it is right for a company to force the employees to promote credit cards to customers.
good,"I was hired under the contingency that I received some Sundays off, but I only received maybe three Sundays off during a four month period. Besides that, my co-workers were always great to work with, may have been the reason I stayed for four months despite their ability to come through with our agreement about Sundays."
good,"Fun place to work but not great pay for most of the store, due to this many people move on to other places for better pay. Hard to maintain staff with out good wages."
good,"The management is very clicky and don't care for the employees at all, the atmosphere with the employees is amazing. They didn't train new employees very well, they were basically thrown to the wolves and learn as you go which then turned into them quitting and it was a lot of new people in and out. a lot a lot of the time we were very under staffed"
good,Youll enjoy it if you're an outdoor person if not you'll have a hard time relating and helping customers. Other than that I learned a lot for my first retail job.
good,It's not a bad place to work. I just wanted to advance in the company but it never seem to happen. And we the new take of bass pro a lot has changed and a lot of good people got let go.
good,"It great to work around other people that love the outdoors as much as I do. the hardest part of my job is assessing the level the product that I'm given. Whether it should be re sold, sent back to the vendor or trashed."
good,"Was a great place to work for a good wage in a small town. Upon expanding the culture was diminished. There were a core group of managers who built the company. who were replaced with ""newly"" graduated people. The quality of the merchandise, the trust in management was gone. The older employees were asked to leave - and leaving they left their legacy. OF which will never duplicated. Fortunately, I was able to learn the business from some of the most successful business men and women in the industry."
good,"Managers are rude and do not take pride in their work or workers, you will feel unwanted and uncomfortable in the workplace. Not a recommended job. stay away if you like to enjoy your job."
good,Over the course of my employment I was able to learn the ins and outs of retail operations and gain knowledge of many different departments. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my team members and the clientele.
good,"Cabelas is okay to work for, retail isnt really a big deal for me but it works if you're comfortable in your area of expertise. A nice thing is being able to relate to who share the same hobbies as yourself."
good,Overall everyone was nice except and fun to talk to except for the footwear manager he made distasteful jokes rude or sarcastic jokes to his employees
good,Cabela's has always been a fun and exciting place to work and has always employed people of good character. I have been fortunate to see the company grow over the past decade threefold and enjoyed being an integral part of this expansion. The customer base is some of the best and the product the same. This company captures the Outdoor experience like no other and will remain a titan in the industry.
good,It was ok pretty laid back almost kind of boring. People were niice to talk to however some could be pretty dran rude just like any retail store. I wouldnt go back and do it again
good,"As a Customer Service Lead: My responsibilities were, managing up to 15 cashiers, 6 customer service staff, cash office oversight and daily reconciliation of income and expenses.  Cash machine trouble shooting and maintenance.  Dealing with continual service questions, complaints and problems that required management oversight.  This was a big job for the amount of pay I received.  Cabelas should be ashamed of how they treat their Customer Service Leads.  I would say that this is the toughest job in the store, and it merits a wage that is par with Department Sales Coaches."
good,"Day to day in the life at cabela's was great, your able to walk around and assist customers with any question that they might have as well as quote there amazing visa card. but the stores need work for sure. the management is not as involved as other careers that I have had  in the past, most times they sit in the office and do not come out unless they are called by an associate. The hardest part of the job was making sure that everyone was taken care of."
good,Cabela's is a great company with true family values. Was just recently merged with Bass Pro and still working on the combination between the two companies.
good,my time there was mostly all great memories. it was a good experiance and made me realize that I can do more with what I learned here. I am grateful for the time I had there.
good,"its an ok place to work, not very many hours are allowed to work since they have many employees but overall a good place if you are interested in working here"
good,u have to keep up with your rate. u have tacks to pick from u scan product and put in boxes and when your task is done u put the boxes on a belt that get sent to the truck . and u start another task .that what u do all day till all task are out and done.
good,The co workers make the job. Great people everywhere and everyone is a friend to each other. Customers would try to do everything they could to get a deal.
good,"* Well Organized Supervisor. Motivated and talented supervisor with a strong commitments to excellence.  Aggressive and intelligent, he acts on every opportunity to challenge himself, both professionally and intellectually never failing to produce polished results. Constantly sought additional responsibility with absolute dedication to customers. Trained and supervised five temporary duty personnel and 4 Federal Government Civilians in all aspects for the daily operations. Continuously displays a high spirit of cooperation and willingness. Resourceful, reliable, mission oriented and will be an invaluable asset to any employer or organization."
good,"Great discounts and a lot of fun helping people from beginners to experienced hunters, fisherman, campers, hikers, etc get their clothing and gear that they needed.  I loved sharing my experiences with people so they could learn from my mistakes and also my discoveries.  Anything that helps make their experience better will make them want to come back and also tell other people about cabelas."
good,They are okay to work for but expect perfection with little pay. They count your break time by seconds. They hassle you for the minor things and overlook the actually important things.
good,"I had a great time working with Cabela's.  They are very organized, have great insurance and vacation packages.  They are retail so you have weird schedules but it was a change of pace for me and I did enjoy working for them."
good,"got to work with everything outdoors and im a fan of the outdoors, meet new people every day, learned a lot about hunting and fishing, co workers were great"
good,"lower level positions are pretty good for those in college, retired, or just looking to keep busy, but advancement is hard or very political, and many times the atmosphere of the department I was in was very negative and the unnecessary pressures that were put on the department trickled down from upper management."
good,"I enjoyed the environment. It was by far, the easiest job I've ever had. All you do is sit and answer phones and use a computer. Not a hard job at all."
good,This job involves working closly with customers to help them to find the right product for the activity they are looking to enjoy while outdoors. Coworkers were friendly and management was friendly.
good,"The people were great, but some of the managers are sub par and have a tendency to play the favoritism card. They cut a lot of my hours which is why I had to leave."
good,"Thought company would be good place to work but was disappointed. The management staff (at the time of employment) was young and not experienced in life enough to understand life situations as they arose. Staff has since been changed."
good,For the college kid this is a great job.  For anyone looking for a career it is subpar.  The company regularly reconfigures the jobs offered requiring .
good,"I have been here for almost a year, and the upper management is not what they seem when you are hired. I struggle with the holding my head up. I feel for my outfitters and the micromanagement is awful. I wish it was better, and that we actually had weekends off, doesn't have to be every, but I am good with one a month."
good,"The employees the deal directly with Cabela's customers, are what have made Cabela's what it is today. Hardest part is saving a long time loyal customer from taking their business elsewhere."
good,"If you are passionate about hunting and fishing, Cabelas may be a great fit. Most of the other employees are like minded and hard working. Cabelas does suffer from some of the same cons every other Corporate establishment does though."
good,A good place to work in a small town. The outdoors culture is prevalent here. I have learned a lot and advanced at a good pace in my time here. the best part of this job is the people here.
good,"As a part time employee with Cabela's you see a lot of things that could be done a lot different.  "
good,A typical day at work for me is me getting there at 5:30 and start sorting the product for the packers to pack.  After I get the sorting out to the people that pack it then I go and help pack.  From my time there I have learned that the customer is always right.
good,"It was good experience for a seasonal job. the people are fun, and there is a  lot to learn. Especially working with the visa cards. Confidentiality, and dealing with customers. Multitasking is a must."
good,I forget as it was too long ago since I've worked there. So now I'm just filling in the blanks...does this help your guidelines now so I can proceed to the next job?
good,Was good until they shut down the warehouse. I heard the call center sucked though. Everyone there was pretty unhappy. I'm just happy they got sold by bass pro
good,The job was great for a younger outdoor enthusiast like myself. I enjoyed working here to begin because I learned how to fix most issues with bows and firearms.
good,"Working for Cabelas you are nothing but a number to them. When hired you are told it is a very family oriented atmosphere which is a straight up lie. Most management is unhelpful, and ignore any pleas for help. Extremely stressful and high paced atmosphere. Customer service is extremely important. So much so that they throw employees under the bus to make customers happy. Loved most of the employees. But will not be missing this job or the pitiful excuse for a paycheck."
good,good to start but not breaks are not enough plus training session is too short and no mocking calls. you are on you're own. and error are zero tolerated
good,"Working at Cabelas was fun and it was easy for me to enjoy because i am an outdoorsman, but the people I worked with was what made the job difficult. Often times there were problems with scheduling or not being able to change hours which was tough while in school."
good,"Responsible for scanning, picking, and receiving orders.Responsible for telephone orders, dailly paper work, handle all materials according to company policy and regulations."
good,A typical day for me answer phone calls as they come into the store transfer phone calls to the departments within the store. Give my co-workers radios and keys for there departments. also help with other departments as needed.
good,"Sometimes the managers there are possibly doing the store a favor, but it is sometimes redundant. However, for those who are more of the out doorsy types. It would be a great place to learn more about the same products you use to go hunting."
good,company started out being a really fun place to work but lost site of the core values that it was built on. restructure of company made it harder to move up. if you want to move up make sure to get a degree.
good,"Cabeles is a great company! It has done me well enjoyed working there for the time being now it's time to move onto better things for myself. Awesome environment to work, very calming & the customers are very kind"
good,"The people you work with are great and its fun learning so much. But pay is not efficient for the work some departments do compared to other departments in the store. managment changes alot and is not orginized, employees are told different things and not informed regularly on changes or store updates. Not a career job, they are more worried about their credit card than anything else while it was fine for 6 months, not a long term eployment opprotunity. Great for retired people."
good,"Good company, learned a lot. However no room to advance. Management did not value the needs of good employees. Would have continued if more advancement opportunities were available."
good,"They are the only people I got along with because there management team was not easy to get along with."
good,Great people and great products to work with. Senior management not all on same page at times.  Overall good place to work.
good,Fine business in a very competitive environment.  Enjoyed the people that I worked with.  Management were fair with all aspects of work.
good,Great team to work with. Company is still fixing its issues transitioning into the area. But overall good work/life balance.
good,the other employees like to pawn the work onto the new guy and likes to circle jerk in the corner while you work your butt off and get yelled at by the upper management becuae its not gettign done fast enough
good,"Not my favorite place to work at. It works for those that enjoy talking to every single customer and running up and down stairs to retrieve shoes for them. My co-workers were great and my management was ok, but the hardest part was standing in the same place waiting for customers or having angry customers."
good,"This company used to be an awesome place to work for. We used to be fully staffed through out the store and we had caring managers who really cared about the people who worked for them. And in turn the customer service ratings were through the roof. People loved shopping there and people loved working there. But since we went public as a company and the founder died, the company has gone down hill. The staff has been cut down and skeletonized to cut down on costs. The pressure from corporate on managers to raise sales and club card memberships has caused a huge drop in focus on morale. And the few good employees that haven't been let go are quitting themselves because they don't feel appreciated or secure in their job anymore. The co-workers are friendly and fun. The compensation is relatively fair. But advancement is extremely difficult to obtain which makes for a good short term job but not an environment fit for those who are looking for something long term."
good,"A great company that has gone down in recent years due to the death of one of its founding members. Great benefits, but very strict on required hours. More accommodation for part-timers than full-timers."
good,"fun job ,temporary/seasonal would have liked it to be full time , still a pleasant experience overall ,rules about parking are very strict ,sometimes parking miles away from store"
good,the company has some very good and very bad policies. It can be a lot of fun working here. Don't always get the support you need to succeed
good,The co-workers are amazing and will be the best part of the job. They are pretty flexible with your work schedule so great work for students. Pay is decent! Management is awful. Actually the reason why I discontinued employment. The employee discount is decent. It is not fun working for a big corporation.
good,Cabela's was nice. It was retail. Fun environment and co-workers. This was a necessity bred of the financial decline in 2009-2010.
good,"I would come into work at 9pm and would unload the trucks, separating product into like bins. Later in the night we would restock the shelves and make sure the shelves looked ready for the next day."
good,the place is good to work for and like any job in retail it has its ups and downs. make it fun to work by having different contest to help reach metrics and the discounts are good
good,"Its alright, not too hard, great discounts. Management was fun, no chance of promotion really. The fact that men have to tuck in their shirts but females do not, is kind of ridiculous."
good,"a typical day at work was stocking shelves, helping customers, and working with my team"
good,When company was family owned they really cared about their employee's. Once they went public it became about numbers.
good,"long hours, meeting and greeting customers, knowledge of many areas of the store not just where you work. Flexible with school and home needs."
good,Working with the advertising at the retail store. This allowed me to use my creativity. Management allowed me to use my creativity in any way that I seen as acceptable per the company policy.
good,Great place to work if you have an interest in the outdoors. High turn over
good,"I had a great time working for Cabela's, however when I did want to change my availability we did have some issues."
good,"Being seasonal labor, learn what each department role and function is to process customers' orders.  Benefit is being able to receive a discount at any Cabela's store.  Opportunity to be hired full time with additional benefits."
good,"Answered phones daily and took catalog orders.  Used computer data system.  I learned how to run their computer system.  Management was friendly and helpful for the most part, but there was a time that management didn't work so well with me.  Co-workers were friendly when we did communicate.  The hardest part of the job was not having the time to take a break and breathe in between calls, some days.  The most enjoyable part of the job was to talk to different people across the United States."
good,"Cabelas has a large turn over in employee, Good place to work"
good,Overall like the people I work with. Just don't like the overall running of the store. love helping the customers!!!
good,The manager informed me that my hours would be reducing to personal reasons.
good,sales was fun I just had 2 relocate loved working around outdoor equipment.
good,Took phone orders from different people in different states. Learned about all the merchandise Cabela's offers. The hardest part of the job is tracking merchandise.
good,"Gather for an uninformative meeting every morning. Management may or may not be present to answer any questions.Find out where we will be working to start out, do your work, ask our 'leads' for next tasks. Go home. The hardest part about the job is the mandatory lifting that is required by a handful of people working in a certain area and not performed by all. Most enjoyable part of the job...breaks, lunch and completing tasks that would be unachievable by most of the work staff."
good,"Built product presentations for Cabelas.com that mirrored catalog presentations resulting in a consistent and polished look consumers found appealing and intuitive. Prioritized product features based on market conditions, shifts in target audiences and promotional efforts, increasing profits even as retail outlets struggled in 2008. Streamlined practices for business units to push out web content through the main site so revenue opportunities could be captured without delay. Created a style guide for featured products departments and multiple users could reference resulting in a consistent message format acceptable to buyers, marketers and external customers. Collaborated with copywriters to help create accurate and easy to comprehend copy to complement related images, charts, and other information specific to individual product presentations."
good,"Typical Work Day- Run Reports, Manage 5 IMA's, Do anything management asked, Research inventory issues, Using Excel, Word, JDA,WM,AS400. I learned how to manage large amounts of employees, lead by example, wouldnt ask anyone to do anything i wouldnt do. Learned how to manage 8 million on average of inventory, punctual on time everyday started at 5 am, called off 4 times in 7 and a half years. Management was good they had there ups and downs. Everybody stayed in there job limiting growth oppurntunities. Co Workers were great. Loved working as a part of a hard working team. Hardest part of job getting all projects for all managers plus own work complete at the end of the day. Most enjoyable part of job is being a team leader and being a part of a successful team as well as running a successful team/"
good,"The benefits offered for full time employees are decent at Cabela's. The pay rate is definitely some of the best you will find in a retail environment. The particular store I worked for has the best break room from anywhere I have worked. That particular store has a ton of drama which is unfortunate. It tends to be a high school like environment with gossip everywhere, prolly the worst in terms of places I have been employed."
good,It was steady for the most part. when it was slow I had the opportunity to go help out in other departments. I learned how they fed the fish and answer phones and more about many products throughout the clothing department. The management was great in taking care of the people who worked under them. co-workers would help where they could and fun to work with. The hardest part was sometimes i would have to stay longer than i was scheduled but it was worth it cause I loved the job. I loved the people and the atmosphere.
good,"Job requirements consist of cashier and good customer service. The enviornment is filled with great sight seeing and different outdoor departments. Most enjoyable part of the job is eating different meals in the cafe, seeing camping, gun, outdoor and hunting equipment and supplies. The store is filled with make believe aminals and a large workplace!"
good,Assisted customers with background checks and firearm purchase. Very demanding retail schedule.
good,I spend my day answering telephones and ringing up customer sales. I enjoy speaking with customers and trying to help them. The only downside is there isn't much time to get to know your coworkers.
good,"called in background checks, data entry, customer serivice. I learned how the step-by-step process went to call in a customer that was purchasing a firearm. Management was very supportive and helpful if you did not know how to do something. My co-workers were grea to work with, they were also helpful."
good,The atmosphere was a good place and the people i worked with were very easy to work with.
good,"Cabela's is a nice place to work. The products are interesting, management was decent, the environment wasn't bad as the coworkers and customers were always friendly and there is always something to learn about for hunting, fishing, camping, or hiking. Only hard part about the job was to get customers to apply to the membership."
good,"benefits and pay were hard to survive with. management was very poor. culture was awesome, customers is what made the job worth it. working weekends sucked"
good,"Management was pretty above average as far as retail goes. They love to pressure everyone to sell cabelas club cards which seema  bit predatory in their interest rates (I'd never have one of these cards). Discounts were nice though, and coworkers were very pleasant."
good,"Cabela's was a fun place to work, almost everyone was suuuuper chill. Managers did their best to keep the store running especially with all the changes that were thrown at them by Bass pro. It's fun, but the pays suck and a lot of hardworking people deserve a raise and better pay. Colleen is my fav person. She's a hard worker and always tries to be on top of everything."
good,"I thought i  was going to be at Cabelas for a number of years but after a great start it didn’t work out for me at all. Right after I started In late summer 2016 we were told they had merged with Bass Pro Shops which after months turned to be a lie. They were bought out by BPS early last year and shortly there after I was fired. First they told me it was due to absences, but come to find out BPS doesn’t use FT backroom help."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Cabelas, mostly thanks to my coworkers. The pay, lack of incentive, and lack of constant traffic caused the work to become dull and unfulfilling very quickly. Management lacked a direct line of communication other than person to person, which was poorly handled. However it was a friendly work environment that was very accepting of newcomers."
good,There is no typical work day.  You never know what to expect.  To work here one would need to be able to juggle working with a lot of products and help customers at that same time.  The good thing about working in a store like this the customers usually want to go there because they enjoy what the store promotes.
good,It was a great place to work. Even opportunities for anybody coming or going. I loved working there. There are great people there in every department.
good,"The company was once very family oriented, company started changing once they thought of selling, Positions were being eliminated from the top and coming down so atmosphere changed. Within the 3 years of being employee I had 4 General managers."
good,"I love my job it could only be better if I could get full time plus benefits. There are to many part time positions and not enough full time."
good,Overall enjoyed atmosphere with room for advancement. Upper management can become cliquish with little regard to actual productivity. With recent buyout by BassPro I see a lot of potential growth and a return to more customer based management.
good,"A lot of good people go to work at Cabela's which makes it a fun place to work.  The customers were usually always good people, with the occasional bad one.  Be prepared to sell credit."
good,Cabela's is a great place to work if you love the outdoors and have product knowledge in any of the areas the company covers. Cabela branded items are well built and last a long time. I would recommend working for Cabela's to most individuals that love the great outdoors.
good,Bass Pro Shops has purchased Cabela's and is in the process of absorbing the company into their fold. We aren't being told much about our future within the company. Very stressful
good,my time working here was enjoyable. Although there were a few things i didnt agree with id still enjoyed the people who i worked with. The pace of this job fluctuates so youre either restocking and cleaning or running back and forth.
good,I hate to be negative nelly on this topic. The management wasn't to the highest grade. The work environment was very hostile though I was only a part time employee. It did not fit very well with my standard of operations.
good,"I enjoy my job, but retail is not what I want to do. The benefits for a part-time employee are limited, and the schedule is not ideal. I like to work with people, so it can be great on days when we are not overloaded with customers and when the customers are not unreasonable. I spend most of my time assisting customers by answering their questions and retrieving shoes from the back for them to try on. The pay is good for this type of job, and the schedule is fairly consistent. My managers and coworkers are truly wonderful, and they are what really makes the job enjoyable."
good,"this company when I started was amazing, when the owner died it became a corporate nightmare, you lost the family feeling that you had there, advanced quickly...moved and had to quit and glad I did because they fired all the people that held my title...to cut overhead no warning just boom your gone completely disagree with that decision. might be why they sold out to bass pro"
good,"Cabela's use to be a really good place to work. After the death of the founder, ""corporate"" took over and things began to really change. Possible merge or buyout with Bass Pro is causing concerns and now there seems to be investigations going on causing red flags. APEX has been reorganizing all positions and at this time, no one has job security. After things settle down and if this buyout is completed, perhaps things will get better."
good,"I really enjoyed my job at Cabela's and wish I could have stayed. I worked in the back, and got along with almost all of my coworkers. I don't think I've worked at a job where all the members worked so well with each other. Unfortunately I couldn't get full time in my position so had to leave."
good,Seems change is this company is constant. Turnover is high and seems direction is always changing when you're finally making progress on a project.
good,"Working for Cabela's had many great benefits.  There are some gaps in the way the business is run as the brand is being built up in Canada.  I relished the opportunity to learn and work within a great growing company."
good,"Cabela's can be a fun place to work, especially if you enjoy the outdoors and are into Hunting or Fishing.  Most of the people that work there are pleasant and hard working.  I started as an Overnight employee working freight to the floor, because that was the only time my schedule with young children allowed for me.  I then moved to the day shift when my kids were in school.  It was only recently that the shift has changed not allowing me to be there for my family as needed.  The company is changing as a whole and it is affecting the livelihood of many in a negative way.  Cutting hours, changing shift times to unreasonable hours.  It is unfortunate because I really enjoyed my position and the people I worked with."
good,"At start up our Supervisor presents the inbound estimation of trucks and then will determine how may teams we will have on inbound to unload the trucks. (typically 3-4 teams 2per team.)"
good,"The senior Associate Position was created for individuals who showed ambition and experience in all aspects of the warehouse operation, from inventory to loading and  dispatching orders. A typical day was involved with moving from job to job within the warehouse wherever  a problem arose or extra help was needed to finish a specific task. This was the job of Senior Associate. I held this position for two years until I left the company in 2012."
good,Pay starts at $9 an hour and can only be raised upon working there a year for a maximum of 3% per year. Scheduling can be up to 45 hours a week during a busy season and you'll be lucky if you get more than 10 a week in off season. Management is pretty good. You're in customer service so be prepared to deal with all sorts of people.
good,its fun working with coworkers but its sometimes hard because of the heavy product.
good,Loved working with the people at the gun counter and ATF compliance.
good,"- A typical day at work consisted of a few core things.  Those are as follows: clock in and grab your RF Unit for inventory management and auto-order adjustments, team up to unload a floor-packed truck, sort freight into palletized crates which would then be worked to the sales floor, merchandise product, backstock excess and use spare time to inventory warehouse backstock."
good,"Im responsible for receiving in new shipments of firearms, and processing them into our store, I would say overall it's an easy job and I work with great people. And there is definitely the opportunity to move up with in the company."
good,Must like talking on the phone. Must be patient. Must be confident with working with a computer. Great coworkers and Management. Lots of Training. Small incentives for a job well done. ( cookie or candy).
good,"Relaxed and constant work. No days of lack of tasks and always work to be done. Management was always working on tasks and never sitting around. "
good,"I have worked at Cabela's for 2 years and there has been ups and downs. However, there are too many downsides for me. Don't get hurt they will barley work with you on it. You can ask to not do a specific job because it makes your pain worse, but you will be denied."
good,I've really enjoyed working at Cabela's over the past several years. The only downside is the retail necessity of being available to work 7 days a week with either an open or closing shift. Makes work/family life balance a little difficult.
good,"My role was eliminated when Bass Pro Shops took over. The community outreach that we once advocated stopped. All the small non-profits we helped all across the country had to find new funding, or not help who they once could. They laid off half of management Nationwide and rehired a few for less money in pay. Sad."
good,Cabela's was the worlds foremost outfitter.   It at one time was the best place to work in the hunting industry.   It's too bad to see them sell out to Bass Pro shop.
good,"On a typical day you have to quick on your feet and everything you do with accuracy and speed. I've learned what its like to be the customer based employee and also the behind the scene employee. management could be a little better at keeping promises and not hide behind a desk all day. the most enjoyable part of working there was all the people you get know throughout the store, fellow peers and customers."
good,"Merger impacted the overall company, like most do.  However, the two companies could not be any more different on how they operate business.  Wish them the best."
good,"Corporate buy out forced me to find a new career . The uncertainty during the buy out caused much unrest . Long hours and corporate unrest caused lack of clear long term direction . The manager was awesome , but was also replaced during the transition . The brand is good and the new owners seem to know that ."
good,"Great place to work!  Management is hit or miss depending on store location, overall team is wonderful and becomes a second home while there.  Best retail job out there!"
good,Good for a college person. I wouldn't say it's a career opportunity job.  You make a decent living working there but not a great living in my book I look at it as a college Patterson High School starting off job
good,A typical day at work involved helping as many people as we possibly could that walked into the Hunting Department at Cabela's. The people working there are very friendly and knowledgeable on the products that Cabela's provides
good,"Cabelas was like a family, my co workers were my friends and most days the job was very enjoyable. Management could be better. They focus on selling the cabelas club card and less on customer service."
good,Job was great worked with lots of great people. Did get tired of working weekends all the time and special events such as Black Friday. Management changed from caring about employees to numbers only from top down. Worked for micro-manager that could not trust any more so left company.
good,"While I am fine with a fast pace and a changing environment, too often there is weak leadership from above resulting in change just for the sake of change before figuring out the causes and possible fixes for issues.  This results in redoing work or doing work that then is shelved so you end up wasting time.  There is NO TIME to be wasting time.  Having said that, there are many MANY coworkers so you are assured to find people you like and enjoy working with."
good,I only worked here a little but I enjoyed it. I worked nights and weekends on top of my regular full time job. The discounts were okay. They reward you for good work.
good,"Throughout the day i would organize the clothes, refold the clothes for the shelves, Help customers find the product they are searching for in the clothing section. While putting clothes away I learned about the different types of Camo customers use to go hunting in certain parts of the state. Dry weather, cold weather, in the snow, ect. My coworkers were very helpful while teaching me about retail. I have never worked in retail before so this was a tricky job for me because I have never had retail experience before."
good,"Busy upbeat diversified workplace"
good,"A typical day at work would be a day filled with helping customers with their fraudulent activity on their account. I learned how to look at fraud trends and determine if an account had fraud. Upper management was great to work with along with the supervisors. Some team leads were not the greatest. Co-workers were great! The hardest part of the job was trying to get issues that were suppose to be fixed previously taken care of, even if it was an extensive problem. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to customer that appreciated what you were doing for them."
good,The company is completely based on being family owned but when it came to my family needing me they were not willing to work with me. When I had to have surgery they did not want to give me the time off.
good,"Some days are extremely busy and exhausting, others are  boring and slow. I learned some sales strategies. The managers are wonderful and understanding, some of the leads not so much. Most of my co-workers are great, friendly, and easy to talk to or ask for help. The hardest part of the job is given a directive and told otherwise by another manager, as well as the hours differ weekly. The most enjoyable part is hearing stories from customers, and that dogs are allowed in the store."
good,"Working at Cabela's warehouse was a great job for me while the were still in operation. After working there for 2 and a half years, upper-management closed down the warehouse and moved there business to a different province. The work environment was great, everyone got along reasonably and got rewarded for working hard. It's sad that they had to close down."
good,"Cabelas is too big of a store to truly care about each and every individual they hire. However, within my department I loved going to work. Being a Camo Outfitter was a blast and helping the customers was so much fun. You have to love the outdoors to work there though or you'll hate your time spent there."
good,Unloaded trucks 3-5 days a week and pulled replenish to stock shelves. Assisted customers loading larger items. Back stocking product once the supply truck was unloaded.
good,"Was a fun work place, packed and shipped merchandise. Breaks were excellent."
good,I have worked at Cabelas for 3 years now.
good,"The problem with working at a place like this is you will get crabby customers. Working customer service was very stressful, but some enjoyed it. It was fun on some days, but most days it was very busy. I did not like how the Club Card was one of the most expected things as a employee, especially since most people that came in already had one. If you were not meeting your goals, they required you to stand at the front of the store until you got people to apply. Managers were great, but often busy if you needed them for something. I did like everyone that I worked with, lots of very nice people. Only get 1-2 weekends off, expect to be scheduled almost everyday. ALOT of standing on your feet and walking around. Lots of side jobs to do as well to pass the time. Get thrown into cashiering, which I was not at all prepared for. After you get it down, it is the same repetitive thing everyday, so it tends to get boring sometimes."
good,Working with the customers is the best part about the job. Most of the employees are friendly and love the sections they work in however there are employees that are just there to occupy space. The pay is decent and the managers are the best that you will find anywhere.
good,"Great place to work up until they went public and were eventually acquired by Bass Pro Shops.  Bass Pro Shops does not have the same culture and opportunities as Cabela's, Inc. did."
good,"worked here for 4 years. was amazing at the start because I was part of the grand opening team and we had a great time. met a lot of amazing co workers and even more friends. had and still have so many customer relationships that I am the only reason why they come to cabelas now. because since bass pro took over. the employee discount has been gutted and the organization has gone out the window. and with stock, well they leave us out to dry when it comes to actually having product."
good,Working at Cabela's was a fun and enjoyable job (even though I was only part-time). The management and staff are top-notch and make work a very great place to be. The part-time salary is pretty low but that is understandable for being a part-time outfitter
good,"Good place to work with great co-workers. Typical day was coming in having a quick meeting with the night team. Then, getting to work on working out freight and helping customers and keep work environment safe and clean."
good,"It was just a temporary job for me, Easy but really boring at times. The management was decent enough. Cabela's kept adding pointless programs for their employees."
good,"not a bad place to make some money, if you like the outdoors this could be a great place for you. discounts on gear a big plus. there is occasional busy work, but all in all not a bad spot."
good,Good place to work friendly people and managers. Typical days consist of trying to get club cards for the club booth. That is the main statistic that is kept track of.
good,"My time at Cabela's was a love/hate relationship. I was excited to begin employment here. The training and orientation was all about pumping you up to be a part of this amazing company. That excitement was short lived. "
good,Day goes by quickly as there is always work that needs to be done.  Must be able to work in a close environment with numerous other employees from all backgrounds.  Hardest part of the job was just keeping up with all the changes.  Being able to balance work with home life and benefits were great.
good,"Cabela's goals are ""Legandary Service to each and every customer"".  This is one of the few retail places that wants you to take your time with each customer to make sure that they are completely prepared for what ever outdoor adventure they have planned.  This was a truly different environment from other retail stores that want you to give great service but get them in and out.  Unfortunately it appears that the bean counters are starting to win out over the true ""Legendary Service"" as staffing has been steadily reduced which in turn has started driving other customers away because we did not always have enough staff to handle the customer flow.  "
good,"-Pros"
good,"A fast paced workplace. Accepting numerous phone calls to take catalog orders, accept customer service issues and follow up calls asking of status of orders previously placed."
good,I unloaded truck and put away.I learned how to scan and my co-workers very nice.
good,Managers always willing to give a helping hand.
good,the job was amazing as was the benefits but the management was horrible.
good,The company was good to work for I’m just looking for a job that will work me full time. Also the people I worked with are great I like working with them I just need a job who will work me 40 hours a week.
good,It was sometimes stressful being the only one in the department when you had a lot of customers and no one to help you.I loved working at Cabelas and learning different things each and every day.
good,"The job was great, employees were happy and engaging. Then they brought in a new GM and everything went straight to hades. Firing people left and right. The ones who weren't fired quit. Now it's all teens and folks who know next to nothing about what they are selling and the people they are selling to. It's sad. But maybe the Bass Pro buyout will turn things around?"
good,No real complaints other the usual customer service issues. The company seems to actually care about its employees though and that made it tolerable. Definitely a good first job.
good,"It was a great company. Benefits where great, people, atmosphere, and all. Untrained management and the sale to another company and pay changes are the only reason I left"
good,"Cabela's was a great company when they were private, became relatively political with politics driving the local town and coercion of following the company line."
good,I only worked there for 2 weeks but i liked the environment. They were really helpful.
good,Great place to work very layed back! Slow during the week days. Not much to do but stock shelfs and clean during the week days. The weekend is when it's very up beat plenty to do.
good,working there was great until I need to find a new job. I enjoyed the people. The only problem was my boss would not let me have every other weekend off
good,not what it used to be - business process has given way to just getting things done.  As a result the new business process spends more time fixing preventable problems then creating new solutions
good,"Great place to work with a Fun environment & great store decor. Enjoyed my time there, and also being a new store it was a great experience setting up the whole store."
good,"Loved the jobs, just not the structure of the company and didn't agree with where it was going. But the overall experience was pretty good. Enjoyed the benefits and coworkers"
good,"Enjoyed working here, made some great friends, and had a blast learning new skill's and making new relationships with those people around me. Would highly reccomend"
good,"Women have a difficult time advancing in the company."
good,I enjoyed the work that i was doing. It was a calm and easy going work place. Every thing ran smooth. I would start work at 5:30 which was okay but an early morning shift was not for me. It was only seasonal work.
good,"I love the environment at Cabela’s, and the customers. "
good,"Very flexible job, easy and not stressful at all. Great advancement and good coaching if this is a career youre looking for."
good,"Setting in a cubicle working with people from all over the world in three forms of communication, telephone, chat, and email."
good,"Job is good. Work is satisfying. No opportunity for advancement. No health benefits. No vacation time. No sick time. There have been periods of time where there were not even employee rest rooms available."
good,"When BPS took Cabela's over things began to change. Not that things were great before, but the acquisition didn't do anything to bolster anyone's spirits. Happy to have left when I did, wouldn't recommend it as a place to go for a job searcher."
good,long days at sitting in one place waiting for the phone to ring.  This was only a seasonal position for extra money for Christmas.  I would have went back for another seasonal year but my schedule didn't work out.
good,Great place to work. HARD to get full time if you don't suck up.
good,"great part-time job. Not worth seeing it as a career or full-time job especially after it was bought out."
good,"I do not know what the overall environment will become as the Brass pro shop  change in  management takes over "
good,I loved working at cabelas but since the sale to bass pro stores  the attitudes are changing it is all about money and not about customer service my peer outfitters are trying but the old ways are better and certain positions need two people doing them and they try and put to much on one person which causes stress and then the family feeling leaves i miss certain outfitters at Lacey Cabelas but they have an employees fund that is suppose to be for outfitters in need but i had to leave because when i was really in need corporate wouldn't help me so i lost my ability to work there and i lost everything except what i could put in my van. So what exactly is this fund for.
good,"Business can be very successful when everyone pulls together and gets the job done. Love working here and most days are a lot of fun, IF you like being busy and on the go."
good,"Loved my job, my team and my personal development with Cabela's.  Bass Pro, however didn't see the value in all the team work and experience Cabela's had.  Communication is a very large obstacle with both companies.  Now, as privately held, I was not prepared for all changes that went along with that.  I did not have to post job positions, track EEOC or even have to worry about Diversity and Inclusion, recruiting no longer existed, a lot of the federal policies I was use to monitoring and complying with didn't seem to matter.  Under Cabela's, I did get freedom to train my managers and my peers on different developmental topics.   I also used my position to creatively get out into the community and support such groups as Toys for Tots, Second Harvest, The Sunshine Place, American Heart Assoc, and others.  I loved working for the team, getting to know each of them and being there for every aspect of their lives."
good,"The job is fun in itself. The only issues I had was management. They are rude and don't take you seriously unless you do everything they tell you to do, when they tell you. They will use you and take credit for your work themselves. If you are proud of the work you have done they will act like its no big deal. They expect you to do every job in the store at once on top of handling customers. There is never enough coverage out on the floors when needed. Schedules bounce around a lot and get changed without notice. ""Time off"" sheets are always lost and forgotten about. I just liked talking with people that had the same interests and me and helping them find what they needed while they tell me personal stories. If management was different I would have stayed."
good,"Pretty easy job, but the warehouse had to much to do without proper amount of employees."
good,"Great place to work for students or retirees. After Bass Pro took over, the management at the corporate level is absolutely atrocious. Communication is non-existent. Really fun on a typical day."
good,"As someone who typically would not choose to work at a Cabela’s store, let alone a distribution center, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it. If I was more than seasonal, I would have gotten lots of benefits and such- I actually tried my best to get hired on full time. I didn’t know my “boss” at all. He could have cared leased about who I was or if I stayed. There was only one manager that I sort of knew, and she at least took it upon herself to learn my name. This is not the place to go if you’re looking to matter to the workplace- it’s a job where you are replaceable.Some of the When there was stuff to do, it was enjoyable and passed the time quickly. There was a lot of down time in between “waves” of product coming down the line and all 20+ workers in the building were expected to pass the time sweeping the same floor. It was just a waste of time and energy"
good,"Cabela’s was a great place to work before the merger with Bass Pro. Once this happened, we lost all of the “good” bosses, as they obtained employment elsewhere, therefore the management changed among many other things, including: days/hours, pay decrease when they took away Strive, less vacation, no personal days, attendance policy, health insurance, we now have to clock out for lunch and work an extra half hour as opposed to having our 2 20 minute breaks, and others. It definitely isn’t the way it used to be. The people there are wonderful, but the management doesn’t have a clue."
good,I am thankful for the opportunity to work there. Before they went public it was a very family oriented company. Once it went public it was more directed towards what the board said. They were not family oriented.
good,"as a work environment, it is hit or miss. Management is selected off of nothing other than resume, not skills. Ive watched the best employees get laid off and the worst get to stay."
good,"They really stress the Cabela's Club Card. They say that it isn't something that they can regulate when they interview for positions, but they definitely play favorites with the employees that are successful. If you want to climb into a leadership role prepare to never say no and to be taken advantage of."
good,"I love working at Cabela's, however, I believe that they force their employees to push their company's credit card on customers too aggressively. The break room was great and the job had a nice atmosphere."
good,"It was a typical retail job, I loved the loyalty that my co-workers and I had. Other than that, there was nothing super special or horrible about this place."
good,on an average slow day its not so bad but once it picks up the management becomes dysfunctional and there is no communication.
good,"I worked at the customer service desk.  I dealt with guest on their returns, on line orders, layaways.  I filled in for the cashiers as needed, the operators and stocking clerks.  We were the frontline to dissatisfied guests.  We were given discretionary power  to make decision on problems that arose in order to satisfy the customer.  "
good,"there was a lot of work to be done. it was fun, you just do what needed to be done and the time flies by. the management had her favorites and was not active with our daily work."
good,Cabela's was a good job but it was a game of favorites everyday with the managers and there was no room for advancement for any one who was not on the favorites list so for two years I worked the same job even after applying for many jobs in other departments. But as far as a job goes not a bad place to work for temporary employment.
good,"Sign on computer and check emails. Receive incoming calls mostly for orders, however other things like questions customers had would come up and either I would take care of it or transfer to another grade customer service rep. Co-workers were great! Hardest thing was the new very challenging computer system. Most enjoyable would be talking to people from all over and assisting them to finish an order. :)"
good,"Some managers are better than others. The place gets CRAZY during holidays, weekends, and rainy days. The uniforms arent bad but it can get a little toasty up front."
good,For most of the year things are fast pace. Then you have a small portion of the year that can be slow. I have learned many leadership skills within the company and made many friends. Everyone here has a good working relationship.
good,"Some management are juvenile. Some are top notch. Some egos to deal with but thats human nature. Very committed to their culture and supportive to employees. Responsive to work place violence. No room for advancement, it seems, for qualified females unless it serves a sales purpose. Low pay even paying same to people at different levels which is bizarre. Overall, I DO recommend working here. See if its a fit for you. My experience was from beore the buy-out from Bass Pro. I only quit because I was being paid exact same as employees, not UNDER me, but folks whose work I reviewed and approved and signed off. I should have been paid more than those folks. This company is very TEAM and CUSTOMER oriented. You are actually allowed to make the customer happy, not cite policies while customer walks out. I would have stayed if I was paid fairly and thought there would be any chance of advancement."
good,Working at cabelas is a decent place. Some problems with stability and management. With all production work places you always have issues with getting full hours. Management plays some favoritism on advancing.
good,I worked there for 2 1/2 years and was cross trained to several departments. At first I enjoyed working there until I was moved to the switchboard. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their jobs but working at the switchboard meant that I was dealing with many angry customers everyday. The outfitters are nice but the customers are terrible.
good,I worked 6 of 7 days a week. All random depending on everyone else's time off. I worked full time. Open to 5 and a day of the weekend. Pay was bad. Time was super slow. Customers varied. Managers at the time BEFORE the buyout were awesome. They made it fun while teaching you alot.
good,Usually busy on weekends but not so much on weekdays.  hours change very frequently and not consistent.  Good job for going back to college.  they are good about working around your schedule as a college student. Management is somewhat inconsistent and always changing.
good,"I went to work to issue out approved credit cards to customers who gave there information. I learned how to properly dispose of their private information."
good,"I was very excited to work for this company, but then we sold to bass pro and I am very unsure about my future with this company. I do not trust our upper management or bass pros management."
good,"I actually enjoyed it.  Not too many places that you can work and talk to people about hunting and fishing and get paid for it.  Somedays are better then others.  The pay was min. wage but I wasn't there to make a living.  i just worked part-time seasonal, and wasn't lucky enough to stay on.  Would go back if called!!  Most managers are pretty good."
good,"Im sure convergys would have been a better place to work had there been more communication after the job started. I loved it intially, but once into the job, it seemed the communication was terrible."
good,You can actually learn a lot working retail at cabelas. I've personally learned quite a bit of fishing and camping skills from other outfitters. The management team is nice and are always willing to lend a helping hand. The hardest part is getting customers to sign up for the club Visa card.
good,"would not mind working there again , great discounts for employees , rotating shifts makes it difficult to plan any kind of vacation time ,great management and potential to move forward ."
good,"It started out well but quickly became ""clique-y"" and was hard to work with certain people because managers played favorites and gave incentives to a few."
good,"too bad I can't afford to keep working there.  I enjoy the job and the people I work with,  but Cabelas is unable to provide me with the benefits I need and is unwilling to hire me on full time."
good,"In my department, everyday seems the same. Arrive, set up, make fudge and nuts, clean up and close."
good,Fun place to gain knowledge on firearms sales and qualifications for firearms sales. Met many people who worked for law enforcement and began to build relationships.
good,It takes a great deal of planning to manage your personal life because the work schedule is very demanding.
good,Even with the amount of experience I bring to Cabela's I was started under $10/hour and the prospect of ever making decent money is unlikely.
good,"Environment & people are good, especially the other employees. HR is pretty relaxed. Training sucks after initial orientation. Departmental discipline is lax and organizational structure leaves a lot to be desired. The schedule varies a lot from week to week. As retail goes, it is not bad, but it could be more organized and work much smoother."
good,Metrics were completely unattainable. You had to fudge numbers in order to meet the metric goals that corporate wanted and you would get talked to for not meeting the goals if you went about it in an honest way.
good,"I love my job, it got me through college and Management is the best part. Great people and work environment. Terrible pay but it’s a retail job. The discount is also terrible but the work environment and the people in the Grand Junction Cabela’s are amazing."
good,"Starting out it was a great place to work. If you work hard and show interest in moving up, then this is possible."
good,It was enjoyable to work with products I knew but stressful to follow what was expected. An outfitter was required to get strangers to acquire a credit card when they did not want one.
good,"It was a great place to work and the company provided a lot for me! The typical day at work was quite fast paced, customer oriented. I learned hunting laws, gun laws, and many different ways to live outdoors! The workplace culture is amazing and everyone is friendly! Hardest part of the job sometimes could be the challenging tasks to help a customer. It may be an unusual situation and you'd simply need to brain storm! The most enjoyable part of the job was the people and the family feeling we all had for one another! The culture and everything about the job is amazing! Hunting and I fish a whole lot! ;)"
good,"I folded clothes all day every day. Typical for any retail position, it can get monotonous. Other than that, there are very kind and helpful co-workers and I couldn't ask to work with nicer people. Everyone is very genuine. The managers leave some things to be desired, but other than that, I enjoyed working here. The hardest part of the job is the continued clean-up of other people's messes. Again, typical retail position. Customers are nice, and employees are nicer. The one thing I do have to say is that if you work here, you will be bothered about signing people up for the store credit card or the ""club membership"". If you do not sign people up within the first week of working, you will be bombarded and have to go take a class on how to get people to sign up for the store credit card."
good,"This was a wonderful place to work. After the merger, too many things changed and leadership tells little to employees and expect them to read minds and make decisions not qualified to do. They follow those decisions up with ridicule."
good,Working at cabelas was a lot of fun however they definantly do not pay enough and do not give part time employees enough hours to survive on as a sole income.
good,Good place to work.  Seasonal work is good.  Dwindling perks since merger with Bass Pro.  No sales pressure.  Poor/non-existent training program.  Had to figure out things yourself or ask peers.
good,"A good work experience - knowledgeable outfitters and good management in the store - once you get on the regional/corporate level not so much. Better staffed that other retailers, still sometimes get overwhelmed by not having enough staff to help the customers."
good,"I enjoyed working in Cabela'sPower Sports Department. It was attached to the retail store, but was licensed and operated as a Power Sports Dealership and Service Center."
good,"Cabela's is a fun place to visit and work, however, in many departments, managers favored certained employees over others and they were treated better than others."
good,"When I started working here, I was excited by the stories I heard form employees who had been there for a long time.  Really sounded like they cared and wanted a good work environment.  In the short time I was there, the perks and benefits dried up, and the demands on employees grew."
good,"I work at one would consider a small Cabela's. Typical retail, has it's busy days, to its slow days. Management has its pros and cons. At best, more cons."
good,I loved the place my job and customers but the management is not good at all if it wasn't for them I would still be there. They treat their employees like dogs and and not very family friendly
good,"Stress of Club Card sales is oppressive.  Management and leaders (sales coaches) seem miserable, which trickles down to the general workforce.  An overabundance of part-timers who work 5hrs/wk or less reduces dedication to ""a job well-done.""  Pathetically low job perks, except for employee discount...which nobody can afford due to embarrassingly low pay.  Pleasant customers and coworkers make Cabela's stand out against Walmart or McDonald's-type jobs.  Unfortunately the pay is about the same.  Further, there is talk of a rather impactful merger, which nobody seems to understand."
good,"Its rather nice working there, as its practically a second family among the employees. I have learned little tips and tricks such as gun safety, or how to research a sku for a product. Diversity is by far number one at Cabela's. The hardest part are days when it's very slow and there is little work to be done, or when equipment is failing to operate correctly. The most enjoyable part of my job is problem solving and working with employees. I also have worked with customers and it is delightful when i can answer their questions directly and leave them feeling satisfied or direct them to the correct department where they can get the assistance they need."
good,Management is lacking in correct judgment calls and scheduling. But overall this company has always looked out for its employees and was a fantastic environment to work in.
good,Learned to quickly adapt to changes and collaborate across all levels in the enterprise.Time management is a must work loads are heavy.
good,"Overall very good. Management seemed to ""micro-manage"" often but generally quite approachable and friendly. The company was very customer oriented and client satisfaction was very important."
good,"Cabelas was my first retail job and working in gifts was so fun! I learned how to make fudge and the little cone bags of nuts. I sold jewelry and watches there as well. There were plenty of chances to earn better pay with the cabelas card, cxps, and kiosk orders. Sadly my managers werent the best and that kind of made it a not so fun place to work, but other employees rocked,"
good,"A fun place to work, management was great, pay was not competitive, no room for advancement, they do not give employees second chances."
good,I was a seasonal employee. There weren't enough hours to go around to everyone. On the upside the employees were great. The managers were OK.
good,A typical day at work consists of unloading the freight truck and afterwards taking all freight to the floor for replenishment. Once all shelves and hooks are filled all left over freight is taken to the backroom and assigned locations and back stocked. All co-workers are great and always there to help each other out.
good,Cabelas is a fun place to work. There are always activities going on at work and the outfitters are awesome. There are always opportunities to learn multiple positions at Cabelas. The hardest part of the job would be the scheduling and the most enjoyable part of the job is how laid back the managers are and the fun atmosphere.
good,"I try to greet every customer with a smile and a nice hello. I then will help them with anything they are looking for in the store. I keep our shelves stocked full of inventory. I will put together news bows we have received, and I will repair customer's bows they bring in. I help every customer I talk with leave with a smile on their face. We have very knowledgable employees at our store, if there is something I do not know I can always call someone who is an expert in that field. It's very enjoyable talking about something you are passionate about and seeing how passionate your customers are about the same things. The hardest part about my job is getting enough hours of work."
good,standard retail job with the exception of being geared towards the outdoors lifestyle
good,Cabela's is a top notch company. They wrote the book on taking care of customers
good,"I really liked working for Cabela's. I worked in a field I likes and knew a lot about. However the internal politics were awful. We had one Outfitter who enjoyed making people mad and thought it was fun to see how mad he could make them,,,because he was friends with the department manager and had 'job security'. "
good,"I enjoyed working at Cabela's. It is a fast paced retail store, and you get to enjoy plenty of customers."
good,"Using barcode scanner, determine size of item, quantity of items."
good,Good place. Don't expect to move up unless you smoke. Smoking buddies of the managers move up
good,I started with wendys when I was a junior in high school until 1998 . It was a good job for me and taught me alot of responsability . This was good path to take
good,its a nice environment to work at cabalas. most the co workers are great but just like any work place has it's moments. Regardless the managers are helpful and co workers are nice and the discounts are great
good,"A typical day consists of backstocking, replenishment, and cleaning. Since I've never worked in retail before, it was like a whole new experience aside from the customer service experience I've already had. I haven't been here long but I feel like management is adequate. The workplace is pretty good for the most part. There is a possibility to get hurt at this job just like anywhere else, more so if you work in the warehouse like me. Just take into consideration that you'll be operating heavy machinery and could be heavy lifting frequently. Best part of the job? Seeing pets."
good,It was fun while it lasted.  Change in manager ruined the flow. No time off worked part time scheduled as full time. Over all decent discounts. Fair trade for not so paid over time
good,"Working at Cabelas was okay there was always activities the store would put on for the customers to learn how to fishing, hunt or camping.  I worked in the inventory part of the company we was always counting and making sure it was correct  for the physical main inventory at the end of the year."
good,"I like working here, but mostly for the people I worked with."
good,Cabela's was my first experience in a legitimate work environment and I'm glad I did it. The people are quite nice and inviting and they are willing to work with you if you have any questions.
good,Management seemed to care more about putting up good numbers than the cohesion of their team members. This created an uneasy work environment with a lot of friction between co-workers.
good,"I enjoyed working for Cabela's in all the different areas that my job detailed as per my resume.  I was kept very busy and enjoyed working with my managers, the company staff and the clients.  The areas that I worked in gave me new challenges every day and kept me learning and updating my skills."
good,the store is great to work for. the corporate culture since Bass Pro took over is horrible. The management is decent and some of them will take care of you as a employee.
good,Cabela's can be like a family. It can be really fun to be talking about your outdoor passions with customers. But it can be very stressful and lots of pressure with not a lot of flexibility.
good,"Team was always hard working, everyone wants to get the job done and most employees cared about the store on a more personal level, making for a very enthused and friendly workplace."
good,"The tasks primarily involve stocking, sorting, unloading, moving merchandise to and from main floor, and operating hand-scanners. Co-workers are friendly and helpful."
good,I worked with some really great people. since the buyout though people were always stressed over losing their job. Workers were great but the management was very clicky.
good,"Cabela's was a great place to work for prior to the acquisition by Bass Pro.  After that benefits were cut and culture went down."
good,"Good job--was able to pay the bills.  No room/chance to move up within the company or to different departments.  If you were considered a good employee--hitting all their marks, they won't let you move up or to another department."
good,"Working at Cabela's is what you make of it. If you just want a job that will provide a steady income, Cabela's is a good fit. However, if you would like to advance, Cabela's does offer this opportunity. Although, the road can be tough for advancement. Basically you get out of the experience what you put into it."
good,I believe Cabelas is a nice place to work. They provide a fun and active place to earn a living. Since I've been here so long I have seen a lot of changes. I'm just ready for a change.
good,I was busy with the job maintaining cleaning materials as clean rags at home in my own time. work through out the whole building to keep  it up for the next  business day. work with all the other employees to see how they are doing & take their place when they need time off.
good,"Just Like your typical warehouse job, just a lot slower and more relaxed. most of the time had my headphones in and just hanging clothes. the clothing mangers for the daytime can act like they're bigshots but besides them. It was a good a chill job."
good,"I learned many skills while at Cabala's, warehouse operations and forklift training, great environment to work in."
good,Cabelas is the worlds for mos outfitter and a fairly good place to work for if you are a high school  student looking for a job after school..........
good,"part time work, able to schedule around college classes.  Staffing issues filling open positions created opportunities for the cashiers to be extra productive"
good,"Cabela's was a fun place to work at in the beginning until management changed. unfortunately things have gone down hill. favoritism or dislike is obvious, and the way things are handled can be unprofessional."
good,When working at Cabela's it was quite stressful because a lot of the time we were understaffed and the management was not helpful. It seemed to be very disorganized.
good,"Cabelas is a nice place to work, but is only part time. "
good,"Cool place to work if you love the outdoors. Met a lot of cool people while working who shared a similar love for the outdoors, both employees and customers. Really liked being able to learn about all the products the store has and then teaching others about it."
good,"I worked there for a whole year only reason for leaving was because it was hard for me to transfer into a different department and the hours got cut because they are not as busy in those months however I needed the money. Overall not a bad job or company, it really just needs better management. My manger was never around and was quick to judge based off of what others said but really no major problems. It is great place with training you and also just work environment is good along with the people."
good,a nice place to work. team members are easy to get along with.  always a positive store. coworkers were willing to go out of their way to help out.  awesome amount of interaction between departments.
good,I held the position of Corporate Travel Consultant at Cabela's for over 2 years and loved the daily challenges and interaction with all of Cabela's travelers.
good,"Great place to work, especially part time.  Very friendly team environment.  Most personnel always willing to lend a hand to get the job done.  Shifts vary and there is a place for all."
good,"Cabela's is a place to let your passions grow and provide, while learning the importance of truly taking care of business-driving customers choosing to shop there.  Helping others on their missions and providing a desired experience is what provides a fulfillment in working at Cabela's.  It is very team and cultural based, which allows for the exposure of unique passions from each and every employee working there; leading to a personalized and heartfelt experience to the consumers."
good,"Fast paced, productive environment.  Management was good.  Job was part-time and seasonal.  I learned basic shipping and receiving and warehouse duties."
good,"Go in and just work to be honest, it's retail. I was a cashier, so it was just keep area clean, do carts, and make sure all the customers leave with a smile on their face and their mind set on coming back in the near future."
good,"I had a good time working there, wasnt able to follow all the computer input on hand held, i dont think they trained us all well enough. Had fun in the BARGAIN CAVE."
good,I liked it but my position was only seasonal so I was unable to stay as long as I would’ve like since they have so many employees already from the normal season
good,"A typical day was fast paced, but not boring. The environment was a little to relaxed with some inappropriate talks being had. Management could be a little better but overall it was a nice place to work"
good,"Great part time job, but work load is way over appropriate pay scale. Low raises even with excellent reviews.  Currently instituted holidays.  No bonuses or commissions for going the extra mile."
good,"The job was pretty simple yet got a bit hectic at times. Enjoyed the people I worked directly with, the pay could have been better but was fair considering some other places."
good,The scheduling left a little to be desired but overall not a bad place to work. The regular staff are fun to work with but I feel management did not always stand behind their staff and looked at the numbers than the people.
good,"Was the best place to work when I started. after management change it went down hill very fast. loved giving tours through the store and about the company history."
good,Management is okay. If you are great at promoting credit cards this is a job for you. The co-workers help make slow days go by fast. Everyone is always outgoing. They work well around other schedules but you need to be opened Saturday and Sunday.
good,"I really enjoyed working there, met a bunch of nice people, however some of them needed to go including managers. The pay could have been more and the benefits needed to be better.  Didn't mind working weekends that's what you get working retail. Would have stayed if some of the managers were let go."
good,Working here was great.  I really enjoyed everyone I worked with in my department.  Management could have been a lot better.  Unfortunately my manager wasn't really there when we needed her.  I learnt a lot of things about being a supervisor and how to manage staff.
good,"disliked the company "
good,"Overall the work environment was pleasant but upon work completion in a department favoritism was played during department distribution to other areas. Management also did nothing involving outfitter problems, situations in which corporate had to be involved to get a problem resolved. The hardest part of the job was the hours of operation, whenever it came time for the holidays outfitters were forced to work 12 (twelve) hour days 7 (seven) days a week."
good,"If you enjoy the outdoors and are looking for a great discount and good pay it is a great place to work. They start out at $10.50 and the discounts are great. For the pay it was a good place, but don't expect advancement. There are a few good managers who are fair and balanced. The company is going through changes, but over all $10+ an hour to work retail is good pay. I don't suggest it if you want to make it a career or wanting to make friends."
good,Fairly good company with good values but management often made me feel like I was always doing something wrong or would get overly mad when we were all brand new to the store and were all learning.
good,This is a very laid back place to work. There is always something to do here and if you ever have a question there is always another employee within 15 foot of you that you can ask.
good,"Depends on your department, I helped put things out on shelf, do planograms, keep the store clean, and help customers with their needs may it be they came in for something specific or are looking for some advice about which products best fit their needs"
good,"workday was great working with people and outfitter needs"
good,I worked at Cabela's through college and they are the only retail place I have ever seen that offers paid time off to part time employees. They were extremely flexible around my college schedule and management was great.
good,We were trained very thoroughly so by the time we were on the sales floor we were able toy help customers effectively. The place ran like clockwork everyday.
good,a typical day at work  what you learned management workplace culture the hardest part of the job the most enjoyable part of the job it the people just
good,The people/coworkers ate cabelas were great! I loved learning about hunting and fishing while I work there it actually got me to go fishing just wasnt enough hours.
good,A typical day of work at Cabela's as a firearms outfitter consists of facilitating customers in making an informed decision on what the best product would be to fully meet their needs.
good,I Loved working here. it was an incredible experience. everyone was so friendly and it was like one big family. sadly i was merely seasonal so I could not enjoy it further.
good,Great place to work. Benefits could be better though. Very streamlined from management all the way to floor sales team. Great employee discount program also.
good,Cabelas treats the employees horrible but pay ok. I hate the manager shes not a very nice women. I want a job where they treat you like adults not like little babies
good,Things started out great but then they went down hill. Was told about great opportunities to move up in the company then they down sized.
good,More payroll to sales than most retailers.  A lot of managers in each building makes more opportunity for advancement.  Pay is in line with competition
good,"Lacked organization. However, very good place in how to learn about public relations and working with the public I worked as a firearm inspector."
good,"As an optics specialist, I learned a lot, built many customer relationships and developed sales skills. Biggest drawback was inflexible scheduling."
good,The remote location did not concern me too much until the need to specialized medical came up.... then it was three hours to help.  I enjoyed the relaxed environment.  Advancement was not existent in my division.
good,"good working environment, great people, able to interface with all levels from top management down. able to train a great staff"
good,other than the hours being cut an ok job but hard to advance and the leads think the own you from what ive heard they dont like working around other jobs
good,"Company placed itself in the high end of the sporting goods spectrum, encouraged and supported sales associates to provide excellent customer experience.  If I made a commission, I'd have stayed.  Left only for a higher wage."
good,A typical work day was fun but yet not so easy. My co-works in department was hard to work with I always seemed to be cleaning all day from what they left behind and there would always be products in the back they need to be put back out but would never seem to get done till I got there. My co-workers would make good friends out of work but in work they never did anything that needed to be done and with management was pretty good but there for I would turn what I needed in to them but it would always end up lost or they would never get to it. I think the hardest part was having to deal with my co-workers an having to clean up or do work they didn't do
good,"•Managed both early morning and day teams to unload, stock, and merchandise freight"
good,"I really enjoy working at Cabela's, and with all of the co-workers that work there. The other co-workers make it fun to be there and I enjoy coming to work. I also enjoy the clientele that comes in. I like working in the gift department and being able to stock the shelves when new merchandise comes in."
good,"I liked the store a lot, and I enjoyed working with fellow co-workers, but it wasn't as enjoyable as people thought it was. My lead would constantly accuse me of leaving the department badly recovered, which was not true, and she was lazy at times, and would wander away from her department every now and then."
good,Cabela's used to be a place I loved working. But they don't take a personal interest in their employees like they used to. I need a place where management wants their employees to advance and prepares them to do so.
good,"Really one of the top companies to work for until the Patriarch of the company passed away. "
good,"Fast paced, friendly atmosphere where the customers are interested in the same things you are. They sell fun, who doesn't love fun?"
good,The nature of MIS/IT is fundamentally incompatible with a love of the outdoors and the nature of a Cabela's employee.  Must purpose to disconnect in order to enjoy that life.
good,"Started as a seasonal cashier, went to customer service and really enjoyed it. Everyday was something new which kept the normal tasks easier to perform. Work environment was pleasant."
good,Very fun co-workers and a good job to get your feet wet starting out life. Loved working here and learning what all retail people have to go through on a daily bases.
good,"I loved the company because of it's history and heritage it began with. As it has grown, it is clear that long term employment with the company is not one of their primary goals. The work is enjoyable while challenging. "
good,"I worked at Cabela's while attending college and they are good about working with your schedule.  The work is pretty simple and easy.  The day consisted of talking to customers, rearranging product, and putting product on shelves.  The enjoyment from the job is going to vary depending on the managers.  There is not much opportunity for advancement."
good,It's kind of hard to advance if you aren't CLOSE with the management.
good,Cabelas is a place every outdoors person would love to work bc you get to learn and talk about your hobby everyday. Being in retail is hard considering weekends and advancement was slim to none because of favoritism. Overall very fun and the discounts didnt hurt either
good,"Work there if you only want part time work, if not its not worth it as the only way you can advance in the company is not through hard work but by kissing upper managements butt"
good,Sell Firearms & Optics.I am very informative and enjoy helping people and love the product I sell.
good,Cabela's is my first job. So i learned a lot. i learned cash-handling and also how to communicate with customers and how to handle customers that weren't that nice. i got along with most of my co-workers with no problem at all. the most enjoyable part of my job is just coming in and seeing my awesome co-workers and also knowing that i could be of assistance to a customer that was in need of something.
good,Cabela's was an experience I will never forget. I loved the people I worked with. The experience and adventures that I had there were invaluable!
good,Being a cashier I was the last person in the customers experience at Cabelas. Therefore it was my job to make sure their visit ended as well if not better than when they came in.
good,"I was seasonal employee, worked seven months. We filled orders for retail stores, internet orders and catalog sales. Also did packing for delivery. I rarely got thirty hours a week, except during pre-Christmas season. I enjoyed the employment, met great coworkers and management."
good,great place to work. very busy during holidays. nothing else to say
good,Cabela's has excellent employees and it is a great place to work!
good,Each day is different. I have learned a lot of different aspects of the business that I will take with me onto the next adventure.
good,"A typical day was assisting customers with their choices, restocking shelves, putting new stock on display, straightening displays, pricing and discounting pricing."
good,"If you like the outdoors, it is a great place to work but the amount of income is not enough to support living on your own."
good,Great company but lacking on hours to give employees. tends to hire temps to take the extra hours
good,"Cabela's is a wonderful, family-oriented company that was a lot of fun to work for. My coworkers were fantastic and we always had a great time while working together. Management was supportive, and always readily available."
good,"Fair, stable hours and decent pay rate. Managers work well with employees and the staff got along well together."
good,"Ritas ice water is a good first job. you don't really learn much but this job equipped me with the skills of handling of money, counting your register and face to face customer service."
good,I became familiar with using the scissor lift and pallet jack.
good,Busy retail environment. long days good people to work with.
good,Typical day is running a register and getting out onto the floor to help wherever is needed. Management is pretty good overall; the only downfall is the company is always moving people around so you cant get used to some people being around too long.The hardest part I think is that its retail; so its retail hours.
good,They pay well for a retail job and you can advance within the company. 
good,"I was a lad over the auto-box dept."
good,Work in the camping department it is fun to help outfit the customers. My co-workers are fun to work with. Management  has its moments where they do things that are great then you have more days where you feel like even though you give 100% is not good enough. There is no investing in the good employees to help them grow with the company. Not getting many hours working part time. So don't count it to live off it. 
good,"had 3 different positions throughout the 4 years i was there, cashier customer service and task team. i learned a lot of new skills but also the most important was people skills and team work. management was a bunch of fun people that i'm glad i got to meet. co-workers were amazing also. "
good,Assisting in overseeing the human resources department. Recruiting for different position at the DC.
good,The job is very challenging and keeps you busy. However management does not acknowledge the amount to do in a certain time frame. Management will lurk around and make you feel like you are not doing your job.
good,Promotions are fast for hard workers. If you can relocate every few years advancement can occur quickly.
good,"A typical day of work consists of replenishing products around cash wraps, cleaning, and transactions. I learned how to handle difficult situations in a professional manner with customers and coworkers alike. The management staff was organized and communicated well, but communication can always be better. The most enjoyable part of the job is working at a place you love."
good,"I didnt work for this company long, but from what i have seen they are willing to do anything to show their appreciation for their employees. They also do alot of things for their customers."
good,Its a very funplace towork plus your benifets are very good place to work.
good,Relaxed atmosphere defininately attempt to please every customer.
good,"Loved this job , very different , had a lot of fun at this place"
good,I am currently one of two ATF administrators for the Boise Cabela's store. I am responsible for the accuracy of all firearm background checks. My job is to keep our digital ATF acquisition and disposition log up to date for all firearms; coming in and going back out.
good,"Nice people, good money, flexible schedule, 2 breaks plus a lunch.."
good,Work environment is great. Schedule is rigid and spontaneous. Credit card sales is a weekly requirement. Often asked to do tasks outside of department.
good,It’s an ok company to work for. But only if you don’t care about advancing or your customers or seeing your family on the holidays or having vacation time with family.
good,"My only real complaint with the job was I was not given very much to do. Many days were spent going to all my department leads as well as other merchandisers to see if I could assist with any tasks just to have nothing presented to me. My boss, Will, was very hard to work with in the sense that he never seemed to give a positive or engaging attitude. It was very difficult to tell if he was ever pleased with the work done or what his expectations were."
good,"I really enjoyed working with customers, and had great coworkers that made the work fun. Our team opened the new store in Woodbury MN. I hated having to push the credit cards on every breathing person that walked by."
good,"It has been well over a year since I worked for Cabela's, and as such I feel as though anything I write here may not apply due to the Bass Pro buyout. From memory I worked with great people accomplishing an amount of work that should not have been our job. We were having to pick up the leftover work from the previous shift while getting paid less, and being required to finish our work at the same time. It was a mess, but management has changed since I left, and as I said I feel as though my experiences are not applicable."
good,Great place to work!.... at first. Poor management leads to a stressful unwelcome work environment. Lack of training results in poor employee knowledge and service.
good,"There is a lot that goes on at Cabela's with different promotions and sales each week. But a clear effort to keep things lively and fun with games, prizes and other things to keep everyone engaged."
good,Speaking with customers about different types of firearms filling out the appropriate paperwork for firearm sales. Learned the correct paperwork for selling firearms. Management seem to be fair with the day to day running of the store. The enjoyable part is being able to help customers find what they want.
good,"Less than expected overall. Management was less than forthcoming, and I requested numerous times for support however  due to the Bass Pro Shop merger, it was to be expected."
good,"The Co-Workers and the 45% discount are the main reasons to work here.  The management is typical retail management!  Customers are nice at times, generally friendly.  Pushing CLUB is a major downside of the job!"
good,Cabelas is a fun and encouraging place to work. It has really flexible hours and works well with my school schedule. They really are great people to work for.
good,"I honestly love this job (Customer Service Counter). The people I work with and the relationships we’ve developed. Our Leads are amazing and I love working with them. One of the ONLY reasons I’m looking for new employment is the hours, in the (a little over) a year that I’ve been there they’ve cut hours about 3 times, this time being the worst! If it wasn’t for that I don’t think I’d leave!"
good,"Great place to work. I had alot of fun there, but the pay is really low and you get no hours. i was there for grand opening and after that was done over half the people lost their jobs on the same day."
good,"I worked as a Cashier for a little over a year before I left. A typical day was pretty boring. You scanned items and talked with customers, however these customers were probably on the nicer side compared to other Customer Service jobs I've had! I loved everyone I worked with even the people who were in different departments! I made a bunch of lifetime friends here! The atmosphere was great and welcoming, everyone was super helpful. Unfortunately after Bass Pro took over we had been assigned a new manager after our previous one had been fired. The new manager was really rude and yelled at us for harmless things. The worst thing about Cabelas in general was how hard they pushed the credit cards and pushed collecting phone numbers and asking customers to round up their already expensive total. Customers became very agitated understandably. I always felt bad for pressuring the customer to do these things. I had not wanted to leave but I needed a full time job and wanted to move to a new department but was refused multiple times. I love the company and my coworkers but I couldn’t live off of part time work."
good,"Customer service is about the same across the retail experience.  Cabela's is no different, you have customer that are great and then other opportunities, management was different."
good,A typical day of work at Cabelas would include unloading a truck that just came in and working the product out to the floor.  I was also in charge of the other employees that worked in the warehouse.
good,Great fast paced work environment. All ATF forms are computerized and easy to work with. All outfitters are customer orientated and strive to insure customers receive outstanding service.
good,"It is a retail job so expect a retail environment, but selling product people want to do fun things is fun. Customers have great stories and are nice."
good,"people are amazing, flexible, scheduling could be a little more flexible, coworkers felt like family, management could have been a little more organized"
good,"I worked prior to Bass Pro buying the company, but heard the rumor and had to tell customers that it was just a rumor. Little room for advancement but they did like to promote from within."
good,Friendly coworkers always willing to help out. Breaks are probably the worst planned. Customers are usually nice but are impatient due to the very slow computer systems.
good,"Greeding people at the door, Giving them help to find product they are looking for. Inspecting Guns coming  in, Check out for safety.Lock out triger. Keeping area clean, Line up shopping Carts"
good,"Well organised business plans with good team structure and good working relationships and a good spirit between different offices in Asia and the USA."
good,"The GM is the best! The culture a little caveman at x's, some good, some challenged managers. Hiring some great people, lost one great manager. Good Ops Mngr."
good,"Good company to work for.  It is retail so you have long retail hours, and lots of fast paced situations, but if you are a good worker you will have job security."
good,Possibly too much management lead to confusion about duties at times but the competitive sales environment lead to fun competition between associates as well as incentive to improve.
good,"*Was offered good training to manage cash office work efficiently."
good,"Cabela's is a decent little place to learn more about hunting, fishing and the outdoors overall. Lots of friends can be made at this place and you can always move up in the business."
good,I love the training and the quality of the work environment. The flexibility of work hours was the hardest to adjust. Management had more freedom with hours than lower level employees. The work goal to force customers for club cards made the customers hostile and uncooperative with cashier
good,Loved the workplace and my fellow associates. The management system would promise job security and would never stick to it. Only certain managers were worth it.
good,this has been my only retail job so nothing else to compare it too. but easy going job. slow days/seasons and busy days/ seasons. fairly easy to move around with job openings. part time get shorted on hours except around the holidays. all in all good place to work!
good,A good place to work where employees are kept in the loop of changes happening within the company.  Flexible scheduling to allow for family time is a great plus.
good,Pretty easy job that being said nothing exciting about it and not much room to expand. Pretty much something until you find something better. Management is decent and for the most part it is a fun place to work. Just nothing to write home about.
good,I was a seasonal worker. You don't have a say about the schedule. Better pay than most retail jobs. Had some decent benefits. The management played favorites more about who you know and if management liked you. Didn't like that they wanted you to push the Cabelas credit card on the customers every time you had a chance.
good,it has a lot of positive managers that are willing to help you grow within the company if you show professionalism and willing to work
good,I loved my job in the beginning. but it eventually turned sour quickly. They do not have an understanding of what business is. The decisions made by the management never make sense. It is a fun place to work though.
good,It can be very stressful. Managers are not always on the same page when it comes to product placement. Product is constantly being moved to different locations which can make it confusing for the outfitter working and the customer shopping.
good,"I loved working with the people at Cabela's. The only issue I had was the reason I left. My hours were always way more than I had asked. I am a full time student, so I asked to only work 20 hours a week. Instead, I worked 30-40 hours a week. It began to be too much to handle. They claimed that this was just because of it being holiday season, but it never changed."
good,"I enjoyed working for Cabela's. But there was a big difference between corporate and CLUB. At corporate, I worked in a planning/inventory role. So I was working with product. I enjoyed that because I was able to see new items and get hands on experience with those items. I transferred to CLUB. I knew going in the hands on product would go away, but the thing that really changed was the atmosphere. it almost felt forced, by some people, to be part of the outdoors. You don't have to be part of the outdoors to work at Cabela's. If you aren't part of the outdoors, you may feel pressure to try something outdoor related. I don't think that's right. Job title at CLUB was marketing analyst, no in depth analysis was ever done. It was more task/calendar management. I didn't care for that."
good,"Good company to work for. I got to talk about ab"
good,The Managers at Cabelas were all very nice and wanted what was best for you. They would help you whenever you needed it and always wanted the customers happy.
good,"Great Team of people to work with in many Cross-Functional Efforts."
good,Cabela's has been growing very rapidly for the past 5 years.  They are opening many new stores and Distribution Centers to try to handle the expansion without losing their culture and trust to their workers and customers.
good,"I was happy working this company, but found their mission statement to be untrue. Their strict rules in regard to attendance, even in emergency statements, was to ridge."
good,There are a lot of good outfitters that work there. It is like a big family. Advancement can be good depending who you are.
good,"It's a pretty nice place to work, not getting the hours I had received at grand opening."
good,Process Items in Bargain Cave and help Customers with product and Questions. Coworkers where great and fun to work with. The Most enjoyable part of job is making the customer happy .
good,"we would be restricted to working the cash registers and stockint the front area, I was allowed to operate a small eletric vehicle to assist in retrieving shopping carts. We perfered not to leave the area due to the customers woulod ask us complicated questions and we would perfer to not make our staff look bad by not  knowing the answers"
good,Job include: Pricing and product integrity. Investigation of missing products.
good,"I would rather be a cashier than doing line cook, I could do more than with the line cook, the management there did not know what to do with me cause of my age. I was 20 yrs. older than most of the people and they felt I should know everything in that job, the workers were great people very understanding. I enjoy the customers who liked coming to the dining area and trying something different."
good,"The people you meet and get to work with are phenomenal. From every day co-workers, to the upper management in the store, establishing friendship bonds come easily. "
good,"A good place to work, with a great customer base. Pay is a little lower than average, but the benefits balance this out."
good,It was an alright experience wish they gave me more notice they weren’t going to sign me on a permanent contract now I’m searching for a job like crazy
good,"Fun, fast paced, and easy to get along with everyone. The gun counter crew I worked with were top notch guys and were/are really passionate about the job."
good,"When I worked there it was for a seasonal position where the work was extreme and fast pace most of the time. However, there was times were we wouldn't get a new drop for hours at a time so the only thing we could do was wait around while we stood and did nothing."
good,I felt like I got along with all of my co workers on and off the clock. I built friendships at that Work that I thought I would never get. After Only working there only 2 months I still felt like I gained a work family relationship.
good,The job can be monotonous at times and slow but that goes for all retail jobs. The discount is incredible however their main concern and judging off your performance seems to come from how many people you get to sign up for credit cards per day which is unfortunate and the pay leave something to be desired especially in Hamilton county.
good,Would recommend working there for hard lines or club which is an upselling credit cards job! Soft line Manager is horrible. Always has fake and poor demeanor. Makes things hard on you just because she can.
good,"Great culture to be a part of, and occasionally there was a food truck available for workers and a chance to win prizes. Minimum wage was the down side as well as the 3 strike policy."
good,Really good discount on stuff.  I enjoy working with some of my fellow employees it is busy and fast paced work.  Always on the go helping customers out.
good,"Great place to work . Great atmosphere , good discount , good people to work with , the hours are flexible, but pay fair.realy like to work with customers"
good,"Wages were not fair to the work needing to be done. Great coworkers, 1 of the top 5 companies I've worked for so far in life... they did not place me into the correct department that I felt most comfortable in.."
good,"Cabela's is a great place to work for those with a love of nature or the outdoorsman/woman spirit! Even after being taken under the less than appealing wing of Basspro, they still manage to be top notch in their field. The workplace community that the management inspires is fantastic and the environment is a welcoming one."
good,"I worked at Cabelas for a year, it was a temporary job until I could go back to Nursing. I did enjoy all  of the customer interaction and enjoyed my coworkers. It was a stressful environment at times but handled that well. I learned how to deal well with upset customers and also how to manage a team."
good,"It is a wonderful company to work for, but it became difficult to advance at the location I was at because any time there was a higher position open, there was usually a person from outside the store that would receive the position. I understood I probably wasn't the world's most qualified candidate  for the positions but after being suggested to apply many times for different positions and nothing came of it, it became disappointing."
good,People are friendly as long as you agree with their political views. Way too focused on associate's shortcomings (ie. lack of credit card application references). Will close for particularly bad weather. Good about granting time off requests.
good,"Daily morning employee and manager meeting at front of the store to review sales, consumer trends, short/long term company goals, and recognizing employee excellence. Upon opening, the firearms department retrieves cash drawers, updates delay logs and awaits customers. In the firearms sales position, I gained an in-depth knowledge of the various types of handguns, rifles, shotguns, optics, and accessories. Also learned were effective ways to communicate with customers and understand their needs for specific applications as well as bartering-negotiation skills. Management was always on top of their duties and ensuring employees and customers were taken care of at all times. Co-workers enjoy each others' presence and are quick to offer assistance when in need. The most difficult part of the job is handling customers who become irate when denied a sale based on a failed background check or are caught engaging in suspicious activities during the course of a sale. Additionally, the P.O.S.system used for finalizing transactions is quite time-consuming and non-user friendly. The most enjoyable part of the job is conversing with passionate employees and customers. Discussing their equipment needs for the upcoming season, customers sharing stories, and asking for advice on how to further improve their skills is always rewarding. Part-time or full-time, Cabelas' offers a great work environment that takes care of and appreciates their employees as well as their loyal customers."
good,"one can learn about different products that cabelas sells, weekends, summer and hunting seasons are busiest. for the most part every one gets treated fairly."
good,"Typically, I would spend all day in Excel spreadsheets and Access databases.  I would use each application to create or update reports on the department so that management can make decisions based on the current status."
good,"Cabelas is a fun and friendly work environment with good work incentives and good benefits. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with angry customers. However, you find that out with any job. LOL! The most enjoyable part of the job for me was being able to successfully help out customers with any problem or question and to see the look of appreciation on their faces."
good,"I have found Cabela's employees to be very friendly and helpful, answering any questions I may have about policies, processes, or items for sale in different departments. It's also very nice to work with people who share the same or similar interests in hobbies."
good,I loved working at Cabela's. The management and staff really work well together to achieve goals. It was a fun work environment and everyone was really passionate about the brand.
good,I was part of the grand opening team and worked in firearms the entire time. I learned most everything about the firearms retail process. I went from almost no knowledge on optics to one of the best in my department with the teaching tools provided by the company. I learned and excelled at mounting scopes and other optics onto firearms. Became proficient with all necessary ATF compliance aspects and firearms transaction process.
good,"When I started at Cabelas I found it to be very enjoyable. You meet so many new people with so many different things and adventures to talk about. The job was fast paced most days, with a lot of customers coming in and needing help. The employees were wonderful, all had great stories and a wealth of knowledge."
good,Awesome place for shopping and for spending time at. Unfortunately I’m a tad bit biased considering I was only there as a seasonal employee in the fishing department and the cafe.
good,Cabela's has a great atmosphere but drama is a pretty big issue there. Some of the management there camke things up that are not true and I have confirmed the with other management.
good,"Providing customers with an excellent experience was my focus.  This was achieved by keeping the premises clean and pleasing to the customers.  Legendary customer service was of upmost importance.  My tasks consisted of providing legendary customer service, keeping the facilities clean, keeping the cart corral full, nightly cleaning of the windows and floors, repair of broken equipment, etc."
good,"Always something interesting to learn, fun customers, fun environment, fun employees.  I would work there again if the pay wasn't so low. The training they do is also hooked up with a college so we got college credit for what we trained for."
good,Working at Cabella's was fun but it was also clicky you were either in or not. At least that is how I saw it. I loved working there regardless I did my job and enjoyed what I did.
good,"Cabela's has a great policy for training. The culture is good.When they opened the pay was great but tops out fast. The hardest part of my job was not being able to uphold my policy with Firearm Safety students."
good,I enjoy working at Cabela's. The people are great. The benefits are awesome. I love the flexibility with my work hours. I think the only thing that has so many people leaving is the uncertainty.
good,"Cabala's provided a workplace that ensured face to face contact with customers each and every day. On top of that, a variety of tasks and deadlines are given to where it challenges you to handle many situations at once."
good,Good to work for. You get good discounts.  The pay is competitive the managers know how to help you and are very willing to do so.  I have enjoyed working for them.
good,Very friendly management.  Very considerate and respectful.  Retail business in not reliable.  Nice brand new store.  good environment.  Great people to work with.  Cabelas has an unsure future right now.
good,"I very much enjoy my position at Cabela's. Working at the gun counter, assisting people with their purchases and talking about their firearms and experiences is very rewarding. In general Cabela's is a great place to have a part-time job and to reap the rewards of staff discounts, especially distributor/manufacturer deals. It makes a great ""second job"" for anyone who loves the outdoors and doesn't mind spending more in the store than they pay you. It's important that you get a position that you care about, otherwise it's just a retail job like any other."
good,"First off, I am privileged and thankful to have been a part of the opening crew of Oklahoma City's Cabelas.  To open a store is an amazing experience.  This store has a part of me.  I have never had a customer leave unsatisfied.  Of course, many may have been unhappy by a miscommunication or by not having a certain product, but we as a TEAM and all departments have met there needs in one way or another.  The policies have changed from the beginning, it was more enjoyable to converse with customers, now we are afraid we will fail a 4most focus analysis or not say the right words.  We now have management hovering over us to make sure we say the right words and PUSH club card visa.  This behavior drives us outfitters away. However, It is fun to learn why customers come in whether it is a hiking, camping, backpacking or hunting trip, etc.  The fellow outfitters are fun people to work along side in all departments.  The outfitters and customers are what makes the days and weeks and seasons enjoyable to come to work everyday.  We are there to outfit the customer with all the proper gear - nothing more satisfying to see the customer excited about their expedition with the proper gear.  We have a great amount of Cabelas brand products with a superb lifetime guarantee, I own much product and enjoy to promote.  I have been at Cabelas for nearly two years, and I love the outfitters and customer adventures."
good,There was always room for improvement and room to grow. The pay did not always compensate for the work you had to do. Management was reasonable and great to work with.
good,"If you enjoy the outdoors and are looking for a great discount and good pay it is a great place to work. They start out at $10.50 and the discounts are great. For the pay it was a good place, but don't expect advancement. There are a few good managers who are willing to work with you and treat you well. The company has some problems, but over all $10 an hour to work retail is good pay. I don't suggest it if you want to make it a career."
good,"there was always new products to learn about, whether it was fishing, camping, hunting and clothing lines. the online catalog expanded my capability of purchasing and recommending more product lines"
good,"there are certain times in a day that it gets busy specially on the holidays but if they have scheduled too many staff they might ask you to go home or cut off your time. staff are friendly, I only met one person who does not like coaching new staff. company is diverse - culture, age-wise. most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and bonding with other staff."
good,"Over all Cabela's is a good place to work, you can get a lot of hours if you ask. Easy and fun. Can learn a lot while working on your customer service skills"
good,Love the people and management.  Low pay.  hours go way down after Christmas.  good morale.  fun environment. love the people. low pay. love the people and management .  low pay
good,"It was an enjoyable place to work, with friendly staff and customers. It is one of my personal favorite stores to shop at, because I love the outdoors."
good,"Cabela's was a great place to work. I loved my coworkers, and my managers. The GM was awful, but he has since left. The atmosphere was so relaxed and you could laugh and joke with coworkers and everybody knew each other and there were hardly any issues. Hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers, but it was never that hard."
good,"it was an amazing Job I learned so many things, from credit cards to larger scale money handling to being almost completely self taught. the only issue is I was not properly trained and the management was not there to tell me where I had messed up or where I needed to improve. I was also promised 25 hours a week and never was scheduled for more than 18 hours"
good,"I'm able to get my job functions done and after that I work on merchandising and training new employees, that is what I really like to do. Management is easy to work with since they know of my extensive retail background and the benefits I bring."
good,Cabelas is the works foremost outfitter and the employees lived that to the core in the Culture and in general lifestyle.  Company is great and discounts are as well but the pay is pretty low.
good,Cabelas was a great place to work and very educational and learning there ways of customer service was great. I started in warehouse and went to archery then cashier.
good,"I worked for Cabela's for three years and overall I really enjoyed working there. The people I worked with were great and I loved helping customers in the fun environment. We went through at least 5  different managers in customer service which was irritating. Also was not allowed to work over 23 hours/week. Full time positions in customer service were limited. Training is good, employee incentives are good, but vary by department. Ability to make extra money selling protection plans and getting people to sign up for credit cards, but never felt like I was forced to shove it down customers throats. Had to be available to work at least one full weekend day."
good,"Spent most days doing things a little differently, which excited me. I was in charge of about 10 employees, we where responsible for making the clothing department sales goals and providing legendary customer service. Management worked alongside their staff. The hardest part of the job was when there where new modular sets, but the challenge was not impossible. My favorite part of the job was making customers happy."
good,"I've been with Cabela's for a year now, and there are a few glitches. And a lot of ""what in the world?!"" type questions when it comes to management, or how things are done. But, over all, it isn't a bad place to work until you are ready to start a career, or just need to get out of the house a few hours a day. "
good,"To provide necessary leadership and training  to ensure superior customer service and growth to all outfitters. "
good,"Cabela's is an outdoor sales store for those wishing to explore and do things in the outdoors, hunting, fishing and such. The company is undergoing changes and may improve or hurt the company in the long run."
good,"When it is busy the day goes by really fast, the biggest plus of working for cabelas is the most interesting people that you get to talk to when they come in. They don't need to be there but they come there because they want to! That makes it that much more fun."
good,"i enjoyed working with them, i would definitely work for them again. they treated their employees with great respect, and will work with you if you had a family emergency"
good,"A typical day at Cabelas was very satisfying.i have learned many new things i had never tried before,such as using RF guns and internet shipping products that customers have ordered.Ihad set a goal for myself everyday to better my self the next day.I was cross trained in most departments which i enjoyed as i wanted to know as much of the warehouse operations as i could learn.As a result i was able to train new employees in various departments.My supervisors were very nice and easy to get along with as well as all of my co workers which it felt like a family where everybody would take the time to help if help was needed everybody was polite and helpful.I think the hardest part of the job would be the heat in the warehouse in the summer.The most enjoyable part of Cabelas is the people.They are all great,i still keep in touch with many of my coworkers.Also i enjoyed the environment ,working with all the different products and equipment. I truly miss this job."
good,"I have worked at multiple retail companies in my lifetime. Cabelas is by far the best one I worked for. When the correct people were in charge, every goal was accomplished."
good,"I came into the company on the ground floor of the Planning organization.  Since that time, the Planning organization has gone through several iterations.  Some for the better; some not."
good,"It was a good environment to work, just not enough hours since the Company-wide reductions in 2013. I worked with mostly good, honest people that cared that the job was done correct the 1st time. We were, in fact, the Top-rated Warehouse Department in the Cabela's chain for 2013. Management were caring to us as individuals. They all knew your name on site, were always concerned as to how you were as a person."
good,Cabela's is a fun environment for some like me to work in if you like the outdoors but it isnt a company i see myself having a future with. A decent percent of the managment isnt supportive. The pay is low.
good,Cabela's is a nice company to work for.  I enjoy working the morning shift because it lets me balance work life and home life very well.  Just wish the company would allot more hours for their employees.
good,"Having a plethora of men's hunting and fishing clothes, it was really educational.  All-weather, summer, fall and everything in between.  A really great environment to work in."
good,"Is always a busy day in our asset protection department.  Being part of a growing company have some pros and some cons.  Pros is that the company is open for change and it that a lot of things that need to be learn on the process of growing.  The hardest part of my job is not having enough resources and workers on the department to provide an excelent, most enjoylable is how exiting can be, Im always busy and all the knowlegde you can learn while working everyday!"
good,"Overall, working at Cabela's is great. They offer great employee discounts and have an awesome break room. At times, especially around the holidays, that the work load becomes difficult, but that is expected during that time of year."
good,"The work I did at Cabelas in the warehouse was very stressful, but not necessarily hard.  Most of the night I spent in the actual warehouse operating a forklift and the rest I spent moving product to the showroom floor. It was very understaffed in the warehouse and a simple project took much longer because of it."
good,In am just not a sitting down at work type of person so I dint really like being on the phones.
good,"I love this company but ii need more pay.. I live alone and cant support myself on their salary.. i work 40 hours a week and still have a hard time making ends meet.. ive talked to them about it and nothing has changed. thats why im looking to better myself and try to find something that will help me..  I have learned alot here, forklife, inventory, stocking, overstock, i love all my coworkers they are all great.. hardest part about this job is the hours rotate from morning shift to evening shift and i need something steady so i can find another job. when they hired me hey hired me and i took the position because they told me it was a 7-4 job 5 days a week.. it then turned to 8-5 now i rotate and cant find a part time job on this schedule."
good,"Great people to work with. Typical day is 8-5. The hardest part of the job is working weekends and holidays. However, the best part is you talk about the outdoors everyday and sell fun."
good,"Easy work"
good,Not real good job security. Laid a lot of people off. Part time is okay don't set your heart on full time
good,I ran the cash register promoted club cards and replacement plans along with stock shelves
good,It was lots of fun working with and learning about all the great outdoor equipment
good,"Clients calling in because they haven't received orders yet, So I would track the order to verify if it had been delivered. I would review the address where the order was or being delivered to. Where the delivery person put the order. If order was lost I would set for an new order to go out at no cost to client. I would replace an incorrect item sent to client. If it would cost more to return we would just let client keep incorrect limit plus get a new correct item. I would notate on each account what the call was about what the item number was issued or was incorrect what my actions were."
good,"worked with customers and always had fun with the co-workers at work, there was a big over turn constantly with management which made things difficult at times, pay was decent, working 6-7 days a week was hard to have a life outside of work"
good,"Customer service, merchandising. The most enjoyable part is the fact that people come into Cabela's because they want to not because they need to. The hardest part about the job is not being knowledge on everything. When a customer comes into the store, I want to be able to outfit them completely with what they are looking for, that's why we are called outfitters."
good,I learned a lot about the out doors and fishing. The job it self is good place to work but just a few bad employes.
good,"Every time I came into work there were clear directions of what the day was going to look like, and how everyone had their jobs that would fulfill the entire teams objective."
good,"Pay could be higher, the company keeps adding responsibilities with no increase in pay. The culture of the company has changed since the Bass Pro Shop takeover, and not for the better."
good,I started there as a Customer Service Representative and within two months was promoted to Customer Service Supervisor. I was ecstatic at the opportunity. Working there I saw many people some regulars and some new faces. It was a wonderful experience wouldn't change it for the world.
good,"Great place to gain knowledge of everything you need to enjoy using outdoors. Firearms Specialist, Run background checks on customers buying firearms and assuring forms where properly field out. The hardest part of job was keeping up with changes in dailey changes in firearms purchases."
good,Was a great place when I started but the culture and company culture declined rapidly.  Very disappointed in the decline of social activities provided by the company
good,Enjoyed working nights. Always busy and time flew by. Met some super people there and learned a lot about different things related to the Outdoors. Only complaint was that they hired too few full time employees.
good,The passion that comes from the people that work there is bar non some of the best. The chance to relate with customers that have the same passion is amazing. The new merger has mad it hard to work there and the management structure is changing to be less supportive.
good,"Decent place to work if you need a second job because hours if you are not making your sales goals drop to like no hours. No room for advancement unless leads or managers leave. Some leads will not be very good leaders and force you to do their work for them and voluntell you to do it, instead of being a true leader. When you ask for help more than likely you won't get help unless you are a lead or manager. Discounts are great."
good,"I think it is a great place as a first job. "
good,A true hobbies store. Customers were always full of exotic stories and looking for something different. Would recommend working there as a temporary source of employment or for someone in school.
good,Pay could be better.  Good environment.  All the overtime you want.  Management is good as far as working with your scheduled and requesting time off .
good,A very busy atmosphere. So much product coming in and out. Working constantly especially though the holidays. Long work days happened more than once. I’m very glad my team lead was there to keep everybody happy in spirits.
good,"Great place for those who love the outdoors, and for those who are retired and or in between jobs. It is a very relaxed and friendly environment, but leaves little room for growth and to advance a career."
good,Fast paced and stay busy. Supervisors are easy to work with and very helpful. I do many various jobs during the time at work and the day passes pretty quickly.
good,Beautiful interior designs and fun employees.  Retail is always hard and rarely rewarding.  The manager believed his employees should get outdoors so he would coordinate special events and take as many employees that could come.
good,A typical day involves helping customers. I learned about products. Management had to have a lot of patience since most people came into Cabelas not knowing a lot.  Workplace culture was fun. The hardest part was being moved from hunting because they wanted to keep the spaces open for my co workers but they were Men who did not hunt and I was a woman who did hunt and knew little about clothing other than I needed to wear it. The most enjoyable part is how Cabelas worked hard to create a family atmosphere.
good,The business culture is changing as it become Bass Pro Shops.  BPS is killing the strong culture the Cabela's had built up and customers are not liking the changes that are happening.  I feel bad that the company has basically been killed off.
good,Its an amazing place to work if you're looking to work during the summer.  Everyone who work there are amazing.  They're very good about being flexible for weekends however you have to be open on working on weekends. They will not hire anyone if they can't work on weekends.
good,Cabelas rewarded me well because I have a strong work ethic. I don't mind doing any job and am often asked to participate in their weekend and holiday events.  Best part of the job is working with others. Learned how to organize and plan store products. I worked well with management because I am a hard worker.
good,It was a very fun company to work for. You got $1 a day meals and a good discount on products. You worked at your own pace and got a bonus based on  your rate.
good,working with customers in all aspects of sales from doing layaways to ordering things for them from other stores.  taking care of returns and selling hunting and fishing Licenses. I love working with people.
good,It was a fun environment to work in. The people are very nice. The other employees treat you like family. They let you trade shifts with your fellow employees.
good,"Have worked there since 1998 have seen changes some good some I am not happy with."
good,"Answering questions for customers and phones"
good,"I worked part-time on nights in the supply chain. It wasn't my ideal job, but it was the first job that had given me an opportunity to work after a few months of searching. I worked with a small group of people primarily stocking all the departments, unloading the trucks, inventory and straightening out display items. Some nights were long depending on how much stock needed to be done, but I worked with a solid group of people and great supervisor. Unfortunately, I didn't work there long. I was let go after a year due to staff cuts on the night crew. Although it wasn't the job I was looking for at the time, I'm glad I had the opportunity to work there in the time I did."
good,Interacting with co workers.
good,This is a great job for college or high school students. Has a very diverse culture in the work environment. The hardest part of the job is trying to help customers who are just getting into outdoor sports.
good,As soon as I arrived I got straight to work. The management would always help if there were issues needing fixed. Everyone got along which made a good environment for work.
good,"No job security, Cabela's is being bought by Bass Pro so a lot of people getting laid off.  When you work for Cabela's you possibly will get a good review but in the next sentence they will tell you that you can always do better.  Management in my department was good & my co-workers were great to work with."
good,"Report and analyze international shipment data that includes container utilization, volume forecasting and timely port clearance to ensure a streamlined supply chain.  Continuous opportunities to learn the business from cradle to grave with peers willing to share their knowledge and insight."
good,It was a fun learning experience. I learned about the different types of cards that they had to offer and the different kinds of products that they had. The hardest part of the job was how hectic it could get but it was fast paced and was fun.
good,"Very family orientated job place. I have met people from different "
good,"Answer phone, assist cardholders with questions and payments and direct to other departments as needed.  Very good incentives when goals were achieved."
good,"I miss Cabela's. I did not leave the company on bad terms, just the management at the final store I was in (had transferred and went from a Manager to part time). I would not recommend joining the company at this time ONLY due to the fact that I'm not sure how the buyout from Bass Pro Shops will play out for current and future Cabela's employees. I made many lifelong friends, and some closer than family, working with the people. While the company itself may not be a solid 10, the people employed there are some of the best folks you can hope to meet."
good,Pretty decent place to work. Pay sucks unless you advance to a leadership/management position. No PT benefits. Discount is amazing. Most managers are cool. Some are eh. Upper management is okay.
good,"My whole job at Cabela's was to pick-up garbage.  I would go around and pick up trash from the floor, and collect the garbage bags from their cans.  It was a nice job while I was there."
good,"A typical day at work was pretty average-pace, with rushes between 11am and 1pm. "
good,"Great work environment, but slightly inexperienced management team. Very fun in the beginning once first opened but then it started becoming sort of negative overall. Became under staffed, and unfair in certain departments, all employees were not treated equally."
good,"Cabela's is an interesting place to work. If you can get used to those awful tan shirts and asking everyone ""what brings you in today?"" it is a pretty good place to work. They have a lot of social events, providing a lot of free food, and the pro deals they offer can be really good."
good,"When we first opened the store it was a great place to work. After a few months and moving up in the company, it was real clear that no one cared about the employees."
good,I love my job. Co-Workers are good. Good atmosphere. The buyout has the retail side struggling a bit. I'm hopeful that everything will turn out okay.......
good,"This was a part time job while I was in school. This job gave me more customer service experience. The only reason, I left was due to me accepting a full time job."
good,Started as tractor sales and enjoyed the customers but now they are doing away with my department- I would like to find something that is closer to home and family
good,"Answering inbound calls in call center. Entered catalog orders for seasonal merchandise. Had to be on your toes & ready to find whatever the customer wanted. Liked it, but it was only seasonal."
good,"A typical day at work as the firearm inspector is directing customers to where they need to go. However if an individual is carrying a firearm you MUST ensure that you properly check it in. The management team is pretty spot on, and the Outfitters that work there are phenomenal. The hardest part of the job is keeping yourself entertained, and the best part is seeing all the new people and kids seeing all the animals when they walk in the door."
good,"Great opportunity and amazing work/life balance mix.  Growing company with a lot of opportunity.  Town of Sidney, where Cabela's corporate is located, is a great community and the perfect, safe place to raise a family."
good,We are on a stock picker. we pull Product to be stocked or shipped. We work a 12 hrs shift. Got to be able to work long hrs with short brakes and keep an high rate
good,"The company's growth is due to creating a atmosphers of Legendary Customer Service, freedom for all employees to make decisions and take care of the customers. "
good,"Typically I would perform background checks on customers purchasing firearms. I also run a register and give legendary customer service. I have crossed trained in the store to be able to work the gun counter and the gun library. In retail the more you can do the better for the company. I also crossed trained to work in camping, shoes, and the fishing dept. With that being said I usually get scheduled to work one area but end up working at least three different one within an 8 hour period."
good,"Not worked there very Long but it seems to be a relatively fun friendly environment."
good,Was to make sure the customer had a very enjoyable shopping experience at Cabela's & hopefully they fund everything that they where looking for at the store.
good,"Cabela's is a very positive environment. Everyone loves their job. There is still the usual politics but in general, I never minded going in."
good,"The people I work with are generally pretty awesome.  I can't say there is one person I could not sit and have coffee with; we come from a variety of backgrounds in careers, families and life.  At the very least the people are interesting."
good,"Able to help customers in any dept, and make their shopping experience extraordinary. Good place to work made great contacts with other professionals. It was a team work orientated place of business, and management made you feel as your were always part of the team."
good,"Arby's was my first job and to be able to work in food service gave me a new found respect for people within the service industry. You learn a lot while working in the drive thru serving customers. It was a great time working there, everyone got along with managers and coworkers alike. It was a hard job, though. 40 hours a week and sometimes working alone made completing all the closing tasks difficult. The most enjoyable part was the knowledge I gained while working there. The experience of working with the public and learning various skills related to customer service have helped immensely since departing there."
good,"My day was ever changing, which was awesome. Each moment presented it's own challenges. Growth potential is awesome if you are able to travel, or are able to relocate. I was not able to do either. My boss was awesome. I miss my boss and and my job. Not too many people can say that. The pay wasn't great, but it was made up with the discount. "
good,"Work life balance is difficult due to business schedule/needs."
good,"	Produce Strategic Planning and communication to Executives"
good,"Had a good time at the company.Until I was laid off due to lack of business. Hardest part was, getting there on time and beeing told your hours are being cut."
good,"A typical day at work included helping out where needed, helping other coworkers, engaging with customers, handling money, and being self sufficient. I was able to constantly learn new tactics from my coworkers, that made me a better employee. One of the most enjoyable parts of my job was engaging with the customers and making sure that their experience was legendary."
good,Cabelas is a great place to work. It has a great atmosphere for the outdoors and the people who enjoy it. I enjoy working with those people because I share similar interests. I submit and review federal forms for gun sales. My job is to look for errors and ensure the accuracy of the forms for submission to national instant criminal background check systems aka nics. I enjoy this in combination with customer interaction. The hardest part of the job is maintaining a high level of accuracy as volumes of customers change. For the most part co-workers have a great attitude and work together. The company is in the throes of a corporate integration so many changes are expected. Part time associates experience a detriment financially due to caps on hours especially if you're the head of the household. Cabelas needs to make sure to consider their employees and their contribution to the company and community in regards to this concept.
good,Cabela's was a fantastic company to work for however once they went public the first thing they did was cut salary positions.
good,Stayed busy worked with management team and employees. I loved a challenge and would never give up until figured out and was challenged daily.
good,"Work starts at 6 AM, it is a very quiet environment with no windows, where we count/balance all the previous day's work for the store and the bank. Make up the deposits, then send daily reports to our managers and corporate contacts through email or our network system's and on excel.  "
good,"Management is very well organized."
good,work in dynamic team environment to ensure overall company profitability
good,Cabelas still runs a business based on traditional values. They take good care of their employees and still treat customers very well.
good,"• I will work on catalog pages from 7 to 5:30, I work 4 10 hour days. I will work with merchants and Art Directors to get ideas on how the pages will look. I will do corrections on the pages and go to meetings to let us know what is in store for the following months."
good,"As someone who loves to hunt, there is no place better to work. With all of the product that surrounds you, you're tempted to shop while on the clock. The management when I was there was pretty solid. Easy to talk to. Normally pretty good with schedule changes. Can be stressful during peak times. Some of the employees have a stick stuck up their butts but overall, good people that work there."
good,".Answering inbound phone calls, check on product available, describing product details to customer, tracking package to be delivered, taking catalog orders, processing credit card payments."
good,"my days were never boring - each day was something new. Hardest part of the job was between Thanksgiving and Christmas, working every Saturday to get packages shipped."
good,"Excellent management, including safety issues, snack during breaks, nice working culture. "
good,Cabelas was a really great place to work. If you are a student or are just trying to get into working your first job I would definitely recommend considering Cabelas. The work environment is really positive with appropriately difficult challenges depending on your job type. Very nice as a first time retail experience or as a first ever job!
good,"I enjoyed helping customers with purchases and finding what they were looking for.  "
good,"On any given day, I’m able to make people smile and help them learn to love the outdoors again. I am constantly making activities and tours for Boy Scouts and other young adult/child organizations to get them out of technology habits and into healthier and more rewarding hobby’s."
good,Started working on the store approximately 2 months prior to store opening for setup and merchandising. Worked part time for 2 years as an outfitter in various departments
good,"As a new employee, you have two supervisors: a ""lead"" and a manager. In my experience, both have been nice and are willing to work with your schedule. If you work full time, you will have an hour for lunch (unpaid) and two 15 minute breaks (paid), which is nice. "
good,"It was a great place to work, but most of the leads are quite rude and will hound your a## if you do something wrong even if it is a small mess up. Yes they have good pay and yes they have great discount programs but, if they say overtime you HAVE to do it even if its 6 days a week."
good,"It was a pretty typical cashier position. I did a lot of closing shifts. Learned a good general idea of customer service and sales skills. I believe it's a good foundation. The coworkers actually became some of my closest friends. However, some of the high-level management, especially our General Manager, was clearly in messy shape. However, my immediate supervisors were great and understanding. The best days were during the week when there was a nice rhythm between checkout and maintaining the front end to kill time. The hardest part was selling credit cards, credit cards, credit cards, credit cards, and more credit cards; we were 'forced' to make a weekly goal."
good,"Great place to work. nice customers, good employees. everyone there likes to be a team player. you never have to be afraid to ask for help. management is willing to go out of thier way to help every employee."
good,"Fantastic organization as a whole, however i find that those working in specialty department stores such as Cabela's should be compensated a marginal amount more than the current rate at lacey Cabela's. I have enjoyed my time with the organization and plan on maintaining my relationship with Cabela's for quite some time. I have enjoyed being a member of the team."
good,"Loved working there. Was one of my favorite places to work, they were very forgiving and understandable as w as it being just a fun work environment. Would highly recommend working there."
good,I enjoyed my time at the NICS counter.  I think that starting off as a cashier helped once I transferred departments.  It was a learning experience for me.  It started off as  a second job for me and quickly turned into my full time job.  The only reason I left was because I was offered a job that allowed for more weekend family time.  This is customer service so there are definitely times where it is stressful due to customer involvement but you have that anywhere in retail.  I had a good support team that trained me and continued to help me with any question I had even after my training period had ended.
good,"I am a salaried member of the management team. A typical day at work for me is divided between the front end and back end. The hardest part of the job is trying to work with the antiquated inventory system. The management team/my peers have been great. It is quite possibly the best and most welcoming team that I have been a part of! The most enjoyable part of the job has definitely been the team. They pay is not great for hourly or salaried, but the team and benefits make up for it."
good,I was part of a an excellent team of workers that stayed on task and work hard to accomplish our goals.  The work pace was fast and demanding at times but we always managed to succeed.
good,"Fun job to meet many differing abilities in folks and a variety of people and lifestyle diversity.  Generally, most people are in great moods and customers can be too because the products are used when they are relaxing, or on vacation, or sporting.  If customers are in a bad mood it is concerned about being haggled into credit card or schemes for unnecessary products.  Though that doesn't seem to be a staff issue; more a fear based on certain customer sectors."
good,"Cabelas is a fast paced, big box, retail environment that prides it's self on customer service. Unfortunately, it requires any time off to be scheduled 30 days in advance, and on the other hand, might put a worker on the schedule with less than 48 hours notice. This makes being a working parent quite difficult. While it does give a great empolyee discount, it doesn't offer the same insentives to all of its employees."
good,"Open 364 days per year, allowing little time for family or recreation.  Typical employee makes just slightly over minimum wage with very high expectations.  Must be senior management position to make a decent income.  As a senior manager it was difficult to maintain a positive attitude with the employees as they feel proper remuneration and benefits were not provided.  They took away discounts an perks which were previously available.  Overall, I personally enjoyed my time there as I had a phenomenal staff and a great department to work in."
good,The people that work at this establishment are very friendly. They will help you to learn anything you need to know about your job. The work environment is also very calm yet orderly and fast paced most times.
good,"The job's not bad. Your position is with one department in the store, so you're focused on specific things inside of the department. Most days, you're working for a full shift, so you get a lunch break. The exception for that is Switchboard. If you work in Switchboard, you usually (I won't say never, because that would be lying) work between four and six hours and get no lunch."
good,"If you like to have fun and talk about the outdoors, this is the place to be. Great staff and enjoyable customers. You are the expert and your job is provide the best customer experience with getting them set up to enjoy the outdoors."
good,I loved working at Cabela's in West Chester Ohio.  I had contact with every single employee and management on a daily basis.  It felt like a family.  Most employees are part time.  I started out working 25-28 hours a week but eventually it dwindled to 12-15 hours a week.  I had to search for a new job when I started being scheduled 6 days a week but for only about 16 hours the whole week.  It was very difficult to leave.  I would definitely work there again if it were guaranteed full time.
good,"There was always something to do. When it is during peak it may be very stressful, but everyone comes together to work. You are able to train in other departments and there are always positions to transfer to."
good,"This was a great place to work, but the pay was not good unless you were in management. If your retired or college just needing a little extra spending money this is a great job to have! But if you are responsible for supporting yourself, get a management position."
good,"It was not hard to make friends here. I would not recommend this job to someone who is extremely progressive or liberal as almost 100% of the people who work here are fairly religious and republican. (Not that there's anything that's wrong with that, just a warning as I'm fairly liberal and had a somewhat difficult time holding my tongue during certain conversations.) If there is a conflict between employees, the GM doesn't care to get to the bottom of things and find a resolution, just goes straight to threatening termination and all it usually is is misunderstanding of events. They also seemed to be in the habit of expecting certain jobs to be done but not giving the employee(s) the necessary means to accomplish said job. My main enjoyment of working for Cabela's was the people that I met. I gained friends and a second family at this store."
good,Business so far has been extremely slow so there is a lot of standing around waiting for something to do. Advertising the club card in the Deli department is next to impossible but the expectation is still placed on these employees.
good,Fast paced always changing environment with outdoor season product sets.  Recently the company was procured by Bass Pro Shops which included management structural changes.
good,I would do background checks on people trying to buy a firearm.  I would also have to make sure the government paperwork would be in order so that Cabelas would not lose their federal licence to sale firearms
good,If they would pay attention to what the associates complain about not being done.  A lot of the things that would save the company in the long run don't seem important as long as the work is done and incentives are at performance.
good,"Great place to work, very fast paced, high energy. "
good,"great place to work! Would definitely recommend a friend or family member to apply there. received great training, and the hours were flexible as i was in school while working there!"
good,"Nice co-workers, very good discounts. you can tell that corporate cares about the employees. Free lunches on occasion. Fairly flexible hours for students."
good,A very good place to work because of the co-workers. Management not so much. You received excellent benefits and employee discounts. The transparency of management left much to be desired.
good,"Very fast paced, pick orders and pack them also.  We do general housekeeping and are expected to make quota on our work.  The hours vary.  Sometimes we work overtime and then some days let go early.,"
good,Enjoyed working with people in an environment where i could teach them so many things about fishing and how to better than chances of becoming a successful hunter/fisherman.
good,"A typical day at Cabelas depends on your position. If you are part time you work 5 hour shifts, number of days depend on expected need. If you work full time, you work an 8 hour shift. Some weekend hours are required. The day is spent helping customers place orders, and if you are a customer service representative, you also help with problems like returning broken or defective merchandise."
good,"A typical day at Cabelas is fast paste, customer orientated."
good,"Cabela's is a great company and a great place to work with lots of benefits. I only wished they paid better. The days can be rather long if the store is slow, and you are standing around a lot, but it does get very busy at times."
good,"The most enjoyable and hardest part of the day is providing customer service to our clients. Cabela's is known for their outstanding customer service and I feel proud to be a part of it. "
good,"co-workers were amazing, job was always fun . management was not the best. very fun place to work and was always something new to experience everyday."
good,"Great place that is well paid for retail. Friendly environment that cares about its employees. However, constantly going through changes so job security is not great."
good,"Cabela's is an awesome company to work for. I have become very knowledgeable with retail, customer satisfaction, working diligently in a fast pace environment, and customer care. Cabela's treats employees with respect and always are giving incentives to push us to do better within the company and ourselves. I enjoy going into work, the people I work with, and management. I am looking for something a little different, even though I love my job I am looking to do something more in office management, accounting, office assistant area. I strive at those things and it's what I love best."
good,"Working part time while in college, they are very flexible to work with your hours. Here I assisted with advanced customer service issues and provided help desk assistance to existing customer service reps."
good,The customer and the coworkers were the best. HR personal was the worst i have ever seen. They do not care about anyone but themselves. the job itself was easy and rewarding.
good,Great atmosphere. Have to move to advance. Not many full time positions. Great job if your spouse works or you are retired. Great outfitters discount.
good,Cabela's seems to have a knack for hiring good people. My biggest concern with the company is their upper-level managers (corporate) are unsympathetic and greedy.
good,"It was a fun environment with plenty of room for advancement. Everybody was friendly and willing to help others out. The hardest part is dealing with disgruntled customers, however it can be rewarding when you use problem solving skills to better their experience."
good,A work place gives opportunities to contribute experience and knowledge to the company.  A fun place to meet cross cultural co-workers and enjoy the challenge.
good,"If you like the Outdoors and helping people connect products with their passions, you will be very happy here.  Not a lot of guidance so you'll need to carve your own path - which is simple if you work hard, evaluate the business and trends."
good,its ok. pays pretty well but the culture is lacking currently due to downsizing and a potential looming takeover. Town is really boring.
good,The most enjoyable part of the jon is all the outfitters I work with. It is a fun atmosphere and Cabela's truly cares about the people who work here.
good,they treated you like family it was fun to work there I like the people. There was a lot to learn and to do. it was a nice place to work and a fun place
good,I was the third employee to be hired there. It use to be a great family orientated company until they changed CEO's and went public with their stocks. In the last 5 years the company has taken allot away from the employee's. And would constantly cry poverty.
good,"It's a great place to work for, but its not some place for career growth. At work I restocked shelves, made sure the back inventory was in order, and cleaning the back at the end of the night."
good,Great experience working with customers but the company cannot keep enough employees due to poor management lead. Definitely one place to work as a start to gain work experience.
good,"I love working at Cabela's. I work in the casual clothing department. I enjoy working with most of my fellow employees. I love helping people find what they're looking for. I go to work, fold, zip and tuck clothes, I complete any projects assigned to me, I help customers, I clean out fitting rooms and returns and put those clothes where they belong. I've learned great customer service skills. I have learned where everything in my department and most of the store is. Management... Most of the managers are great! There are just a few that are not so great. Most of my co-workers are fantastic people who I have befriended. There are just a few people who are just mean or annoying, but that's something I've gotten past. The hardest part of my job is that we are very under-staffed through the whole store, when customers are rude when I'm trying my hardest to be nice, and when I am working with co-workers who won't let me rest. Another thing is I HATE trying to sell the CLUB card.. It seems ridiculous to me that I have to try to sell something to someone that I know close to nothing about and that I wouldn't get myself. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I have satisfied customers and managers."
good,"As manager, I worked between 9-11 hours day. Opening and closing the store. Hardest part was dealing with rescheduling employees to meet the demand of the store and incoming freight."
good,Cabelas educate their employees their goals mission policies. The most important things is how to give legendary customer services. The outfitters are like a big family. Cabelas have different manners to incentive the outfitters good job and recognize their efforts.
good,"I am an Executive Administrative Assistant to the Vice President of Corporate and Marketing Strategies.  I am not just his assistant but the office manager of our department.  I keep regular tabs on supplies, budgets, vacations, meetings, conference room bookings, notes within meetings, organization of Quarterly Reviews and the Executive Yearly Retreat.  I am the face of our department and give my high energy and pleasant personality to all I come into contact with.  Interacting with people is the best part of my job because I have incredible communication and interpersonal skills.  The hardest part of my job is the same routine of the tasks; I am a perpetual learner and desire learning new things."
good,"answer phones, assist customers with paperwork for charge card, assist the bank with customer information, process payments for the charge card, assist customers to find merchandise"
good,Cabelas is a great company to work for. They try to take care of there employees as much as possible. They are very forgiving to there employees as well. They give many chances. Management is great as well they are truly there to help everyone and dont micromanage.
good,There are both slow and fast paced days in the IT field at this job! Everyone is great to work with and are always available to help out if you need it!
good,Cabela's is a really fun place to work. Great co-workers and management staff. Corporate controlled.
good,"Pulling inventory. Stocking."
good,a typical day for me was kinda boring because I was on midnights.I learned how to run forklift and other machines.The managers were pretty cool and knew what they were doing.My co-workers were pretty lazy.The hardest part was working 6 days a week 12 hour mid night shifts.I got to drive on a forklift all night.
good,Cabelas is a great company that encourages you to learn about the product that you are selling.  A typical day is helping the customers and maintaining the department.  I have learned a lot about shoes and all of the other departments from fellow outfitters and customers.  My management listens and they try to do what is right for their employees.  I have a great team that I work and learn with.  The most enjoyable part of the job is all of the stories that I get to hear from all walks of life.  The hardest part is not having everything in stock.
good,"A typical day varies between each individual and department, but the similarties lies within knowing how to maneuver through the Warehouse Management system in almost all departments cause that was a crucial part of getting orders out on time and meet customer satisfaction. "
good,Great place to work...fun. Management great/Outfitters were great...was at opening a fun place
good,"A typical day at work is made up of managing a team of project managers, business analysts, system testers, resource managers and various developers. The facilities are top notch and co-workers are amazing!"
good,Providing great customer service to all customers while working in a Team atmosphere with some great coworkers.
good,G-2 Merchandising is a great company to work for offering flexible hours which allows for work and life balance.
good,"A typical day was unloading trucks, and processing the products into the computer system. My coworkers and management were all good to work with, fun yet capable of getting the job done. The hardest parts were getting up early in the morning and the time limits on unloading containers."
good,I normally start at eight p.m. and work until six a.m. i start my days by getting my machine key and rf gun.Then we have our start up meeting and its time to work.
good,"cabelas is a great place to work. Though sometimes there are middle managers with to much power on there hands. Upper management is great and easy to get along with/talk to. The hours are not bad, Fall and winter is when the most activity happens"
good,The management at the El Paso location was very willing to work my work schedule so that I was still able to work 20-30 hrs while still being a full-time college student.
good,"I'm everyone's GO TO person at customer service, great friends to work with some are like family, Some days are busier than others. MOST managers are fun to work with."
good,Great atmosphere great coworkers just a fun family friendly place to work everyone is there to help each other and not only just to work but have a great time during your shift
good,"Cabela's is a very good company, its like they are your second family. Very good management and very nice co-workers, always have teamwork. If 1 is busy, everybody should be busy."
good,Its outdoor store thathas everything you need. It is a dream store for some people. When you walk in you see all the taxidermy animal all thru the store and they have an aquarium with several fish in it for the customers to watch and see. Staff is friendly and very helpful.
good,"I enjoy working at the Distribution Center in Wheeling WV. I have never been a ""temp service"" type of person so the ""seasonal"" label bothers me but otherwise I like the work and the people I work with. The pay still leaves room for improvement."
good,"Combining experience of Professional producers of outdoor equipment with the Outfitters at the place of employment , you are always meeting new advanced pro staff to help learn about the products that Bass Pro Shops/Cabelas will provide to our customers. I take the overall use of the employment level to the expert and one on one take of the whole experience of being at the store."
good,"Other then the low pay I loved working there. The people are great, it was a pretty low stress job and the dept. heads were very nice. The hardest part was shift work."
good,"Great place to work. Somewhat political as far as, ""who you know."" also, Cabela's is ruled by the point system. No matter how good you are, if you have car problems or days one is late, points are taken off. Once you hit the maximum points, unless you have major medical problems, you are let go. I am still there, but I am at my maximum. I haven't been absent or late in six months, but due to unfortunate circumstances, if I get one more point, I'm gone. Also, I can't apply for or be considered for advancement until January because of the point system. I am a great employee, I am great at sales, get ""star cards"" and win sales contests all the time, but because of the point system, on paper, I look bad. I think there should be ""considerations"" for such circumstances. But, oh well!"
good,The culture and people here are amazing. Working with people who also enjoy the outdoors and similar things is fun all day long. Management isn't the best but at the end of the day it's retail and feels like it.
good,"Everyone helps out. Work 3 days straight, 12 hour shifts then 4 days off . One thing I didn’t like was the split weekends. No real complaints. Typical management/employee knowledge."
good,Most days I will show up and help any customers that need help in the front of the store. When it gets slow I go to the entrance and start to sell the Cabelas Credit card. I am one of the best sellers at this location
good,"The management and people at cabelas are amazing, but the work is very bland, especially when working in backroom.  When I first started working there I was getting too many hours and I am in high school, but a week after I requested less hours they granted me that."
good,It was a great job! I started working there part time and the only reason I left was because I needed full time hours and they didn’t have any full time spots open
good,"Cabela's is the most fun place I have worked so far. It is a straight forward retail environment with plenty of coworkers and customers that are willing to share stories and adventures they/ you have had in the outdoors. If I have one bad thing to say about working here is that unless you get permanent full time, your schedule can go from 5 shifts in the busy season down to two per week."
good,Overall not a bad place to work. I enjoyed my time there An got to learn a lot. But some of the management was very unsure of there roles an how to manage properly. My warehouse manager was great. It was more so the higher up management.
good,Cabela’s offers a great opportunity to help customers with placing orders over the phone as well as assisting customers with problems they may be having.
good,If you're looking for a place to work with like-minded outdoors people it is definitely the place to be. If your willing to work through the bureaucracy of a large box store to advance your career it is a good job.
good,A typical day involves talking to customers to access their needs and sell them the items to fit their needs. Doing background checks for firearms purchases. The hardest part of our job is when we have to tell a customer that we cannot sell them a firearm.
good,"When w/Cabela's prior to merger w/BPS it was a terrific place of employment. hard work, many hours at times but well worth it! Loved it. Stressful at times to be sure but so many great people in several departments! Users of all of their gear and equipment and the amount of Outdoors experience was unmatched in the industry."
good,Great place to work. Nice people to work with. Not a lot of room for growth though. Easy to get along with most people. Very friendly and helpful management.
good,"Before the buyout, Cabela's was a great place to work.  They did a nice job of work/life balance and the pay was very good compared to other companies."
good,I advanced quickly with the company.   Loved the people I worked with.   The atmosphere was wonderful.  Very flexible when it came to family or health issues.
good,It was a close to home job that I worked right out of high-school until I decided what I wanted to do with my life and where I wanted to go. It was a good job from what I remember
good,Cabela's is a great place to work for outdoorsy people or for high school/college students looking for a part-time job. It has flexible hours and they understand if something important comes up.
good,"I greatly enjoy working at Cabela's, though the changes since Bass Pro has taken over are often poorly relayed, which causes challenges.  Management is flexible with schedules, and the work load is reasonable, especially for retail.  The company values their employees and shows this with recognition, financial incentives, and lots of free food.  They are easy going with time requests off, availability, and work restrictions."
good,A typical work day was to unload the trucks and unpack the boxes. Than bring them out to the sales associates for the floor. I would have to scan in the items off the trucks for processing. Management was a great. I learned pretty quickly with the receiving department.
good,"Cabelas was a very nice place to work at.There was a very nice staff and clean and pleasant surroundings. Fun activities,always. I would like to be a rehire at Cabela's. Nice lunch room. Always open to suggstions. Very nice staff. Free popcorn for snacks.I am a former employee of the post office employee in 1970 at Gary, Indiana as a post office clerk,sorting mail."
good,"part-time cashier, not hard. you will stand for four hours and get a fifteen minute break. the other cashiers are fun to chat with and helpful. the clean up at the end of the night is best because you can take stuff up to the bargain cave."
good,Biggest piece of my leaving was that the leadership changed and structure changed. Less opportunity to run a store because they wer scrambling to find stores for regional teams that had no clue how to motivate teams. The culture changed drastically from the one circle to the next and a lot of managers left honestly. Cabelas as we knew it was gone.
good,"It's a good place to work and the staff and management are friendly. Working in Customer Service is pretty quick paced. You go out on the floor, wait for customers and make sure the area is tidy. Handle returns, answer the phone, talk with customers, help customers find the correct department, check out customers."
good,"nice place to work, good people, treated well, stress advancement opportunity, coaching good, management good, i enjoyed my time working at Cabela's. Thanks"
good,"When I first got hired here at Cabela's, I knew nothing about sports or their products. I helped put the store together before they opened and got to learn alot about the probducts, which helped me learn about the depts."
good,"I answered these questions from my perspective as a Cabela's employee before Bass Pro acquired the company. "
good,"very helpful staff, busy holidays, sometimes short staffed which made things at times hard to deal with and trying to keep customers happy. Always seemed things were out of stock."
good,If you enjoy the outdoors then this is obviously a fun place to work. You make friends with coworkers because they share the same passion. I would recommend this company.
good,Easy to balance work and home life.  Quality employees and hard working culture.  Good benefits with a competitive discount plan.  Communication and collaboration between teams.
good,"Started here as a part-time job in college, great work enviornment, but i had to work my butt off in order to rise the corporate ladder, very good set of managers though"
good,It is a good company to work for if you are starting off and if you are looking for a part time job. if you want a full time job i wouldn't reccomend working here.
good,Cabelas was a great company to work for. Very pleasant staff who were helpful. Great atmosphere. Was able to venture into learning new things. If need I would go back.
good,Peak season is very busy but I still liked it.  Most of the bosses there are great and work with you if you need.  Benefits and discounts were awesome.
good,"Most customers that shopped at Cabala's were extremely pleasant to work with. It was always fun to hear about what kind of adventures the customers were about to head out on. I had only a handful of encounters with customer's that were ill mannered and rude. However, my coworkers were amazing. It was a fun work environment and we pulled together as a team."
good,Cabela's is great place to work very supportive of the employee and respectful. Management very friendly and accepting of new ideas which was nice to be able be creative.
good,I enjoyed working at Cabelas.  Fellow workers and management were friendly.  The Friday staff meeting were fun and helpful to get to meet the staff.  I was disappointed that I had to leave.
good,"the fellow employees were always in a cheerful attitude and the customers were always patient, polite and willing to talk...the products were easy to find in the catalogs for both the customers and the employees.. the computers were helpful and hardly had any problems"
good,"Wonderful employees to work with and the best customers on the planet."
good,"Greet everyone with a smile, will show customers where items can be located, keep the front end looking nice, and will make sure the customers had a great experience finding their items or even just looking around."
good,"Fast fun place to work at."
good,In the beginning..there was a manager  opening and an number of employees put in for it...no one had and interview...we later heard that a 18 year old was hired because their mother was a manager....
good,Cabela's asks a lot of its employees but the compensation isn't too bad and the discounts and access to products are great. There are pros and cons and strong personnel and poor personnel as with any workplace.
good,I mostly enjoyed working for Cabela's. I would recommend to a friend seeking a different opportunity. Would like to move up in job responsibilities more often than not.
good,"Typical day of work, is finding product on foot or on pallet truck with RF mini computer scan then pack it in a boxes, use of PC also and working in other areas they send you to sometimes."
good,"Enjoyed working for the consumers who called in for orders and customer service needs."
good,"i was there for over 10 years.  wonderful people to work with. ggod job that taught me many AP skills. i enjoyed my work and was good at it. i started out in dropship, made my way to matcher and later became a problem solver."
good,Contacting Visa cardholders to settle accounts. It was not rare to encounter frustrated cardholders. After working collections I moved to R&A. Here I used coded and ran statistical analysis to gauge the effectiveness of promotions.
good,"Provided excellent customer service, phone management, record keeping, office organization,, involved in leadership, conflict resolution. Time keeping, use Microsoft office, outlook. Product knowledge is key."
good,Working at Cabela's was a fun and great experience. Met a lot of good people with great attitude and working atmosphere. Hardest part of the job will probably finding something to do if days are slow.
good,"Very fun department (packing). Great bosses!!!  Always fun to come to work. Ability to cross train and make your job never dull.  I have worked for a lot of companies and cabelas truly cares about your well being. Like any job,  you do your job and they will take care of you.  I could t be happier where I am at"
good,It was very fun being a fishing sales outfitter for Cabelas. They treat there workers well with solid benefits and discounts. I would recommend anyone to work in the fishing department.
good,"I love seeing my regular customer, unfortunently at the Fort O location management has gone down hill. It's not the same atmosphere I felt when I helped open the store."
good,There is a lack of accountability in the department I work in. Not sure about the other departments. They talk a lot about teamwork but don't seem to live up to what they say.
good,"Good management, friendly co-workers and weekly classes for knowledge on retail product. Definitely makes the job more fun and easy. The most enjoyable part would be making customers and management satisfied. The hardest part would be keeping on top of customer needs in a retail setting."
good,I really loved working at Cabelas. It was a fun environment. And during the holiday season it would get busy but it would be so much fun. And they throw holiday parties and have meetings where they would bring food in and still have fun during the meetings. I really miss working there
good,"I'm not a real outdoorsy individual; however this was a fun, rewarding & motivating place to work. even though I worked 3rd. shift. Even though I was laid off (with 13 other folks) after only 1 year. I'd gladly do it all over again."
good,A typical day at work is just like almost every retail store. I clock in I go to the archery department and I check to see if there are any bows/crossbows I can fix if we got parts. I assist customers I all there archery needs.
good,Loved working there fun enviroment loved the people and bosses they truly cared about their employees needs and made sure they were well taken care of
good,"I worked in the Hunting and Firearm group. I did not work behind the gun counter. I was involved in all the other items for hunting, not archery equipment."
good,A typical day at work began with your feet hitting the ground running . I learned new things every day. Management was considerate and always willing to help. It was high energy and high impact and made me not want to go home at night. The hardest part of the job for me was the training on safety and regulations. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with such fantastic customers.
good,"I learned a lot while working at Cabelas.  The employees really live the outdoors, camping, fishing and hunting lifestyle.  Working with the guests and customer was great too, there were always great adventure stories.  Working here helped mold me into a better outdoors person."
good,"Nice people, great culture, no pressure, good work-life balance, good customer service, lovable peers, good management, fun place to work at."
good,Cabelas is a Fun place to work. Unloading Product from trucks and stocking it to the floor. The hardest part of the job was having to tell a customer we were out of stock on a product after they drove from out of town.The most enjoyable part was finding Merchandise that was compatible to what the customer was looking for and the Customer leaving very Satisfied.
good,"The day at work going by very fast,"
good,"Customer Service"
good,cabelas is a fun place to work good employees and employers we have BBQ and other events to make the work day fun great discount as well
good,"alot of walking ,learned how to pull orders,pack,receive product in,the management was good some of them knew you by first name,the heat,working with new people"
good,"I really liked it here. It was a lot of fun being in the environment, and being with other people who also share your hobbies and interests. Like any job there are good co-workers and bad ones. Although, even the bad ones help you out when you need it. Like any retail job, it can get stressful when they are busy. At times you could have up to 6 people asking completely different questions at the same exact time, with all of your co-workers also having the same problem, so you would not be able to get any help if you needed it. The best thing about the job would be the discounts."
good,Cabela's is a good place to work.  They believe in work/life balance and support their employees.  The opportunity to work with and for interesting people is great.  Overall a great company.
good,"I enjoy working for them.  The atmosphere is great.  I enjoy researching and purchasing used firearms."
good,A typical day would be providing the best customer service possible. I learned how to use equipment that Cabeals used. My Co-workers and I became more like family as time went on and I am still in contact with most of them. Hardest part about the job is trying to convince people to apply for the credit cards and the most enjoyable part of the job is making sure everyone in my line went home with a smile on their faces.
good,"It's okay, my only complaint is that the open availability policy is bogus. They are flexible in the schedules but when it comes to wanting more hours or wanting to make up for lost hours because you were sick, it is impossible."
good,"Very fast paced.  Sometimes more costumers than even an experienced associate could handle.  If you can handle the stress, or thrive on it, it makes for an exciting work environment."
good,"Great Place to work, everyone is fun and nice.  everyone that works there is like family. Great place to learn about new things and great way to go out and learn about the outdoors.  If you like cooking, camping, hiking. fishing, hunting, trapping and shooting its a great place to expand what you know."
good,A typical day at work includes answering calls and helping customers place orders. My co-workers are  a great bunch of people who help out when needed. Management is willing to sit down with each individual and go over things that need worked on in a positive way. The hardest part of my job is obtaining from the customer what it is that they need. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I can assist someone and make their day a little brighter.
good,"Totally new experience! An amazing amount of talented individuals, worked to many weekends. For the most part it was a good Life skills position!"
good,It was nice to work with a big company and to learn about it. Management was great. They cared about their employees. Loved the people I worked with. Very positive energy. Most customers were nice to work with.
good,I learend lots  of skills for customer service.There was really good management.Company provide all kind of training what i need.
good,"A typical day at work would be putting away a truck , taking three breaks . The most enjoyable part of the day to me is when everyone that's there at 10:00thats the people you will be working with for the night the hardest part is when you get back of your lunch break some people sleep an has to wake up"
good,"Fun workplace, but can be stressful at times. Overall, a very flexible place to work with good compensation. The training opportunities are excellent."
good,Cabela's is a very family orriented company to work for. They understand that life happens. I work in the Wheeling store and everyone there is wonderful.
good,"I honestly like Cabelas, the company is very good to their employees. The only reason i am looking for a new job is because i need a job that pays a little more and has more hours. During season you get plenty of hours but off season is different. You're lucky to get 40 hours on off season and i can't live off of that. The job is a job that isn't for everybody but it is a job for me. I love what i do and would really like a job in this field of work."
good,"Pretty much what you'd expect from a call center. Some monotony, tedium, the occasional really angry caller, and semi-competent management. The supervisors are all nice and approachable, but are limited in how much they can or will do. Compensation is nothing special, but is solid. You meet and talk to a lot of interesting people during call transfers and downtime, and that's by far the best part of the job."
good,"Making sure our customers received the best customer service and the best quality of food. "
good,A typical day here would be a meeting every day before we start work. And making sure everything is done correctly. I learned how to operate a forklift and order picker.
good,"Cabela's is an awesome place to work, they care about employees."
good,"I loved working for this company, we were all very close, almost like family. No favorites or anything like that. Typical day was to stock and off load trucks. I learned alot with this company, from talking to customers and doing orders to stocking shelves correctly. Management was awesome very friendly and always had your back. Co workers were like family and still are. Hardest part of the job was holiday times, it got very hectic. Most enjoyable part of my job was the people i got to meet and the friends that i made"
good,"I was a consultant.  Headquarters based in Sidney, NE.  I was brought on board to build out newly created office in Denver.  I was also awarded the VP of appreciation.  First consultant to receive this award."
good,Working for Cabela's was like working with family. Everyone was very close and worked well together to get the job done. I was always able to get time off to attend family functions as long as I gave advanced notice.
good,"The in store Senior Management team is fantastic. Fun and exciting culture. Opportunity for advancement. However they are getting too big for their perceived internal culture. From the corporate standpoint, the Outfitters used to be top priority. Not anymore. Corporate directors no longer care about the quality of people the company employs. They quality of people that work the floor and at store level are what keep the customers coming back again and again; the exceptional customer service. They are doing away with knowledgeable employees and taking warm bodies instead. They will become Walmart before you know it. It's very sad to watch."
good,"Typical day at work is taking and making phone calls to verify potential fraudulent charges. Supervisors and Team leaders are awesome to work with. Office and cubicals are newly remodeled. Break room has TV's, video games and a pool table. Awesome break room."
good,I really enjoyed working with all the employees at Cabela's.  They are a great group of people with high level of integrity
good,"Great place to work, I learned a great deal of what customer service is actually about.Customer interactions and how management works within a retail business."
good,"Working at the distribution center for cabelas was te best job I ever had. It was fast, fun and paid great. The work is always easy and the management was a blast to work for. The supervisor was a great guy, never yelling or getting mad, willing to help and teach. Fun to talk with at breaks and actively kept moral up by laughing and telling jokes. "
good,Helping customers with the purchase of products.  I learned a lot about outdoor sports.
good,"The people that work at Cabela's are a great bunch of people to work with.  They do a great job at creating a place where their workers can balance family and work life.  If you like spending time on the phones talking to customers, then this is the job for you."
good,"Typrical day at work involves daily openening and closing duties, multiple levels of discipline are needed to succeed.  Multi tasking and strong organizational skills are essential.  Strong backgroung in personel management are used daily.  Understanding of all levels of accounting/finance are essential for position."
good,Cabelas is a great place to work if yo need a prt time or seasonal job. Management is very flexible in helping employees balance work and family.
good,"I have learned a lot about my self and other people."
good,"I am in school and I have a young child, they are very easy on my schedule because they are aware of that I have a family. My typical day consist of doing background checks, inputting information into the computer, cleaning up, and alot of customer service. My co-workers are very delightful to work with, and my managers are very understanding and yet tuff on us. "
good,"Cabelas in Gonzales, LA is a fun place to work. It is always busy with a lot going on. As a company they have a great value system and most of the outfitters (employees) care about where they work. The management staff is very easy going and easy to get along with. As with all retailers they tend to have a lot of short term employees. "
good,I learned how to slow down and do the job right.
good,"Depending on the shift, mostly put away stock in the morning and get everything ready for the day, if you close you come in and help your coworkers service the customers with questions and finding product or explaining techniques to further their endeavors in the outdoors. I learned many things, including merchandising, how to help customers, different company policies and procedures, etc... Management is willing to help if you ask, or they notice something needs done. My co-workers are almost like family to me, the hardest reason to think about moving up or out."
good,"Started out as an hourly outfitter, promoted sereral times to a Senior Manager. Learned a lot about myself as a manager and what is needed from the people who you are overseeing. Most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with co-workers and customers in an outdoor (hunting, fishing, camping) environment. Hardest part of the job was long hours behind a desk."
good,Got to travel to numerous retail stores and gain a better understanding of retail operations.
good,"I have learned so much! From how the backend works with recieving products and backstocking, to working out on the floor to help customers and learn from my fellow employees. I have learnd more and more about the products that we carrry. CO workers are great because I learn something new everyday."
good,"My time here at Cabela's was great. The benefits were suitable, the pay was helpful, and the staff and management alike were like family. It seemed however that when you get the ""crowd favorite"" telling lies however, that everyone believes her, thus how I lost my job there"
good,Its a retail business like Sports Acadmey. The food was both exotic and domestic.
good,Great place to work I would work there gain in a heartbeat. The wage for a part timer stays the same neither decreases nor increases. If you have beliefs of any kind dont share them for you will be ridiculed and management won't do anything about. Other that I was respected and give lots of hours.
good,"I loved Cabelas. The customers are almost always happy to be there so for retail it's not so bad. Loved my manager in club, he was super friendly and understanding. Most management there was the same. Coworkers were always fun, overall just a super fun place to work. They were super flexible with my availability, too. Only downside is pushing club on all customers. Not that bad but customers get annoyed if too many people have asked them the same question during their visit."
good,Great benefits & culture. Enjoyed the atmosphere and the Team. Great participation in the community. Great service culture. Great benefits and I enjoyed my time there.
good,The environment of the place is such a family atmosphere. it may get stressful sometimes but that's going to be with anywhere you go. I am a current employee and I have progressed so much in this company in just the last year. I started as just a part time employee and maybe only two months after I started I got changed to full time by working my butt off. Then just recently I hit my year and two weeks before that I got promoted to a lead. there is opportunity to grow in the company you just have to work for it because they don't just hand out higher positions to anyone.
good,Around the winter months it gets very slow and your hours get cut severely but in the summer it's a food place to work. Very busy and fast paced good management and benefits.
good,"Cabelas has changed a TON since BPS bought cabelas out. Cabelas merchandise is very slowly dying out and BPS is shipping their stuff to stores like forest fires. "
good,"Work was good"
good,The company really respected work/life balance.  When I lost my husband unexpectedly in 2014; this became a very crucial piece for me as I was a only parent to a 13 month old and taking care of a farm and cattle.
good,everyone there is a blast to work with and all very much love there job and helping customers. The items sold are very high quality and very reasonably priced. they take very good care of there employees
good,"I would not have left my position at Cabela's but after the merger with Bass Pro, my position was no longer needed.  The hardest part of my job was working with others that were not team players,"
good,"job is relatively easy. in the warehouse you will be asked to unload freight, replenish merchandise to the floor, do customer rushes, and help with customer pick ups. some lifting is required and the use of power equipment is needed as well. overall it is not too demanding, but you will have to communicate and focus on details. I would recommend to anyone looking to get experience in a warehouse or someone who is looking for entry level work."
good,Cabela's always gave you a challenge and helped you achieve the challenge as needed.  Always promoted enterprise wide collaboration   and innovation.Coworkers were kind respectful and knowledgeable in      their field of expertise and willing to share their knowledge.
good,Was a positive place to work and if you enjoy retail and the outdoors there discounts on their products were excellent.  Good management and the workers were friendly.
good,"enjoyable place to work, fast paced making sure to get trucks unloaded and merchandise checked in in a timely manner and to the warehouses to be shipped out"
good,"Most employees at Cabela's are pleasant and fun to work with.  They seem to be happy with their jobs.  A typical day includes helping people find the gear they need to do an outdoor adventure."
good,Cash duties were keeping tills clean and organized. Keep your paperwork organized and stocked. Also keep up on bag supply. Fill coolers and candy. At customer service you would help out with returns/exchanges and purchasing. Also had to sell licenses for hunting and fishing. Managers had their good and bad days. Hardest part of the job was to try and find staff to come in if someone got sick. The most enjoyable part was sharing stories and laughs with customers.
good,"Cabela's was an amazing place to work.  Once Bass Pro bought the company, it became more clear that our future was very uncertain with having two buying offices.  I did not intend to leave Cabela's and was intending to retire there."
good,"Cabela's is a fun and great place to work,  Our team environment is one of the best.  People are always willing to led a hand outside of the work force. Cabela's is very diversified place to work."
good,"Fun place, fun products, wonderful customers and a great outdoor spirit.  I enjoyed my time at Cabelas.  I learned a lot about the products.  The clients are loyal and the atmosphere is fun."
good,"Cabela's has a great work/life balance and are very flexible when it comes to working nights and time off.  Day in the life at Cabela's is assisting on cash when required, slow time is January, February and March, so we don't have the hours and the Leads (Supervisor's) are helping on cash.  I am responsible for doing the weekly schedules and my husband works away a lot so they are flexible when the time comes as we have a little man at home.  They have a fun work balance, but know when to be serious.  The hardest part about the company, is that there is not much room to move up, as the management team don't transfer and growth."
good,"Surrounded by talented peers."
good,"Company was fine. Job was seasonal. Breaks were a good length and compensation was good. Company schedules far in advance giving plenty of time to adjust personal schedule or work schedule if need be,"
good,"I provide employee status to the managers early in the morning.This is mostly call outs. This is kept on a spreadsheet, throughout the day and includes the reason for the call out, this part is kept confidential."
good,Cabela's is a great company with a great history.  Not bad working for a company whose sole purpose is to provide products so that their customers can enjoy the great outdoors and the lifestyle that many of them pursue.
good,Fun place to work. Management is going through some changes. Great co workers and they make the place a fun place to work.
good,I've only been here a few weeks as a contractor so I won't say much. Small town atmosphere and values. Family oriented with good work/life balance. Lots of taxidermy in the office! They need to pay contractors a lot of money to motivate us to come this far. Discounts at their stores.
good,"Clocked in, went to station, did inventory and replenishment, front faced, cleaning, customer service, product repair, break,continue previous tasks, lunch, continue previous tasks, clock out and end of day chores."
good,"Prepping food, making fudge, and taking orders is usually what involves a typical day at work. I have learned more about the food industry and the do's and don'ts. The management is new and just getting into the swing of things, excited to see what's to come. The really is no hard part about the job. The most enjoyable part is going to work with people you get along with."
good,Learned how to operate heavy machines at a fast pace and also becareful. Learned how the company is ran with good work ethics
good,"Lots of product knowledge, as well as fun and productive employees."
good,Don't have anything bad to say about this company. Good company to work for
good,Cabelas has great co-workers a great support system and management is very good at answering any questions and being helpful. the only downside i can say was that i was working at a place with a lot of high dollar items and it is very easy to spend a paycheck there.
good,Start work at 4am unload the truck full of freight scan all the product to receive it in to our system. Break down all the freight and then put it in carts and work it out to the floor. What ever that does not go out to the floor take back to the warehouse and back stock the freight. I love working early shifts so I can get out at a decent time. I love working with other people in the morning.
good,If your an outdoors person the atmosphere is like no other and almost every one is experienced in there area to help anyone out
good,"It is a pleasure to work there, but not if you a part time employee with a family, hard to get a full time position. as much money as that place makes, it could pay a hell of a lot better, med,dent,eye, not to bad..."
good,I learned alot about how to work with others in any situation. The most enjoyable thing about the job was the people I worked with. The hardest part was the long hours during peak season and not knowing when you would be done for the night.
good,I was a cashier but even that was a fun position. I was only seasonal though and they happened to not keep me on after
good,"Enjoyed working and helping customers , applied my product knowledge to help customers. Stocked product, displayed product did demos."
good,Cabela's was an awesome employer with great benefits and compensation.  The culture and opportunity were amazing and it was filled with amazing people.
good,"the [lace is really productive busy place never board there always something to do "
good,"They work well with students and two managers there are beyond amazing. There is a lot of issues at Corporate and can be a very drama filled area within the store at times, but made so many friends there and was super fun at times. Great if you want to experience things you have never experienced before and to work with great people while you are attending school."
good,"I worked out back in the warehouse (supply chain). The management are really good with their empolyes. Like working right along with them. If you enjoy hunting, fishing or anything out doors then Cabela's is the place for you"
good,"This was a decent place to work, I never had any trouble with other workers or management. The work days were filed with fun, some days I was sad to go home."
good,I loved working here it was a great job for being in retail. everyone there was so friendly and nice. if anything ever came up with yourself the managers would always understand  and get something fixed for you.
good,I enjoyed the type of people that came through my till. Everyone seemed to really enjoy working their as I did. They are very focused on keeping everything running smoothly which I love.
good,"great place to work made a lot of friends and great bosses, short breaks great people to work for. The peak season is crazy but it slows down eventually."
good,"Cabelas is one of those jobs where if you love anything outdoors, the job will provide all the joy in the world for you. I would highly recommend this job to anyone who loves Hunting, Fishing and pretty much anything you could think about outdoor wise."
good,"I enjoyed working at Cabela's.  All of my coworkers were very intelligent on a lot of outdoor matters.  We each had our specialties, and we each had our weaknesses on certain subjects."
good,Everyone is very friendly and great work environment. Lacking in some benefit areas and pay on the lower end of the scale.  If you are a hard worker promotions and opportunities come fast which makes up for the lower starting wage.
good,"If you like the outdoors and the type of people it attracts, then working here will be great. Customers and some coworkers can get on your nerves, but at the end of the work day I did my job and had fun with it. Also, lunch is really cheap at the deli for employees."
good,"I took on a cashier position for the holiday seasons. It was a very busy place to work, but both the customers and my fellow employees were very nice people. Would recommend to anyone looking for something similar."
good,"Great overall experience. Work with a lot of great people and the work is not hard. Really enjoy my work. Breaks are nice, two 20 minute paid breaks per shift."
good,This Job is a great choice for anyone who values customer service and shares a passions for the outdoors. Cabelas demands legendary customer service from each and every employee how ever in training they give you very helpful tips on how to accomplish this.
good,"Cabelas is a great place to work. Amazing people! Most everyone is hardworking and is passionate about the outdoors. i learned alot about the retail industry i did not know about, as this was my first retail oppourtunity. Just show up to work, work hard, and give every customer that comes in that legendary customer service."
good,"My co-workers are a blast to work with. I was able to utilize my skills from previous jobs. Nobody stabs anybody in the back, unlike some of my previous jobs. All in all its one of the best jobs I've had."
good,Cabela's works hard to develop and produce the next generation of management. They offered in store development and training to aide me in becoming a better manager.
good,"Due to my ability to show understanding of the systems in place, I was entrusted with the development and restructure of an aspect of the store operations. This oportunity is unheard of at other companies I worked for. Cabela's ability to allow hourly supervisors the ability to undertake projects like this is a wonderful aide in ones professional development."
good,"Great place to work everyone is very helpful and managers are nice."
good,Fun place to work with good people and good managers but they only hire part time employees and do not give you enough hours to make a living.  Would be an awesome place to work if they hired full time and pay was a little better.
good,Working at Cabelas is nothing less than FUN!!!  The management team is great to work with.  Systems technology for the retail environment is the latest and greatest.  Co-Outfitters work together as a cohesive team!
good,Very good way to get a feel for cashiering. It had it's good days and it's bad day. but overall it was a big enjoyment for everyone.
good,"good just started,good training with good support afterwards"
good,"When I first work for Cabala's I was hired as a seasonal Elf for their Santa photo booth. My Co-workers were friendly and the managers were respectful and helped out whenever I was in need of assistance. I give Cabela's a positive experience overall, Great for first time employees."
good,The employees are very friendly and helpful. They really make the work environment better. The employees at Cabelas make working there so great and fun.
good,It is a great place to work.  The benefits are great too!  They make sure that the employees are taken care of and appreciated.  The manager will set up coaching sessions to better skill you on areas that need improvement or time to teach you new things.  They do allow overtime during certain times; however not all of the time.
good,was only working their for a seasonal position as a fishing outfitter but I enjoyed every moment of working their. staff were always their to help and decent working hours.
good,"Cabelas staff was great so was management! it was a very relaxed, comfortable place to work at. Everyone is super friendly. I definitely recommend Cabelas to those who love the outdoors!"
good,"I learned many jobs as a Cabela's employee.  I learned sorting, pitching, fork lift. I learned how to go all around and pick all different products and where they was located"
good,"Very friendly environment, with great management. Typical work day included morning meeting to discuss sale goals for the day. Then tasking until customers needed help. Very customer first company."
good,"Cabela's Canada is the greatest retail job I have ever had. Management, coworkers and the general atmosphere is great. My only issue is the wage, if the wage was hire I would not be currently looking for a new job."
good,well I am leaving alike quitting because I am moving out and pregtant..
good,Fantastic work place with great scenery with a great co workers. Lots of room to grow! You actually get to have one on one time with the customer to really create growth and awareness.
good,Learned all different areas jobs and stayed very busy at all times. I enjoyed working with all the employees and managers.
good,"Good place to work, company seems to care for their employees, the only con I know of is they don't have enough hours for their employees."
good,"Workday was very automated, answered incoming phone calls from clients in call center environment."
good,I enjoyed taking these calls and helping people with their orders and all other staff employees and management was friendly
good,"I quite enjoy working here, they are very good with schedules. The team is pretty awesome. Easy to talk to managers if there's any issues. Everyone is pretty easy going."
good,I love how everyone treat cares to us and fun meeting before opening the store. Everyone show their positive attitudes to help customers on what their needs and coworkers as well. They always willing to cover your shift if you call in sick.
good,Oriented Warehouse Associate With Over 3 Years Experience In All Warehouse    Departments. Proficient In Machine Operation And Efficiently Complete All Tasks
good,"always had extra hours available. alot of cross-training. management was great and friendly, easy to talk too. staff was friendly. learned to use micosoft excel and power point. taught me to sell credit cards. "
good,"Seasonal was great, very busy. Couldn’t leave at end of shift until each department was checked and walked through "
good,"Unload trucks in the afternoon, come in early mornings to place the product on the floor. Opportunity to gain experience using bailer, compactor, forklift, work assist vehicles, along with the basic retail skills. Teamwork and communication is a heavy factor of the job."
good,"i went from cashier days to graveyard warehouse worker. the company is very family oriented, and actually care how you are doing at your job,"
good,Really enjoyed working here everyone coworkers/managers/even customers were genuinely nice. The bad would have to be hrs part time gets usually 15 to 20 hrs a week
good,Was a great place to work until Bass pro bought out Cabela's. Loved working in the corporate office was laid back and family oriented. i would not recommend any one trying to get a job there as many don't believe there will be a cabela's soon.
good,"start day putting merchandise on sorting trays, then went to packing. had to put boxed together by picking what one to use to put order into, match box size to order. print packing label and seal, put on conveyor to shipping. very fast work pace and i really enjoyed working for them."
good,"I was laid off with only one days notice. I was not very impressed. But I loved working there. My co-workers were very friendly. It was not an extremely demanding position compared to working in a kitchen. So, it was a relatively laid back job. But it was enjoyable being face to face with customers for a change."
good,"Has been bought by Bass Pro Shop  atmosphere is in the processing of changing . I Wish the new  management good luck."
good,"I like the job, I like some of the people I work with and I love dealing with different customers each day. In my store I don't feel like there is an availability to move up: there are favorites and it is apparent. Also I signed up for the health benefits as a part timer and got screwed so don't do that."
good,"Starting when it first opened, it had an entirely different feel than how it is now. They need to pay better so they can keep knowledgeable staff on to assist customers."
good,work at your own pace to handle call volume. scheduled your own hours and breaks. clocked yourself in and out and had to keep up with call volume. training was quick and easy.
good,Love the customers enjoy hearing bout their experience in the outdoors. Like how the company helps people with disability's an make their dreams come reality
good,If you do a great job and are a great employee it doesnt hold alot of weight at this particular store. You have to be in good with the HR to get anywhere and if she doesnt like you then she waits on an opportunity to get you out of there. I felt racism is a big issue there as well
good,"Salary is not good, but it is the same across Retail. "
good,"As a college student working part time, this was an excellent opportunity to gain more knowledge of the sports that I enjoy. Most of the management staff that I worked with is no longer employed by this company, and I was dissuaded from exploring further opportunities since my college education would give me better options."
good,"Took the job in order to get my foot in the door.  Was way overqualified for the position.  Most of the employees and manager are adequate.  Culture in the store is low to poor at the moment with Bass Pro Shop's taking over.  A lot of redundant and unnecessary processes, trying to fix things that aren't broken."
good,It was great just got really slow after the Holidays. Then I did a volunteer job helping a gas company in the area through Cabela's really succeeded at that for about 3 weeks. Then went back to my regular schedule in April and it was very slow made for a very long day.
good,"Great company, remote corporate location made it difficult to attract best talent. Good old boy system of management."
good,"Store level, its a great company. Its great working around things that you love to do in your personal time. There is always something that needs done, so its easy to stay busy and focused. Always a fun place to be and work!"
good,"very laid back work environment "
good,"Great discounts, fun people to work with.  Most managers are less than personable, but the other employees make it fun.  Discounts increase the longer you stay"
good,Large Corporate environment with room to grow.  Work life balance not always a focus of the company. Long hard hours in a company that has cut a lot of vested positions.
good,It was productive and I loved my job.I learned about different types of computers. great co-workers. the hardest part of my job was learning a new system on the computer.best part was the letters from the customers! A typical day is getting your station and open the first package and read what the customer wanted done with the item returned.
good,"During the summer of 2017, I worked as an intern at Cabela's. My internship was a positive work experience. I had several mentors who guided me with the daily operations and I got to work with computer related technology."
good,i had worked in so many warehouse jobs and its something that i would be enjoying working i had very good exprince in warehouse and working on loading and unloading from trucks
good,I love the environment at Cabelas. My coworkers are very kind and inclusive. It feels like a family and I would definitely recommend working for this company.
good,"I worked in the shipping department. I had to pack boxes for shipment. It was fun, but you were on your feet all day. It was just a seasonal job. I got along well with the people I worked with."
good,Cabela's is a great company to work for. Always gave the the tools to do my job well and quickly. Management was always around to help and teach. Very good company.
good,"I wish I would've never left this job! The people I worked with were amazing. I prefer to work with customer over the phone than in person. This is a great job to advance with, the opportunity just did not present itself to me."
good,"Gun sales, and background reviews and checking. Best part of the job is talking with like minded people. Hardest part of the job is working long hours."
good,Outdoor retail industry with a great culture.  Currently under acquisition by another company so future is a little bit in limbo.  Over all has been a great place to work.
good,"Great work environment, and leadership, worked there most of my college career, but feel a lot has changed since changing over from cabelas to bass pro."
good,I actually loved my job. It wasn't until the changes started happening that I had any problems. Loved everyone I worked with and for. everyone got along and the customers where the best.
good,"When I got hired I started out as a normal customer service outfitter. Two weeks later the GM of the store pushed to make me one of the leads. Once I became a lead my manager pretty much took me under her wings and showed me everything she could. I learned how to read certain reports. I learned how to add information from the reports until the corporate page. I learned a whole new system on how  to look things up. Eventually, I learned how to do the a very important every day roll. I learned how they did the deposits and how the paperwork and reports are very important everyday. I was showed everything to take her spot when it was time for my manager to move up in the company."
good,The people were great as well as the environment. I had a lot of good times and would go back if i lived closer. it helped with my people skills and was overall good
good,Rarely a slow day. The management was gave good clear instructions and also push us to meet goals in sales. Goes by a great family base culture. Hardest part of the job was standing the whole shift.
good,Cabelas is a good place to work for a college student. doing the same thing can get old but for a temporary person with no skills its alright  great place to work
good,"Very helpful coworkers; everyone is willing to help one another in order to keep the store running efficiently, even if it includes doing work outside their job description"
good,I worked as a customer service representative taking inbound phone calls.  It was challenging and fast paced.  It was rewarding to be of service and assist each customer with whatever issue they may have had.
good,"Cabelas is a good employer."
good,"I sold at least 5 firearms daily, cleaned and maintained the displays and display models. I learned differences in ammo loads, optics, cases, firearms, and extra accessories for different types of firearms. Management was fun, helpful and flexible. My coworkers were knowledgeable and entertaining and make work an exciting place. The hardest part of my job was to up sell the product and the most enjoyable part of my job was the recognition for sales."
good,It is what you make of it . Co workers are fun and good to deal with . Meeting new Customers and seeing them get what they want. Every day is a new day
good,"wonderful place to work, they clearly care very much for their employees.  Customers on average we not that terrible.  wonderful environment in general."
good,I really enjoyed working here and am sure had i not moved out of state I would still be working here. pick sort and pack customer orders for shipping. Management was amazing. Co workers were very freindly and helpful.
good,I loved working at cabela's. Working there provided me with new skills and also enhanced some of my skills such as customer service and problem solving.
good,"Cabela's is a great place to learn about all sectors or retail/online sales."
good,"Cabelas was a great place to work for, I moved all across the country for them.  I managed up to 220 employees at a time.  I built a lot of great relationships during this time.  The toughest part of my job was getting things from our corporate office to run our business the way we needed."
good,It was a fun place to work however I would say that the management needed to be improved. Constantly changing and having issues with competitiveness. Their are some very catty women in positions here that need to be more professional and respectful.
good,"Great place to work, laid back, casual attire, great people, great managers, great support, great benefits.  It has been a fantastic experience, and I could not ask for more from a first job."
good,I would unload the stock trucks each week and also assist with warehouse organization. I would also put merchandise on the floor if they needed to be restocked.
good,Cabela's CLUB Visa is an outstanding employer.  I enjoyed the support and encouragement that leadership displayed.  The core purpose that the CLUB shares with Cabela's is a true example of a family oriented company.
good,Being a deli outfitter has its challenges but rewarding at the same time. I can depend on my fellow outfitters to help when needed.
good,"A typical day at work, since I was one of the people who worked full time, would be me starting off with unloading a truck of pallets, and then loading them into the warehouse before the store even opened. Then when the store opened, I was taking care of customers in the footwear department, running and getting sizes they needed and ordering online if needed."
good,"Great Store, Great place to work! Very fast pace, very educational"
good,"Handling customer issues via phone and in person, all cash/credit/debit sales and transactions for both in-store purchases as well as online purchases, taking phone calls, filling store orders for purchases to be shipped out to customers, selling hunting and fishing licenses in accordance to state and local laws."
good,"Fun Work Environment, Slow Paced Just Enough Amount Of Work. Co-Workers Were Amazing Very Easy To Communicate With. I Enjoyed Working At My Own Pace Long As Everything Got Completed"
good,A typical day at Cabela's is great!! You never get bored listening to stories told by the customers and co-workers. I learned so much more about the out doors than what i already knew. My co-workers were great whenever I needed help they were always there to help. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with all the new product. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I helped that customer with his/her needs.
good,Store is kept clean and tidy. All employees I've talked with were always friendly and very helpful if i got stuck on something.
good,"Place is crazy, horrible leadership and no managers that actually care. back stabiing to the fullest degree."
good,i loved making people happy and giving them exactly what they want.
good,"Went in picked out items for catalog orders, scan product to but the sku sticker on the product and put in tote. Co-workers was friendly management was good."
good,My work includes reporting/solving errors/working on cycle counts.
good,"Cabela's is an excellent company to work for, I enjoyed my time there and was sad to leave when I graduated college and moved away."
good,Its a great place to work but the pay is not the greatest. the store manager is awesome.
good,"Worked my way from cashier to a certified gun inspector. My co workers were always pleasant, fun to be around and hard working"
good,Pick orders out of stock send the order to packing to packed up and sent out .
good,"It starts out as though they are very family oriented and as though they are very flexible...well they are if you are ""one of the guy"" or until you say no to being over worked and severly underpaid for the expectations placed on you. Don't ever think you will be hired for the position you applied for because in the end you are expected to work everywhere and be able to do everything. The promise to have every weekend off is a HUGE lie. There is not enough staff because they keep quiting. Management is a joke and and look forward to a 10 to max 50 cent raise/hr after a year of working your tail off if you do as you are told. Most staff are ok but the gossip and talking behind backs is over the top especially in the customer service area. This company makes a HUGE HUGE profit and will not pay accordingly and will not hire staff to help all of us who are severly overworked. This company does not care about it's employees one bit. Someone said it in another comment.. The owners of Cabelas' should be sad and ashamed that they allow this to happen. You want quality workers then treat ALL of them the same."
good,Great on breaks. Great on pay. good expierinces. Vacation is great.
good,"I worked at Cabelas from 2016 to 2018. Overall, I enjoyed the people I worked with as they were professional and nice. I learned much about camping and outdoor life as well as working in a warehouse."
good,"Fun place to work. Pay is rather low. The managers were good. The only reason I left was because of low pay, and having to work holidays. I would consider going back, if the pay was better."
good,"Working there was great, made new friends and always enjoyed seeing the regular customers come in to chat. I would love to work back in the fishing department but they were unable to secure the position."
good,"Co-workers are reliable. Management are approachable. Hardest part about the job was the hours. Loved the work I did, researching Inventory variables."
good,Cabela's is a great place to work.  Work/life balance was good.  Compensation was not all that great.  Not much room for advancement at all especially since Corporate continually cuts jobs.
good,There are many great outfitters working at Cabelas.  Everyone is so dedicated to making this store a success.
good,"Its an a nice place to work.I start each day checking my areas are kept full of supplies,cleaned as well."
good,"This was by far my favorite job I have ever worked at. The management and other employees made that job amazing. And the customers were great. The atmosphere of the job, and the type of customers the store brought in, were great."
good,"At Cabelas it is a one green roof work place. Meaning we all work together to get our jobs done. We work hand and hand with the customers, truck drivers and vendors. We are strategic and love to win. We have won what we call ""Club Maddness"" three years in a row.Which no other store has ever done. We did that by working together as a team and making it happen. There is nothing our team cant do."
good,Always a relaxed environment. Only stressful during certain events and/or days. Competitive pay. Super friendly people and management would work with you to the furthest extent.
good,Great for people who love the outdoors like camping fishing and hunting. Great deals and overall fun place to visit.Also they are now paired with Bass pro so that is a plus in itself.
good,"Good place to work, very friendly outfitters, fun things to do. lots of activities for families to enjoy on the weekend. Nice conference rooms for meetings and parties. Oh let's not forget about the delicious food cooked. Homemade gumbo, soups, and salads. Wild burgers, poboys, and club sandwiches. They offer daily specials foe a reasonable price."
good,Cabela's was the most fun workplace I've been at. It was laid back and relaxed most of the time. The coworkers weren't uptight and most the managers actually worked the sales floor as well.
good,"I just began working at Cabelas and everyone has been more than happy to help me in every way possible. Though I do not know many people yet, I feel comfortable asking questions to any coworker."
good,The store is really fun to work in. The pay and hours were perfect for what I was looking for. It had its moments that were frustrating but that comes with any job you get.
good,"Loved meeting and assisting customers from all over the world.  Co-workers were great!!  Loved my manager."
good,"A typical day of work was you badged in the security system then you punched in at your scheduled shift went back grabbed your scanned gun and then punched in on your scan gun, Then after that you grab a cart and your boxes then you go retail filling basically you shop for the customers."
good,"A day at work for me, is just standing at a cash register. It can get pretty boring, when we are slow, and when we are busy it's ridiculous how much we have to get done. I learn new stuff everyday, how to help customers more and more, and how to handle different situations. The hardest part of the job, is trying to keep busy when not busy. I enjoy interacting with new customers everyday, and helping them along the way!"
good,"Generally a fun company to work for, especially if you love the outdoors. Advancement is not very easy unless you have an ""in"" with the management."
good,Cashier - checking customer out and answering questions about products.
good,"no jobs available"
good,I loved working for Cabela's in the DC Department. I did Autobox where you were to pack yup to 5 orders at a time. It was a very enjoyable work space. Only wish it wasn't temporary.
good,"Provides educational and advancement opportunities"
good,"climbed ladders to pick orders"
good,"Who hasn't heard of Cabela's?! Must have good people skills to work in this department.  Spend a lot of time on the phone placing orders, tracking orders, or dealing with angry people.  Responsible for creating purchase orders, invoices, and receiving payments.  Also partook in several administrative duties.  Management was not my favorite, but I learned about the kind of person I DON'T want to be.  Every job is a learning experience.  Cabela's is still a great company to work for."
good,Great company it is just hard to advance. More work performed by those that are not management
good,"As far as a retail environment this is the top to work for. Your customers are a much different than going to target or Walmart. This is like the Nordstrom of sporting goods retail environment. Just stay busy and productive and work well with others, Communicate well with customers and other work associates. Have good attendance. If you cant do these simples things list above. Your going to be looking for another job. Excellent employees and management."
good,"At the store I was at, you couldn't advance to a lead or management position unless you were a full time employee. The full time pay didn't pay enough to live on, so I stayed with my full time EMT job."
good,I have loved most of my time that I have been at Cabelas. Your coworkers are all friendly and willing to teach you if you do not know what to do. The customers are friendly and are very interactive. The atmosphere of the store is unlike anything that I have experienced.
good,Cabela's was One of the wholly family owned companies & then they started trading on the stock market.  Decisions weren’t as fruitful.  Bass Pro came calling & they sold out.  Very sad day.
good,"Sometimes,  easy work. Sometimes, stressful due to irate customers. Stress comes from some customers wanting something for nothing! Those calls can overwhelm some days."
good,"Cabela's in Marysville Washington was a good place to work. I was just widowed and they were very kind. I set records uo selling there.  I uo sold added insurance, and warranty upgrades to customers."
good,"Unload truck, separate to department."
good,I came into the company to open a new store. The management was amazing. The corporate support was phenomenal. The job itself was fun and the people I met in the community were great. My position got eliminated but I have nothing bad to say about my experience there.
good,Strong foundation of culture and focus on the customer.  Work environment is nice.  Work/Life Balance is important to upper management.  Great place to work for 9 years.
good,A very typical retail environment. Fast paced and always something to do. Customers are loyal and fun to work with. Management empowers the employees to do whatever it takes to make the customers happy.
good,"It really is a fun place to work the sad thing is that there really is no room to move up, that I have noticed anyways. I have been wanting and even needing a full-time position but I have yet to receive one even after a year, and I am not the only one."
good,Fellow employees are generally very friendly however there is a major class divide between different levels of management which can put stress on middle management to meet near-impossible sales goals and credit card applications.
good,when i get to work I have to put up freight. then i help customers with whatever they need. the management is nice and they give recognition to the outfitters.
good,Very fast paced. Friendly staff. Learn new things all the time. Get a lot of updating on policies and laws concerning banking. A lot of laws to learn.
good,"If the genuinely interested in the outdoors you couldnt find a better place to work. The staff and coworkers are fascinating. Everyone has amazing stories to tell, and the amount of knowledge you learn about numerous things is uncanning. Truly a passionate place to work, however it is retail so it is a necessity that you are flexible when it comes to your work/life balance."
good,the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to work with customers and amazing employees. on a day to day basis I would lead my team in the warehouse. this truly is a great company to work for and they are very family oriented.
good,My work place is amazingly positive and an awesome place to be. I love giving awesome customer service and maintaining relationships with my customers and my co-workers.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the variety and individuality in service which I am able to provide.
good,"-A typical day at work is everything goes perfect"
good,"I would normally work night shifts except when I was doing overtime. I would be at work by eight pm to start my night off. Us as a team would have different parts to working together. There was one guy working replenishment, one guy catching the boxes, and then there was me unloading the boxes from the back of the truck. We would unload one of those almost every night. After unloading them we would finish replenishment and run the pilot jacks and organize the merchandise. "
good,sold knives and hunting apparel and equipment during the Christmas season it slowed down alot and hours were cut back over time.
good,the different array of customers kept the job interesting everday
good,"Working with the events team at Cabela’s was the best time I’ve had in a work environment. I loved working with the team and the managers. The interview process was pretty easy, we were in a conference room and I was asked many questions about who I was as a person and my professional experience."
good,"Excellent atmosphere and an everyday learning experience, co workers are in part very helpful in giving assistance to  any outfitter, as a part time, management is very flexible."
good,Retail is a fast paced environment.  If you are passionate about the outdoors it is a great place to work.  Discounts on products for the outdoors for employees.
good,"Management was focused on accomplishments and progress over clock-watching and ticket processing. The goal was to improve the state of the platform and resolve active incidents and as long as it was met, promotions and rewards were available."
good,"Enjoyed the job, not the clique style atmosphere created by management and coworkers.Would definitely recommend this job to others, and actively tried to get others on board."
good,Cabela’s is a great place to work. It has been the best place that I have worked. They really care about the outfitters that work here and go above and beyond not only for customers but for the outfitters.
good,Cabelas was a great place to work. I quit because of management issues at the time. They have changed managers since i quit working there. and then i ended up moving from Ringgold to Dalton.They gave me great hours and I was paid good also.
good,"Overall a fun place to work if you are passionate about the outdoors."
good,"Worked here for almost 3 years and it has been a great experience, glad I applied and took the job. I've met some of my best friends through the company"
good,"I love the team in Wheeling.  Lots of tenure and the team really cares about each other. The truly try to place a premium on work/life balance, but it is a job so you can't always get what you want."
good,I did my job there very well but they added to my workload so heavily and moved me to that position with no alternative after 10 years.....I did my new job there just as equally well but my job was going to go away with the sale of Bass Pro.....so I left before that and took retirement from Cabelas .
good,"great staff, management knows products, staff, and customers well. only downside is having to work 1 day of the weekend and 1 closing shift per week, otherwise its a pretty flexible schedule."
good,"I loved working here, however they let me go with no warning before my shift and would not allow me to finish my scheduled shifts. Very hard to transfer departments, lack of help from management. Also if you're a cashier you have to fight to have a restroom break."
good,"The time I spent there was a learning experience - having never worked in retail before. I have no complaints about the store, management or work environment.  I personally did not like the hours  that retail work encompasses."
good,"I found working at Cabela's to be enjoyable mainly because the products I as assisting customers to find and buy were, in most cases, things that I enjoy as a hobby. It made it fun to talk to customers about the products we sold."
good,great place to work but the hours and pay where not the best and the discount was just taxes but the stuff you could learn there was great the other departments always needed help and that when you learn more about the items sold there
good,I would love to discuss my experience and opinion of this job with a representative of your company face to face. thank you for your time and consideration.
good,Good management overall fun people to work with. Not much flexibility with hours if you as going to school. Pay it good and the discounts are worth working there
good,"I don't think i've ever had a bad day working here. There's a lot of walking and climbing on ladders.The management is great! If you have a problem or need a day off right away they fix it right away. Id have to say the hardest part about working here is getting use to everything, the commands on the scan guns and figuring out where everything is. The most enjoyable part about going to work is everyone there. There caring, everyone has a sense of humor, and nobody really judges you. It's a great work environment!"
good,Cabela's is a great place to work with a great culture. They are a great company located in a nice small town and the leadership has a dedication to the community.
good,"Enjoyed working here, but overall structure was inefficient. Alot of communication issues between levels of employees, and many mistakes in pricing across the board. Overall culture was good."
good,A great place to work! Management is great. I have learned to adapt to the ever changing world of retail and obtained a great culture and utilize daily
good,"Cabela's was my first job, so the environment it offered almost instantly was a very friendly and helpful area for me to be myself and actually get the job done and still be smiling by the end of the day. The Cabela's name is one that they take pride in and take care of the employees as well, like for Christmas everyday they had something new and fun going on for those who were working."
good,Worked in the dog and hunting area with good people willing to help when needed. Was able to interact with customers and assist them with questions they had about a product.
good,"Great place to work.  Management is amazing and the culture outstanding.  For me, there is lack of advancement opportunities in my desired areas."
good,"I worked with this company for 12 years and I got to do a lot of things and go a lot of places that I would otherwise not been able to do.  "
good,While working here yiu are allowed to joke around as long as your work is being done. High expectations however getting a full time position is hard unless you know someone that can pull strings.
good,A fun and great place to work. The management team is vary helpful in preparing other employees for leadership throughout the company. It is no a place to work if you have a family.
good,"It's a great family oriented business, learned a lot of things, the most enjoyable part of my day is helping customers load there purchased products into there vehicles."
good,"Co-workesr and management are pretty amazing. Just wish there was more room for advancement in a ""man:""based company. This company offers great incentives and opportunities to do different events in your community. Also allows great travel experience if one is able."
good,"Great team of hard-working individuals. Management was generally pretty good, but sometimes had slightly unrealistic expectations, but we all worked together to get things done in the end."
good,"Taking care of customers, having a positive attitude,  learning skills, and working close to Co-workers/ Management for higher positions."
good,It is a great place to work and I appreciate the help you get from the employees with more experience. not hostile but competitive in a good sense.
good,"Wonderful company to work at for beginners, but very little advancement for the future. The branches of Cabela's are pristine and wonderful with the low light settings, natural appearance intermingling with a retail environment. The store takes a natural wildlife appearance while trying to sell retail equipment, which makes this place more of a day trip then a five minute trip to Walmart. Extremely successful store, with highly skilled and knowledgeable workers on everything outdoorsy. This building sees a tough customer load, but they do staff accordingly so employees are stressed but not overworked. The benefits are good here with plenty ways to make extra money for any employee. However this business is large, but with very few stores nationwide making it hard to move up the ladder in this business with so few high ranking positions. Most of their employees are either part-time or seasonal with few full time employees able to lead a stable living."
good,I liked my job a lot have to pass a test at the training but the test is not hard. I had 100% scores almost all the time. Never had bad score.
good,I love shearing stories with customers and talk to them about what kind of hunting and fishing and anything out doors I love to do and love listening to there story's as well
good,"I love working for Cabela's! Not only are the customers amazing but so is management. I like how professional they are but very laid back at the same time. Never once have I had issues with any of my co-workers. Cabela's offers lots of incentives during a regular work day and if you are good at what you do, there are tons of ways to make extra money off commissions when processing online orders for customers, selling product protection plans and signing customers up for the Cabela's Club Card. I really enjoy helping our customers find solutions to their (sometimes complex) issues and seeing a smile on their face when they leave the store."
good,I loved working at Cabela's. I learned A LOT about a whole variety of things from materials to ammunition!
good,"although home would have been a better option. Cabela's tried to make everyday a easy day. the company was extremely organized, yet I never got to truly spend time with my family as I would like at home. management was always around to help"
good,"Fast pace work enviroment"
good,Cabela's is a great place to work because of it huge part in the Outdoors lifestyle. Cabela's is a company made up of many different types of cultures and heritages among it's employees which makes it a very diverse place to work. Employees of Cabela's are great people to work around because they are very involve with Cabela's and they love the Outdoors.
good,"Show up to work, on time, and get my walkie talkie and go to the front of the store and talk to the front lead manager on shift and go to whatever register they asked me to go to or stay at customer service depending on whats the most busy."
good,"A day of work at Cabelas is, helping customers find the right product for them. Give the customer addvice. Merchandsing, clean your department, the most in enjoyable part of the job was getting to learn new things about outdoor gear from co workers and customers"
good,"Cabelas is a nice place to work, They focus in on customer satisfaction, honesty and integrity."
good,"Amazing place to work, I love it! The Management looks out for its employees and tries there hardest to have fun while also making money. I have never been happier with a Job and It feels like a home"
good,"There are multiple opportunities for you in growth. If your in a specific department there, there is even more options. They pride themselves in customer service. Excellent for someone who just out of high school looking for work."
good,"Working at cabelas taught me how to work independently, and along side other people. Strengthened my communications skills. And gave me lots of new opportunities in trying new things"
good,Decent hourly job for someone who has yet to achieve a skilled trade. Unfortunately not conducive to support of a growing family. Recommended for associates who aren't primary providers.
good,seasonal position sorting item onto belt to be sent to packers one item on tray fast paced once that done go to packing put box together to ship product to Customer owned stuff seal label put on conveyor to shipping
good,"I worked 3 yrs. Salary plus commission,made a decent living then bass pro took over took away the commission pay as i was getting 20% commission which was a kick in the face."
good,"Everyday i worked there it was a good experience. I loved assisting customers and helping them find specific things were searching for. Some days i had good customers some i had bad customers, but the ones who were rude i just ignored their attitude and continued to do my work."
good,"Cabela's knocks it out of the park when it comes to leadership training and development. Over the course of 3 months, you gain the necessary skill sets to not only assist in your own career, but those whom you manage. The talent and development team is invested in the health, happiness and professional developing of their employees."
good,"I loved working for Cabela's.  It has it's downfalls like any big corporation, but all in all they are a good company with down to earth values.  Met some of the greatest people there."
good,Job very good. Hours are fair. Management is very good. Work day cleaning deli area. Learned alot more on cleaning & bad part taking garbage out. Bad part leaving heavy bag bottom og garbage bin.
good,"In my experience with Cabela’s was an overall welcoming one. The management takes time to work with you if you have last minute events. The job overall is entertaining at least for me it was. You get to meet people of all kinds, and help people with the same interest."
good,I have learned a lot of things from all the managers in all the different departments. I never knew how to do anything on a computer before I started up there they had a class for excel and I took it.

good,"Working at Cabela's was my first job, So beginning the job was very exciting, The pace at the Job was very busy, Even when the snow took over the roads we still had a busy day, but what made the busy days better were the managers , they always kept a positive attitude handled any problem."
good,The experience at Cabelas for me was excellent. Working there gave me good insight into the retail world and it was a fun environment to work. The management team was phenomenal and respectful.
good,"The day would begin always with a morning meeting, and end with a nightly meeting; it depended on when you came in for the day. I learned to maintain a task while also being ready to pause said task and assist customers, my time management was very decent and the managerial team at Cabela's was...alright. The workplace culture of Cabela's was rich with heritage. The hardest part of the job was maintaining one task finished all the time; there was so much work that needed to be done to change certain things that it was a never-ending battle occasionally. The easiest part of the job, on the other hand, was the ease of the day. Customers came in waves, and when there were no customers we could go about our daily tasks freely with no distractions."
good,"Very nice break room , not much time to get lunch location of restaurants are away from work.Retail customers can be hard to deal with at times . The people you work with are great ."
good,My time at cabela's was full of daily activities with plenty opportunities for professional growth.  Coworkers are willing to assist in other departments when needed to help ensure complete customer satisfaction.
good,"once you learn to operate the crown man lift and scan gun the resy is easy. there's no involvement, unless you need help with something, with other people. you locate merchandise and place it in an active isle. a good place to work."
good,"Fun place to work, learning about every feature and benefit on power sports and boating industry.  Positive work culture, very diverse customer base, competitive sales environment"
good,Cabelas is a great company to work for if your a collage student and dont plan on making it a lifetime career the benefits are decent and the discount is awesome.
good,My job at Cabela's was a fun experience. Although I was just in the footwear department I had the opportunity to work in other Departments. occasionally I would work in the warehouse unloading the trucks and organizing the deliveries.
good,"I love it. I have learned so much working here, incredible training classes, i would tell everyone about working here, there just isn't many advancement opputunities"
good,"I've been with Cabela's for about 2 years now and it's never been a bad experience. Management has been good and (almost) everyone I've met who work there are all great people. "
good,Cabala's was great because most days had variation. The workplace culture was fantastic as there was an events team dedicated to getting employees and customers excited about products.
good,"its a really fun place to work. They reword good work and have really great courses where you learn allot. I sadly could only stay on for my three month term, i missed to many shift and they let me go. but i still really liked it, and respect them. I was young. live and learn."
good,"Very fun to work there, and a wonderful management team. We were rewarded with food and snacks when we would meet our goals, and always made sure we got our breaks."
good,mangment was very helpful with everything. Loved working with the staff. I miss working here. They have a great training programe. I would go back to work here in the future.
good,Moving from an internship into a part-time position allowed me to grow and see how they operate. Absolutely a good company to work for. No complaints.
good,Bosses were great to work for. Employes were awesome to work for to. Fun and different everyday. Paid vaction and sick leave. Health insurance and life insurance.profit sharing l
good,"i loved working for cabelas. i was in the cash office so i handled the store vault. i answered and followed corporate, not the in store managers. the new manager in charge of customer service didnt seem to understand that i didnt answer to her so she found an excuse to fire me. told corporate that i had lied about something that they refused to tell me when i asked. its a great place to work. some of the management is hard to deal with but if you just keep your head down and do your job its amazing."
good,"A typical day at work was very enjoyable. It is an outdoor sports/adventure store, so the customers were always happy to be there. During my employment at Cabela's, I learned about many different things from fire arms to camping. Product knowledge seminars were available at various times to ensure there was always someone on staff who knew about certain products. Management was always fair with customers and staff. They were all very approachable and helpful. Everyone who worked there had a passion for what they did and loved being there which made it very easy to go to work every day. The hardest part of the job was not being able to wander around and look at all the new merchandise. Every time you look around there is something new to look at or learn about. The most Enjoyable part of the job was talking to the customers that came in. Most of the time they were there searching for a new item(s) that would make their outdoor experience more enjoyable so they were happy to be there."
good,"Overall, an excellent place to work, though the lack of a regular schedule could be trying.  Management was extremely competent, and really cared about the workers.  A fun place to have a job for an outdoorsman."
good,"People travel from all over to by hunting, fishing, and camping equipment from the most knowledgeable associates in the business. The district team is reachable should any issue occur though that is unlikely. Management is very knowledgeable in both the world of retail and the world of their department. The hunting manager is an experienced hunter, the fishing manger is an experienced fisher, etc.. Cabelas also does a great job hiring people both full and part time. Associates are placed where their business skills as well as team skills will be best utilized. There is a great knowledge team at cabelas as well, anytime a new product or idea is on the market it is researched and passed down the line with hands on training. Coworkers are easy to get along with because everyone is trained the same information and expectations. Teamwork is a big part of how Cabelas runs daily. Each department is a team and has daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly goals for both chores and metrics. The hardest part of the job is when someone decides not to try any more and begins slacking at their position and therefore letting the team down. At this point Cabelas will move the associate around to find a suitable position that would inspire the associate to do their best again. The best part of the job is the comradery shared under the green roof. People really step up and help out anywhere they can, and management takes care of any issues that arise. Outside of the store comradery remains as we share fishing, shooting, and camping trips or have a potluck on a busy weekend so everyone has lunch"
good,I enjoy the employees I work with.  I do not come in contact with customers other than on the phones. Some of the management teams are great.  Over all the company works well with their employees and the operation of the company is great. The hardest part of the job is the hours.
good,its a great place to work if you love anything to deal with the outdoors. i learned more about hunting materials and the management is good. the co-workers just depends who you work with most are great. the hardest part of the job is getting everything done before the store opens. and the most enjoyable part is the people you work with and if you love being in the outdoors.
good,"Every day is like Christmas, here. I love the people I work with and I have made some great friends here. I also love the interaction with our customers, and knowing that my expertise and knowledge has helped someone to better enjoy their adventure in the outdoors. "
good,Hardest part is asking of someone wants a credit card.  Co workers are great.  you stand all day  Entering data into system accurate and follow FDIC rules.  I like to help customers find stuff they can't find.
good,"fun place to work, very productive. Management is good. Every one is friendly.  I have learned alot about the company and a lot about my self"
good,"process customer returns, transaction, answer phones, greet customers"
good,"It was a great environment, the people there were very friendly."
good,Fun environment to work in with great potential to grow in the company.
good,"Customer service is always a must, while taking care of each other on the floor.  Day to day is checking with Management for updates and floor and sales goals. Reviewing sales from day, week, month, year.  Changing and altering floor to increase sales, credit card sign ups, CXP (insurance add ons), phone sales and questions.  The hardest part of the job is ""recovery"" to keep the clothing department looking great at all times.  The best thing is the interaction between customers.  I have gotten to know some so well that we now exchange Christmas Cards."
good,"•	Educated customers about the brand to incite excitement about the company mission and values. "
good,It was an amazing atmosphere. The managers and my other co-workers were simply amazing. Such fun loving people who really care about what they do.
good,"Cashiering can truthfully be a repetitive job, but it pays bills and allows for customer interaction and problem solving as well as some creative thinking. I would clock in, and man a register for most of the day, then someone would take my place or I'd help open or close depending on my shift."
good,Cabela's is an Amazing company to work for at all levels.  Best work enviroment I've ever encountered!  Upper management was one of a kind.  Just awesome.
good,"Cabelas of Gville is a smaller than average cabelas. Customers have complained about Bass Pro taking over and removing/replacing several Cabelas branded merchandise. Some cheaper brands are to market to Walmart customers. Unfortunately, Cabelas Lifetime Warranty is gone! Long time customers are finding out the hard way. Management is fine and seems to get the job done. Nothing is ever really perfect at any job but this place has a lot to offer. Starting pay is $10 but discounts on cabelas brands are 45%. Other name brands are 15% discount. Club Credit cards are aggressively promoted but that has always been the case. For some life experienced employees, this place is therapeutic, low stress, and easy going with great conversations with customers."
good,The job itself was very straight forward and involved a lot of time interacting with all types of people. The job was fun from the start of the day until the end.
good,This was a great job if you want to work seasonal only .. i like the people and customers were great as well . They have great sales if your a outdoors kind of person .. love this store
good,Must be a team player.  Cabela's is a WE atmosphere.  It is easy work for the computer literate.  You must be able to perform on the spot with problem solving skills.
good,One of three best places I have worked.  Store Manager cared about his employees and the nature of the store.  Best place to work if you enjoy the out doors.
good,It is fast paced during certain times of the year. You have your own desk with your own work area and bring in your own supplies. Break room is nice with vending machines and an area to go outside and sit.
good,Part time employees lack benefits or decent wages. The overall culture of the job is exceptional though. Management is understanding and willing to work with employees to achieve their goals in the company. The wages are on the lower end. Full time benefits are excellent for retail.
good,Great company- fun to work for and care for their employees.  Merged with new company was difficult.   Enjoyed the skills and experiences I gained while working there!
good,"They are always willing to work with me on my schedule.  The discount is pretty good, there are some health and dental insurance benefits.  Fun to meet so many interesting people."
good,A typical day at work includes processing and putting out clothes to the sales floor for me as well as getting club cards and zoning your department as well as performing tasks for managers especially for the holidays.
good,I learned a lot working at Cabela's over the years.  I was given the opportunity to grow with my department and it made me a much stronger individual.
good,Cabela's was a great place to work. The management was great. The teamwork was wonderful. I was only part-time so left for full-time employment. Great place.
good,"Great opportunity to get away from City Life, while still enjoying the opportunities of the big city. Very modern IT infrastructure and focused on staying with the curve."
good,"Friendly employees, and the occasional rough customer who is NOT always right. Great Training program and staff. Ensure you know your job, and a fair share about the equipment for sale to educate customers."
good,"Amazing work environment with amazing people. I loved my job working customer service for our local Cabela's, and had they not closed their doors I surely would have continued working there."
good,this is a really nice place to work at if you love the outdoors! everyone feels like family and you get to now the customers. although after working there for awhile you'll get tried of it and selling the outdoors to people
good,"The culture is one of family, all working together to support each other even though we may disagree on some issues.  The pace is fast but not overwhelming.  Great place to work."
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Cabela's. Advancement is possible, if you work hard, and show initiative. I enjoy the fast pace, and I am never bored. It is a great place to work."
good,"Great place to work, flexible schedule, advancement opportunities. Employee discounts. Friendly coworkers, always interesting, Any job to s nylon as good as you make it, those without people skills need not apply."
good,Great place to work with a lot of wonderful people.  Good middle management.  Flexible hours which makes having a family enjoyable.  Most everyone cares about everyone else.
good,"I love working at Cabelas, to me, its not really a job at all, but I just wish I got more hours with full time benefits, not just part time. My wife and I need to have a more stable and reliable income"
good,"Working at Cabala's was supposed to be a seasonal job, it led into 2 1/2 years of being a cashier. Cabala's is a great place to work. The only thing is that they focus on Club too much and not on the customer. The customer gets frustrated when being asked about Club eight times while shopping. Most managers were great to work with. If you want a pt job this is a great place to work."
good,"Assists customers in finding merchandise and making buying decisions. Restocks"
good,I love working at Cabela's I still work there as of now especially love doing the events it's so much fun to meet new people and see people enjoy our products
good,"schedules required to be ""available"" 7 days a week, 5 am to 10 pm."
good,"- Typical busy day with interactions with customers on the phone"
good,As a seasonal employee I was treated very well by both staff and customers. The company is top notch in customer service. The employee discount was very generous. Employees spend days in training thus ensuring the utmost in attention to detail and customer service.
good,"Management is very lacking, and is not helpful in many situations. The staff, however, is very friendly and works great together. All team players and everyone gets along for the most part."
good,Enjoyable retail setting to work at with a busy fast paced atmosphere which will keep one interested and excited to participate.
good,"I was impressed as a customer prior to working there and I am equally as impressed now having worked there month 6 months so far. Management is accommodating and they work to make sure their employees work in a healthy, happy environment."
good,"Really fun place to work, the staff are amazing but as a lead position they don't give enough training, and the wage should reflect the position."
good,"This was a great company to work for, to be part of this company was a great thing in its self.  Always surrounded by people that looked out for each other."
good,"Overall great place to work.  Average wages and benefits, Enjoy the overall work place culture.  Does have some strict policies most of which are understandable for the business type."
good,Like every job it has its ups and downs. New company for this location and getting to work with a variety of different people can be complex sometimes.
good,"I appreciate morning recognition, outings, free food offered during certain times, and the truly authentic co workers!"
good,"It's a Great atmosphere for work, with great management team, that has great hours for P.T. work with decent discount levels."

good,Nice place to work. Mostly fun place with lots of activities. Lots of competition and customers are very loyal. Lots of contests to win prizes.
good,"Great place to work with great management and customers. Compensation is low for me, but it may be high for retail. The company tries to keep everyone energized and educated while being professional. Customer service is the top priority and everyone is expected to act accordingly. They have many fun days and really try to treat all employees with respect and fairness. Great place to work retail."
good,"Scheduled 10 hours a day, 5 days per week. Typical retail management duties. The staff is great and everyone cares about their duties and position within the store. We all love helping and learning from our customers, as we all share an extreme fondness of everything outdoors."
good,Great job  its just not full time and its a 45 min drive so I us way to much gas. My co worker are great they are fun  happy  go lucky people  how will go out of there way to help you
good,"This was the best place to work because everyone is so friendly and caring. Everyone helps each other out and you saw so many different kinds of people. Cabela's is not a store that you ever need to go into it is a store you want to go into because you love your hobby. From fishing to hunting and camping, all the great outdoors inside one building with experts in each area to help you find the perfect item that you need."
good,"A typical day at work was 5-8 hours, but never the same schedule"
good,"Very fun and very country! I'm always happy to be there! A typical day consists of me taking applications for our Club Visa Card. We're generally pretty steady, but some days more than others. I have learned a lot about customer privacy and teamwork along with being able to build relationships and trust with your customers. Management is pretty well staffed and is pretty fair with how to handle things, considering Club is without a manager at the moment. The outfitters I also work with are always fun to be around and work with. Life in Cabela's is never boring! The hardest part of the job (for me) would have to be not being able to go over 28 hours per week. I love to work and it bums me out when I'm not allowed to pick up more hours after reaching 28. The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be just talking with people and getting to know a part of them. It's just cool to see how different everyone's lives really are!"
good,"Cabela's is a fun place to work.  They offer several different options to make extra money on your paycheck.  Management varies with styles, but is mostly very flexible and great to work for.  The company is growing tremendously so there are several opportunities to grow in the company."
good,I really enjoy interacting with customers and helping them. I love being busy. I use the computer all the time to enter applications and look up customers accounts. I take payments and provide cash back if needed.
good,good place to work would be better if it wasn't seasonal work hard to get on full time
good,"loved working for Cabela's. people are nice, pay was great, and so were benefits. had to sign 2 year contract to work, and they relocated my family to nebraska. would still be working there but children were young and hated living in a isolated high plains town. closest mall was 100 miles away in cheyenne wy."
good,Overall a great place to work and an AWESOME MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE. I love being there and will work there for a long while.
good,*Company really understands the importance of work/ life balance
good,"It was the best job I ever had.I was sad when it was over,it was just seasonal.The training was thorough and friendly if you made a.mistake. They were like family."
good,"I love working at Cabelas! I have met some really neat customers from all over the world, and I have enjoyed the friends I have made while working here. I have awesome managers that help outfitters whenever it is needed. I really love my job however there is no career advancement, and pay is low."
good,The outfitters and management are great and the environment is fun and stress free. Pay is low compared to other places. An increase would be appreciated to go with the other benefits. Might help in retaining quality outfitters. Over all it is an enjoyable experience and place to work.
good,"This was the second place I ever worked and it was so much fun everyone was helpful and worked well in a team. The managment didn't have much time for us but that was becouse I worked seasonal at christmas time so crazy busy for us and them. but once it slowed down they had more time to help with stuff."
good,You get an amazing amount of training. Managers and leads are super super nice and approachable. I worked there for my first job and everyone was so patient with me. I truly loved working there. Would recommend it!!
good,"Even with my short time as a seasonal employee with the Santa Wonderland, everyone was helpful and had your back. Management would help when possible and did their best to help those that had shortcomings."
good,I work at the registers because of the Holiday rush. So far it is a great environment to learn and be a team member in. I am excited to continue with Cabela's for this Holiday season.
good,Interesting job that happens to mirror my particular interests. Enjoy dealing with customers that are interested in knowing more about the products that the company offers
good,Loved working at Cabelas. The staff genuinely love the products and are passionate about the people - and that makes a world of a difference. They care about their customers and it's clear in management and staff. The hours are very flexible. Great employee discounts.
good,"I've never worked in such a positive, happy place. You actually feel like you are important not replaceable like most other places especially for how big the company is. The human resources lady is probably the most loving down to earth awesome person while still being the most professional,hard working person I've ever seen. All of my coworkers were all very pleasant, I miss it ,"
good,I absolutely loved this job. When I had to leave it broke my heart. I would go back in a heart beat. I loved what I did and who I did it with. I was always learning something new and having fun doing it.
good,Cabelas was a fast paced environment.  You were on auto call delivery.  It was fun to take customer orders and help them find the items they were looking for.  I only worked part time while I went back to school. I liked helping the customer.
good,"fun work place, good management, good hours. Great team building, fun projects and fast paced weekends. I have been here since Oct of 2018 and I am so glad to be able to work with a great team!"
good,Cabelas had a very great atmosphere and was very fun! the managers talked and worked with you daily to set goals and encourage you to be better and achieve those goals!
good,"Although it was a fast-paced environment, the staff is great and the vendors were great to work with as well. It was a learning experience in a new town and I enjoyed getting to know the town and the people."
good,"I loved working at Cabelas. Management was great, my coworkers were fun and easy to work with. If i hadn't moved to the valley, I'd still be working there!"
good,"I love working at Cabelas. The staff is friendly and hardworking. You can learn so much about the outdoors such as learning how to shoot any gun, hunting, fishing, camping outdoors and even making sure to wear the right attire in the outdoors."
good,"You know what you're getting with Cabela's. No two sided faces. Genuine interest in outdoors sporting in many varieties. They encouraged not just interest, but expertise from all of their employees."
good,"I will cherish my days at Cabela's, the teams I worked with were awesome.  There was an amazing amount of experience under that green roof and pure dedication to the Cabela's pillars of Hunt, Fish, Camp and Shoot."
good,"At Cabela's, I easily felt engaged working on the floor or in the office as there was always another outfitter or management personnel reaching out for a hand when needed or reminiscing about a fun hunting trip.  I would drive sales, support the team, promote the credit card club program, attend customer service, solve problems, interact with co-workers, bring a positive attitude, and learn every day.  The store culture is filled with good times mixed with selling a quality product.  I enjoyed my time with Cabela's as it gave me a wonderful opportunity and I gained so much more than I ever would have thought."
good,"I loved this job! Straightforward working on computers, handling customer's calling in and placing orders. Thorough training. Nice environment to work in."
good,"The Fort Oglethorpe Cabela's location has an excellent team in place. The GM and Retail Managers are top tier and they have built an excellent staff. The work is seasonal in that sometimes it will be wall to wall customers while others, it can be dead for hours on end. There are endless opportunities to learn and grow your experience and the discounts don't hurt either. The pay isn't the greatest, but is in line with comparable retail in the area. Overall, it is an excellent place to work with a fun environment and team."
good,Love Cabela's! Great exciting place to work. Co-workers were great and worked as a team to make sure our patrons had the best shopping experience possible at our location! Love learning about all the products we carried in order to help our patrons find what they were shopping for.
good,"Great place to work fun and exciting, the store was amazing, with every new customer came new adventures, hunting, camping, fishing, boating, and the fun outfitting the customers for these adventures and the stories afterward."
good,Being around and talking with customers great! People that shop Cabela's is mostly a want to as to having a need to. The tasks I was assigned were easy to complete. Always something new to do. Good people. Fun Fridays awesome. During Holidays employee discount increased greatly. Cool stuff to look at.
good,This was a good place for a first time job. There are great benefits for the employees and the competitive commissions help drive the work place in a fun way.
good,It wasn’t bad. Retail as it is is fairly stressful but as long as you don’t mind talking to people it’s not bad at all. There was a few disagreements but that’s how it is with any job.
good,Very fun and family oriented place to work. Flexible hours and works well with students. The managers are very understanding and help whenever they can. Cabela's strives for great customer service as well as a great environment for their employees.
good,"Being a call-center, it was a very positive place to work for. The leadership was always willing to help. The hardest part of the job was not being able to help the customer. The most enjoyable part is when we were able to have options for the customer in helping them."
good,"This position was quite busy, always something to do.  Communication was great.  It was an enjoyable place to work.  Some days were grueling especially around the holidays with cranky customers but it was all taken in stride and more often than not we were able to help make the situation better."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers on what they are needing and just looking for so they can have an awesome experience while outdoors. You never know what a typical day is like due to what the customers needs and wants are they change all the time
good,"Great place to work! has a very strong corporate structure and many knowledgable employees. "
good,"I got to manage my time myself, so a typical day was checking emails and responding accordingly, planning new events and training's, researching new products, going over standard operating procedures with new employees. Promoting events inside and outside the store, helping customers on the sales floor by providing superior customer service. My management was not very interested in my day to day procedures or in listening to issues or concerns I may have had. But I most enjoyed the amount of information I got to learn and the amount of customer interaction I was able to have."
good,"I have been with the Cabela's lnc. for two and a half years, and I absolutely love it! You have the greatest co-works that become close to you in a way of family. They strive to help each other in all areas of the store. They stick together, they are family."
good,"fun, competitive, great communities even and instore events.  nice discounts for employees and the bargain cave discounts, its fun. They do a lot for their employees."
good,"Cabela's is a growing retail company with a loyal customer base.  The company is very supportive of its employees and work/life balance.  Management has an open-door policy and was very accessible.  My co-workers were the best part of the day.  I was blessed to work with a smart, talented group that challenged me every day."
good,"I answered the phones took orders from the customers put them on the computer .I learned word software and  the products that we sold to customers  .Enjoyed working with my coworkers alot  we would help each other out . Sometimes  the Hardest part was when the busy session came in the fall and we would have people sick and there would be no  one to help out we just keep smiling and keep going ."
good,I have been with the company for 10 1/2 years. I t has been a great place to work with great benefits and the opportunity for advancement based on performance.
good,"Was a great job, worked in the warehouse, drove the forklift, stocked shelves, and also ran inventory out to customers when the product was not found on the floor. Great environment, that is the hobby that I love, anything outdoors."
good,"Outfitted customers in proper gear for whatever they were going to do. Whether it was hunting, fishing, hiking, or camping. My coworkers were great, a nice drama free zone. Management was never rude, nor abused their authority. The hardest part for me was trying to get folks to sign up for the CLUB credit card. It was expected to have at least one sign up a day. Other than that Cabela's truly cares about their customers. It was a nice change from previous jobs."
good,"If you like the outdoors with clean air and views that go for miles, this is the greatest place. If you must have the packed in feeling of the big city, might not be the best"
good,"This is a great place to work. Well being a cashier and mostly closing shifts I usually am responsible for closing the front end down and checking out customers. Management is pretty good, Co workers are good and a great family feeling. The hardest part of my job is dealing with customers that are not very nice, the best part is dealing with the customers that are nice and funny"
good,"learned new things everyday"
good,"Cabelas was one of my most favorite jobs purely in reflection of the staff.  Everyone worked well with each other and got along great.  The corporate aspect of it was quite disappointing though.  We were ""reeled"" in with many empty promises and benefits that were hastily taken away and a 50% unemployment rate shortly after store set-up was finished.  Shortly after the companys needs were met and goals were reached the working crew was treated as cattle and berated on a regular basis.  Although this particular store was named store of the year (corporation-wide) the demands are still outrageous from what I hear of the 3 remaining original crew.  Regardless of the Corporate big-wigs, the store was run like a well oiled machine and I am still proud to say I worked there with such a wonderful group of stand-up people who always stood up against unnecessary accusations from people who didnt know what really went on."
good,"A great atmosphere to work in,  something new to learn every day.  Advancement is slow but opportunities are there for those who want them."
good,I absolutely loved working here! The people are fantastic and make it a great environment!
good,"I loved this job but unfortunately it was 4 hours from my home where I still have my children, family, house. With my daughter in her last year of high school I had to be home for this crucial year. I have never had a job that I just loved everyone from management to my co-workers. The hardest part was working some evenings until closing then having to open the next morning. A typical day would involve, sales of firearms to customers, calling Pennsylvania Instant Check System/ state police for clearance to make these purchases, shipping firearms to other states for customers. This job was fun and enjoyable. I hated to quit."
good,Very Satasfied with this company which is why I am enjoying keeping it as a part time position on the weekends. 
good,"Cabelas was a good company they gave me decent pay, full benefits and most of the people including management are great. All you have to do is ask and they would bend over backwards to help you."
good,"My typical day at work consisted of loading trucks with the appropriate goods from the appropriate bays. Management was friendly and helpful, and my coworkers were pleasant. I learned many things, as it was my first warehouse job. I learned the proper procedure for loading an 18-wheel semi-truck with adequate weight distribution, how to operate a palette jack properly, and how to use an automated shrink wrap machine. The hardest part of the job was almost constantly moving around 40-80 pound boxes, and that was also the most enjoyable part."
good,"A typical day is when I would open and or close the club booth (where people sign up for credit cards), preparing what was needed for the day. I learned about different types of credit cards and what was optional, for example, life lock and payment assurance. I had a great relationship with both my managers and co-workers. The hardest part of this job, since this is retail was of course black Friday. Having multiple people pulling you in a million ways. I really enjoyed working with everyone."
good,We stood in a circle at the beginning of our shift and heard the statistics of the day before. Then we went to our assigned register and began checking out customers. Our managers worked with us and my co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was when a customer got mad and started using foul language. Other than that everything was enjoyable.
good,"Loved the customers and goods that the store carried. I also like the flexibility of working here, they really worked with my school schedule"
good,"I truly enjoyed working at Cabela's. It was easy work for the most part, but you were always on your feet. The people coming in and out of the store were usually nice, and the rude customers weren't hard to deal with. The store discount was probably the best part."
good,"Working at Cabela's was like working with family, I mean that in a good way. We supported each other and were all good friends in and out of work. Some less desirable changed occurred as the company prepared to go public that in my mind took away from the intimate and closeness of the staff but that happens with every company when they get big."
good,I really enjoyed the company and the people I worked with there. I just didn’t get enough hours to make the drive. I enjoyed my job as in customer service
good,It was a family! Managers were awesome but sometimes it felt like I was doing their job. I really felt a part of the team. They are flexible with schedule but it’s hard to become a full time employee
good,"Most front end coworkers were my age. Had alot of fun. Weeks are slow but weekends are alot busier. I learned alot and got to meet a lot of interesting people and customers. I miss the job and wish they had a full time cashier position but they didn't. Management was great, I got along with everyone too. Recommend working there. Atmosphere was great and laid back, but we worked hard too."
good,great place to work I love the people its a huge family here but some of the management isn't too great such as any other job! Bass pro made some major changes to cabela's since the buyout you do get weekly pay now like I said not a terrible job def a great part time opportunity
good,Ive worked here for the past two years they work around my college classes and everyone is friendly good discounts and work with company reps often customers awesome and always friendly
good,I truly enjoyed working there.  I would still be there if things had not have changed the way they did.   I truly miss it. Would go back to inventory in a heartbeat.
good,"It’s a very good place to work great benifits and employee discounts. You get to meet people from all over United States during pheasant opener, that is probably my favorite part of working there so far."
good,"The Distribution Center is where I worked. There, the pace is fairly fast. It does take a little getting used to. There is a lot of product in as many different locations. You are directed with voice activated equipment to aid you in your task."
good,I enjoyed working at Cabela's. I meet allot of very sweet& loving people. The outfitters & managers are very hard workers & are very understanding. I had fun working here.the work environment was wonderful and never had an bad day while I was working here.
good,"As PRN clothing sales for a store opening, the Cabela's team offered many resources in teaching the staff about the products being offered that way we could be as knowledgeable for the customers as possible. Opportunities to move up in the company were present"
good,"Cabelas is a great place to work.  The people are great and everyone really does their best to support one another. An extremely positive environment.  If people are looking for a positive place to work, Cabelas is the place I would highly recommend!!!"
good,Try it out for yourself and see what it’s like to work for a company that does it right. You won’t be dissappointed. Open environment roles to fill and a clientele base that will blow your mind
good,"I liked the job a decent amount, I liked the people I worked with and overall the fast paced job setting was nice. But with the competetiveness of trying to get customers to sign up with the credit cards was very challenging as I am a shy person and am not the greatest at ""selling"" things to people in that manner."
good,"Cabela's is a great place to work! You're helping families have a wonderful experience whether it's camping, fishing, hunting, Cabela's has everything and as an employee or ""outfitter"" you learn a lot about the product and get a nice discount when you shop there."
good,"I have worked at Cabela's since the end of 2008 and although I had a slow start, I was soon able to move up in management. Everyone is always eager to help with everything. I have had nothing but good times here."
good,"The Cabela's Distribution center here in Prarie du Chien Features three vast warehouses of items. i was only in one of the three for the duration of my stay. i used the cabs to go between home and work, and i was never late for a shift thanks to it. i'm not sure what to say about management here, everything was coordinated with fine leadership, even though i rarely got to speak with my boss or supervisor. The Training was Great, everything was thoroughly explained right away, the technology wasn't hard to master or control, outside of a few disturbances here and there that interfered with said technology, and i was never overworked, if anything if i felt tired, it was my own fault for not drinking enough water during breaks. i rarely had any reason to complain outside of the occasional ache from constantly moving, or standing. the breaks never offered much in the way of relief, just a way of getting more energy to keep going. The job didn't require much social activity, i rarely ended up speaking with any of my coworkers about anything, mostly focusing on my own work and going to get a new roll of tickets. This is probably a perfect entry-level job for high-schoolers, but it requires a distinct attitude. from a personal standpoint you shouldn't be in an adult workplace, if you're going to distract coworkers, endanger their lives in a prank, or goof off. Cabela's is an honorable company, and it deserves to get respectful, Mature employees who can get the job done correctly with no error."
good,The original CABELA’S was an amazing place to work and grow with the company. Great benefits and vacation time for all position within the company. Family values
good,"I absolutely LOVED working at Cabela's. All of my coworkers and most of the management were great to work with. Always very friendly and if you had questions, they were quick to answer. Never really had any problems there."
good,I really enjoy my time at Cabela's! Great leadership and great culture! The managers take time to get to know you and train you on company process's. The best part of the job is the people.
good,A great place to work if you like low stress retail enviroments and like the outdoor culture. Management is really friendly and the coworkers are just as nice.
good,Cabelas was a very fun place to work and was also a good place to Learn discipline and diligence and how to do things the right way so that the customers would appreciate how clean and set up every thing is
good,"Cabela's in Ammon, Idaho is a great place to work. It has a good environment and a great team to work with. They are very upbeat and very understanding. Not only are the managers very friendly but so is the majority of the outfitters."
good,"Cabela's is an exciting place to work at where you can talk about your passions.  The management team is thoughtful and willing to help you out.  If you do not know something about a topic, you can always find someone who will be willing to teach you."
good,Easy to get along with everyone and is very productive and very active and  will keep you on your toes. Everyone is friendly and understanding and helpful when you are in need of help or need something explained.
good,Fast paced friendly environment.  Team environment with customer service at heart.  Add on sales with 4 most focus with club membership offers.  Team takes care of each other.
good,Very different from other retailers. Very active and fun work environment. Would recommend to anyone seeking a slower pace work environment.
good,"This job is a fairly easy job to do as far as helping customers and interacting with co-workers. The company itself is very inviting and they make the environment welcoming to not only customers but employees as well. They take care of everyone and everything that comes through the doors and makes sure that everyone is satisfied by the end of their shopping experience. The hardest part of this job, I would say, is making sure every customer finds what he/she needs. You can not always satisfy every person that walks through the doors but as long as you make the experience memorable that person will most likely want to come back in the future. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to see all the different types of people, animals, and children that come in the store."
good,Worlds Foremost Bank provides an environment for employee growth.  Management is overly focused on enhancing employees knowledge and supports you at all times.
good,"Typical day is providing legendary customer service by helping customers find the products that they need and are seeking. I learned how to use the AS/400 computer system and learned more about state regulations. Management is great. Co-workers are great. There are no hard parts of the job. Most stressful part can be trying to resolve an issue with a customer, but I would not call it hard. Most enjoyable part of the job is all day, from when I walk through the door and onto the floor to when I leave at night. I enjoy being at Cabelas."
good,First job learned new things everyday..Best experience to have under your belt for manager exp. Customer service diffrent software educated you on alot work enviroment is very good different ethnicity you get to work with .
good,"A typical day st work clock in on the computer and teleset and start taking customer calls answering there questions and placing orders for them."
good,"A typical day at work consists of answering calls and taking orders, working with credit cards, gun licenses etc. and also ocassionally making calls to customer informing them of status of their orders."
good,"Great place to work, Amazing employees, everyone was willing to help everyone. One of the places i MISS working for and hated to leave"
good,Working at Cabelas was a great experience i loved my co workers and advanced my knowledge in the outdoors. The most enjoyable part of my job at cabelas was the interaction with the customers and staff. i loved being able to answer question and help make there outdoor experience great.
good,"Excellent team atmosphere, great with their employees treat you like on of the cabalas family, stress free family place to work at where they make the customers feel like they are also part of the total cabalas experiance."
good,A great place to work for any type of person because they have so many departments. It is always busy and a lot of great people work there with a lot of wonderful stories to tell.
good,I loved working at Cabela's. Awesome crew and great management. Great work environment to be in. I couldn't have asked for a better job while going to school.
good,"The management here left more to be desired. They didn't communicate with each other at all as a management team. 6 months into working for the company they had a company wide restructure that forced me to be laid off as full time, but kept all seasonal and part time outfitters. I was one of over 900 outfitters nationwide to be laid off in less than a week."
good,The company was a great company to work for if you love the outdoors.
good,"Working at Cabelas distribution was a great experience . I learned how to self motivate myself and make my work into an enjoyable process. I would start my day in picking and work my way to sorting, then to packaging and onto other jobs. Management was great never had any problems . My co workers were of a variety of ages , ranging from 18 to 40 , still everyone got along . The hardest part of the job was working late . The most enjoyable part of the job was doing something new everyday and never getting bored ."
good,"I worked for Cabelas just over a year only leaving to stay home with my newborn. They are a great company. We were given opportunity to earn bonuses and  sometimes had daily prizes. The management was good for the most part. The like to play ""musical managers"" and change departments a lot. They worked well around my schedule. The owners take great pride in the company and woluld even tour the stores and give out prizes and have a party. I loved my coworkers. All in all it was a wonderful place to work."
good,"Working at cabelas is fun everyday with new skills and knowledge learned everyday. Working in a fun enivorment with great people, I enjoy helping others and learnign of their adventures."
good,"My Typical day at work changed every few days. the leads set up where they wanted the employees to work for the day. There were a few different areas to work at in the resturant. Cashier, Grill, Sandwhichs, Soup and special station, pizza station, along with dishwasher, lobby, and food prep. At the end of the night we picked two to three people to take down garbages and boxs. All the employees helped eachother out whenever needed to make things flow at a better pace. Management was very respectful and cared for each employee with the same respect. Co-workers were always friendly and always helped eachother out if asked or looked like we needed help. The hardest part of the job was being fast paced during the rushs because the lines would be intense exspecially during the holidays. I made every moment as enjoyable as i could at cabela's it was a great place to work."
good,"Cabelas is full of fun, friendly people and the opportunity for advancement is great if you work hard. Plenty of room for growth, and the company values are what every company should strive for."
good,"is a specialty retailer. The company is a direct marketer of hunting, fishing camping and outdoor items related. The company operates through three business segments: Direct, Retail and Financial Services. It provides services to customers who enjoy the outdoor lifestyle by supplying outdoor products through a multi-channel retail business consisting of Retail and Direct business segments."
good,"A typical day at work consist of answering phones, customer interaction, placing customer orders, processing new items, planograms, merchandising."
good,Training was excellent and the job was fun. Interacting with customers and telling them about the latest technology. Hearing great stories and building relationships. Management was okay but needed a lot more communication and cooperation between them and the staff.
good,I worked at Cabela's for one month as I was waiting for a desired position with another company to be approved. For the 4 weeks I worked there I really enjoyed the customers and their attitudes in the environment. It was more like a museum than a store which made it fun! I would definatley work there again.
good,For the most your job is easy. Does not require much supervision. As with most jobs your boss will give directions. Morning meetings are informative and can be fun. Like looking at all the cool stuff. Cutomer meet and greet awesome.
good,"I love working at Cabelas."
good,Cabelas Distribution Center was an amazing place to work at they provided me with an amazing opportunity and I learned new things and I was proud to be apart of their team
good,"Working at Cabelas was fun and full of new activities. Everyday you either learned something new or met someone who really impacted your life, in the best ways."
good,Generally I can't really say to much bad about the place. It is a low stress environment. Typical day is working freight out to the floor from either coming for our twice weekly truck or from our backstock of items. Management is very approachable with any issues you have or suggestions for improvement. It is an interesting time to work there at the moment as we are transitioning into a Bass Pro/Cabela's store with all the extra merch coming in and the lack of awareness on the corporate level.
good,"Everyone that I currently work with is very down to earth and knows what they are talking about. Everyone has experience in some area in and outside of the store. If they don't have experience, they are able to radio over to some one who does. Overall, very helpful for customers with questions."
good,"My day will be helping customers with their camping equipment and getting cabelas visa club cards,cleaning and facing products all day long.The hardest thing on the job is standing all day for some people.I most enjoyable part of my job is working with the best co-workers."
good,"Lots of fun, great co-workers and always learning. Always able to interact with the customer listen to their stories, their wants, what they are looking for, and the best part is when they leave with a smile."
good,I had no intention of leaving Cabela's.. But after they went into partnership with Bass Pro Shop a lot of the warehouse work was out sourced. Which caused a major loss of hours and shifts for a lot of staff including myself.  I stayed as long as I could in hopes that things would go back to normal.. When they did not I had no choice but to give my notice.

good,"As an Inventory Coordinator a typical day involves creating PO's for Retail Stores and the DC's, updating and reviewing backorders and past due reports, communicating with vendors about merchandise. I learned how to do everything listed above. As far as the workplace goes it is friendly and someone is always willing to help you resolve an issue. The hardest part of the job was learning how to work through the past due report. The most enjoyable part was the friendliness and teamwork."

good,"Was a fun job and and had a good atmosphere. Loved the people I worked with and was sad to see it close. Hardest part of the job was during the summer when we were the busiest. The easiest part of the job was in the winter, because not many people came in for smoothies."

When my guests came in to shop they came with a glisten in there eyes. Management and coworkers were equally pleasant we all enjoyed the out doors. The hardest part of the job was not having enough arms to help everyone during hunting season. most enjoyable part was the atmosphere."

good,Very good company to work for. So flexible and understanding!
good,"A typical day at work would include us coming into our scheduled departments for the day, and looking for red tags or scanning products that we should have up on the floor and either finding where it's hiding at and place it in it's set location, or checking the history on the product and making sure inventory count is not off, if it is then we being the process of rack verifying the product."
good,"Work days were fun at Cabela's, you started at 9 and would usually get done around 6 or 7 unless you wanted over-time then you could stay until 9 or 10. I learned how to use scanners to back stock and to stock merchandise onto the floor, also i learned how to unload and reload trucks that were filled with merchandise. The night management crew at Cabela's was amazing they always took care of us as a team, either with breaks, pizza, or rewarded days off. All of the co-workers at Cabela's were hard workers, and would help you any way that they could. The hardest part of my job was learning all of the departments of Cabela's and where merchandise went how much was to be on the floor at one time, what to do if an item was overstocked. The most enjoyable part of the job was finally getting the hang of all the procedures and being able to get merchandise onto the floor as fast and work as hard as the guys that have been there longer then me, and being able to enjoy the meal rewards, and to be a part of that company. "

There is a very good culture, considering the company aims towards a certain type of customer. The hardest part of the day is, first coming in for the day.  The reason for that is I have to see where we sit at, as far as production. That way I can make plans for the day. The most enjoyable part is seeing everything getting executed, that way the next day will start where it needs to."

good,"Cabela’s was a great company, now owned by Bass Pro.  The original business plan for Cabela’s was great but as the owners aged and others took greater parts, the company went down some.  It became somewhat of a good-ole-boy system where women were hired based on their appearance.   I was shocked to have Store Managers actually bring women to me and direct me to hire them because they felt men would buy more merchandise from attractive women.  I loved working there but did not agree with some of the business philosophy as it existed."
good,Cabela’s was a fun place to work and it provided good retail experience. There were more responsibilities than the average retail job so I would consider it a valuable job experience
good,Loved working here. Friendly Management but you needed to do your job. Good job if you like helping customers with getting product or missing product delivered.
good,The flexible is great!! The hours were based on your schedule and availability! The work environment was nice and clean. Everyone was so helpful and friendly
good,"I loved the competitive environment of this job. They would post your status, some people liked it others didn't; however, if you are a competitive person and like to be the best at your job then this a good job for you."
good,I started off in retail transportation and was moved to Haz after a short while. Haz was more computer based and more knowledgeable rather than just stocking boxes into the trailer.

good,loved this job. made alot of friends. something new always going on.was easy to work with everyone.sometimes the drive to work was the hardest part of the day.

good,"Cabelas is worth the while, we are a family there. its fun to work at the store, you will meet a lot of interesting people. "
good,"Every morning started off with the morning meeting, which went over the current events happening in the store. Then we split off into our own departments where we set up for the opening shifts. The management in all departments are absolutely exceptional. They are all, by far, some of the best managers I have ever worked under. Everyone got along with one another, which really boosted the morality of the store all together. The most difficult part of the job was staying organized through the holidays as we got increasingly busy, but with the help of all of my coworkers, we all got through the season wonderfully."
good,"I really like jobs were I can interact with guest. I like jobs were I am rewarded for doing well. There was a possibility for me to move up into management, but I decided on college."

good,"great company and great people all around. very organized very productive and very great customer service to people, workers and customers. they know what they are doing and the managers are amazing"
good,The has many gray areas. The incentive program didn't work well for me.  The company provided great service to those who needed their cars repaired but the work load is endless with no paid days off. There is PTO but it isn't offered all the time or when we really needed it.
good,"Fun, organized, competitive workplace, with laughs and always greeting people with a smile, making sure they found everything they needed. Constantly going and always doing something."

good,"Cabela's was a great place to work, I was able to learn new skills and use my previous knowledge adequately. I looked forward to coming into work everyday!"
good,"-Great place to work / awesome atmosphere"
good,"Cabela's is a great company to work for. I love the environment and the managers are usually pretty good. I just think this company has integrity and treats their employees fairly, the one thing I didn't like though is they kind of force you to push their credit card upon customers."
good,"A typical day at Convergys were pretty laid back and easy. I had customers that called in and already knew what they wanted, and I was done with them under five minutes. Then you had customers that didn't know what they wanted or knew but didn't know the item number, so it made my job difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job I would say was getting to interact with the customer their not just calling to place an order, their wanting to know about your day, hows life. That makes you feel special and like someone cares."
good,Cabelas is a job i would go back to again and again. Its a great place to work. Everyone is super friendly and kind. Its a store you never know who is gonna come in.. Iv seen a country music super star in there a time or two.
good,"Very fast paced work, I loved working there the people was great and the management was to.  I helped open the distribution center it was a great experience.

good,I love it here. The staff and management are awesome and very funny and helpful. It feels like a big family and all are very great to train with. Lots to learn but they don't push or rush you.
good,"Hunting, fishing, camping, hiking, and water sports. Huge selections of guns and all accessories needed. Fun place to work and family oriented. Everyone takes good care of each other."
good,great people just got rid of the overnights and thats all i could work at that time. but besides that everyone is so nice and laid back i would recommend this company to anyone.

good,Great management.  Supportive environment for professional and personal development.  Engaging sales philosophy and retail environment.  Knowledge salespersons.
good,I've worked here for over a year behind the gun counter. It's great to work with so many like minded individuals and help the customer​s. The company itself as a customer there was always great.
good,Cabela's is a wonderful place to work. The people are so great and willing to do whatever it takes to help you out. very knowledgeable people and its more like a family....sad i left.

good,"Encourages employees to improve knowledge, abilities and skills."
good,Cabela's Provides you with outfitters who know what you maybe looking for from a new gun to camping and hunting equipment.
good,"Being apart of the Cabela's world was a nice place to work for. Everyone was welcoming and accepting. Didn't matter who you were. The only concern was how many staff were being scheduled at a time in the department I was working in. There should be at least two people working per shift. It was hard being the only one at times. Knowing I was working in my department, and there were different sections. It was hard to keep up when you had to do tasks, helping customers and and trying to keep the department looking decent. When sometimes me or  be the only one scheduled or not enough people hired on. Pretty much my little synopsis of my personal experience at Cabela's."
good,I enjoyed my time at Cabelas and enjoyed most everyone I had the opportunity to work with.  Managements is hit or miss but for the most part its management like any other retail store.
good,"This is the job to have,great co workers,good money,discounts,free lunches on holidays,they treat you with respect the managers,an leads are down to earth they don't think they are better than you plus the co workers go out of there way to do whatever they can to help out anyone"

good,"I liked Cabela's .  Customers were great, employees were nice. Great store.  Customer service manager was the best.  Lots of fun with managers."
good,"This was my first job outside of the military. I stocked merchandise in the warehouse and on the sales floor. I maintained a clean work environment and scanned items to certain locations. I would also find merchandise for customers and go back into the warehouse and bring it to them on the sales floor. I enjoyed learning about what the company sold. Sometimes, the customers taught me what some of the stuff did."

They have always been an honest and fair pay company.Typical day is fun and you are always learning about new product. The co-workers are nice as well as the managers.

There is so much  you can learn from this company. I have learned a lot about myself and how other people think. Not everyone thinks or acts alike and getting to know people here opened my mind a lot more. The management is great. They know how to work around your schedules and they are very open to new ideas that the employees have. Being in retail isn't necessarily easy, but the most challenging part about the job is dealing with all the different people out there. You will always have people with attitudes and you just need to learn to deal with it. The most enjoyable part about my job is the co-workers. They make work fun."

good,Cabela's was a fun experience in my job experience. Pay was pretty descent. Love my cabela's team! Management was awesome. The only bad thing was long hours.
good,"Awesome company with great culture"
good,"great while it lasted but was seasonal so was short lived."
good,"Great environment to work in, great people. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people. The company is really relaxed help people."
good,I love working there I want to go back. When you go on break you have to go through security. And it can take your whole lunch. Could pay more
good,enjoyed all employees and customers  looked forward to going to work
good,"Sometimes it's hard to work when im not feeling well or im sick because you can lost focus on your job but that barely happen though,yet i still need to go and work bacause that is my responsibility.I learned LOTS in Cabelas like using those RF Guns on SAP.Picking,binning of items,ang using a Forklift,Order Picker ang a Power Jack.The Management are well-mannered,they Respect you in anyway possible.I did'nt found any hard times working at Cabelas because i loved what I'm doing.The most enjoyable part is when i always used Order Pickers and HELP other co-workers when they need my help."
good,My days were always busy i made amazing friends management was always nice especially our GM he was awesome my co workers always had my back since we were there since the store opened we all knew each other. The hardest part of the job was doing a thousand things at once if you were the only one of two people in the department but you find someway to manage. I think the most enjoyable part was i knew when i went to work someone was always going to make me laugh no matter how rough a day i was having my manager always knew if there was something wrong with her employees and would pull them out of the way to just see if they needed someone to talk too.
good,"Hardworking, Loyal, Teamwork! Great Training!"
good,"Fast paced environment, very helpful crew. I learned that Customer Service is a plus. Management very helpful and willing to teach. Co-workers were willing to help out in different departments when needed. The hardest part of the job was inventory. The most enjoyable part of the job was making the customer happy."
good,"goes buy pretty quick,how to work with items,management  is pretty nice,we get along fine ,is waiting for the others to get done with there job to move on to the next reaching the end of the day to go home"
good,I loved the disciplined and coordinated management teams of each department. I appreciated the extensive training I received in all areas that I expressed interest in. I loved the store and I loved the fun atmosphere. I had a great team of co-workers. The only reason I considered leaving was because it was a permanent part-time position.
good,"Get to work clock in and hop on a register, stay at the register for 3.5-4 hours then get a break then get back on the register. When closing time comes around our department starts cleaning the area. Management is wonderful. Created wonderful relationships with each and every person there. Co-workers are great. We look after each other, our motto is we are a family and no one is left behind. Hardest part of the job is to keep a smile on my face when I have a bad day but I learned to work through that obstacle. I would say that the most enjoyable part of my job would be that after we close the store we all share stories of our day then we all go out for food and just socialize. I learned that to have a good day it starts with your attitude from the time you come into the store to the time you leave the store."
good,"I've worked at several retail jobs and by far, working for Cabelas was the best experience I've had in retail. In general, Cabelas is a company that gives you what you give them. So, if you work hard then they work hard with you. I never had any issues with management; I felt like they were compassionate and understanding of the fact that their employees had lives outside of their jobs."
good,"I learned the great benefits of having a Cabelas Credit Card, I learned so much about retail. My co-workers were diverse and I loved that about Cabelas. The hardest time was just those days they were slow but maintained my area and the department well organized and its place."
good,"Working at Cabelas was a great experience for me since it allowed me to work with other who have the same passions in life as I do. I enjoyed showing and introducing the sport of archery to young children and watch how fast they learn and how they get excited when they just learned something new and did a good job at it. The atmosphere in which I work was fun, exciting, and I always had an enjoyable day."
good,great place to work great people ok hours and scheduling ok management
good,"I like the job, the people I work with are very nice."
good,Most fun I ever had at work. If you don't like rejection this is not the job for you though.
good,Great place for benefits.  Employee recognition.  Great discounts
good,"The people and environment were Great!"
good,Great place to work. If you enjoy the outdoors and wildlife scene you'll love working here. Fun environment to work in with great advancement opportunities.
good,"For Cabelas, first thing I did was to stock the shelves before the store opened, clean the floors. I learned how to us a RF gun for scanning the products back in storage, how to drive a forklift. The management was awesome they really got to know all the employees the best way they could, was always there to help you when you needed it. The co workers were perfect to get along with. The hardest apart the job was probably trying to keep all the shelves stock to please the customers. The most enjoyable part was just being apart of the team and learning more stuff about the outdoors. That I still use today when I go out."
good,"This company was great to work for! I loved everyone I worked with, as well as the managers. It was difficult leaving, but unfortunely I relocated. My job was a customer service outfitter. Along with performing cashiering duties, I was the one to come to for returns/exchanges/in store pickup etc. Any inquiries could be brought to us and we were glad to help. We also shipped customers products we had in the store to their homes, and if we didnt have it in the store we have an in store Kiosk we used to ship customers what they needed from Distribution Centers. The hardest part of my job was deciding the amount to return to customers. Having the 90 day policy in place, once they were outside the time frame we were allowed to use our discretion to take care of the customer. It could be from giving them a depreciated amount that they originally paid for to store credit for their items."
good,"Lots of training, and fun place to work.  People and management are nice and willing to work with you."
good,"Good hard working employees and managers."
good,First thing when you show up is looking at the board and seeing what tasks are to be done for the day or week. And making sure that you are able to take them on entirely so that you still can do your normal tasks for the day..
good,I would  handle returns and exchanges. I also handled customer complaints and helped made them right.
good,I was a seasonal cashier at Cabela's. It's definitely a family-type environment where everyone is very respectful. I got along with everyone including my managers. My job as a cashier mostly consisted of just staying on task and working well with customers.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is being part of such a great team. We are encouraged by management to have fun, smile and enjoy our jobs."
good,"A typical day at work would be, steady paced, and always provided customer service. I learned how to use RPI and other websites that were needed, on the cash register, in-case a customer brought up an item that didn't have a tag. I could look up the item, rather then calling & waiting for another employee to bring up the same item. The management & co workers were extremely helpful and friendly. they help you every step of the way, to get you prepared for what you need to do, and get done. The hardest part of this job was keeping up with the customers and making sure everyone is helped and satisfied. The most enjoyable part of this job was talking to customers and learning about their road trips or talking about past hunting trips. Some regular customers would even bring in pictures after their trip to show and share."
good,Cabela's is the worlds foremost outfitter. They are the best retail facility that gives incentives to the employees but also gives back to the public. They donate funds to different societies and foundations and provide training and free seminars inside the store. They truly are a fun place to work with lots of incentives.
good,"Outfit customer with proper footwear, answer phones, customer service, stock shelves"
good,"Everyone there is super nice, when someone is in need of help everyone is very supportive in helping anyone that needs something."
good,"A typical day at work is always fun, can never go through the whole day without a smile on your face. I have learned that if you stay positive at work, then you can have a fun and exciting day at work. The management is phenomenal! I like how the managers are always there for their workers and help them with whatever they are having troubles with. My co-workers are very friendly; on my first day of work , my co-workers came up to me and introduced themselves and asked how I was liking the job so far. That right there makes me love this job more and more. The hardest part of the job is where customers see prices online but can only get those prices if they order online. So that can get frustrating. The most enjoyable part of the job is just being able to have fun at work."
good,I helped open the Cabela's in Allen.  It is a fun place to work.  You meet a lot of nice people.  Plus wearing jeans and tennis shoes to work is always very comfortable.
good,Highly enjoyed working for Cabela's. Very fun environment and had excellent bosses.

good,Loved working with Cabelas employees to provide good customer service.
good,"A typical day at work is fun. I get to talk to cutomers all over the United States, they are very good natured. The hardest part of the job is remembering all of my resources before transfering to another department! My co-workers are all very nice and willing to help me out. Management is very good at communicating and helping me help the customers"
good,A typical day of work was working full-time 8 hour shifts greeting customers along with taking customers food orders in the deli along with at times having to watch the other crew members and to also make sure that tasks were completed and done on time while the supervisor was busy with another task on the sales floor.
good,Great fun place to work! Very structured but also fun! Very busy constantly moving!
good,Everyone was very nice to me and help when they were told too. I would start work at 11:00pm and work until 7:00am. this was a seasonal job. I love this job tho.
good,"had fun meeting different people...work atmosphere was great.. co-workers were great,management was awesome,"
good,great nightshift upbeat fast paced. unload a truck sort it put freight away on the floor...back stock and then go home..
good,"Typical day was working in hot warehouses in the summer time, but keeping busy all the time takes your mind off of the heat. I love the job and learning new things all the time."
good,Cabelas has a friendly environment and its a place you just want to be. I loved interacting with customer and other outfitters.
good,"I love Cabela's Inc here in Lincoln, NE. Our phone calls are monitored to make sure we are giving our customers the best service and treating them courteously. They will tell us whether we did a great job or give us ideals on how to improve so we do better next time. They never make you feel bad. They will give us a 30 minute training class on things they think we can do to improve sales always being positive and enthusiast about how we're doing. They have contests and prizes. We are always learning from Cabela's how they are improving products and services for the customer. I love talking to people and take Cabela's ideals for improving myself to give better service to heart."
