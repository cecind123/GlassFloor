rating,review
bad,Owners were racist. I didn't like working there. They didn't train me very well and treated me poorly. I am a hard worker but didn't feel like I was appreciated.
bad,"Cooking, cleaning, taking care of customers. Restocking, refill for next shift all for $7.25 an hour. Pay really needs to be upped. Training didn’t really happen. They just put you out there."
bad,"Fantastic place to work full of life , the environment and safety culture was good . It only that African in any position are not too good , they use sentiment to do their recruitment which is not fair enough ."
bad,"I enjoyed working here everyday, I enjoyed talking to customers and getting to know them. Everyday wasn’t the same that’s what I liked about that job, we always challenged ourselves as employees to do the best."
bad,gave me a 17 hours shift and when I say I can't they say if u can't then quit and of course none of the at is on the pay check. They only give me legal hours on the lay check which is not true and there are no lunch breaks not even for a minute and no bathroom bathroom only for 1 minute for a 10 hour shift the worst gas station and wprst experience no gloves to change trash and worst tratment
bad,They have great opportunities and great pay just there’s certain people there that ruin the job for everyone and just make you not want to show up. Thank you.
bad,"If you want to be bullied, never have the same hours and quit/fired because this place is so horrible and breaks many California Labor laws once you actually work there, then this place is for you. Poor owners probably have no clue as to what goes on in there."
bad,too many things were wrong. one no safety measures with a gas spill. mice problem on my food the owner just laughed at me. needed time off for my sick dad first said yes than said no. I have pictures too prove all my claims. never got paid for vacation pay when they said it would be ok.
bad,"This company will work you to death. They pay the lowest they possibly can. Just a few days of paid vacation for full time employees. Zero benefits for those who work part time. If an employee gets injured or sick they will find whatever loop hole they need to fire that employee. They do not promote based on skill and education. Friends and families are promoted over those with skill and education. Because this company has nothing to offer, the employees it attracts are uneducated and undesirable to work with."
bad,Bad company overall to work for. They don’t care about they employees and treat us like nasty. The manager very rude and disrespectful. Yelling in front of customers and at customers.
bad,They pay was good and my co workers  were friendly  but managment  was horrible. They would leave you to do a double shift with out asking. And they had favorites.
bad,Constantly being micromanaged and the owner was constantly making you feel like were not fast enough. Having to work for your hourly wage. Always having you do a task and then 10 minutes later assign another one the gets angry cause you did complete the other 20 tasks that were assigned. Only allowed 2 minutes per customer
bad,Awful man to work for. No respect for his workers never gave acknowledgment of a job well done. Lied about future advancements threw things at workers
bad,They preach about how much they want you to move up but it's all a lie. Empty promises. They do not care about your well being.  They work you until you cant handle it anymore and eventually quit. The people they do move up are normally inadequate for the jobs standards. So many people are unfairly treated at this job I literally till this day still receive checks from lawsuit settlements of other employees being treated unfairly or illegally.illegally
bad,"Bad owner was no good with running store"
bad,"No direction, no expectations, poorly managed. Such a disappointment for a company with so much money. Supervisors don’t want to fix anything because it cuts into their bonuses."
bad,"Worked for chevron for 2 years and for those 2 years I was a field specialist in Odessa Tx. Oh, by the way, notice how I left each chevron with a small ""c"". No matter how hard I worked or what I did it didn't matter. My 2 bosses there at the time mocked me at looked down on me. I even was called an idiot in front of everyone by Lee after working tirelessly on like 30 wells that days and having my partner sleep in his truck. They then fired me on 3 reasons, 1: I did not know how a boiler operated or how to perform functions on it. That was a total lie. 2: I failed the retake exam I did. Another total lie. And 3: I did not know how to gauge a tank, probably the easiest thing to do on the job. Once again....another total lie about me. September 23, 2015 I was called by Lee to the chevron headquarters in Midland Tx and on that day they fired me. To this day the reason I think they let me go was due to some health issues I was having. My advice to all who is out there....do not work for this low life company! All they will do is invite you in and then leave you in the dust! Oh, I also moved 1800 miles away from my family and friends just to work for them and they fired me for those 3 reasons that they made up. DONT WORK FOR THEM!!!! I don't buy their gas, grease, and I certainly don't buy their oil! I tell everyone your better off putting water in your car or truck then that gas and oil from chevron."
bad,I worked here for 2 days and then found another job. I was hired for register and later found out that I was a full time custodian while co workers we're inside doing register. I cleaned and cleaned for 8 hours straight till it felt like my legs were gonna fall off! Idk if the chick training me was doing it on purpose but it definitely felt like she was. So be aware when they say your hired for register!
bad,customers very rude. management sucks and manager is very disrespectful. no overtime no holidays off no shift rotations and very rude employees. employees are always high at work. not a place to work at unless you like getting treated like trash
bad,They suck. They really really just suck. They accuse every black person of stealing and they watch them like a hawk when they come into the store. Racist and rude. I am disgusted to have seen such horrid slander on one race. They are disgusting too.
bad,Manager doesn't take time to listen to the employee always changing the schedule on us without asking if we had important things to do sliding around corner trying to hear what we're talking about.giving the employee pay role deduction for the manager mistakes and stays in the office all on the phone when the manager should be helping her employee.
bad,Horrible at taking care of their workers. Always have horrible shifts to offer. I would never work for this company again. The benefits are not good either.
bad,Chevron used to be a great place to work for and probably still would be if the owner of the company changed completely who he is.. they do not offer any paid time off you work every day of the year the store never closes no paid holidays and no paid vacations
bad,"On a typical day I would clock in and get my paperwork ready, you count the cigarettes, cash register, lotto etc. you'll be counting that at your end of shift as well, after that you can start assisting customers (first priority) then when things get slow you start cleaning, organizing and stocking making coffee. you only get a 30 min lunch. every shift is a little bit different as is every gas station."
bad,"For a person that will like to learn that field in customer service and cash handling is good but not to stay for long time."
bad,"This location was horrible,  mainly stemming from management. Lazy workers, no equipment maintenance up keep with cheap owners. So if you have job ethic or work hard you  shouldnt work here."
bad,"low pay, treated not the best, short staffed, expect you not to have a life outside of this job. No sense of benefit to what you’re doing. Unorganized"
bad,Management was the biggest problem as well as organization. They really didn't care about the employees. When a employee tried to call out because they had a burning fever they were forced to come to work or lose their job.
bad,The company had switched owners during the time of my employment and the new owners  did not meet the prior goals of the company in any way. I was very disappointed in the way they treated their employees also.
bad,"Everything is about average or below average about this company. Average salary and benefits, no flexible hours by any means. no opportunity to work remotely. Minimum annual raise. The only thing they are excellent at is advertising themselves."
bad,the company is terrible does not care about workers and does not take in account the people that come in and destroy the store or the bathrooms and the employees are expected to put on a smile and be nice no matter what it is not right what so ever if a customer is acting a fool and rude they should be treated accordingly
bad,"Bad management , forced everyone to be on call if u dont come in they write u up . Slave drivers . They dont care about family life ..........................................................................................."
bad,They will only hire family members or close friends who need a job. They'll hire a random person and have them work 3-5 hours maybe. They will send them home and call the new employee and tell them they don't need you any more and they found someone else to hire. It happened to me at the chevron in kelso on allen street. It was a full time passion and played me pretty much.
bad,Unless you intend on becoming a franchise operator with a large amount of cash to invest then this is only a basic minimum wage type job. I was going for a franchise operator and trained in a special program but due to sudden and drastic corporate restructuring at the time it became unfeasible for me to continue to do so.
bad,This place started out ok. But with managment it was hard to be yourself. They don't care about their employees like they should. They always place rediculouse expectations on the employees but then they show the total opisit.
bad,"Working there was a joke, They expected alot from you for very little pay, when i was hired he said in 90 days i would recieve a raise never gave me one"
bad,"I don't like working here because our manager doesnt know what he is doing, doesnt listen to any of us and doesnt care about our safety. I am looking for another job solely because of him."
bad,Management was terrible. Would not recommend working there. no chance for advancement. hours were inconsistent. was always treated with a lack of respect. would work two graveyards then be expected to work the following days at different times.
bad,10.50 an hour. Management was rude and unprofessional. I was only payed for 8 hours a day but worked 8.25 without breaks. This was a franchise not a corporate store.
bad,I honestly wouldn’t even buy my gas there. The employees are rude to the customers at every location I’ve been too. They always look like they are high on something ( meth probably )
bad,"Unprofessional management , toxic work environment , no breaks even though the law requires them , the only way you'll get a break is if you are a smoker and have to have a smoke break . Managers dont help, and any issues you have will never be kept confidential ."
bad,No room to advance. Managers don't care about days you need off even when discussing request  1 week in advance. The job wouldn't be so bad if the management staff was a bit more proactive and attentive to their surroundings and attempted to acknowledge good work when its being done.The atmosphere is fear driven unless you are friendly with the right people(i.e. manager) Management turnover rate is horrible.
bad,"Very poor management and employees. sometimes my hours would drop so low it made it hard to even get a pay check. Drama filled work place, rude customers."
bad,It was the worst job I have ever had to date. there is literally nothing left i have to say good or otherwise because its not worth hearing about trust me
bad,No room to advance. Do not care about days you need off. Schedule is based off of a lazy manager that does not look at days off requested. No set schedule.
bad,The job at Chevron wouln't be so bad if the management staff was a bit more proactive and attentive to their surroundings and attempted to acknowledge good work when its being done.  The atmosphere is fear driven unless you are friendly with the right people (i.e. manager).
bad,This company doesn't care if you get hurt on the job I called out and had to go to the ER and the manager asked if I was still going to make it for my shift.
bad,Working for Chevron was too regimented and boring.  Everyday was the same grind.  I would not recommend this job if you are a creative type of person.  The office politics here are unpleasant.
bad,"The chevron I work at was Private own no benefits also with  no vacation pay and ,  no longer worth the stressful environment. The way the economy is no one who is a decent worker is willing to stay in the environment this job provides for the pay."
bad,"Fired without warming while on suspension for missing 1 day of work. Bad hours, Management favors people. No control of employees, People would leave whenever they got a chance because the manager had favored them."
bad,"The benefits would seem okay with vacation pay and 75% tuition reimbursement, but the benefits are no longer worth the stressful environment. The way the economy is no one who is a decent worker is willing to stay in the environment this job provides for the pay."
bad,"They didnt pay me for my overtime and they didnt send in my w2 so i got way to much money taken out of my check for taxes. They dont let you take lunches and cant provide something as simple as a schedule. They expect you to work 17days in a row, with no day off, the dont compensate you for it and then get mad at you when you take a lunch break. They hire their own children who sit all day with their face in their phones but get mad at you for taking a mandatory break."
bad,"Nothing that I can say about Chevron as a company, that is positive. "
bad,"Chevron was one the the worse company I have ever worked for "
bad,"Terrible place to work. Bad management, poor scheduling, bad attitudes and improper workplace behavior. The owner is a hot head and fires people for not taking out the trash when they are a week new."
bad,No over time pay but worked 70 hours.... No job advancement and was let go for a reason that was so wrong... was treated unfair because the new help and ownership
bad,This company is cheap and management is very unprofessional. I worked there for less than a year and was very unsatisfied with how things are done. Management acts like a child and is very petty. How well you are liked depends on your schedule. The company does not do holiday pay or offer any benefits. Even the manager does not get health insurance there. The turn over is pretty steady there.
bad,I will not work for Chevron. They are a bad company with mis management. The overseas assignments are not controlled with time off. I was always on the go and the travel time is not scheduled good
bad,Needs Work with many of the things in the Store not like a Traditional Chevron gas station was independently owned and the owner was not a Great Person
bad,Interesting place to work.  Chevron is not a popular company and many people dislike it because the products this offer.  Like any large company they are bloated and will fire employees without warning.
bad,"Horrible manager, talked down to you, FAVORTISM, only plus is that I worked the cash register . That's all. Is is a dead end company, no room for advancement, I've seen all 3 of my bosses quit in a year of going after one after the other after the next boss, when I left the boss supposing was better as she is still there now. Everyone knows your business and pretends not to. Constant overthrow of employee turnaround."
bad,Chevron never cared about their employees safety so I got robbed at gun point while working. Never gave us a lunch or break so they got sued an I quit for better occupation. I learned that I needed a better education for the safety of my life.
bad,Had this job and it was just a part time job to pay some bills. Nothing spectacular about it. Just go to work show up and stand behind a counter. Pay is low as all get out but its to expected in my area.
bad,I was full-time but when it came to being eligible for vacation I was given the run around for weeks to finally be told I wasn't eligible for vacation but had just recently been granted sick time which had the same eligibility terms as vacation.
bad,"i dont suggest working at this location. manager was rude, made promises of advancement and never followed through. was made to take on supervisor roles and never received the compensation for a supervisor position"
bad,"General manager is very rude and not understanding of family related emergencies, supervisor was literally the worst supervisor I have ever worked with in my entire life. She brought outside drama into work ALL the time, she constantly ""dated"" her employees and would allow her ""boyfriends"" to not have to lift a finger at work. Just a rude and disrespectful place of business."
bad,"I would ring up customer's for the purchase of snacks, beer, soda or gas. i would take the money and give them the stuff that they purchased. also we had a shop in the back that they worked on cars."
bad,They had me working 3 days of 2 to 10pm and then 10pm to 6am and you don't clock out for lunch you have to eat while working.  if you are overnight you are by yourself so it something happens to bad.  If you go to the ER as 5 hours before your shift they still ask if your going to make it in today like going to the ER is not a big issue for them.
bad,The company is great at a corporate level. But the life work balance leaves a lot to be desired. The management could have been a little more helpful.
bad,"Didnt spray for bugs in the last 4 years crawling with roaches"
bad,"Work was boring and slow. Manager was passive aggressive and punished us for requesting a day off with a two weeks notice. Hardest part of the job was tolerating the manager, Easiest part was the actual job. Any employee who wasn't a keyholder got about 12 hours a week."
bad,"I only worked at the one chevron but no breaks 30 min lunch while our job was always threatened,it was a beginner job so I learned alit but I will not be a customer or a employee in a chevron again"
bad,"Management was horrible, hours were never steady, new employees would get hired on making more than long term employees, overall a horrible place to work."
bad,I worked 3rd Shift at this particular gas station and felt very fearful of some of the customers that came in at that time of night. Not a good experience or very good pay.
bad,i wouldnt not recomend to work here !!!! management is very bad racist place if you like to slave for no pay  go ahead and apply he treats his worker like animals
bad,"This place was really fun to work with to start off but once you get to know the people there, they are garbage they speak to you with such disrespect."
bad,They do not care about young employees. They give the majority of hours to older staff regardless of productivity. They do not work with school schedules.
bad,"my manager was terrible and should not have been a manager in my opinion. She made a mistake on the days I had asked to take off for a family vacation. While I was still on my vacation, which was an 8 hour plane ride away from home, my manager got upset at me and made it out to be my fault which it was not. Then we had a death in our family and the family member was somebody I was very close to. I was scheduled to work on the day of the funeral and let my manager know the situation and that I would not be able to work. I was then given an ultimatum to either miss my grandpa's funeral or be let go. awful managment"
bad,Required to run an entire store alone with little training. practically no respect for employees. I would never want to work there again. I was miserable.
bad,Great place to work but co-workers were rude to paying customers. I seen them yell and talk about customers. I did not fit in at that store and was let go.
bad,The management was horrible with communication and the pumps was always having issues. They would never work with you on hours and always chose favorites.
bad,"Poor compensation, no benefits, rude managers and owner, customers are often impatient and condescending, coworkers are lazy and the majority of work falls on a select few while management does nothing to remedy the situation"
bad,"its not worth the time, other companies pay you more for the same knowledge and skill set, and they do not allow the mentality and buddy buddy system."
bad,"A typical day would either be a steady flow of vehicles, or none at all there really was no in between. The worst part about this job was the weather when there was a steady flow of cars. Nothing like being soaked to the bone freezing, and pumping gas."
bad,"Security for employees after dark is a joke. Had multiple people come in at night harassing/threatening me, and when I informed my manager, he just shrugged it off and never addressed it."
bad,ran the store without supervision. a pleasure in meeting and working with so many different people. the owners were as great to work with.
bad,"Working for franchise is very hard, they try to get away with not complying with the state laws. Very hard on there employees. what else can i say about a gas station."
bad,I did not enjoy working her that much. your personal life should always be seperate from your job. i would like to be given the chance to prove to a business owner that im more than a pretty face to show off to people
bad,didn't care who u were but they just wanted money if you did make what they wanted you would be sent home for no reason and the ceo was really disrespectful
bad,"Awful, The customers are lovely, but the management staff is terrible. They need to hire better qualified people. Awful Awful Awful"
bad,"boss doesn't care about you or your personal stuff either "
bad,Typical day at work was stocking the drinks in the cooler. I learned nothing at all. Management was the most unprofessional I seen. Co-workers were decent. Hardest part of the job was to stay motivated. Didn't have an enjoyable time here.
bad,Good but the co got sold to tetco.  bad co.  no payment or award.  They one person work two people job.  not a good place to work.
bad,"review all payroll for employes"
bad,It was a job that I knew that I could receive fast cash I had got paid under the table on and off I did not have any training I learned as I went on and I had nom lunch breaks
bad,Best place to work. Good Work Ethics. Good Working Atmosphere. Worked for more than 2 years. Work/life balance. Takes care of the employees.
bad,"The management there is ridiculously revolting. They are racist towards their employees which is absurd and unfair. If you're not white or Arabic for that matter, don't plan on working there because they will treat you poorly based on your race, ethnicity and education status."
bad,"She let's certain employees do what they want, act how they want, and treat other employees how they want with no disciplinary. She does not handle disputes inside the store. She takes both to the office and the two just argue it out and there is never a solution to the problem."
bad,I would come in 10 minutes before my shifts starts and get ready I would start my shift by cleaning inside the gas station and also taking customers when they come in and also I help with ordering gas.
bad,"while some of the employees were very fun and helpful, once you got on someones bad side they did what ever they could to get you in trouble, management was not too bad until the new assistant manager took over, she ran it down, did a terrible job and lied alot, would not reccomend it"
bad,"Maintenance, Stocking sodas, beers, everything, cleaning the pumps the gas, clean outside, food prep,"
bad,Temporary job. No enough to do during work hours. watched an empty parking lot and building.
bad,"no advancement, no good management,i dont enjoy going to work, never enoigh stock, got csrs acting like management."
bad,The pay sucked. It was family owned and lots of drama. They were not very professional 
bad,"I arrived to open, made coffee, count till, turned equipment on, attended to customers needs, put cigarettes away, daily inventory, pulled bread from fridge, prepped it to temper and then cooked it, when co-employee was done making breakfast muffins I would go in back and prep what was needed for Subway. Then I would make sandwiches, clean, stock and check for quality. When shift was over do closing shift inventory, and close out till."
bad,"This store is in a prime location and destined for success. However, it was under very poor management/owner which hindered its full potential, causing frustration to the employees. The customers were very pleasant, however let down a lot of times, as we were often out of standard items/products. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. "
bad,"Pumping of gas and cash handling. Lack of management, and co-workers couldn't be trusted with anyone else's cash."
bad,Typical day would either consist of 1-3 meeting then scurrying back to our offices to meet deadlines. We were required to juggle multiple projects at a time some routine projects from our direct team and other special projects that would require more time and attention.. I Me myself had no real issues with the tedious work load. I have always been very good at prioritizing my work day and address the times that need immediate attention. So for me to be hired to that environment was a win-win and a perfect fit for the team I worked for. We were always sharp!
bad,"i didn't learn anything from this company, co-workers are selfish and they never help, the hardest part of the job is actually dealing with the fact that this company DOES NOT have any sense of management what so ever."
bad,"working with the public was a fun expierence, and free deli food"
bad,Bad management and poor judgment on running regulations and racism to women.
bad,Poor management.  Weak management.  Poor communication  Poor training environment.  Poor team spirit.  Poor safety culture. Poor documentation. Hostile work environment.
bad,Very hostile environment especially with their female manager I won't mention her name but there was alot of drama and management was very 2 faced as well and creates problems.
bad,"I thought Chevron was supposed to be a great company to work for but the management team at my station ruined it .  There was biased treatment for different employees, they cut hours so they didn't have to pay overtime , length of breaks did not correspond with length of shifts, worked every stat holiday but not paid for it, the supervisor and manager liked to ridicule employees on the work online website.  Didn't know defamation of character was an acceptable practice while working for Chevron. Maybe it is just the management at this station but work ethics and lack of respect is so blatantly obvious. Very disappointed with this company!!!"
bad,"Both management and employees are lazy. As long as you don't steal or drink on the job, you'll likely never lose your job. You work 8 or more hours straight, no scheduled breaks or lunches. Management won't let you park your vehicle on the property and will deny compensation if your vehicle gets broken in yo because it's not on company property."
bad,Customers are so mean. It can ruin your day sometimes! People assume you just stand there but there’s always so much to do and you never really have down time. This job will never offer a raise
bad,"Horrible place to work. Often times you’ll be overworked and have no time for life outside this job. Management isn’t the best. Customers treat you like a piece of trash more often than not. The bathrooms are disgusting. Not the worst job I’ve ever had but it comes in second, glad I never have to go back."
bad,"Way fast paced but not worth it for minimum wages. A lot of people think its an easy laid back place to work and that is so far from the truth. It is go, go, go. Clean the inside of the condiment lids, sweep this mop that, push credit cards, ID everyone or get in big trouble...too much stress for minimum wage."
bad,it was one of the wrost places to work. i would never work there again. i dont not recommend if this is your first job because it will make you never want to work again
bad,"The manager didn't give a hoot about labor laws. No mandatory breaks were given. "
bad,If you're fresh out of high school or flat out don't want to work at a fast food joint this is the lesser of two evils. I suggest looking for another job as soon as possible.
bad,"Normally you count the register, do transactions, stock stuff and count out. they will tell you to pump propane with out training. Everything is over priced, the management was bad, that may have been because the owner lives out of state. they will fire you without warning or a reason and only tell you when you come in for your next shift. Out of all the jobs I have had, this was by far the worst, boring repetative and if they hire you, its not for the position that you ask for."
bad,"i would not recommend this job to anyone cause for one it doesn't  pay very much. And second, the hours are bad . The management doesn't care if they get the work done on another shift but if u do not do ALL of your work they jump down your throat"
bad,"Absolutely horrible management in MCBU, very low pay for the industry, benefits were alright, no job security, no work/life balance, worked very many hours. The only good things were my co-workers and what I learned."
bad,"No room for growth. Low pay. Never have a set schedule ever. Good for someone that needs work experience. As an assistant manager, you will be doing the managers job everyday. But huge differences in pay."
bad,"Unless your friend is the manager your just gonna be yelled at for everything. The customer is always right is a saying they hold true, even if the management knows your in the write your gonna get in trouble."
bad,"I loved it when it was Atlas, then Chevron came in and changed the atmosphere. I made less the first year because there was a cost increase with Chevrons benefits"
bad,"its a good place to work but no more chances to grow as it is family owned business. love to interact with people on daily basis, and getting to know your customers and their needs is the most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,"In my opinion, based on 20 years of experience and two degress in the environmental field, their understanding of environmental compliance is severely lacking.  I felt very uncomfortable working there because of their ""different"" method of rules and regualtion interpertation.  And this is the only company I worked for that I felt that way.  It's my opinion that they were more interested in making themselves look enviornmentally compliant than really being environmentally compliant.  The recent TCEQ audits of the Orange, Texas facility will support me on my ""opinions""."
bad,A typical day would be walking around communities in different cities distributing flyers for this specific Chevron gas station. The employer was very rude and disrespectful. My co-workers would stop walking at times to take a longer break than expected. The hardest part of this job was walking around in 100 degree weather for 9 hours with little or no water at all.
bad,- interaction with different people
bad,when there are very difficult task to do without cooperation of co workers
bad,This Company is Toxic Period!Poor management employees don't take showers before coming to work no one is ever happy the Customer Service Sucks!The blind is leading the blind
bad,The manager is god awful and doesn’t know how to treat her employees. Talks down to them and talks about them behind their backs to other employees  I wouldn’t recommend any of my friends working here
bad,"Too much favoritism. Upper mgmnt. Is treated well while the ones that actually do the wrk. Get no credit or respect. Speak your mind, your fired. New MGMT. Doesnt care about anything an"
bad,"Inconsistent leadership, metrics, and organization. Contractors feel like outsiders. Lack of communication and respect from the business due to pour performance and deliverable. It is a work in progress that has a LONG ways to go."
bad,"Not a good company to work for, to much drama for working at a gas station, and I worked at like 4 different stations, would not recommend working there"
bad,My understanding is this was an experience unique to my area however that does not minimize the fact that it happened nor management doing nothing about it.
bad,The duties are strenuous which normally wouldnt mind but pay is not good enough. There are no breaks accept if you want to smoke a cigarette. No lunch breaks just have to stand and eat in the fly.
bad,"I only worked there for a month but the other employees told me that Chevron use to be a good company to work for. The focus was on customer service and caring for the employees. Recently Chevron has switched owners and the new owner doesn't care about customer service or the employees. "
bad,"Worked with minimum supervision.Good Job security. . Management workers relationship  Safety emphasized."
bad,"Don’t pay fair, i only getting 10.50 per hr. No lunch break and im working alone at night. It’s not a safe environment. Overworked with a low salary, its not worth the pay you getting over your daily responsibilities in the store"
bad,"Worked here for two months and did not like it one bit! I was hired as a cashier, but remained cleaning back room for scheduled check. Electrical wires were hanging out and not properly put away and back room was extremely dirty. I will never again go back to this Chevron!"
bad,"Owned by Indian family. They do not pay well. They will not hire men. The kitchen needs to be cleaned badly, not all employees cleaned as they should."
bad,"When I worked there, the owner/manager tried to cheat everyone. I was treated bad because I refuse to due extra work that I had experiences without acknowledgement and more pay. At one time I was home recovering from surgery, and he kept pushing me to come back to work early before my recovery period."
bad,"An example of my hours were from 4:30am-2pm depending if someone was coming in, if not there were times i stayed until 8pm with NO overtime. Hours were NOT flexible at all. The main store manager never wanted to give raised. The pay sucked"
bad,"I cameinto my ASM position after being employed in the same position with a different company. A week after my start date, the supervising store manager left on vacation, assuming I already knew how to process the particular companies paperwork ect. ect. "
bad,"It was a horrible experience. The job itself wasn't the issue, it was the management. "
bad,Chevron is still a 'good ol boys' company with a pyramid like culture that rewards the big guys who definitely draw a line between themselves and the little guys.  Micro management is the norm.  Posters throughout their buildings stress 'The Chevron Way'.  Conform or leave.
bad,I sat in a box with little or nothing to do other than wait for the occasional customer. 
bad,"some of the co workers will try and boss you around and tell you what to do when they arent the boss. always on your feet, fast pace,maintain customer"
bad,Disappointing company culture. Does not encourage personal career development. No work life balance. Employees don't feel job security. Heavy office politics and back stabbing.
bad,They need to have better people in there managing and managing the employees. They were never there when needed. They wanted the employees to work more hours than they should without asking.
bad,"Managment tried to belittle me in front of customers because I quit and was NOT able to finish out the week due to another job starting. Overall, the employees i worked with were wonderful and very helpful. Management was laughable considering one of them, I'm not sure if he was the discrtict manager or what, didn't even introduce himself to me. "
bad,"It was a part time job that only gave me 12 hours a week. Sometimes if they needed extra help I would get another shift but it was usually only one a week. The money I made wasn't nearly enough to pay any of my bills with. The only people who were making 40 hours a week were the manager, her daughter, and anyone related to the owner. The owner was foreign and was slowly getting rid of employees so his family members could come to the U.S. and have a job. Luckily, this was only a temporary job for me while I was working on something else. I feel bad for the people who were relying on that income."
bad,"First you are lured in because of the fact that it is the best place on the coast to work because of the pay and benefits. the as time passes, and the newness and excitement wears off, you begin to notice the cracks, the different mentality people that are there. Not everyone, but 8 out of 10. you notice the willingness to lie. God forbid you stand up to the lie. You will be miserable. I hated giving up the pay and benefits, but the company, at least the refinery in MS, is evil. They don't ""honestly"" care anything about you, unless you can go along with the lies they tell."
bad,They didn't really take their time to actually probably train their employees and the work environment need to be safer for the employees who work night shifts..
bad,Lack of security for graveyard shift. Morning shift person was always late. Shifts before mine were not asked to stock or clean leaving more work for graveyard.
bad,Didn't have any kind of security had females working graveyard by them self  employees wouldn't work together as a team employees wouldn't finish all their work task so they would leave it for the cashier on graveyard to do all in finished task plus what needed to be done on graveyard.
bad,It's owned by an individual not a corporation. So I was paid under the table with no benefits or overtime pay. And worked 6 or 7 day a week. I would not recommend it to anyone
bad,"A typical day at work requires mulching through about 2000 customers who want restricted products or gas by the dollar"
bad,Management is rude and disrespectful towards its employees.  Every employee is God fearful to speak up due to the fact that they can lose their only job.
bad,"there was not typical day at work, it was always different, which is good, i learned a lot about plumbing, and other construction skills. The hardest part about working here, is the managment, and the co-workers."
bad,"Kept you busy, which made for fast shifts, employees dont always show up for shifts, changing schedule"
bad,"I have been trying to get w-2 form since it was mailed to an old address. Here it is August 23 2019 and I still haven't been able to get one from them."
bad,Lots of overtime and great pay.  Downside is politics.  You will find that you need to be related to someone if you want to have a career there.  Workers are abusive to everyone.
bad,"The job schedule you dont get to choose, they can call you that same day to cover a shift, You relay on the person before you or after yout shift to determine what time you leave or clock in. NO BREAKS WHATSOEVER! you have to wait until there's no customers at the store to use the restroom. NO supervision. You can only be sitting doing for a certain amount of time. Customers are really rude and you have to remain your cool regardless the situation. You will encounter a lot of customer that will want to start a problem with the service. There is not enjoyment of this job at all."
bad,"Stocked shelves with merchandise, Coolers with beverages, Complete gas & sales transactions. For the most part, there were a lot of times where there was ABSOLUTELY nothing to do! It was very boring & slow paced."
bad,"Going on 10yrs with Chevron. I have created lots of friendships with customers and co workers. The manager was awful tried to get along with her but she was a very bad person! I have been assaulted, robbed and verbally abused from customers daily! Its time for me to move on to long to put up with it anymore. Overwork there employees for the pay they get."
bad,"Chevron is focused on their deep water interest. Before the company began to explore deep water oil and gas, they took care of the shallow water employee's. After they did not. In my opinion, Chevron did not practice what they preached and in Many cases, it was money over Safety, which I did not agree with."
bad,willing to relocate - cost of living in Vancouver is too high.
bad,"A normal working environment as in upstream sector of oil and gas industry, normal 8 hours per day, multicultural and uploading the project costs, team building outing"
bad,the management was terrible. they were very unprofessional and disrepectful towards their employees. their schedule was very inconvenient because they made it at the last minute
bad,The management set unrealistic goals and threatens to take action on you if you don't achieve these goals. Total unfair. They treat you like a piece of meat.
bad,Good Company to work for if you have a solid educational background if not forget it. Layoff are controlled by oil and gas prices. Raises and bonuses are above average but growth is limited if you do not want to relocate
bad,"Left Loves Travel Stop 39 hr a week job "
bad,Career progression is based on the right people knowing and liking you.  Skills and performance are not as important if certain people like you.  Company preaches a lot about diversity and inclusion but very difficult for minorities to progress.
bad,"This is a stress workplace with stressful environment. No benefits. "
bad,This is a place full of liars and crackheads.  I was constantly picked on by the homeless while my boss did nothing but laugh.  It's a stupid place for stupid people who just want to move up in a stupid company.  They try to make it seem like their work culture is top notch and force you to hear about it constantly.  Once a year they force you to attend a safety meeting where they treat you like children.
bad,"This is a great place to work especially if you need flexible working hours . I am able to work this job while attending college and working two additional jobs ! I get paid here every week direct deposit which is a plus! The work load is light compared to most places, and you always have the ability to change anything you do t like ( location, time, days of the week) I also love that you can pick up and deny shifts at your leisure. Just woke up and have nothing to do for the rest of the day? Call and pick up a shift! Need extra money for something that came up? CALL AND PICK UP A SHIFT! Literally that simple! You get paid weekly so you see what your making right when you need it !"
bad,"I was there to work, not to butt heads with coworkers and management. I feel that making me clock off and continue to work without pay wasn't right either."
bad,"I Greet customers in a friendly and professional manner, Provided Propane, Cash handling, maintained a clean store as well as outside grounds, Stocking of merchandise, Answered Phone calls, Inventory I went all out for anyone that came into the chevron"
bad,Mind the strings. Do as you're ordered. Don't complain of pain. Don't try to associate with coworkers. Watch your till from coworkers. Be wary of the higher-ups above the store manager.
bad,the owner was rude and didn't care about are safety just his money I'm not sure about other location but the one I worked at in Hayward CA on foothill Blvd. was not a good location
bad,"Working here was ok at first but then I started noticing all the drama that kept going around. Lots of  talking bad about other co-workers and lots of back stabbing, It was difficult to stay for the few months I was there."
bad,"It was my first job, but I did not like it there. The managers did not respect that I was a college student and made me choose between working there or going to school. I only worked there for one week."
bad,Thumbs down. I don't think this question should be on here because some people may of not like the people they work for but love the job itself.
bad,"After 9 years with the company I was laid off because of the poor oil and gas economy. I was already planning on quitting. Typical work day was boring, not motivating, lack of challenges, etc."
bad,This was a very unpleasant place to work.  Although they liked to claim work life balance there really wasn't any.  The AMBU business unit was managed very poorly and was run in my opinion by individuals that really didn't understand how to do business in the Appalachian basin.
bad,Long work hours with no benefits due to the fact that I was a contract employee. I had little to no chance for advancement.
bad,"-sign on computer"
bad,"I am flexible to work any days in week ,I learned how I deal with clients and handle work problems when I work with team , the hardest part in my work I must to handle many tasks in same time."
bad,"This job by far has been the most difficult company I've worked for. On the other hand, I learned how to be an excellent employee here. The hardest part of this job was working for the owner and his lack of managerial skills."
bad,"Chevron’s philosophy is “The Power of Human Energy”. Here we find high level of compliance, safety and good work life balance. Chevron care about environment and people where they do business."
bad,"not a bad place to work, deal with a lot of rude people it seems, although that's every customer service job i guess."
bad,It becomes a stressful enviroment when limited hours and employees while busy with promotions.
bad,"It Was A Great Environment. I Had To Clean,Sales Things and Stock. Majority Of The Time I Didnt Have Co-Worker Working With Me."
bad,"Management was very poor. He was a very irresponsible/unprofessional man. He took forever to send your schedule. On the bright side, he was very flexible with hours, but he didn’t know how to talk to his employees."
bad,Don’t work here if you expect having days off. I’ve been working well over a year and I’ve had a total of 5 days off. If you like to be controlled/enslaved you should definitely apply here.
bad,As I was in my first interview for the company the owners son-in-law told me that any trained monkey can do this job. Nuff said. So keep in mind that any employee at Chevron is just a trained monkey And they don’t give trained monkeys raises
bad,It's just a stage of work but no carrier in it.you have to work hard just to get something.no future.no penefit.of medical.health insurance.no future.
bad,Management was poor. Didn't build employees up instead they belittled the employees. Crazy work schedule. Didn't follow company procedure. Schedule was never correct.
bad,This is a neutral review because it was locally owned and did not follow Chevron Corporation. I would imagine that a corporately owned store would have been better to work for.
bad,Just not a place to go to better yourself hours always drop lots of teenagers working here poor management  there's no moving up in the company and the boss plays favortism very rude cashiers always with a attitude especially the chunky white woman works nights and the black woman in the morning I wouldn't recomrecommend working here.
bad,"Currently, Chevron is unstable and work is slow, no engagements, therefore, makes this place a risky place to work.  Chevron is becoming a full contract environment with very few full-time employers to rely on for encouragement."
bad,"It wasn't the job that was bad, Perhaps with better management and in a different area it wouldn't be a bad job to have as a side thing. The job itself was easy and there is a lot of down time. The boss isn't strict as long as you do your job, to keep the pace clean and ring people up. This particular station was in a bad area (found drugs several times) Crackheads would come in often. But very diverse crowd."
bad,Was over worked under paid and un appreciated. Was there 2 years worked doubles and never missed a day. Worked over time with out the pay to go with it. Was let go for paying a vendor which I did every day. Just no one told me not to pay the vendor had I known not to I never would have.
bad,The manager was horrible she made friends and if she didnt like you she would make you do all the work. The pay was so little for having to clean the bathroom and pumps in all weather conditions. Having to change the price sign in all weather conditions.
bad,My experience at Chevron was extremely unprofessional for a multitude of reasons. They were also unethical in terms of how to deal with customers and employees alike. I worked alongside all family members and would not recommend working in Chevron at this location.
bad,"I was hired when they were rushed, the first two weeks I had no training and was written up twice a week due to no training."
bad,"One of the main things I learned, is time sensitivity. Most Chevron locations are independently owned and operated, though multiple locations may be owned by the same person. The location I was at was slow enough there was normally only one person on per shift, so you quickly learn how to multi-task and get things done while serving customers. Customers are normally cheery, but occasionally you will run into grumpy customers who are not pleased, as with any customer service roll. They will teach you the basics, and hope for the best. My personal experience, it was not worth the stress."
bad,very low pay crazy hours no communication very unprofessional. The computers need to be updated no team work at all i just had a bad experience there.
bad,"Typical day is working hard."
bad,got there. counted safe and all money that was being used. Did some cleaning. did deposits to bank and made sure other staff was working and keeping store in working order.
bad,"The job its self was very easy. there is very few things you need to finish each day. Janitorial and customer service are what you will be doing the most of each day. If you know how to clean, restock shelves, and count money then being a CSR (as they call it) will be a easy yet not overly fulfilling job."
bad,Terribles need to take pride in their employees. I worked that job from 6am to 10pm at night for 8.50 the manager always left while I ran the store. I loved my job and customers but i will not be a peasent
bad,"This job was not a career, it was something that i could pay most of my bills with and got me out of the house. I liked the interactions that i had with most of my customers, my regulars especially. When it came down to it the management had little empathy for scheduling conflicts and was unwilling to work with myself and other employees, as well as their general attitude towards the other employees and customers became unbearable."
bad,Very fast paced place easy work manager has favorites. you get free drinks i didn't really enjoy it at all Very fast paced place easy work manager has
bad,"I just installed below- grade fiberglass laminated products to the tops of their bulk fuel underground tanks, to get the things legal to pump gas...I was never an actual Chevron employee, I was a sub- contractor..."
bad,Unorganized and keepa. Cutting hours and dont do write ups and cause an unfair fire do to lack of proof and no investigation was in role. Dirty and short of supplies and not give full pay
bad,I enjoyed working with all costumers who prefer Chevron gas for their vehicles.  The area I worked has a specific class of costumers and the costumer demand a certain v.i.p attention that I was able to execute because of my costumer service experience.
bad,"The management was horrible, they had favorite employees that got to do things that others couldn't do. They were racist, and made working there so miserable and stressful. Half of the employees were not good with their customer service skills, but somehow still was able to keep their jobs even though they were rude to customers and the customers who complained, didnt see any difference in the actions of these rude employees. The store has a horrible odor and no one seems to do anything abt it. It was just a horrible unorganized company that should have went out if business years ago!!! Also, they have a high turnover rate because management is terrible and have no place being management at all!!"
bad,"the people at chevron was always judgmental about everything, i dont really know how to descrbe working thier . it was a job and its hard finding a good work environment now in days"
bad,"I have worked on and off at Chevron for years now, I don't have anything good to say about it except the other employees are like family, and they pay better than most gas stations. Boss is never around and extremely unprofessional. Management has no clue what they're doing. Employees with health issues are mostly told to get over it and get back to work or they will be fired. Favoritism is a big issue there, promised shifts which take away from other employees who could only work certain shifts. I can go on and on, but I'll end this review with saying I would not recommend this as a long-term job, it will pay the bills (barely) but you will lose your will to live."
bad,"I was told from the beginning that they'd work with my college schedule. It was fine for the first month, if that, until they started having me work 40+ hours, i bargained and pleaded but i kept being told the same thing, ""Soon, we'll work on it."" They'd have me close then open then mid then open, close, etc. They had me working all holidays without giving me a day off before or after. I was the only one who had to work christmas eve, christmas, and the day after. The employees were decent. They will always think less of you and talk behind your back tho. If you were the preppy kid in high school you'll love Chevron"
bad,Subpar franchise company under the chevron umbrella. They tell you one thing and do the complete opposite. The upper management changed the scheduling format to part time only.
bad,This is a company who doesnt take care of their workers as well as the managers put all their workload on the cashiers. They dont provide any benefit and their paycheck is bad.
bad,Management is bad but they do try to work with your schedule that is like the only thing good about this company and don't like the fact that only one person works per shift to dangerous
bad,"the managers at this facility were husband and wife, who worked during the week and refused to close.  I literally worked the weekend closing shift with the flu because they didn't want to close."
bad,If you aint been there for years you have no voice. You get used and abused like no other. So much is expected in your short shift and if its not done before you leave then you have consequences the next day.
bad,"I began working here as a way to help ends meet. My husband  was employed on a day shift job and our children were very young. Night shift was the only option left at that time. It was pleasant work. I cleaned the store and parking lot, restocked shelves and cooked the breakfast foods for the morning crowd. Ten hours shifts made this very easy to accomplish. I was quite disappointed to see how little my coworkers were able or willing to do in the time scheduled. In addition to laziness, they would intentionally cook more food than necessary and eat the unpaid excess. Call me a tattle tale, I. Asked management if this was an acceptable policy. Needless to say, it was not. My coworkers understandably made it very uncomfortable to continue working there."
bad,"The manager is a highly unprofessional and has very poor work ethics , criticizes an employee in front of other employees as well as customers, and expect you to do your job without providing any training."
bad,Was working overnight. didnt have any one to help me. and did not feel safe by myself the manager was very nice. typical day was cleaning and stocking.
bad,"I enjoyed the customers but, working for Chevron was horrible. I would do an 8 hour shift and no breaks because I was the only one working. There is no reason for my shift to be so difficult all the time all they needed was someone to be there with me."
bad,worst job i have ever worked management was rude unfair was not paid enough to do what was asked of all employees and was very unprofessional unless a customer was present and the training was not provided properly.
bad,worked hard and got the  job done  worked  well with other people loved the location .learned how to deal with hard situations ..
bad,working with csr that don't want to work for $10 per hr. Very demanding boss. Always walking on egg shells . Hiring and training csr companies says you can only hire P/T but you can offer F/T at P/T wages.
bad,"the other ones might be great but this one isn't. i'm being paid under the table and i'm not given any kind of schedule they only call you the day of, so i can't be out and about running errands all day because i have no clue if i work or not."
bad,"I was at Chevron for 4 years as a contractor was promised a job even used my credentials for the job posting. I didn't understand why I had to apply even though I was already in the position and knew the job inside and out. I interviewed and just knew I had the job. Was told by a co-worker that as a contractor should I not get the job I would be out of a job. I couldn't imagine a company taking a job from a contractor that was there for so long as well as was promised the job. However that's what happened it took almost 2 months before I got the news that Chevron went with someone else. I was devastated for 4 years I was there and yet they gave my position to an outside person. Its an unspoken rule there at Chevron contractors don't like to pursue going permanent because they may loose their job. I've never been with a ""prestigious company"" that do people like that. If you are applying as a contractor before warn you may loose your job should you want to become an employee. Oh and the Chevron culture is a load of crock the culture only applies to the employees who they make it known they are only looking out for."
bad,"Start the day off by listening to a safety meeting, then complete a JSA for the task to be performed that day. Gather up the tools and material required for the job. Proceed to the job site to secure the work and performed required task to complete it."
bad,"Usally I opened the store. I either worked in the kitchen or as a cashier. Some of the employees were rude to other employees and customers. The hardest part of the job would be stocking the coolers and freezers but that was only because it was tooo cold. We didn't have a manager at the time. A lot of times employees wouldn't show up for work so I would open the store and close the store. There was no room to grow or advancement. Also, they didn't give any pay rasies"
bad,"I loved working here at first until I got sick one night & it appeared that it was a huge problem to management. I had to show up either way & got 2 days off following to that, just because my manager was upset that I had called in in the first place. Very immature of him. All because he doesn't have enough people trained to do my graveyard shift. Horrible! This continued to happen & eventually lost my job for reasons that he couldn't really explain."
bad,Got assaulted by co-worker lots of drug addicted employees. Worked really hard for low pay but received really good on the jobs training. Definitely a job for a strong person who doesn’t get pushed around and likes being around cars all day. Drug test at time of hiring with pretty strong background check.
bad,"great place to work, flexible work schedules, nice offices, great salaries, great benefits"
bad,"Depending on what shift you were working, I either was opening/closing store. So, upon opening get your register ready, lottery machine turned on and signed in, verify all tickets were correct, start coffee and make sure everything was stocked, fill ice machine. At the time of change shift, run your report from register for your shift, balance your drawer, run report for lottery for your shift and verify tickets, order tickets weekly, check in vendors and make checks payable to them. Put up stock, clean store and keep shelves stocked and fronted."
bad,"Very poor Management from Terminal Manager and Area Management , had to deal with some racial issue that was not address by Management, also was not fair to older employees once management was change at the Fort Worth Terminal.....quickly found reasons to eliminate older employees for younger ones..."
bad,it was hard working there because lots of robberies and people coming with weapons. I decided to leave after 3 years because of my safety. otherwise I loved working there I just was more concerned for my safety. bad area
bad,"Stay away. Racial overtones, no breaks, on your feet the full shift. The owner is a stuck up wanna be cowboy, who depends on an addict / alcoholic to manage the store."
bad,"Company provided no mean of advancement or recognition of doing a job well. Long hours of standing and being by yourself in the store, cleaning and maintaining the operation largely on your own."
bad,"When i let the manager know about the verbal haressement, intimadation and the bullying.  The manager would only *talk"" to the coworker.  This was the second time, obvisously the talk was pointless for co worker."
bad,I would come in and the employee before me would let me know what had been done and what had not been done. If there was any issues with pumps or coolers or items in the store.
bad,"My experience working there was not good at all they started me out in the cashiering department then threw me in the kitchen and cut my hours by 10, which I felt was unfair."
bad,"my experience working at chevron was not quite a good experience manager had no management skills our hours were always messed up and i never saw myself  advancing my work skills there. the workplace culture was highly mandatory, it was a franchise so it was a family owned business. i didnt find anything hard about the job it was just stressful because half the time working my shifts there i would be by myself, during the daytime i would have a co worker there with me but they would work they're hours and then leave the most enjoyable part of the job was that i got to meet a variety of people that would come in the business"
bad,"Don't allow hours over 20 hours, poor management, no pay raise, no medical, no paid vacation, etc....................................................."
bad,Management was terrible and the hours were hard lucky to get scheduled 3 days a week from 8p-4a is you put in a RTO expect to get on day a week for the next month
bad,"The Chevron that I worked at in Everett, WA was the worst job experiance I have ever had.  Most employees, including the Manager, are using drugs and even selling drugs out of the store to the local homeless people! The owner is aware but he doesn't do anything about it because he is too lazy to go through the process of hiring and training even one new employee."
bad,"Very demanding job, with little to no margin for error.  Wasn't enamored with the shifts I worked, and felt that when I did do a good job, wasn't given enough credit."
bad,I had some of the most wonderful customers very pleasant outgoing and always friendly when entering the store.they would also leave me tips for my good csr skills.
bad,Working at the chevron in stone mountain was not easy management did not care about the life that we had they would call me in on my off days have me work 14 hour shifts and never paid overtime nor did we get lunch breaks
bad,"There are two types of Chevron - those owned by a private party and those owned by corporate. I have been told that the stations that are owned by corporate are a much better career environment. But in my experience this is about the worst job you can have. There was no way to move up, fighting amongst employees, poor management, no benefits, no vacations, no opportunity for full time, no raises, etc. I do not recommend working at a privately owned Chevron."
bad,"It's a good company and there too proud of it.  They don't have a problem keeping you as a contractor forever with low pay and no benefits.  I learned that they give contractors the same work as employees, which is not supposed to be happening.  You were never recognized for all the good work you did."
bad,Very different place to work. Working for a family owned franchise there was no chance for advancement. The hours were good but the management was sub par.
bad,"Okay so it is a gas station. and all chevrons are not alike. however this gas station is drab. i was always stuck doing dirty work and was never trusted with the cash register. the workplace was clean,and management could be better...waaaay better. hardest part of the job was when the manager would assign jobs as we'd all have the same jobs except me"
bad,"The company is ok. This job is good for a summer job, in college, or young adults with no kids! You have to wait for the night shift to relieve you. If they don't show up your stuck working a hole  shift again by yourself  and maganent doesn't answer your calls"
bad,"waiting on customers (best part). I learned how to do inventory and ordering gas and cleaning the car wash, the pumps, and the entire lot.The manager at Chevron was not very nice. The co-workers I had were o k. The hardest part of the job was waiting on customers while cleaning the lot and car wash. The most enjoyable part of the day was going home."
bad,"Work d there for a year, some of the co workers were awesome! But the management sucked! Fired two people who worked hard only because they caught the manager doing drugs at the job, he called HR and was fired a week later... You could work as hard as you possibly could but only the kiss butt lazy people got hours and got away with everything..."
bad,"I as in charge of both opening as well as closing the station, I had to be in charge of the whole station without any other employees, which in my opinion is not safe considering the type of business it was. I choose to leave due to the poor scheduling as well as the unprofessional environment."
bad,This employment has been a change in positions I've held before. It has been great interacting with the regular customers and my coworkers.  I feel that the pay rate is quite low however due to the high turnover in this field its understandable.
bad,"A typical day, would consist of checking out customers ,helping customers in car wash and the deli, cleaning and stocking inventory,checking in deliveries,money drops,i have learned how to manage a store as well as a car wash, the hardest part was trying to keep track of my drawer since two to three other employees that i worked a shift with had access to it,few of my co-workers were great ,the ones that stayed many came and go with in the time iwas there i would say about 9 to 10 ,the most enjoyable part was having a job to be honest,management was rarely there and when she was she stayed in the office and left all the work to the employees"
bad,"For xtra money, its alright. Manager is very good, but she can only be as good as the company she is managing for."
bad,Extremely un-professional company with a blatent disregard for safety.
bad,Mngrs at Chevron lack leadership skills/not aware of the on- goings within projects & of needed improvements/do not implement needed process & staff changes/keep employees and contractors with very low work ethic-knowledge-skills-professionalism (INCOMPETENCE).  Highly competent are not retained. Pay is out of touch with reality for high-value-adding staff.
bad,The chevron I worked just had very poor management which didn't prioritize other employees whatsoever. Also frustrating that no matter how hard you work you don't seem to climb the latter or be appriciated.
bad,Low pay aweful management never ending weeks no days off . Everybody calls out poor benefits. It's a gas station but they think it's a law firm. You will work 7 days a week for nothing.
bad,"While my rating is poor I did have some fun times with some of my coworkers, but customers were quick and frequent to argue, very few people will be nice. I had a decent relationship with just about everyone but my manager. I primarily learned customer service here and I'll be the first one to tell you it is a great test of patience. The place does offer one big benefit and you can get hired pretty young at the location I worked at. Its a good first job but proves to have difficulties fitting around a unique schedule like I had for my college."
bad,It’s a bunch of favoritism at the Chevron that I work it is off of Richard Boulevard in California. She cuts my hours when she want somebody to begged.
bad,"Our owner sold the store, two people got let go before it ever switched hands, and then the remaining two of us we fired under dubious circumstances and last I checked everything was run by his family members."
bad,"Chevron Extra Mile is not the best place to work for. The store I worked at had poor management and asked too much from every employee. They would overwork you and you’d never receive anything in return. You only get a week of vacation AFTER being a FULL TIME employee for 1 YEAR and that’s IF you become a full time, which most people don’t. Besides that, Chevron Extra Mile is a cheap company and don’t like to compensate their employees for a lot of expenses."
bad,"not the best culture, safety only applies when its convenient. lack of hiring has put the company in a hard place. they do not pay great but also don't require you to work , ""just simple show up on time, shave your face and pass a drug test"" is the untold motto of the maintain department."
bad,Asked to do much more than you would expect for a minimum wage job with no advancement opportunity and no benefits. Management tends to beat around the bush when confronting issues.
bad,"its a alright first job or a job to get back on your feet but most surly not a long term place of work , horrible management not a friendly work environment"
bad,"My immediate management team was terrific, long hours and days to be successful.  Culture has been up and down over the years.The most enjoyable part of the day is the people."
bad,"A typical day included arriving to the job not knowing what time you would be getting off. For the better part of time employed with them, this store was expected to operate 7 days a week from 5:30 a.m. til 11:00 p.m with only myself, a part-time cashier, and a manager that only worked  morning hours Monday thru Friday. Their was never a set schedule, which on most weeks left me working between 70 and 80 hours a week. The thing that I loved the most about working there was being able to meet the very wide variety of people that came in daily. The store is located directly off the interstate, so I had the privilege of meeting people from all walks of life."
bad,If you are a contractor you may loose your job at any time... Plus people treat you like a second class and you don't have any benefits...but that is that way to get in.
bad,High pressure environment for projects; employees facing layoffs.  Good points:  Ergonomics are stressed with sit/stand desks. Contractors are let go suddenly with no explanation.
bad,its a small little place which means not much to do the GM has been there since 1993 has retired 3 times and needs to just go. she is impossible to work with thinks she is ALWAYS right even when she is obviously wrong. they are doing things there against the workers law no scheduled breaks or lunches you work a 8 hour shift without a break. the manger and assistant managers are great but they dont stand up to her. you can get fired at any time for any reason.
bad,"During my time their I was never given any clear duties or directions, just thrown on the night shift and asked to run the store alone after a week of training"
bad,A typical day at work in Chevron starts with safety meeting which is later broken down to tool box meeting (unit heads having meetings with unit members regarding job expectations for the day); job safety experiences are shared; equally diversity moments are shared and the need to work as a team is highly emphasised. The hardest part of the job is when subordinates fail to ask questions when they don't understand and the enjoyable part is when a customer expresses satisfaction over the asset protection program and professionalism displayed.
bad,"would schedule one day off a week. its was ran like a prison. not allowed to show too much enjoyment, or it would be considered unprofessional.  would schedule you to work on your day off."
bad,"I was a cashier for a little over a year. The job was very monotonous and I would never be able to live off the pay, but it was a good place to work while trying to get on my feet. Very little supervision, customers were great! I enjoyed interacting with the people and stocking shelves and cooler. There was absolutely no career advancement opportunities, no benefits."
bad,"it was clean, work with a variety of people, we didn't have the best management, the support system was a fail....but it was a job"
bad,Workplace was fun but the management there was terrible to work with. Slander and lies all around.
bad,"Chevron Pipeline - Poor work/ life balance. Was lied to during interviews on comp time, to find out it didn't exist in my department. Couldn't find relief for vacation, sick time, etc... Unethicval management."
bad,"A great first job for anyone teaches them valuable lessons so they can avoid them in the future, and come out a better person"
bad,Different shifts have different customers who had different attitudes. Evening shift had the best customers. Alot of racist people in the area.
bad,"Very close company! "
bad,"Nice people just could not ever get ahead ,"
bad,Not to bad of a job. Sometimes very fast pace. Deal with all kinds of people. Have to deal with customer compliants.
bad,Not enough time spent at Chevron to rate it.  I will rate other companies when I spend more than one month at the company.  Not enough time spent at Chevron to rate it.
bad,"Opinions of only 'loyal' AMERICAN employees matter."
bad,Used to be a good place to work but now there is too much process. Bosses can't make a decision without 2 meetings. Travel / meetings are restricted .
bad,"The jobs itself was great, dealing with customers on a daily basis and building relationships with the regulars was my favorite. Management on the other hand was terrible. I remember one occasion where I was sick to the point my throat was so swollen I could barely breath let alone swallow any food or drink. I called the manager while in the hospital and they said they didn't care, either I come in or I'm out of a job, this was after 4 months of working there."
bad,"One of the owners comes in drunk often, and will yell and cuss at you, if you stand up for yourself you will get fired. The work drama is even worse, don't get caught up in it! The people there are not your friends, and constantly talk about each other behind their backs. On the other side the customers are the best and really fun to interact with!"
bad,"Typical day for me was my work phone would start ringing at 6am and non stop until I went home around 4pm. Frequently would take after hours calls as well to make sure everything was ok operationally."
bad,"Since I started my career at Chevron every position I had was moved overseas to a Chevron Service Center (cheap labor).  The Chevron motto in finance was, ""the only constant is change"".  Management uses the subordinates to achieve their goals, they do not mentor employees unless they have a Master's degree or higher.  The salary ranking session every year is based on how well your supervisor likes you, it has nothing to do with the work.  Chevron places people in management that have no business being there. The company is one big high school clique."
bad,"Highly focused on safety"
bad,"I worked there for almost an entire year. Horrible, never work for Chevron/Bubble clean. The owners need to be a little less rude to the employees and management.  The owners treat the employees like complete garbage with no concern for their well-being or respect. I was the only employee who put in effort, besides the manager. We were back and forth daily across the store. The job is not worth the pay at all. If you're anything but white, expect to be treated horribly and your tenacity to go unrecognized. Hazardous conditions in which a subtle acid mist blows in your face and all around you from the car wash. it will make your skin irritated and itchy. one of the employees fell into the car wash's garbage ""pit"" filled with acid and sludge, and now hes bald, skin tags were developed. We still aren't sure if contact with or breathing in the mist poses any long-term threats."
bad,"One time i was alone at work and then all system shut down on me, then i had to figure it out by my self calling the service line."
bad,"I enjoyed working there, but there were more cons then pros. I was not impressed with how alot of the employers treated each other, the manager stayed really tense. I understand managers have alot on them, but she also took her personal problems to work, which made her not focus on what she should as a manager. There were many times where she had made alot of people cry. It was also bad for business when you act in a bad manner in front of customers."
bad,Supervisor was never organized. Rude co-workers. Never trained. No one showed up to work on time. employees never clocked in so no record of how much you were paid. checks where always given late. place of favoritism. Not a great experience.
bad,"constantly understaffed, poor management( manager creates a hostile work environment with attitude) decent pay for a menial before college job. Pleasant group of coworkers while I was there."
bad,they don't pay very weill......not bad pay your bills nothing else
bad,not much to say its a gas station. work was ok but if you had good co workers it made the job a bit better. management sucked. didnt learn much here.
bad,no advancement unless you are someone's pet at the higher level....
bad,"This job was just super boring most the days drag out because the store was so small only one person was needed so you have no company, and the work required is finished in no time, so most of the day your staring at people in the parking lot pumping gas while you wait anxiously for a customer..."
bad,Over all there is alot of overtime and alot of work the pay is ok. Management not really supportive there is alot of opportunity for advancement all you have  to do is want to learn show you are interested and you will be considered for a advancement.
bad,"Started working at Chevron at 17. Was not allowed any breaks. Did not get payed after hours. I worked 8 plus hours, three to four days a week. I worked there for about 10 months, received no raise or benefits."
bad,Chevron is cut throat. When hired by other managers and it’s talked about in meetings it always shows in the training performance of upper management.
bad,Very nice friendly place to work I was going to school and working so they were very very flexible with me and my hours while working and going to school
bad,"I got sick towards the end of the year and I was forced to quit because it was hard to work with my previous condition.. The owner was a rude lady who was not understanding at all. The job was overall boring, just constantly fixing stuff on the shelves and standing the whole time watching people come in and out."
bad,"The place was very poorly run when I worked there. Communication was poor, team effort was poor, and my coworkers were generally not respectful. Then again, it was in Moab where I grew up, so there’s that “benefit”."
bad,Owner is too controlling and wont work with you on scheduling or money.Didnt learn much.  management was non existent and the culture was horrible.  hardest part is the hours.
bad,The only thing that wasn't compleatly unbearable was the people i worked with. The homeless was a terrible problem. the manager never did anything. This place made me swear never to work at another gas station
bad,Typical day is busy. Learned to communicate better with different people. Management is ok. Hardest part is not getting help. Enjoyable part is serving the customers.
bad,in my opinion i wouldn't work a job like that again due to not seeing a career there. just got the job because i needed something at that moment and time.
bad,"A typical work day was really slow. Where I worked at you'd only get so many customers every few hours. I learned how to fuel pump and more about talking to customers. Management wasn't that great, they never took care of any of the issues that the pumps had. Workplace culture was kind of slow ad lazy. on the other hand when it was time to work they would get things done. The hardest part of the job was sitting around for hours waiting for customers. The most enjoyable part was being able to talk with customers when time allowed for it."
bad,"Chevron didn't have much opportunities to expand my career. Good place if you like traditional life style. Great people to work it. However, not much opportunities for women."
bad,"I work with mobile crew in an offshore location and we do use copper or boat as means of transportation to different jackets and platforms to work but the most hectic day for me is when we use boat when the weather is bad and the tide is high. (2)I learn different skills such as scaffolding, painting, swimming, hot bolting/unbolting, changing of choats/choats box e.t.c.(3) the management is fair but to their staffs only, we the contractor staffs are being treated like a piece of rag (4) their wash word is safety and they always put it into practice(5) the hardest part of job is when you pass your night on the jacket or platform due to bad weather condition and not receiving your monthly payment as at when due (6) the most part of the job is when you are going back home to see your love ones you left behind for some weeks (THERE IS GREAT JOY IN IT)."
bad,"Hours would change on you quiet a bit. Somedays i did graveyard, some days i worked during the day. Ome week you have 40 hours and the next week you have less. Not a dependable work environment."
bad,"the 3 years was great, the last year just got worse and worse. i was constantly put down told what a horrible person i am. had only ever missed work 4 times in 4 years. the fifth time i was told i will be fired if it happens again, i was in the hospital."
bad,"Poor decision makings and do not adhere to experience staff. If they feel insecure due to their own short comings, they will make you redundant. Alot of politics."
bad,"while i've been at chervon the working environment wasn't always pleasant from co workers, the station i happened to work at had a lot of favoritism m for the employees that have worked 6 plus years. There isn't no confidentiality once something happens everyone intends to find out within a hr"
bad,"typical day was kind of slow nothing much going on  had to constantly find myself something to do "
bad,"There is no advancement, no raises, minimal appreciation, and poor management. If you do your job you will get work and if you make an effort you can achieve a full time paycheck."
bad,Don't come to Midland Texas under FE and I&E unless your ready to be unappreciated and taken advantage of.  Middle and upper management very poor and cut throat.  No opportunity to grow and management puts you where they want not where you will be happy and most productive.  I tried sticking it out longer but the environment is very toxic due to management using the divide and conquer scheme among its employees.  Very sad culture due to favoritism and separation.  Management very oppressive if you have aspirations and ambitions of bettering yourself.
bad,"construction phase management a pleasure to work with however in the commissiong phase line management were Narsistic,self opinionated ,not willing to involve experienced contractors generally not a pleasent working atmosphere I personally was glad when my contract ended"
bad,Good first job but not sustainable for living on your own. Bad management and not much room to grow. good experience to learn but not a viable place to advance.
bad,Manager wasn't cooperating with hours as asked. I explained to the manager that I had another job and I need my hours to be fixed and it was never done.
bad,Management is terrible in regards to hiring diverse staff and training. They have fun promotions at times though. People that work there are great people just management is terrible and so is HR when it comes to payroll problems.
bad,#1 focus is to cut costs which means most IT jobs moving offshore or to H1Bs.   For the remaining employees management is doing their best to get them to resign by moving jobs to Houston and forcing employees to move or resign.  This is how Chevron treats loyal employees.
bad,"Worked here for a few months when I first moved to the area.  After the manager that hired me decided to take another job for more money and better hours, the owner refused to hire or promote anyone else, having minimum wage employees pick up the slack at no matter the cost to their personal time or desires.  Days off not respected.  Nothing above min. wage even for veteran employees."
bad,"Chevron was under poor management, they also are not equal with all employees. the employees who work at chevron are easy to get along with, but not the management."
bad,"A typical day at Chevron was dealing with various tenants which consisted moving tenants in/out and negotiated various leases with the tenants, which also involved remodeling suites."
bad,"I was stressed every time I went to work if I was going to get all I my work done because I worked 11-7 shift by myself so I was stress about being robbed as well. I had to clean the store, stock and do gas, and cashier by myself and they expected it all to be done by 7 am if I was busy or not. The weekends were busy so they could have had another worker with me."
bad,"it was a great job  at first then new management took over and let everyone go without any explanation . "
bad,Asks you to do things you have no education/experience knowledge of. Manager had no formal training in her field making decisions costing the company hundreds of thousands of dollars.
bad,Manager was absolute garbage. Would never have a set schedule. Was promised 40 hours per week sometimes only got 22. Took 2 months to get $800 dollars owed. It's all good I took it to the labor board and these punks got served.
bad,"This is just a terrible place to work, The boss (bob) while yell and curse at the manager (nadir) in front of customers. they talk bad about everyone."
bad,Hours vary with only one employee being in the store.  No breaks given a certain amount of hours worked.  No insurance was provided.  And the manager changed your schedule without given notice to do so.
bad,Just a temporary job I took as I had just moved to a new state. Its alright but not worth to me and my skills. I am skilled with computers and there's no use of it there hindering my progress.
bad,"My daily duties at work including sorting out data using SIMS SMART system to be able to analysing data by measuring trends and identifying areas of opportunity for further development and also areas of concerned that needs to be addressed."
bad,Not a great experience here. Little care is given to the business and the employees. Not a good place to work if your looking to advance
bad,"This job was very easy. I did have a lot of responsibility being the night manager, but there were no challenges. It was a job where there was very little trust I don't mind my work being monitored, but with this job my managers did more than monitor. It was almost no need to have employees. That was the hardest part because I constantly tried to prove myself and there wasn't anything that worked."
bad,"Good company, General Manager was very rude and hostile towards employees, inflicted  fear to get what he wanted. would be a better place with better managment."
bad,You need to have good customer service skills and able to stand for extended periods of time. It's a good starting job but doesn't make for a career.
bad,was not very happy working here.  Work hard for nothing have the time and was not appreciated.
bad,Typical work day consisted of working the register by taking and providing monies to and and from customers. I learned how to use their register system and how to complete a lottery entry. Co-workers were punctual and very helpful to knew employees. The hardest part of this job was the clean up of the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with the customers.
bad,Training was my expertise but managing their local business office was a very enjoyable part of my job.
bad,I mostly worked alone in this job. It was nice - you had allot of time to think.
bad,"I come to the work , I work on registry , i solve the problems of customers ,and I clean the store and organize the staff on shelf ,i make the order of what the store needs"
bad,mainly i was in charge of the cash register and cutomers. cleaning and arranging store and its needs in inventory. great daily customers and staff was very nice and fun.
bad,Majority of the time I worked alone and stayed at the cash register.
bad,"Micro management is high"
bad,"As the title says, same with the boss, not so much with the manager."
bad,"Not a place that you wanted to work at for a long time, the manager seems to know that people will come and go so isn't to upset about people leaving, but also means doesn't give people much reason to stay either."
bad,"Chevron Law IT does not have on-boarding in place for new hires and contractors.  Their Agile Methodology is not according the standard. The functional design document is required before the Business Requirement Document. "
bad,"The management was bad, the manager really never did his job we the staff had to take almost all of our problems up to HR and get them solved that way, when we did bring problems to the manager he would just ignore said issues and nothing would be done about it.  "
bad,"It was a good environment, cashier stocking, cleaning , made sure store was always clean and well maintained. Enjoyed working for Chevron, would like to go back."
bad,"I worked here for a little over a year. It was a pretty new environment for me bur I adapted quickly to it. Some coworkers were really fun to work with. But others would bring their own problems to work and blame them on you even tho you would barely talk to them. The reason for leaving this company was because I wanted to go back to school and they refused to give me the hours that I needed. I was told ""Next time don't choose classes that will be interrupting  company hours."""
bad,"The skills you learn help you in your career if you are just starting out. Pay isnt great but it is not terrible. Management was poor at best, Culture was subpar."
bad,My entire department was outsourced to contractors to save money putting all the records of previous exploration in jeopardy.  They don't care about anything but making a dollar or doing a buddy a favor.
bad,"The work environment was very fast paced and demanding. Many people would come in at once so customer service had to be speedy. We helped each other as needed but it was difficult due to limited people working. Training was decent but your expected to learn very quickly. Also had too much drama at work at down times. If you were to work swing, day starts out extremely busy but gets slow at night."
bad,"Very fraternal, forced rankings, lost culture, lost many good friends including myself to younger inexperienced new hires. Cost reductions and safety put people at risk - the public rarely was exposed to many of the accidents that were published."
bad,"They rarely hire anything but engineers or recent college grads. The supporting staff is all contractors now and instead of decent pay in lieu of benefits they just offer low pay and no benefits. They post all their jobs internally and only hire friends or relatives on recommendations and a lot of total slackers enjoy great jobs and benefits while contractors do the same work and get no benefits or appreciation. They don't necessarily treat you poorly but it becomes very apparent quickly the difference in compensation between employees and contractors. A higher skill required job pays less then it did in 2008, they are taking advantage of people because of the competition for jobs."
bad,"If you like cars then you'll like washing the nice cars that sometimes come in, but the management is normally very poor. They will not teach you the things you need to know but will get mad you don't know how to do them. If you bond with your customers and coworkers than it's bearable."
bad,"Very un organized, before starting , I was told that the pay rate was $11/hr. When I came to find out that they had ""forgot to mention"" that we start at $10.30/hr and get a $0.30 raise in 3 months, which to me was ridiculous"
bad,"its usually quiet."
bad,"If you work for the parent company, CVX, you can expect integrity, a good working environment and loyalty. CES, Chevron Energy Solutions is just the remnants of a company called Viron that Chevron picked up to be able to claim that they were investing in renewable technology. The reality is that CES is okay place to work, but far removed from the standards of Chevon Oil. They use CVX's clout to get jobs, then sub them out to low bidders and charge margins 50-70% higher than the industry standard for a general contractor."
bad,very un organized. if your Mormon there are no worries. Because that's who the area manger is a president Mormon.
bad,Great place to work with customers and providing excellent service all day to make the customers day.
bad,Chevron is really obssesed with safety and will make you review their policies every 6 months. Management varies store to store. The hardest part of the job is not defending yourself when customers verbally abuse you. the best part of the job is when customers treat you well.
bad,Company is led by mid level managers who are only interested in furthering their own career via buzz words while just milking the technical resources without any hopes of helping them develop.
bad,"I really enjoy working at gas stations i get a good vibe and meet a lot of different people , you get to engage more in life i feel like when you meet different kind of people and working at chevron really was all about just making sure you get the job done you can still enjoy your time at work you just have to multitask and stay focused"
bad,"The job was decent, management was very poor. Customer Service was a key attribute to have. stressful at times. most difficult part of the job was doing inventory and checking in new items and tending to customers at the same time. very important to be able to multitask."
bad,"Working as a contractor there you have NO JOB SECURITY, so beware if anything were to happen, you cough the wrong way they can and will fire you. Great job, with benefits, work/life balance is good, but just know you will be treated differently at all times. Discrimination has been a main factor as well."
bad,"When I started with Chevron, we had superb management and leadership.  If I did something poorly, I was corrected.  If I succeeded, I was rewarded.  Somewhere in the past couple of years, perhaps due to the down-turn, the atmosphere has changed.  Office politics has overcome technical competence, drilling the well and sound leadership.  I would not recommend this company."
bad,"And when oil prices are down, don't spend any money, layoff a bunch of people, kill any morale.  I'm glad I don't work there anymore.  Pay was great, but there's more to life than a paycheck.  I sleep much better at night without all the stress."
bad,Loved my job it was very stressful due to all daily dutys feel on me. The chevron is independently owned the owner is very hard to deal with at times no raises no sick leave no 401k work all holidays. The owner don't have any compassion for his employees he  concern is the money and what's going out of his pockets not his employees.
bad,"I enjoyed working here at the beggining, until i got the impression that Corporate does not veiw their employees as people, but rather pawns.  My coworkers and Manager have worked here for 15-20 years before our store was changed to Chevron, and the new Rep we got is still not respectful to my manager and other employees.  Weve had problems with a certain customer threatening my coworker and hes still allowed in our store despite the fact she told Corporate about it."
bad,"Incredibly competitive workplace, in the sense that you're seen to be competing with your co-workers. Recent layoffs have soured morale. Nearly all perks have been taken away. Raises have been stagnant for two years. Training has all but stopped."
bad,i worked here for about a month before i got fired for being accused to stealing by the supervisor... if your drawer comes up short they take it out of your weekly check and they expect you to do so much irrelevant tasks all for 7.25 and hour . the manager doesn't do her job unless the owner is on his way
bad,"My main objective as an employee, and where I gained the most enjoyment was when you could work as a team to make the workplace  the most positive environment possible. the frustration, is that  many workers, lack sufficient organizational skills, and the anything will do attitude. I like doing tasks that have a good before and after affect.  Where you get a true sense of accomplishment. I enjoy customer service, providing efficient , effective customer interaction.  I like it when it is busy, providing we have  the proper staffing, so that customer service is not sacrificed .   As a manager, I like to delegate, cross train employees, I have noticed that some managers are micro managers, and fail to delegate, therefore  not giving their staff the proper opportunity to show their stuff and potential. Give the staff a chance to take on responsibility , their job becomes more interesting and it promotes the team concept."
bad,Working with the public is enjoyable and satisfying. There were no hard areas of work. You took care of the store to make a customer want to come in and purchase items needed or wanted. Always have a smile on your face and be friendly.
bad,"non exempt employees are not valued, two weeks vacation a year for the first five years, very behind the times.  Good old boys network still running the show.  Company is slowly pulling out of California, if you don't take a job in Houston, no severance.  Archaic HR policies with too many people in HR who know nothing and the other half either contractors or outsourced.  Top heavy, big salaries.  Way too much money spent on executive compensation. Most people have worked there twenty plus years and are sitting pretty.  Newer people not so much and if you're non exempt, you are at the bottom."
bad,"Tedious"
bad,"I did not mind the hard work, very long hours and unpredictable work schedule. But I am looking for a place to work with benefits as I have a son now , and want a place of employment with insuranve and an opportunity to move up. There is virtually no real chance of advancement at my present employer, thanks"
bad,"My job is to provide customer service to the best of my abilities to anyone and everyone, i have learned to better my skills in communication, organization,  and work ethic. The hardest part of my job is multi-tasking between stocking up the store products and taking the customers at once."
bad,"Worked 12 hr. shift mostly nights. Management was not what I thought it would be. Was told that there was going to be several years of work, ther during the Company training time was let go."
bad,"My experience with working at chevron was energizing, but had a few shortcomings. I greatly enjoyed the work environment, and it was a position I could see myself still being in, had it not been for the unlucky lottery that is a bad manager. The usual day is first and foremost dealing with customers, and using the time between to take care of the store. doing things like cleaning, sanitizing, organizing the displays, restocking, and taking inventory. Unfortunately, my location happened to have a less that desirable management that, through a series of decisions, made it apparent that the above and beyond attitude that I had a worker was not going to reciprocated well, and that the ethical position of the owner was less than favorable, at which point I felt I didn't have much option other than moving on. That being said, its my understanding that having an unfavorable manager is a rare occurrence in the position, and I would gladly recommend my friends to work at a chevron location, just maybe not that location in specific."
bad,"At Chevron, even the simplest tasks become painfully detailed due to corporate anti-lawsuit minutiae.  The tuition assistance, however, was highly desirable and outweighed the cons, by-and-large, for a working student."
bad,Plenty of room for growth and can be a stable and long term job if you want it. Easy to move up into mangment positions and most times you can work as many hours as you like.
bad,Chevron Gas Station is a 24/7 operation so my hours varied including weekends.  Advancement Opportunities are slow.  Benefits are excellent.  Management need to improve in promotional opportunities.
bad,"i wouldnt recommend , too many rules and meetings, i had people being rude and disrespectful, the manager i had treated me diffrent than others, i dont know if it was because i was a girl or my race."
bad,"The Chevron that I worked at was actually a jackpot food mart. It serves hot food in addition to the average gas station snacks and supplies and such. Keeping up with the food made this job particularly difficult, especially considering that it would be extremely busy, and understaffed."
bad,"working at chevron taught me to be more patient, customer service was great. over all chevron was a good starting point. my previous manager was very flexible with my schedule when i was attending school, always put our education first."
bad,i think that extra mile is a good place to start working in life if u had never work in ur life a gas station is a good place to start..it help me to think what a really wanted in life..
bad,"I would cook, clean dishes, meet and talk to some customers, i wasn't a fan of my bosses (husband and wife) people were mean when food wasn't done at the time they wanted it."
bad,i love to learn about vehicles and to please my customers hoping one day i can have my own business i learn how to change oil rotate tires check all the fluid
bad,"After A year being here I no longer care for the job. Im sick of the amount of work I do and how little I get compensated. The owners are not the greatest and It is obvious they do not care too much for their employees. The owners are obviously sexist and the Lady co workers get treated much better. A typical day would be me washing cars for hours, filling peoples propane tanks, and running the register. The days are stressful when you consider there is only two people running the store and tons of cars, customers, and propane to taken care of, usually im rushing around between the mentioned jobs trying to get everything done in a timely manner.... really we need at least 3 people everyday run the store not 2. The hardest part of this job is being outside for like 4 to 5 hrs straight washing cars non stop and only being compensated minimum wage its total B.S. There is not much too enjoy at this job except my co workers who are the greatest. In the end this job is ok nothing more nothing less. If we were compensated better maybe it would be worth it... and if the higher ups were not so bad in general maybe I would not mind being at this job."
bad,"A typical day at work was fast paced; almost no room for slack.  Some of my coworkers were competent and knew what they were doing and some were incompetent and did not know how to do the simplest of things . About half of the staff move slowly and slacked while the other half took their jobs seriously and worked hard.  The customers were friendly and surprisingly reasonable.  The manager cares for his job, he's been a good and kind boss to me; tough job to go through on a daily basis, but he does his best.  I learned the meaning of hard and fast paced work, how to become a people person and how to manage, learned a little about cars as well, most important of all I learned how to be a professional.  The most challenging aspect about my job is the high number of customers we go through on a daily basis.  We are surely outnumbered and some of the coworkers don't know how to work under pressure.  On the other hand the most enjoyable aspect about my job is how easy and simple it is.  I am good at what I do."
bad,"Working alone was a great way to learn to how to manage your wisely. "
bad,"Chevron, overall, is a great company to work for, though Public Affairs has many managerial issues to sort out."
bad,Not bad . The company lures you with good overseas package . Then send you back home and pays you 60% less. No overseas bonus. I resigned from the company due to this problem . Treats it  employees many time worst than contractors
bad,"Easy job and a some what of a nice staff but too many lazy employees. Don't work too hard, management does not care or appreciate you going out of your way doing extra work."
bad,The Company was more intrested in their bran name than employees and was always on getting the deal close no matter what price and getting the brand to be exoanded alwaysss.
bad,This job gives opportunity and has a great job culture with chances to move up the ladder. I would recommend someone this job because it fulfills everything a person needs to continue
bad,"They worked with my schedule for school, so that was very helpful. Manager and coworkers were very nice, but overall, I would not recommend. You get a lot of mean customers who treat you very badly. The job itself is very simple and easy, but it does require you to be fast. The plus side is, there are many ways to move up. There's constantly job postings and if you go to school, Chevron has a program where they pay about 75% of your tuition. Good benefits, but a very hostile environment at times."
bad,I really enjoyed the work but the head office totally screwed everyone that worked there over without a second thought. it was a good job for highschool students
bad,It wasnt a great job had alot of internal bs n management played favorites made unfair rules. Day shift left alot of unfinished tasks for graveyard n management would never correct that bad behavior
bad,"Im sure chevron would be a great company to work for, and the pace is set fairly busy at certain times, and sometimes depending on which shift and other co workers work ethic you could be contributing to a lot of work duties, a lot of lifting heavy weights, and propane servicing, Managment wouldnt schedule their employees with enough hours or days, and soon was cut down to one or two days per week but then they kept on hiring new employees but I’m sure that not all the chevron stations review like the chevron located in Wasilla, Alaska."
bad,A typical day at Chevron.  You show  up and help out the person who you are replacing.  You check the log book for any changes in policies or procedures.  Then you probably clean the store and stock missing products.  You also cook food to safety standards.
bad,Chevron is a great people friendly company to start off in. Chevron provides a great work life balance and networking within different groups.
bad,"Not aggressive enough in regards to alternative energy solutions. Culture is the ""old boy"" network, not enough diversity in thinking, not enough visible diversity in upper levels of management."
bad,Chevron Phillips has a great CEO. He really cares about the success of the company and the employee.There are really great people who work here. Also the company offers  9/80s.
bad,It was okay job to work at nothing fancy no opportunity to exell
bad,"The responsibility was considerable due to handling money, especially when working the late shift and dealing with some unrully people."
bad,I met a lot of good people and had a great time working there. I learned everything very quick and was a very flexible with my hours. Overall I beliebe I was paid fairly for the work I was doing.
bad,It was good working with chevron Nig. Ltd as an intern and while working with them i add to the growth of the company and i was opportune to be the budget trainer using EPIC application for budgeting to the budget coordinators.
bad,there was a day my supervisor ask me to do  the hardest part of  the  job and I did it perfectly .
good,"Not a very good company but other chevrons are good !"
good,"You have too want something that no one else wants for you..."
good,"manager yelled at me for not cleaning a machine properly, she stood me in front of said machine and yelled at me and showed me how to do it properly! this was in the middle of the day during rush hour, so every one saw..."
good,i miss this job. when i first started working at gas stations i thought they were low cheap jobs that could be no fun and i was gonna get no where in life with it.  it turned out to be a fun job
good,"I started at a different location where I loved my boss, it was very chill, the customers were weird, but great!- lots of regulars. It was easy to get the work done because everyone did their part and was a team. I started at 10.50/hr"
good,"I worked for Chevron in drilling and completions. Chevron is the lowest payroll out of all major oil companies. When I start Chevron was a good family oriented company who helped and believed in their people. Since the slow down 2012 many good employees with vast experience retired, got laid off, or moved on  New supervisors with little to no experience came in. They only worry about how the can move up stabbing all others in the back. You will only make it it you go along with them no matter what and do what the day. Don’t rock the boat or disagree with Chevron or their mighty Chevron HR department will find a way to fire you. The best is for young employees to get experience then move ov to better companies with more par."
good,cant speak for others but the one i worked at was the worst palce ive ever worked at... they had no care for there employees they didnt give no rasies
good,A typical day at work was very repetitive with working with customer sales and store cleanliness. Clerks learned how to handle cash and customer service as well as stocking the shelves for future purchases. The management team was very willing to work for their employees. Most of the co-workers were willing to accomplish their job effectively.
good,"Operate cash register, handle customers, clean, stock shelves, do basic paperwork. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the low morale of the work environment. The job itself is not hard and could be more enjoyable."
good,"Job Duties: Cashier duties, light cleaning, stocked, helped customers, cleaned gas pumps, made reports on pump malfunctions. Kept daily reports on registers money entrance and withdrawals from safe."
good,"Counting in the till."
good,"at times the manager would allow staff to take ready-made food home example muffins, donuts, sandwiches, lunches in plastic dishes.  Maintaining the cleanliness of the store inside and outside."
good,"Being a cashier is not that difficult. "
good,"I was wrongfully Terminated, for, ""Whistleblowing""!   Typical day at work, cashier, cook, clean. Made up to $3,700.00 on the weekends, begining on Fridays."
good,"Have a manager on all shifts. Managers should be responsible for cigarette count not cashiers. Employees should be trained properly, not just put on there own and docked pay when they make a mistake they were not trained to deal with."
good,The overall experience of work ing here was beneficial because I encountered alot of well rounded people. The job wasntgood in pay but it made ends meet.
good,"other then having a really messed up sleep schedule going to bed at 7am and there not being any advancements because its just a gas station. it was a really easy job and before the new owners, the old owners were super awesome and didn't mind if i read my books once everything was cleaned for the night and I had no customers. the new owners didn't re-hire any of the old staff. id rate higher if it was still the old owners."
good,"Most chevrons are franchised out to private owners. These owners in my experience underpay their employees consistently, over charge customers and care nothing for either."
good,I do not believe my last 2 years are a reflection of Chevron. Find the right people to do a job and you will not have a job done wrong. I want to work for a company that truly stands by their employees. Regardless of the social status they hold.
good,"Chevron is a great company to work for if under management with integrity. Great benefits and for the most part, employee's are decent to work with. Management is in dire need of supervisory skills."
good,Try to make working here temp and try to go somewhere where you can advance. You can never move up with this company. The only way to move up is if someone gets fired.
good,Was the only black person working three amongst many hispanics and try treated me terribly . It was an awful place to work. You could work by yourself with no breaks
good,This place is a good place to work at untill you upset the manager. Poor communication on management side you never know whats going on unless you are in the inner circle
good,The company was very unorganized and did not treat employees well at all. Fraud was also going on within the company and i would not recommend telling friends to apply.
good,I enjoyed the position as a cashier. The management was not that great at the time I worked there. I enjoyed my customers. I loved the hours I worked.
good,I enjoyed being around people. the work enviroment  was very nice.
good,Most chevrons I have worked for is very easy going with the employees. A little too lenient.
good,Job was great but commute was very far from residence.
good,"it was a job for someone who already has another job, using chevron as an extra income job. Management was  hardly ever there, or never really spent time with the customers addressing any of their concerns."
good,One family pretty much manipulates the work environment there including in management. The crazy part is they are ripping the store off. They create a hostile work environment to anyone who isn't related which causes a high turn over rate. General manager doesn't care because they do the work he's supposed to do and doesn't .
good,My manager was horrible she only cared about herself. The pay was very low for a graveyard shift. You had to stand on your feet for 8 hours with no break.
good,The chevron I worked at was lacking in management. I loved the people I worked with (cashiers) but the “manager” was a joke! I did enjoyed the steady work pace at the chevron I worked at.
good,It is a fast paced job with lots of stocking customer service required but the main thing is watching out for the drug dealers drug addicts and people stealing that's one of the main important things for customer service
good,there is way too much of a high school type of way to move by basically only bickering about people will you be able to find way up in the company past a certain point
good,I would not work there again. Moses is an unfair boss and has poor management skills. He does try to make everyone happy with the schedule but other than that. he is very unfair.
good,It was a great place to work until they changed ownership. The new owners don't speak English and they make you do things that aren't part of your job description.
good,The particular Chevron I work for is also a small family-owned general store. The owners are very kind and accommodating to their employees; to a certain extent. I do not believe that the majority of the complaints I can make about the job itself can necessarily be directed at Chevron.
good,"Stocking products, checking out customers at front desk, cleaning the store and taking/receiving orders from vendors. Typically relaxed, allowed to have your phone out as long as your doing your work. Sometimes stressful and management could use extreme work."
good,I had some fun experiences with costumers but the job isn't enough to keep me busy. It's a boring job that I honestly don't enjoy anymore. I want something with a more social work environment.  And younger customers.
good,Chevron has good managment and the bosses are good to there employees also gives you hours if needed. They also give you food when you don't bring your own lunch.
good,"management is what ruined it for me. On a typical day there would be two people on shift no matter what because of the drive through. but when you worked with the so called manager he would go take naps while you're being overwhelmed with the drive through customers, walk in customers, and while all this is happening if you dont restock before the boss shows up you get chewed out. was not fun."
good,Management did not care weather we have personal problems. They never allowed us a break. If someone could not make it for what ever reason we were forced to do a double .  They did not pay over time.  If a Customer has a problem management did not care.
good,Great team work. Everyone at Chevron is nice.  The entire team work together to help one another when things get mind bobbling.
good,"clock in, count drawer,help customers, stock shelves, make coffee.I learned how to run a gas station by myself. The job was rewarding until the owners husband would come in and upset everyone but the greatest part of the day was I got to talk and meet different people from different walks of life. We are all interesting in are own way."
good,"Working at Chevron gas Station is a challenging experience for me being a qualified immigrant in a strange country with different work ethics, language and entirely different culture.appart from d physical challenges, it requires maximum concentration both mentally and emotionally most of the time, sort mentally in d sense of selling alcohol to minior emotionally alart in terms of helping those with incomplete money, and watching your words or respond to and impatient or angry customers. In the beginning it was tough for me feeling like quiting d job, but I eventually became tougher, and more alart to be able to handle my customers, and the job becomes an enjoyable one for me."
good,A typical day at work would include my coworker and myself to complete a list of chores. The hardest part to my job is learning the prices of everything that doesn't ring into the computer. Normally i work with one other person most of my shift. The most enjoyable part of the job is the happy working environment created by my coworkers and myself.
good,"My time at that place was very uneasy. Poor management. Just bad overall. Hopefully, that company can pull it together...hopefully."
good,Provide customer service. The night shift was more enjoyable . The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers
good,"my typical day at this job was not what i expected, they made me hand wash the pumps and car wash when no one else would do it even though it was and mandatory to make sure everything was clean and look great. what i'v learn for working there is that the coworker can do whatever they want since they have work there the longest and complained about how there stuck here while they have a life. the management skill there poor when he was there he/she was there they would favor some coworkers. there was no hardest part of the job cause they really don't care what you do or when it gets done. the most enjoyable part of this job was the customers seeing there smile faces and helping them when they asked for."
good,There are many people who have been at Chevron for 30 plus years who are very clicky and don't provide you with any assistance to succeed.  In my department I felt I was set-up to fail.
good,"It was a great place to work when i started but, as time went on more responsibility was given to me without the pay to go along with it. Some times there was not enough help on the weekends."
good,Its oka ...just boring a little  bit..that's the bad. I liked it.  They have cheap fountain drinks. Lol and good prices on most things.i would never work there again though
good,"Busy place, love the customers, from laborers, truck drivers, to people passing through to the beaches and back home. I'm not happy due to lack of hours considering several people hired and still hiring after me. I can't get ahead inmy life. Now looking for a second job."
good,"Did a fair amount of sales throughout the day. Learned manager, filing, stocking, cleaning, and ordering skills. Management was average. Workplace was enjoyable. Enjoyed connection made with ""regular"" customers."
good,Don’t do anything you don’t want them to watch later they check all footage and constantly criticize everything it’s creepy and then they all talk bout it behind your back
good,At first they give you so many hours. Then they take them all away practically. The pay wage in Los Angeles is better then Kern County. Have a contract  made of set hours and a length of time set in contact. Dont let them walk all over you.You are worth more .
good,"Enjoyed working alone during overnight shifts. Doors locked at 12/1 am when alcohol stops selling and I would tend to customers through the window which was bulletproof, so safety wasn't a big issue even while being alone at night. There is always something to be done to stay busy even when business was slow. I loved getting to know the regular customers and being a part of their day. The few downsides being: I wasn't being paid for working overnight (was told overnight shift paid an extra $2/hr), I was never put on payroll, and my hours got cut."
good,"If your supervisor does not like you, you have no future in chevron. Your faith is in your supervisor's hands. It is a very passive aggressive culture."
good,It was okay when I first started but after a couple of weeks the manager decided she was going to leave me in the store by myself untrained employee that's when I said that was enough and I don't want it to work there
good,I've worked there for almost a year now. there is no chance that I will move up. Great job to help you get a feel for any working environment.  I get a lot of hours but sometimes we are short staffed making it difficult to keep up with the stores demands. We always manage to keep up tho.
good,Not impressed. Furlough after furlough with no pay during Thanksgiving week and almost entire month of December. Very very disappointing and disgraceful.
good,"I loved my customers. However, there was too much internal drama and no way of moving up. Space was far to small, and management used a lot of favortism."
good,"Some days the job is repetitive & tedious, but overall it was a good place to work. The owners and management were great! They have an open door policy and they don't make you feel stupid when you ask a question."
good,After being yelled at consistently I would just rather never work there again. Even if I got paid more to do it.  Although I think it was a lot better than some other gas stations.
good,This job helped me get ahead but I had trouble with management. I did not Like the boss I had because she seemed to be on a power trip and it was very hard to get a clear answer from her. I didn't learn much from her.
good,"its hard for this employer to keep employees, theres only two employees thats been there for more then a year. all other employees have either gotten fired or quit."
good,"I had a good time working here, rather than feeling over worked and stressed. Discounted food was a plus also working alone was fun at times until I would need help."
good,I worked for a franchise not sure of the company. It was ok for the time I needed a job. Handled a lot of store maintenance. Dealt with product issues
good,"Chevron was my easiest job I ever had, BUT the manager was my only problem. I asked for months for more hours promised me more hours , did nothing about it until a employee was fired for stealing and promised me that employees days . He played favourite with the area coach mother in law and gave her the extra days."
good,awful place to work the employees are very rude. just stand there and look at you the whole shift. always talking behind your back. you only get 16 hours a week
good,good work place that makes u feel like family. work hours are kinda set and no one can make over time unless under staffed. they don't have any befits
good,It’s okay place to start out from high school. But I wouldn’t recommend to no one. You have to work your butt for nothing. The bosses are two faced and you get paid and you don’t get the days you like off. Job security isn’t worth the time.
good,Great gas service but very rude staff expected me to pick up the slack of other employees and work extra hours would not let me take sick days with pay
good,Never a dull moment you never know what lies ahead for you when you walk through the door. One day it may seem great then the next you feel like your walking on egg shells.
good,The best part of the job was meeting new people and the most important thing you learn when working in that type of environment is to how to talk to different types of people.
good,Not enough benifits and poor managment but  fun getting to know customers and bonding with co workers the work was very simple. Sometimes co workers where late and being the only person in booth I had to work late a lot but I didn't mind.
good,Management sucked! This company sucks! They don't care for there employees all they wants is money!!! They will fire you asap... the only good thing about working here was all the experience handling money and dealing with the worst kind of people
good,"I would say this is by far one of the easiest jobs I have been at. I love working with the public and talking about their days, where they were going, their pets and so much more. I also enjoy cleaning, so that was another easy part. I"
good,that pretty much sums it up..owners work you til you break. no lunch breaks or any breaks really if they are present.
good,"no respect from customers, bad manager. long days, no benefits"
good,"Thankful for the opportunity the manager gave me. Jobs really dried up in the area at the time. She made a chaotic, busy place a great place to work at everyday. The staff worked well together."
good,The hardest part was keeping an eye on the customers in the store and making sure the ones at the pump don't run off without paying for their gas.
good,Not an ideal place to work. Management is awful and lots of politics being played. Pay is a bare minimum for the amount of work that has to be done. Do not recommend this place at all.
good,Management didn’t want to work with me having kids  wanted me to open but I never had anyone to watch them at 1:30am. I loved working there and I loved taking care of my customers i just wanted more time with my kids
good,"It’s a job it’s easy and simple it’s not physically straining and its above minimum wage 12bucks . They let me go after 2 weeks . One week my manager loved me the next week i showed up and they said someone was suppose to call me. "
good,The work place there isn't something I recommend . You basically do not have a life. The enivorment there isn't the happiest place and sometime i wish i did not have to go to work.
good,If you want a pretty easy job this was good but there's no advancement in the company and the experience got me nowhere. Customers were usually OK but you do have to deal with jerks and the homeless.
good,"Make deposit, count tills-audit, customer service, manage store, order product, call employees in to cover other shifts when needed. Shifts would very from 5am to 1130 pm or all night."
good,Owner acts as manager and is very over bearing for the small pay provided. I would not work here ever again and I wouldn’t want anyone else to either.
good,"Try not to accuse, refute, or blame. In fact, industry experts recommend that you simply restate the company policies and speak to how you will right the wrong.No matter how offensive the review is, always assume that the customer might be right. (I don’t believe that the customer is alwaysright.)For example, if a customer is upset about shipping times on a certain product, you can the repeat shipping policy, send a link and comment that delays can be expected at times. You can also add how committed your company is to their customers and work hard to make sure shipments are made on time and accurately. An option might be to offer the customer free shipping on his or her next order. This may calm the situation but can also let other customers know that you are serious in meeting customer demands within time and budget.You might even have the customer change their rating from 2 or 3 stars to hopefully 4 or 5."
good,the company did not pay well and there was no room for advancement. The work environment was not well. It was an easy job but terrible place to work .
good,"When I worked for Chevron, I genuinely thought I would love it and stay for longer than I did. For those of you this is your first time, go for it. But for me, this was my third job and the lack of communication with each other and the hours being cut, I wasn't going to stick around sadly. I wanted to stay but I wasn't making enough money to help pay my bills so I left. It wasn't for me but I feel like for those who want to avoid fast food and have their first job experience this job would be a perfect starter."
good,I didn't work long but the times were not flexible to be able to take care of my kids and home. There weren't any benefits and the pay was pretty low. In all fairness the job was not hard either. Good starter job
good,Plenty of work if you don't mind some unfair treatment. It always seemed the owner and owners wife preferred another employee. A series of back handed promises only to get them taken away.
good,"Agradable trato con los clientes, pero la administración no contaba con buena logística, aprendí a tomar decisiones de forma inmediata para satisfacer la necesidad del cliente a falta de respuesta por parte de la administración. Por parte de la dirección falta de interés con la fuerza de ventas; y una cultura que fomentaba la honestidad y el compromiso con la empresa."
good,"Lots of stress, lots of hours, administratively under staffed for the project for the entire time period.  Lots of insecurity about continuing employment.."
good,"Great job but new owners caused complications in management. This job was excellent with flexibility on scheduling, but the schedule never stayed consistent."
good,i enjoyed working with my crew members but manager show differences between her co worker she wouldn't fair i loved meeting new people the whole job was stressful
good,Chevron is a great client to work. Business Partners have equal opportunities as much as a full time employee. A very good company to work with. People are very safety minded. They are concerned about you and want to make every effort to make sure you do well in your position.
good,It was a decent job. I was given 36 hours a week over 6 days. I would have rather gotten the hours within 5 days instead of 6. There wasn't enough advancement on the job.
good,I loved this job for a long tome but the poor management and revolving door of employees constantly leaving pushed me out. Also no PTO. No sick time. Honestly you can’t even call in without everyone being super angry at you.
good,"Working at a gas station, might not be the most glamorous job and it isn't, but you do have a lot of down time. Working for Chevron for 4 years had a lot of ups and downs. Corporate's demands are not as ""stressful"" as other jobs, mostly posting company promotions and setting merchandise as they want to. Other than that, there's not much else to the job other than working a cash register. When it's busy, working the register and the lottery machine is a little tough, but you get into a good groove over time. Customers are a mix bag depending where you are located, I working in the Los Angeles area, so there was a lot of very rude and aggressive customers. Management will be different from Chevron to Chevron, but my Management was okay, self focused and looked out for themselves mostly. On good days they looked after their staff, but they looked to do as little as possible and still turns  profit. Overall learned a lot about myself and working with the public, worth doing for a short season of life."
good,inventory count cigarettes and lottery. make fresh coffee. refill drinks. count inventory that comes in and goes out. clean gas spills. i learned that it was a privately owned station. hardest part would be dealing with drunk people trying to buy alcohol after 2 am. most enjoyable part of the job is meeting tons of people.
good,I worked by myself for 9 hours everyday. With only the company of the customers that only stayed a min. of 5 minutes. was boring. Management was not professional at all. Did not listen tohis own employees.
good,"The Manager Mistreats employees. Does not provide breaks, or lunch breaks. Makes you waive those rights. No overtime pay just paid normal pay but in cash."
good,I enjoyed working this job as a 2nd part time job when I need to earn a little extra money. It helped with my joy of being organized and you get to meet lots of new faces.
good,"Enjoyed the customers and the face pace work. Good food, and a full time job. Very stressful place to work. Did not get lunch breaks.Worked very hard for min wage."
good,"Manager's spouse is probably one of the rudest individuals I've ever met in my life, one MAIN reason I stopped working there. Coming to work wondering if they will be in a good mood or not at all, is pretty stressful. I never did anything to hurt any feelings, but I got treated poorly. Turnover is ridiculous, new employee working there at least once a month."
good,"Objectives: *Focuse on detail of specific job skill"
good,Working overseas in Iraq was very interesting . I learned a lot working for DynCorp.  I had a chance to train outside of my  skillset on my free time in the Supply Chain Dept.
good,Typically enjoy side tasks and talking with costumers. There is a drug problem with one employee in general and I suspect theft is occurring. This is the down fall to the job.
good,"The Owner and the Manager are amazing people, very charismatic. I felt like at times though a few of the elderly patrons that had been there 10+ years pushed their work on me and when certain stuff wasn't done, I was to blame. Can't really move up the ladder and the top out pay was $1.00 more than minim wage."
good,"A typical day working at Chevron would consist of many things such as opening and closing the store, making all of the food through out the day, making coffee through out the day, helping customers, stocking shelves, pulling out of date items, training new employees, opening and closing the car wash, spraying down cars before they enter the car wash, and being polite and courteous to customers. While working at Chevron I learned many things, a few of those things I learned are how to rotate items on shelves, how the gas pumps worked, and how to check inventory. Working at  Chevron I had some of the best co-workers that I have ever worked with, besides some bad apples we had the best team an employee could ask for, everyone I worked with was very hardworking, very team oriented. They made working at a gas station fun and enjoyable. The hardest part about working at Chevron was the hours. I was hired to be the night supervisor so I planned everything around the hours I was going to be working, I planned childcare, life, bills, etc. But unfortunately I was not given the hours I was hired for, and that made my home life very difficult. The management at chevron was decent. I absolutely loved my supervisor, who trained me, and worked with me almost everyday, she was patient, kind and understanding. My store manager was not the most understanding or caring women. She did not care about most of her employees, she would pick favorites, and be very rude to the other employees. She often blames everyone else for either her or someone else's mistakes. The owner of the store was a very"
good,"A typical day at Chevron is assisting the customers in their fuel and product purchases; interacting with them and promoting them to buy not one but two.  What I learned while working there, is patience and a little bit of Spanish. Most of the customers are hurrying on their way to whatever place they need to be, most times they get the pump number wrong or they do not understand why they fuel prices are so high.  Having patience and understanding to deal with these situations help.  If you do not, the situations can and will get out of hand and will escalate to bigger problems.  The company I work for only has one management; the owner. Everything is done by him.  If you have a problem or grievance, you take it up with him.  This one-man management operation has good and bad points.  The good point being that the company feels like family and if any emergency irises, it gets taken care of.  The point is, the if you have a problem with the owner, then there is nobody above him that you can talk to.  The co-workers are great.  Some have come and gone, but the ones that have stayed the for a duration of longer then a year have been good.  They have been great to work with.  Many aspects of the job could be hard or enjoyable, it depends on how the day is: customers,  the owner or the co-workers, could be amazingly fun or extremely difficult.  I found out that I have the most fun with repeat customers.  It is nice getting to know that and they you."
good,"Management had a tendency to fool around with others on staff. That type of indulgence is deleterious to the morale of the workers not involved in illicit love relationships."
good,I rated it this because this place I loved working at. Dealing with the customer and helping them.
good,"I had the greatest privilege of learning and applying ""diversity"". Its a typical great day at work because you sure have new things to learn and new challenge to handle daily."
good,"A typical day at work, being a cashier and cleaning, and making customers happy. I learned to stay on top of everything when a huge crowd of customers came in all at once. The management was fair. co workers were Good and we all worked together.. the hardest part of the job, there was no hard part to me. the most enjoyable part was constantly dealing with the regular patients who came in and you know exactly what they want."
good,Fast ace depending on the day works management is always willing to help and teach. Get along well with co-workers hardest part of the job is dealing with customers and different personalities most enjoyable part is meeting new people.
good,"A typical day at work is running the register, help customer and perform cleaning duties around the store. I learn how to deal with any situation even on busy stressful days. My co-workers fun to work with and like to work as a team. The hardest part of the job is when the network system breaks goes down and we have to do some trouble shooting to bring it back up. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers with any questions or problems they have with our gas pumps or promoting our specials we have with some of the store products."
good,It's a job and it got me thru a tuff time. Not the best pay. But they came work around a schedule if u have s ok mething to take care of...............
good,"The current atmosphere of Chevron is that it's very disorganized at hiring new employees in a timely manner. As a result, staffing is very difficult and it requires current employees to work a lot in order to cover jobs that must be manned 24/7. Though it's very easy to make a lot of money in short amount of time."
good,"Gas station was Privately owned and operated. "
good,"Easy work, fast paced environment so you stay busy. Low pay and a lot of drama associated with the workplace. Getting to meet new people from different places was the best part of the job."
good,A good Company to work with but bad managerial approach to contract employments. workers benefits  are still hanging imbalance after the changes in new contract employment.
good,"They say is costumer service but is not they don’t let you know you gotta clean gasoline whenever there’s any spill, work outside and inside exhaustive cleaning including bumps and restrooms. Sometimes you get to work alone, deal with favoritism from the manager, so the tasks are not switched fairly, poor management, they don’t provide positive feedback only negative, working with less than $100 in the register is stressing. Terrible stressing place to work."
good,"I didn't line the 9-80 work schedule."
good,The company is full of mismanagement.  They allow people to hide behind their processes instead of being held accountable for mistakes.  The working group is forced in to layoffs and other poor situations while upper management is allowed to continue in their jobs.
good,Toxic work environment with little to weak leadership and support within the field group. the work area and equipmentg to be worked with was new and easy to work with.
good,"High-paced work, little to no time for breaks. At night all cleaning was left to who was working at that time. Work hours were not that flexible and often had to work a double shift."
good,"The Chevron I worked at was extremely inflexible. I was going to school and not only were they not willing to give me more hours to pay for classes, they made it very clear that there would be no advancement."
good,"The last two years at chevron have been a depressing time, I have been working there for the past 4 years and the last two was taken under new management. I felt like I have been disrespected. I have been in the customer services for 5 years now and 3 prier to new management and being told what to do by new employees whom don't know the job them self's. it was stressful not knowing what days I worked cause the constant changing of schedules with out my knowledge. Also the lack of supply's and equipment  that was provided for me was sad,  Had to bring me own rubber cloves and rags form my home to clean stuff like toilets and pumps. there was no team work and did all labour work well the rest sat one there phones and sitting in chairs.  I worked for another Chevron and never have I seen any thing like this, "
good,Chevron offers good pay and benefits but it comes at a cost. Working weekends holidays and nights along with consistant forces deplete your days off. Hopefully they hire soon to allow for a less stressful workplace.
good,Two in one business. Delishop and gas station all in one. Maintain store and ga pumps stocked and clean. Clean up restrooms which are frequently used by customers.
good,"I had pleasure working there but unfortunate they never set a schedule and seemed they only have a few people to only have set schedules. "
good,The boss was uptight and there was a lot of favoritism going on. They made us work with food even though some of my team were obviously sick and shouldn't have bee working. They did not require us to have a food handlers card and that should have been a requirement for anyone working with food.
good,"As a Super Major, Chevron cannot be bothered with either the advancement nor concerns of lower level management.  Fortunately for Chevron, the massed competence of their employees overcomes the incompetence of senior managemen"
good,"Great co woorkers , but poor management, too many employees and not enough hours. Unfair pay , No holiday bonus, no raises . Slow paced environment and relaxing job"
good,"When you have a small business and your employee number is low that’s only coming from two things! 1, you have a great team. Or B, not enough money for more workers"
good,the hardest part of the job was having to work with a incredibly rigid work schedule but the upside is that the people i worked with on a daily basis were great.
good,Day to day operations of high producing wells was a challenge and book work was also abundant. The new wells are coming online a a fast rate creating problems for operations and new challenges.
good,"My shift was from 2 pm to 11pm "
good,Same routine every week very tedious tasks like stocking and constant cleaning. good customer service practice. Managers were very strict on rules and dresscode.
good,No  cannot do this.  I just want to work. Why do I have todo this stuff in order to get a job.  This is major blah.  I just want to get a job i dont want todo this blah
good,"It wasn't amazing. The boss was rude, I was dropped in with next to no training, and the coworker was a dude literally 3 times my age, who only wanted to talk about politics. It was a slow area, the most busy part being the gas station part, so I was hardly doing anything."
good,A typical day at work would be making food for the hot case and restocking for the following day. keeping the hot case full for customers at certain times of the day. keeping the store clean and keeping customers satisfied. The management in this store is not like many others they care about their employees.. The hardest part of my job was trying my hardest to do my job with the short amount of time I had training. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help the customers.
good,Hi I'm Gurpreet t I'm start too work chevron 2013 and end 2016 last month but onwer or mangers all time trouble me costume is good with other employees is working together so fun thanks
good,The management was wishy washy & they were not flexible with the hours we would have to work. The communication was also an issue. I think they should have also had 2 workers for the overnight shifts until at least 2/3AM it's kind of dangerous for a woman to go to the dumpster late at night by herself
good,"The people you come in contact with are pleasant most of the time. You get to know your community who is around you. My co workers are awesome. The days stay busy there is a lot to do. I have learned to just be patient and don't sweat the small things. Management I feel doesn't know what they are doing, how to make schedules, remember your name, or just clean up after themselves. The hardest part is probably dealing with them. I love the people that's what I get the most out of working here."
good,It made it hard to work there but I enjoy working for the public and always have. The manageagement did not pay any us overtime. I would work any hours asked of me.
good,"My typical day at work would be waking up early as 5:30 just to get ready, the 6 am morning shift was sometimes slow but easy. I say it was easy only because I would see the same morning people every morning. I've leaned how to use a cash register and interacting with different kinds of people every other day. The management at Chevron was respectful and also organized. My co-workers were helping, nice, and great to get along with. My most enjoyable part of my job was working in the morning and not in the afternoon."
good,Real push for an American style culture that pushed work over all over elements of life. Management believe that Chevron should be the centre of your entire life.
good,i did graveyard at gas station with lot of people and i know how to do customer service and has good communication skills.
good,"desk job  not much excitement "
good,I learned that working for this company it only a job not a career and will not help me get up in the corporate latter and becoming financially stable .I believe that management at this company is impossible not working with object.
good,I don't not know much about this company within itself. I was working for this company as a temp in a data entry position. However there are plenty of jobs within Chevron that are open.
good,"Working at Chevron has been quite an experience. "
good,It was really fun place to be I loved the people i worked with. we would get a lot of manager's so a lot of things would change a lot. other then the management i would say chevron was a grate place to be and fun.
good,"I would start off by cleaning the coffee pots, then take out the trash and put new bags on the trash cans. Make sure that all the pumps were clean and had paper for the receipts. Scrub the oil on the street and rinse it all off with the hose."
good,"a typical day at my work is pretty hectic with all different types of people and different problems with pumps, homeless, upset customers and sometimes no team work from co workers. Management is awful a lot of favoritism and no equality between different shifts. the hardest part of my job is not knowing if i will be guaranteed 40 hrs the following week. I cant really say that there is nothing enjoyable about my job."
good,"The owner did not care about his employees or his customers. Had unsafe work conditions, as well as illegal business practices."
good,"Chevron Energy Solutions is the green headed adopted orphan of the Chevron family. The main purpose of the division is to give a green spin on the company. While they are self-described as a rounding error on a rounding error of the CVX family, CES is usually front and center in the annual report. As such, it's a pleasant place to work with little or no connection to the parent company,"
good,"greet regular customers everyday and meet new ones"
good,"I did oil change, timing belt changed, and smog check. Nobody helped me in this place, it make me had to do everything by myself. It make me feel good when I could resolve customer's problem."
good,"The Chevron I worked at had the typical day of cleaning the store and restrooms in between dealing with new and reoccurring customers. The management was not always on top of things and many customers complaints would go unheard.  The hardest part of the job was the random schedules and the ""8 hour turn around"" scheduled at least once a week. The most enjoyable part of the work was getting to meet new exciting people and help them with directions, pumping gas, or finding product."
good,"I cleaned, organized, & looked after the store. I ran the cash register."
good,"come in stuck fridge,count register, work closely with customer, handle money,"
good,Challenged and individual with multi tasking while handling money.
good,"My typical day at work is very routine. im assigned a job site and i set it up with fire blankets , fire hose and exstinguisher. I make sure i know my shelter in place in case of emergency and safety equipment location. My superviser is very understanding and works with everyone is a good mannner. my co workers are very helpful and dedicated. my hardest part of my job is staying busy. the most enjoyable part of the job is doing it safe so that i may return to my family the same way i left."
good,"There is a culture that prizes engineering degrees more than anything else.  If you don't have one, you are at the bottom of the foodchain.  The ironic thing is that most of the engineers don't know how to work with their hands at all, and they look down on those who do."
good,"It’s a great job at times, but I need to be able to work more. I’m in college right now so any extra money really helps. They’re really good about doing payouts though to help."
good,The job itself is easy but mangagnt is poor. the favoritism is just too much.  If you only focus only on two people then you ruin the chances of other people getting days off.
good,"It was a fun job and it was easy to get a promotion  but the owners definitely dont have the best interest for the employees. "
good,"On a daily basis, the manager of a gas station greets customers, orders stock and interacts with vendors delivering goods. Other duties include creating the employees' schedule, training new employees, supervising daily activities and handling disputes between employees and customers"
good,It's ok. The fast pace in the spring and summer. Very slow and long days in the winter. Work full time. No lunch breaks. Only get ten-minute breaks every three hours.
good,"Not enough safety protocols for robberies. Very erratic schedules, but manageable when working full time. at the end of my time here i worked graveyard shift, which was 10pm to 6am. I started the night by cleaning the restrooms and restocked all toiletries. Then i brought out more product from the stock room. i made sure to follow FIFO and check for expired product. followed by sweeping an mopping the entire store. Then taking out the trash. All while completing transactions with customers through window. once the morning time comes I am also expected to start brewing coffee and cooking hot foods to be ready to go at opening"
good,it just wasnt the job for me it was a good place to work but wast not for me i enjoyed getting paid weekly and bing able to run the store thank you for the postion
good,My experience so far has been good at chevron. It is a very organized and clean working environment. Your always on your feet and doing something wether its stocking merchandise or cleaning counters. Great peers and work environment overall.
good,I did overnight paperwork as part of my shift noticed an hour being deducted each pay check looked into it I was being docked an hour for lunches and breaks I NEVER  received when questioned I was told it wasn't my business and went from 102 hrs in pay period at one time to two days a week they owe me a lot of money for 12 hour shifts double lunches I worked very hard and loved my job wish they weren't shady about it and signed on duty meal period = pay me for my time working
good,Lay out rules but don't follow them. Plant manager is a maniac. They expect the employees to learn Spanish instead of making the contractors with Spanish speaking employees learn English
good,Overall there is not much I could say bad about the company but it was ran by foreigners who did not know how to treat their employees unfortunately. I we continue working for this company had there been different management and better pay or at least some benefits.
good,Good in some parts bad in other parts want you to work too much and have little family life but pay was ok just way too restrictive for the work environment good manager would make all the difference
good,Job is a good customer service job if you’re a people person with a friendly attitude. As for Management poor communication brings personal problems to work environment
good,I am very great full for the opportunity chevron had gave me. I learned a lot from how to run store and responsibly. I was underpaid and the managed to incorrectly file my tax information and I only got 20$ for my taxes my first year there.
good,The Chevron was a wonderful place to work it was. Just not a lot of communication between the managers and employees there was no security and there's not a lot of parking for employees
good,I worked at two different stores because the first one was such a problem that I would have quit otherwise. Employees were lazy and got fired frequently and the ones who stayed spent more time gossiping than doing their jobs. There were a few people who were very pleasant but there was even one instance where I was inappropriately approached because they had overheard other employees saying certain things. the second store wasn't quite as bad but still wasn't an ideal working environment
good,"There is to much at that store that they let go or don't deal with. And raises are not something that he will do"
good,"Good co workers"
good,Hours are flexible. No pay raise unless you move up to a higher position. You have to be able to multi task and work in a stressful environment. You have to be able to work alone with others as well as on your own to complete daily tasks. Have good self managing skills to get through your shift and be a quick learner.
good,"Overall it's a good company to work for and Chevron cares of its employees and contractors. Especially for their health and safety."
good,"A typical day at work involved interacting with customers, cleaning the store, stocking items, and handling money. The hardest part of the job involved a schedule that seemed to shift at the whims of management. Knowing just when to come in to work was always difficult and many times required daily calls to the store just to find out when to come in to work."
good,There are plenty of negative but also positive things to say about this company but i think that is the deal with all companies in this industry. It is about average.
good,"I was told one thing about work and pay. When I got there it was something way different. Benefits were not very good unless you lived in Houston, TX."
good,I've learned a lot at this company about tobacco and inventory. The customers and staff are really friendly. Management works with you on your schedule especially if you have a family or issues that need to be solved outside of the work place.
good,Great job busy atmosphere but horrible management. Wasn't alot of team work at this store. Day shift and night shift always pointed fingers at each other.
good,It was a good job had it’s downs but other then that I really liked my time there and coworkers. It was my first job so it wasn’t what I expected it to be.
good,"On a regular day at a 8 hr shift, I would always start of with cheeking that everything that needed to be done before it would be my time to take over was done correctly. Also enhancing my knowledge of what i should make sure is done before i would leave. Coming in to that regular day i would also notice whom id be working with, and would recognize if my coworker would be a help of me and me of them."
good,"Work on your own, other pumpers will help you in time of need. Get a truck, phone, laptop. Within a year I was at the top of my paygrade. Lots of call outs."
good,Aj Mini Mart is a terrible location to work at if you expect to be treated with respect by manager. Everyone there does the bare minimum if that and are unwilling to do more than that.
good,"when i was there it was run by family so if you werent related, you had a hard time. the night shift had to do their load and the load left over from that morning."
good,"Earth-science understaffed so long hours.  Company seems to hire and promote based on confidence over competence.  Promotions scarce.  Semi-competent personnel are retained for years. Overemphasis on diversity, political correctness, meetings, and being seen ""collaborating"".  Good retirement benefits, good medical. excellent relocation benefits but nowhere to move to anymore."
good,"-Even with a  small  gas station , one  needs to find work   in order to learn more "
good,"Despite the community and location, the hours are decent but fixed. You can choose to be paid 'undertable or legally'. Undertable is every week. Legally is every two weeks. Hours are daytime and evening only."
good,"Overall, not a bad place to work. However, there's high risk dangers of working certain shifts; such as, the evening shifts leading into the night and overnight positions."
good,"The most enjoyable part about this job was the customers! I love talking and meeting new people. I also lived in the neighborhood right next to the station, so, I got to meet all my neighbors!"
good,"This was a private owner company, they offered no benefits to the employees at that time, working shifts were fine but the pay was minimum, when i apply to this place i never got told that i was hired to temporaly replace one of the old employees, and after working couple months there they told me that there was no more work for me because i was just replacing other employee and they were planning to get that person back, this affected me alot because i was supporting my family and also my new baby soon to come."
good,"I had over 15 years experience (Store Manager, Assistant Manager, Cashier Clerk) before coming to Chevron. Therefore, with a few exceptions, I saw very little difference in the operational side. In their defense, their safety program was good. Having been a Regional Safety Manager, I knew what to look for. From my perspective, their root problem stemmed around personnel management and people showing up to work as scheduled. Oftentimes, there was a problem with the graveyard person either calling in an hour before the shift or not coming in at all. Obviously, the person on swings would have to call the manager, who would in turn request that the swing person stay until 3am. At one location, this became the norm rather than the exception. If you were the Assistant Manager, you were obligated to cover the shift. Because of this, many of the seasoned cashiers were in fact Assistant Managers, but opted to step down rather to continue in this role."
good,Other  employees are good to work for but hard to move up in management. Good place to work at busy all the time which is a plus. Manager is also good to work for
good,It was the average workplace with many ups and downs. the days were long and slow because of location and I feel they should have hired more hands for work.
good,During the day the owners where at the store and every day was nice to come into work. Working the night shift was very unsafe to work. Several robberies and life in danger enviorment
good,"I know we have to make money and be profitable but you don't have to constantly remind me that we have an obligation to the investors.  "
good,"That was my first job in the US about 30 years ago and I was not familiar with the work culture at the time. I worked hard to get to know my customers, vendors, and market."
good,"I would usually come in and just get started on ringing up customers and if needed I would restock. I didn't really gain much knowledge in which I wish I had. My manager was a great man, really laid back, but serious about his work and made sure at late hours my coworker and i were safe. My coworker was my sister, it was difficult at times but she made working there more fun. The hardest part of my job was going into the FREEZING coolers for so long having to restock all drinks. The most enjoyable part was the different people I would meet all through out the day. People interest me. We're all different and I love it."
good,"Stocking the store, making fresh coffee, cleaning as needed and taking care of customer transactions. opened new accounts."
good,"Ok company to work for with mediocre pay. excellent training ground, but would highly recommend moving on after training is finished. advancement is difficult."
good,"Pay is low, too many forms to fill out, scope of work is broad, training programs are good, 401k is good, benefits are good,"
good,"This job was great for going to school. I had a set schedule; I could do my homework while working; and I never had to work late hours; not past eleven pm. I did inventory, managed the vendor payments, and processed banking transactions."
good,Up selling and Cross selling made me aware of how to increase daily sales and achieve targets. In addition to my previous experiences this provided me admirable customer service skills.
good,"A typical day at work is busy and full of customer service and cleaning."
good,"No time for family, vacations, sick leave, vacation pay, as a contactor.  Management is laughable at best."
good,"My day will begin with cleaning and operating the cash register. It includes stocking of cooler, cleaning restroom, and maintain cleaning on the outside of the store. "
good,"Chevron is a place where people go to work for the rest of their lives. The pay and benefits are excellent, and employees are reluctant to do anything that might negatively impact their compensation or result in more work for them. Advancing social media efforts in this risk-averse environment was an uphill battle. The people are incredibly nice and genuinely want to do right, but often that gets in the way of them doing anything at all. There are dozens of meetings where decisions are never made. The few projects that do move forward often hit a wall when they run up against the byzantine approvals process."
good,"Managing cash register and maintaing the store and outside was challleging if you are one person to be in the store. At the same "
good,"Most of the people who worked their were locals and i work by the section eight apartments. Occasionally we had some good employs who were bright, hard working, and pleasant. But they always felt under appreciated and their kindness abuse. Most of the time the workers were slow checking people through the line, fast to judge even though they were filled with flaws, ignorant, irresponsible, lazy and almost always late. Well at least at 1139"
good,"People nice, and learned that we all can learn from others."
good,"Menlo Park Chevron created a fun and friendly work experience for me. As my first employer, Chevron helped me learn the many customer service skills needed in every field of employment today. I also learned how to cooperate efficiently with a small personable group of peers, all dedicated to the greater good of the community and the business. I enjoyed every moment as, I took each and every one of them as a learning experience."
good,"A typical day at work for me is day to day office administration database management, and supporting the supervisory manager and accountant. I get along with all of my co-workers. There isn't a hard part about a job. The most part enjoyable part of my job is learning new things about the oil field."
good,"Good weekend job, provides a good source for extra income. Employee's are very friendly. Explended customer service, provides the higest value of customer service in its industrie."
good,This work is highly fast pace and customer service is high demand and high energetic. This particular station did not give employees breaks even with 12 hour shifts.
good,"Pension, 9/80, and 401k match are reasons to stay."
good,"Good place to work with normal general set schedules, however difficult to arrange time off due to very minimal employees with set schedules. One bonus perk is the ability to purchase on credit against that payperiods check. Good management at the store I worked at. Referred my best friend who has now been working for "
good,"If your not in the in crew they will set you up for failure. I was told by my supervisor it us eight months to set you up, I could not believe it. Then he smiled and told me to call him if I needed anything."
good,"Mostly friendly, family run/oriented business. Weren't very flexible on time off or hours for new employees compaired to employees who had been working there for a while or were employees related to management."
good,"Ability to establish respect among every customer"
good,"I was initially excited about working for Chevron, individuals I worked with were good, but my manager was incompetent and didn't know our job, so if we had a concern with an hiring manager it made it very tedious and stressful to get task accomplished."
good,Bad experience due to lost supervisors. The one I worked at was independently owned. The owners changed every 2-3 years a d so did the pay. Flexible scheduling.
good,"It was a fun place to work. Customers friendly, vendors energetic and talkative and store stayed busy. Management were nice but fairly new to the business I feel. Reviews for raises weren't  always done in a timely manner and job security could be seen as hit or miss but was a pleasant place to work"
good,Micro management is at the forefront in this job. Great pay and benefits are available. Working at a remote location without a terminal manager on screen is not very good.
good,"worked 70 hours a week and it was not appreciated, nor enough"
good,Chevron as a whole is a good company. Its just the management with Asian Culture thinking. Trying to implement simplicity but adding work steps for people below the management. Work have to be done with waiver been given that will be against procedure... Hardest part of the job is to accomodate changes within changes...
good,"Just another customer service job, not too hard job and do not expect much in terms of pay and benefits. Management do not care about workers, just want the work."
good,The position I held at Chevron is a dying position. It takes a certain kind of person to start work at 6 in the morning while being on there feet until 2 or 3 in the afternoon.  Especially for the pay and varying weather.
good,as a first time job its pretty good but there is now progression and eventually you're gonna need to find something more secure. my store didnt offer much.
good,"I have zero great packages for benefits to stay or/and to get hired on, the employees earned just as much as I did.  I learned how to do some accounting work and ordering but nothing else.  I new I did not have any future with the company because of the pay issue and it ended up being more of a stepping stone for a better paying job."
good,Management that I had was great. very supportive and understanding. Some fellow co workers would talk down about other co workers so the environment among us wasn't always the greatest. Also sometimes we were short staffed and that can go for some stressful days.
good,A typical day would be working on one of the production lines. I learned how to pay attention to detail. The management was good. As long as you did your job no one bothered you. The workplace culture wasn't good. I was working there full time through a temp agency so the people that did work for Chevron would down on the temp workers. The hardest part of the job was trying to meet production quotes when the machines kept breaking down. The most enjoyable part of the job was the incentives we received if we met production quotes.
good,"Customer service is always a-1. However, working for them was not pleasant. No health benefits, rare raises, pay is minimum wage. Management was sweet, but the owners do mot really care about their employees."
good,"Chevron was a great place to work, I was in need of a job and they were willing to let me come join apart of their team. We worked with great costumers and always had a great shift!"
good,"I was a student then and the reason to work with them was since I needed money to support my university though I also wanted  it to lead to a direct internship rather than a third party employment. Even though their marketing head promised they would look into it, they never got around to the real deal."
good,"If you enjoy a career that keeps you on your toes and  has you ready for action, you should consider a job at Chevron. Chevron offers competitive wages, career advancement and job longevity."
good,"Chevron is a great company to work. I worked in Dhaka, Beijing, and Chengdu for Chevron.  I worked mostly in Decision Analysis and Business Planning. Great work culture, learning environment, and  was the highlight my time in Chevron."
good,No room for advancement. Tends to overlook minorities and women in particular. I wish they would look at inside candidates and give them opportunities to grow and advance. They talk about diversity but do not practice in their recruiting.
good,Loved my coworkers but the hours were hard to adjust from a graveyard to a swing and never knew if the schedule would be changed on your next shift. Missed out on having a regular life outside of work.
good,"Ok,back stabber General manager is awful ,she picks and chooses her people.never smiles or talks to anyone.and she thinks she can just make up her own policies"
good,"Great people to work with, family oriented, flexible hours, My only downfall is no benefits package and low wage. Great starter job and experience booster."
good,"Work was good but I was not able to convert from a contract position to a full time role."
good,The 9/80 schedule is great.  The pay and benefits are very good.  Be very cautious about working for the Procurement Department.  That is the worst management I've experienced in 30 years.  The Procurement Management will not stand up for the direct reports.  Procurement employees are reluctant to speak up about the Procurement management due to proven retaliation.
good,they gave me a chance and by the time the store was sold i had gone from cashier to ordering and performing  the manager duties without mangement pay. i chose not to stay on with the new employers. i enjoyed the daily interaction with the customers.
good,"Working at a refinery as a finance person is a bit depressing.  The work itself is rewarding, but the environment is not at all motivation to come to work every day."
good,"Tenure started off as a dream job and saw high level of integrity among employees and leadership alike. Observed that as price of oil plummeted, so did behaviors. Instead of 'always do the right thing', paranoia (fear of losing job) dominated decisions accordingly. In a culture that had valued collaboration in decision making, I saw a significant swing towards autocracy. Previous commitment to ""the right people, doing the right work at the right time with the right skills and for the right $"" became elusive. Recently, did not see work life balance honored in teams within my direct purview."
good,"Chevron has been affected by the downturn in oil prices.  This has affected the company culture and company focus away from the main objectives.  Management style has become dictatorial, and any opinion or question asked of a member of leadership risks long term career-limiting effects"
good,"I worked the Surface Land Department purchasing Rights of Ways, settling well site damages etc., 1 thing I did learn was the diversity in culture there, Chevron supplied many training programs in this area. The best part of the job was the people you worked with, the worse part of the job was that Chevron places too much emphasis on a 2 year degree compared to 20 years experience, some of the team leads and managers have no business in their job roles, this is every department!"
good,"Pros: Very good training opportunities, and professional growth. competitive salaries and good work-life balance."
good,it was really fun working there very laid back and easy i enjoyed it alot the only bad thing was how rude people were sometimes it was worse than any other job
good,Very driven company with growth as a goal.  Increasing shareholder value is stressed.  Very large field of operations so in-company movement is possible.
good,"Flat organization, Diverse culture, has a great work station, sometimes stressful but most of the time, have work life balance; average compensation package"
good,"Day at work is to show up, serve customers, clean & stock."
good,"As one of the largest oil production companies, Chevron offered great pay, however, as oil prices dropped, many of the perks, such as contract companies fixing compressors that had gone down at night, fell on the the employees, and call outs at night, especially in the winter, were very common, and you were expected to go out an take care of the problem, which involved dangerous roads and conditions with no lighting.  The company trucks, which we allowed to drive home at night were eventually taken away, and this made going into the yard at night, to get our truck, very inconvenient.  What I did like, however, was being outdoors during your work day, and no one directing what you needed to to, giving you a feeling of independence.  The feeling of accomplishment you get when solving problems is also a plus."
good,"Chevron has great work balance, but there is limited career opportunities if you are not an engineer.  Typical day starts at 7 AM and ends at 4:30 PM."
good,"A typical day at work could be above ground or underground. I learned many different duties at Chevron and it was an experience that will last forever."
good,"This is a really nice group of people that continually rearrange the deck chairs of the Titanic.   They continually create ""busy"" work that brings very little ""real"" value to the shareholders.  Genuine world-class regulatory compliance never really occurs."
good,Nonexistent. Management violates their own policies. HR does nothing to address reporting of violations. Inept leadership culture.
good,"A lot of small jobs to get done while running register. I learned how to deal with customer altercations and how to handle them. Management isn't bad at all. My co-workers are great, we all work together well to get the tasks done. The hardest part of the job is to get everything done every night. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking with the customers."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to take home bread garden orders that would expire the next day! I learned knowledge on BCLC lottery tickets. Good experience with co-workers and some of the management team.
good,Good company to work for and has gave me skills with the public and working with money. Management and co-works were easy and fun to work with. I ran the cash register and pumped gas for 2 years I worked there.
good,"Since my background is Management in restaurant, I was indecisive about leaving that field at the time. I knew my ability to learn quick, and my ambitious will lead me to master the business. The locations, was not in the best of areas in Atlanta. I knew with my personality, and my diversity skills I can bring customers, and vendors in to the locations. Making the monthly profit increase 20%. Easy maintained stores, great workflow, and rarely no customer complaints, or dissatisfy."
good,Enter invoices for payment.  Very very quiet place.  Very little talking in the working place.  Very concerned about safety at all times.  Very concerned about exercising during the working day. The hardest part of the job was the lack of direction and help with understanding the program used.  Very unfriendly co-workers.
good,Descent place to work with descent compensation. Recently shut down. No job opportunities here.
good,"hardest part of the job at first was staying up late nights."
good,"A typical day at work was slow. We didn't have big sales by the end of the day but our customers were challenging because they were usually under the influence due to a not so good side of town. I learned patience and to be understanding."
good,"I enjoyed being there because the amount of people I got to see. Not fast paced unless it's the afternoon. Although it's an easy job, it can be dangerous because the risk of an assault or weapons involved from thieves."
good,"GM believed $10 oil changes best way to improve business, although average invoice was lower than other shops in company that did not offer this price point."
good,I met a lot of interesting people but the job itself was very scary at times especially at night. My co workers felt the same as I but we remained alert at all times. I had to deal with many people and many attitudes but that is part of the job and I am great with people and defusing problems. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the bums that would come in and try to steal it wasn't hard but annoying.
good,"People development is not good at all. Benefits compared to other companies are ok, but could be better. Chevron would not be the number one company on my list if I ever had to reapply again."
good,"A day at work for chevron, was slow to moderate at times. They had a tendancy to have people that didnt work well but could fill slots. I had both good an bad co-workers,the hardest part about the job was covering the extra work for my co-workers that didnt want to work at all. The enjoyable part about it was talking to the regulars and the travelers."
good,"Chevron is a great employer,well at least i believe they are.My brief stay was enjoyable but i wasn't around long enough to experience the benefits of this employer.Overall great place to work specially if your going to school."
good,I really loved working at my chevron.  99% customers awesome! I was my own boss as I did graveyard worked alone from 10-5:30 am.  Down fall no break or lunch just anything in between customers.  If the store is right you will know after a couple days.
good,I love that this job was always so busy and maintained me busy. Customers are a priority and to see them leave happy with a smile was very important to me. Customer always comes first.
good,"Collaborative environment. "
good,the work is easy. the people you work with are not as easy to get along with. The management kinda just allows you to do what you want as long as the owner is not around.
good,I liked working here it was good days that i worked and i liked the people i worked with. Unfortunately it burned down in the 2017 tubs fire. I wish i could go back to working for chevron cause the place was fun to work at
good,I was very fortunate to get to work on Site with an amazing Chief Inspector. Very patient and kind boss to all his crew. Kept everyone on task in a calm  motivated fashion. One of the best places i have ever worked. Always considerate of family emergencies  or weather related worries.  I would work for this division any time they asked me too.
good,"You are working at a gas station so you can expect gas station wages. The manager was awesome I know her well, other employees were mostly cool(like anywhere else retail- always at least one snake or snitch). You get free coffee and I liked that you could go out in the lot/outside work, not always stuck behind the counter. It was pretty relaxed and I saw a few people move up pretty quick. I never intended to stay for super long was just a good, steady job until I found something with better pay."
good,"It was a good starter job for first moving into the area.  I would not say it is a career, but something to help you get established in a job setting for a first job and or to help you get on your feet."
good,"The managers didn't care about their employees. There were some very questionable things happening with some employees, and management did nothing when numerous people brought this to their attention. The hours were nice and it was pretty easy to get time off, but it wasn't worth it for me."
good,boss did not really care about imployess. did not count overtime pay into pay check and did not pay for it. no paid sick days and no paid days off. but overall ok place to work.
good,"Although there are big, long-term projects with Chevron, there is a culture of not learning from previous work which is frustrating.  There is a lot of talk about ""lessons learned"" but it is never actually realised.  There is a growing divide between staff and contract positions which never used to exist.  The colour of someone's smart badge seems to be more important than ever."
good,No thanks I had a horrible leader who insisted yelling and throwing temper tantums was his way to control people. Have no idea why he was allowed to do this.
good,"Daily activities included monitoring and controlling process variables to convert crude oil into valuable products (gasoline, diesel, LPG, Petrochemicals,etc.)"
good,A typical day doing turnaround work includes having to deal with petty differences among other employees who back stab and go out of their way to make you look bad.
good,It was a decent job while going to school. The morning hours allowed me to still work a second job in the evening and take classes online. My managers were decent but often lazy. I would commonly take on the tasks of my managers and assistant manager.
good,"can be fun but very stressfull at times if you take your job seriously "
good,I learned many things from there like how to talk and communicate with people. Management was good. They always helped me whenever i have any problem.
good,management was always trying to justify their jobs by stressing people out needlessly and thinking they are better than others. The other employees were good to work with and the job was good.
good,benefits and compensation are awesome but the downfall is the middle management and lack of on the job training which will cause you to struggle more to get up to speed. Management expects you to know everything as if a well seasoned worker even if you just started. the culture is one sided and not in your favor. One mistake and your out mentality.
good,"Was a good work  experience but the Ower wasn't."
good,i loved the management and ownership there if i didn't move I would still be working there this also a job I would recommend to my friends and family if asked
good,"Daily paperwork, deposits, and scheduling. Did not have great management team. Testing your own abilities and making yourself learn and grow within the company."
good,"I learned:"
good,"This company is super competitive and you won't be able to climb up unless you have a PhD.  The company views the rest of the people as nothing and doesn't care about their career development at all.Bachelor degree's people are cheap labor.  If you are very good at taking people's credit and BS, this is a very great place for you to work.  Upper management sucks."
good,"A fun work environment, with a hard working manager. Helping customers complete transactions, trouble shooting when needed. Laid back environment. Not enough room to move up in the company, so would not see it as a long term career option. Pay was not competitive. Comfortable uniform!"
good,Well I worked there as a fire watcher...which entailed watching the backs of watching the backs of welders while they welded and repaired the numerous pipes during the shutdown's.
good,Management only looked out for themselves. They were not concerned about the people that did the work. could not get work done because of all the meetings that were required to attend.
good,i did like it but never got elevated to management even though i applied twice. i worked hard and knew the ins and outs of the work place but still no opportunities.
good,Great place to learn and build incredibly useful skills that no one outside of Oil and Gas understands.  Transferrable skills become difficult to market.
good,Very repetitive and high pressure environment. Management doesn't know what they are doing and won't listen to the employees. They are lucky they make so much money for doing so little
good,The job was ok.  The team work was good.  The management was great until the got another manager. I really liked the job until they cut the hours.   At this job it's all about team work.
good,"The pay and benefits are outstanding. Too many layers of management with too much time on their hands, which results in senseless tasking. Once you are fully qualified there is little opportunity to advance. Lack of accountability. Can be very unprofessional at times."
good,I was a hard worker there. Just not enough pay. Loved my store and all who I worked with. Manager was easy to get along with day to day job tasks were cleaning store and bathrooms stocking cooler running shells and maintain customer service
good,Working for Chevron was a milestone for my own personal growth. Not only the customers but my coworkers were always a delight to see. However like any job or work environment there were its ups and downs. I will recommend Chevron as a place for those who enjoy the interaction with the people and wish to better there own being. Also I will recommend for those who need work and education. Chevron offers to those who qualify a chance at tuition reimbursement. If I had not chosen a new career path I would have stayed on with Chevron for they look out for their employees as well their customers.
good,"Chevron Australia has been through the biggest growth of any of the business units in Chevron, and it has had both the highs and lows."
good,I liked working there but did not get paid enough for everything that I did . No vacation or sick time . I worked night shift alone . I feel night shift should always be worked in 2s. But over all it wasn't horrible it paid bills n took care of my daughter.
good,"A good place to work however when one does a good job they hold that person back from advancing. Management has no accountability especially overseas. The rules are not create equal for all, meaning depending on if your a US expat or from the UK or a national from Angola or Nigeria rules are all different with different benefits. However, the benefits are great, pension, 401K, insurance, etc."
good,"This is a great company in many respects. However, it is not the type of company that embraces individuals or honest opinions. They embrace conformity and political correctness."
good,"I was the cashier, stocker I had stock the food drinks all the supplies and took on responsibility to be cashier as well. I'm very good at cashier and.stocker positions"
good,"It was a nice time at Chevron. The seniors were very helpful and learnt the aspects of leadership and team management from the staff and management. It was nice,"
good,I enjoyed working with the onsite manager. I think they should appreciate employees more and the good things they do. They need some incentives for employees. Overall it was alright.
good,"Chevron Canada is a very large company, however it is extremely hard to advance within. The work itself is quite simple and easy to master. However, once you know the basics, there is hardly any more learning to be done. There is no real way to earn any sort of advancement, and over all is a decent first or short-term job."
good,"My scope of responsibilities are:"
good,"Foi uma empresa muito importante na minha formação, onde iniciei como estagiário e pude ao longo do tempo desenvolver todo meu potencial através do meu trabalho e também de diversos cursos/treinamentos que a empresa me proporcionou. Fiz muitos amigos e colegas, dos quais desenvolvemos diversos projetos e trabalhos em equipe, sempre com muito êxito, embora a direção/gerência nunca desse muito valor ao bons profissionais, preferindo enaltecer sempre os participantes dos seus ciclos de amizade."
good,"The assembly process is always a team effort so it is great for building a strong foundation for team work. Hard work, long hours but a good feeling of accomplishment."
good,"Only worked for 3 weeks, overall it was a good experience and well managed. Everyone was on alert to their environment and surroundings."
good,"Worked many years at Chevron, unfortunately it went from the best place that I ever had the privilege of working to one of the worst. Weak, micromanaging and uncommunicative supervisors have taken hold and brought the company down. It's really too bad."
good,"Great company to work for on paper, but you're not going to be individually valued.  Employees are just numbers to them.  When the oil prices drop, layoffs happen very quickly and frequently.  Job security is definitely and issue with this company"
good,"Set for a minimum of two years, promised the earth by recruiter.  Gone in eighteen months."
good,The management was a great team of people / and my co-worker all work as a team. everyone help each other / a typical day was busy
good,"The company as a whole was just ok.  They promoted work-life balance but when it came down to it, management really didn't care about women with children."
good,"Typical work day was coming into work .. first thing i did was count onto my till . Then after meet with my manager if he was available and if not i met with all my team mates from the previous shift to make sure how the day went , finding out what job duties where done and which ones were not done yet . "
good,"hours went by so fast with how busy it was. i liked being busy."
good,"Good fast paced job. Always on feet running around. Although minimum wage, enjoyed most coworkers and management. Was nice having an active job that helped me keep in shape."
good,"I enjoyed my work at APS. I was given an opportunity to grow in this company and learn new skills. I enjoyed my work at APS.People who work for APS are very nice and hard working, they have to travel a lot though."
good,"Working at chevron helped me learn about the public as a whole, also it helped me learn financial responsibilities. I had to do cash drops, safe loans, and deal with money everyday. When I first started the job the co-workers were extremely helpful, I was well-trained. The hardest part about the job was when a customer wanted lottery tickets, only because if you messed them up you had to pay for them out of your paycheck. However, the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers. Greeting the customers as they walked in the door always made them smile and they seemed to always leave happy."
good,"helped customers get what they wanted cooked food to be put out made coffee and stocked suppies around the store, worked the lottery, stocked shelves did weekely ordering, and inventory, some bank deposits and got cash for the safe, helped the other employees if they needed help pumping gas or help getting the cars prepped for washing, ran credit cards signed customers up for new credit cards. management was okay great co-workers to work with we all got along very well. the hardest part of the job was when you had to do double shift I loved the environment of the customers and how you get to know them on a very friendly way."
good,Chevron was a great place for me to get my feet wet in the oil and gas field. They are a top notch corporation.
good,"It's not a bad place to work, but i really want to move on. "
good,"The manager and co workers were great. I learned a lot in the seven years I spent there. The customers were what kept me there for so long. They remembered me, which is the greatest benefit I ever received."
good,"Chevron used to have a family feel to it until a drastic change in management a few years ago. Work was performed with great pride and supervisors used to empower their employees to make decisions. Success was measured in terms of excellent craftsmanship,reliable repairs and pride of ownership. Now success is empirically measured to the point of data being generated for the sake of generating data with no true reliability successes or satisfaction of a job well done. Resources are micro managed so excessively that the best and brightest employees no longer have a passion for their job. They only comply with the wishes of management so as to not cause a disruption and get to their next raise."
good,Great pay but a poor lifestyle. Long hours and shift work that did not allow a decent lifestyle.
good,Usually when i get to work im busy for about two hours preparing food and thats the hardest part of the job. My boss is very understanding and will work with me my schedule. I do enjoy the interaction with the public and have come to know alot of the customers on first name basis.
good,"Days at work were steady sometimes slow but always moving doing something."
good,Waiting all night for customers sitting behind a window. When I had time clean and stock the floor. Management and co-workers were helpful in a way. The hard part was that I worked alone and it was boring. Most enjoyable was being able to experience the job.
good,"Check balances of cash, cigs etc."
good,"Most of the Management is wonderful and friendly. They go above and beyond to show their appreciation. They give out fun and challenging projects to keep you learning and growing in your career. They demand a lot, but it is very rewarding."
good,worked in a convience store doing cash handling co workers was great but needed more from management stand point
good,Dealing with a wide variety of customers everyday .
good,The job requires you to work with customers and venders. I have not learned alot with this job. The management team is not on the same page. The co-workers love to gossip about each other. My view of this store is that it is not a healthy enviroment and I feel that I need to move on to a carrier that is. The most enjoyable part of this job was working with the customer.
good,Its what you'd expect working at a gas station. Most of the time it is laid back and slow paced
good,"Working behind a counter providing people with service. Keeping your stock stocked, Cleaning fuel pumps when need as well as checking the main gas tanks for any water leakage and fuel consumption."
good,"The company has excellent reporting system. Has good details on displays, Point of Sale materials and upselling incentives."
good,"I really enjoyed and appreciated working with the crew I was assigned to"
good,Keep on  doing your job the best way you know how . Don't get ahead of yourself. Get along with others. Don't trust the big dogs in  California. Some people don't know how to have your back
good,"A surprisingly tolerant and accepting place to work.  My co-workers had very diverse backgrounds and there is a strong employee network culture."
good,It was a good business for me but due to the location summer would be very busy being by the lake but the winter would be the opposite. There was only one competition down 1 mile. Overall a good experience.
good,"good environment to working in and would recommend others to work there as well,please seek out if you want no regrets working there..best place to be nice people to work with."
good,i literally took this job because i had time on my hands that i didnt know what to do with. I only worked one day a week so my pay was pretty low. Even that though i still didn't feel that I was treated very well.
good,i learned how to use a change counting machine and a lottery machine  nights were kinda boring  not alot to do  cleaned alot and reorgainzed things  people were nice
good,This position is excellent for young adults entering the work force. It teaches the importance of being organized and the importance of paying attention to details.
good,Stay on schedule and learn as much as possible to move forward with the company. Request week in advance if you need a day off to before the schedule gets done
good,"Not the best job, but it is a job until you can get a better one for what you are looking for. I recommend if you can find something with better pay and something you like to do, then skip a gas station job and go for what you want, unless you get to work for a gas station that has an HR department, then apply yourself for those better opportunities."
good,Great place wish they didn’t shut down and lay everybody off it was real disappointing but overall it was a great experience working there my co workers were very nice
good,"I didn’t like it there management was very poor, I didn’t like the hours I was getting. I needed 40 hours a week to make a living just moved here from Wisconsin currently working at goodwill industry’s"
good,"A typical work day was interacting with customers very frequently and giving back correct change, management was very nice and laidback. It was pretty nice working there day to day, I learned the best ways to interact with people and work quickly and efficiently."
good,Pay was horrible for all they had you doing. I mean I was a good job just wasn’t making what I should have been for the list of things needing to be done.
good,Challenging and fun environment.  My manager at the time was nice and easy to talk to.  My work was challenging and I felt push every day.  Though my team was smaller than most.  So it was easier for us to get along and know each other.
good,"Customer service integrity, Ambitious working environment, Work can be at a slow pace during weekdays. I enjoyed my day to day and most of the customers."
good,"I enjoy the customers , I have learn how to give money when needed,  my hardest part of my job is trying to stay awake I work 9:30pm to 5:30 am the most enjoyable is my customers because they know me my name and most time I know what they want"
good,"Had a high turn out rate of employees and a lot of call in, which made for good hours but not on their own. The management on the lower level was great but upper was hard to get in contact with."
good,great place to work  very observing and require safety wear at all times. be very aware of your surrondings at all times. large place with many diffrerent contractors
good,"Working at chevron was by far the best job, the manager alone was beyond amazing, she went above and beyond for all of her employees, I can honestly say she was the best manager I have ever had."
good,"Specifically at the Chevron I worked at, the owner wasn't good to their employees and the owner didn't provide seniority or a decent pay for what we worked."
good,I had an enjoyable time as a cashier at chevron. The atmosphere was relaxed and the team was enjoyable to work with as well as the costumers. It was a great learning experience
good,"Most people are friendly. However, not all team leaders are knowledgeable. Work environment is OK. The company provides a lot of courses to help you develop new skills."
good,Managment wasnt bad the employees are nice once everyone gets to know you the customers wasnt bad as well most are regulars met some cool people while working there.
good,"Working environment in Chevron is fantastic, use state of the art technology, stress-free. Employee are very friendly & collaborative, Always maintain high safety culture  .Excellent work place , worked 14/14 shift , It was an awesome experience working for Chevron"
good,Good all around the year work place. But patients is a must to handle the long hours of busy days and extremely slow days. Keep in mind that in this job you are more than just a cashier.
good,This was a very productive place to work for as a contractor and I learned a lot from them. While with the company it showed me what it was like to work for such a big company.
good,The job was going well then I became pregnant with my daughter and the manager at the time was not treating me very well so I quit and stayed home during the time to have my daughter.
good,"Chevron was a company that gave me the opportunity to retire from,  I had plenty of days to enjoy the benefits since I was in charge of ordering and coordinating meals and other items to benefit the company progression"
good,"Nothing out of the ordinary, I worked in a deli section of a Chevron so the position was pretty simple. Hardest task was catching pizzas before the fell out of the oven or finding something to do in your spare time."
good,"maintain the station, which include attending to and assisting customers, accepting payments, stocking the shelves and maintaining station organization, preparing any hot food and maintaining the balance of the cash drawer."
good,"Good colleague but not good policy.  I was happy to work with my colleague, and worked very hard to help Chevron. But the company policy need improvement."
good,They provide good benefits for their employees; however some stores are highly lacking proper higher management authority. This results in many employees quitting.
good,the job was good got laid off because of the hurricane and they closesd the night shift stocked the store and all coolers and freezers did garbage fronted store did cig and lotto count helped customers all night long good place to work if you like to stay busy
good,"It's a great place but for the hours worked, no matter how hard, or how long it's almost impossible to get a raise no matter how long you have been there. The ""usual"" customers are very sweet and respectful, the other employers can be a joy to work with. The work is really simple if you put your self on a schedule. It's a good place to work, but also a difficult place to make a good salary."
good,its interesting place to work alot of customer service and things that could benefit you as a person if really wanted to succeded in becoming a team member
good,good company to work for. one of the few companies that still give pension. Benefits are really good especially the 401k match. insurance is expensive but good.
good,the job and company was good but it was a stepping stone to a better job.  I met a lot of interesting people and learned a lot including being the state inspector.
good,"I was a Contractor which affected my view of the company.  But I loved the culture and the team I worked with.  Compensation/benefits could have been better, but I truly enjoyed working there, I just didn't like being a contractor."
good,"Liked working there, enjoyed my Coworkers, it was close to home, meet allot of people from different countries, good work environment, lots of neat stuff"
good,"Chevron is a best company in this country, I have a lot experience during my internship with them I believe without School I won't work in the Company"
good,Overall a stressful place to work due to having to cover so much grounds. Worrying about whether or not people are going to pay for their things and if not even if they steal them the attendant has to pay for it. Which I found highly unfair.
good,"So cannot say much. But it was a challenging project and high pressure, high stakes. Worked as a team and pulled together because of the pressure. No room for excuses."
good,"I actually liked the job, during that time. But that was when I was 18yrs old. Fun job! You meet all sorts of people! But pay wasn't great and management was really bad at that station. Probably why it's out of business now."
good,It was a nice place to work. Had a good experience. Good management. Stress full and fast paced working environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is their management.
good,"Work is stressful enough without having a manager treat you disrespectfully around customers and listening to other employees about things that aren't true, where good employees get fired over nonsense!  Management should be more professional!"
good,bad staff lazy people nice stores though thats it expect alot out of you for little pay like we have to landscaping fill pot wholes buy the fresh product from safeway
good,Great company if you find the right mentor.     Stay away from Chevron Oronite.   Lubricants is a good place to work.       Working yourself to death will only get you burned out.   Focus on networking.
good,"I got to meet all kinds of people from all walks of life. i learned management skills, how to invent work schedules, and become efficient in my job duties the hardest part of my job was getting people to stay employeed at chevron. They offered no benefits and the pay was mimimum. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting alot of people."
good,"Dealing with customer "
good,"Not bad for a gas station, learned a lot of customer service skills, enjoyed my regular customers....always had to work weekends and evening shift, management was not always honest"
good,"Great place to work. Management all over the place but it was alright. I enjoy working here, people are great. I felt safe because I was in a shopping center with a lot of other stores surrounding me."
good,"Hardest part about the job: the company is trying to accelerate in the digital space, and there is upper management support, but there is not the motivation to take risk in the middle management, which limits the creativity and amount of calculated risks people are willing to take.  It will take time, just requires more patience to allow new ideas and enable the employees to be more independent.  Smart people were hired, let them make their own decisions."
good,"I liked working there it was just the rule changed alot cause of people not dong their jobs,The store was pretty clean , the cooler was always a mess and cooler was hardly ever stocked."
good,"it was not bad job"
good,"Unless you stop coming your unlikely to loose your job. Its a slitghtly stressfull possition, but all in all a great first job or inbetween career option for someone."
good,There was never down time working at Chevron. Between checking people out and making sure everything was stocked. Coworkers were a bit questionable too.
good,they respect full to people we work to getter we get stuff done the way it supose to be my manager showed me also how to work in the cashier and i also know how to change the gas prices wen it goes down or higher
good,When i work at chevron i love i like my boss and i got along with everybody i love the fact that i got the chance to meet all kind of people some was good and some was bad but over all i loved it..
good,"The type of work involves being the ""middle-man"" between the client, which is the operators of the plant and the technical designs team to ensure that the equipment on the plant runs efficiently to keep the refining process going."
good,If you don't speak Spanish the customers look at you like you are stupid. If you don't speak Spanish its hard to advanced there. They are can be helped
good,"If you're in High-school, then this is a fine job. It pays minimum wage and often times has employees who like drama. I felt badly for some of the adults who were stuck working there for 20+ years, because they couldn't really move up or get a higher wage, and there were no benefits. I'm sure the quality of the work-environment varies by location, depending on the manager and people who work there."
good,"Low pay for hard work, but its a job. Running register is not easy it takes lots of practice. So many thing can go wrong, got to be on top of every transaction. Completing multiple transactions at one time."
good,chevron is a very flexible job. if you have another job or go to school I recommend working at Chevron. They will really work with your schedule. My manager was very kind and understanding about working around my schedule.
good,it is a good company and i've learned so many things in this company and for the first time in my life that i've stay longer a year ago. and it was a good characterized by myself.
good,It was customer service cleaning I hope you’re not the customers keeping a good clean area organize work please mopping sweeping cleaning the bathrooms clean outside plans we’ve been outside taking out the trash is around the store etc.
good,My review is that Chevron is an ok place it's not like hey let's go work at a Chevron they don't give benefits they don't give good pay but min wage but it's a minimum skilled job but on the contrary every one needs gas so the workers should be getting paid more
good,The store I'm at is fairly slow which gave me a good oppurtunity to learn how to manage a gas station since I would be the only one running a shift. Store Manager doesnt seem like he knows what hes doing and doesnt really manage the store well.
good,It was okay to work there. There is good and bad. The direction it was going was bad. Started off great but through the years started to go down hill. There is a chance to fix things but that remains to be seen.
good,"I would show up and be sent to take care of various tasks that more senor employees did not want to do, such as clean the bathroom or take out the trashes."
good,"nice people, friendly staff and customers, fast paced with slow times off and on. clean working space. meeting new people everyday was always fun. free fountain drinks"
good,"It was good place to work with many different teams."
good,"A valuable experience. Many of my co-workers and customers helped make this job awesome. Sure there were many events of people walking intoxicated outside and strangers asking for help, but it helped me grow and deal with such events for the future."
good,Over all I enjoyed my experience working the graveyard shift at the chervon and most days I do miss it. I learned alot about the chevron as a company as well as about gas in general. All the safety procedures that need to be taken as well. I would definitely work there again.
good,i would not work there again and wouldnt care even if they paid me a million dollars to work there ever again the manager sucks really bad and is unproffessional
good,"Repetetive tasks that are manageable to achieve, training is paid, the coworkers are amicable, customers are usually very friendly, overall an easy going workplace."
good,"Working graveyards was pretty simple. Cleaning the store, running the register, and doing end of day paperwork.The management wasn't all that great though."
good,"If I had to I would go back to work for them, but only if I couldn't find a good job in the field I was looking for,  because it is a good fast paste work environment and I enjoy the customers on a day to day basis."
good,"It's a good company,"
good,Amazing manager! Work days vary from slow to extreme. All walks of life come thru the doors. Must be able to defuse all confrontational customers. Also provide a smile and kind word to those traveling!
good,"Good place to work, most work a 9-80 schedule and good vacation."
good,"The owner of the store is not a very nice person. I was over-worked. I went above and beyond, stayed after work to help the other cashier many of times for hours. I missed family events to train. All of this was overlooked. I quit because I was pregnant and when I asked to not fill propane tanks any more because the fumes were dangerous to my unborn child I was told that I would continue to do propane so long as I worked there. To ensure my child's safety I had to quit."
good,"Chevron is great about letting ambitious employees to attend training needed to complete job.  The lower/local management, which were older generation, didn't seem to have Chevron's further employees best interest concerning advancement of career."
good,"Overall it was fun to work there, wish they would of gave more hours but with being in college at the time they didnt. But it was a good experience overall"
good,"early mornings, late nights but all worth it because the customers are like a family. can make connections from working there. easy job consists of cashing people out, organizing counters and refilling drinks and foods"
good,"As manager, worked multiple shift/hrs. Very tiring. Chevron corporate pays well but is very strict. I worked for franchise. Pay was low, no benefits, crazy hours, lots of stress. All the overtime was nice but I had no life outside of work. Its ok to work for if you want to have someone work around your schedule. The place I worked for was very eager to teach anyone anything about the company etc. Not bad to work for. If I didn't mind working crazy hours and weekends I would stay (but benefits would be nice)"
good,Amazing guidelines and rules for maintenance and overall store upkeep. Great training meeting. Poor ethical management in store. Not much else I can tell you so I'm just gonna keep texting oh.. we good.
good,"Never a dull moment working at Chevron, Very positive Employers, I knew several happy past employees that had enjoyed working at the Chevron.  If given the opportunity would work there again"
good,Manager tends to gossip about employees personal lives with other employees and customers. Manager tends to yell and be rude to employees in front of customers.
good,"Rotated between Houston and Angola, and held several international positions while working in Angola, which included Project Controls, Cost Control, and Lean Six Sigma Coordinator."
good,Good place to work. Intelligent coworkers. No room for advancement as a contractor. Full time situation might be different. And thats all I have to say about that
good,I ran the register and replaced food items as needed. Cleaning the store and taking care of customer needs. replaced register tape in the gas pumps as needed
good,Great company to work for. Great pay and benefits. good work family time. many different organitions to particate in. work in the hot and cold of it all. if you like working by your self then this is the job for you as long as you keep safe.
good,I love the company but the public affairs team is toxic. It needs a spring cleaning and reeks of the old boys club mentality. The company is a great one to work for so that is why I stayed as long as I have.
good,"Would recommend for people who need a job asap, and have to start making money immediately. If more hours are needed you can just ask for more and most likely get more hours."
good,My first job was here handling cash closing and cleanup and organizing and making sure stock up was in the regular and ensuring customer satisfaction another good first job for someone going to school
good,"everyday is a fast pace day. its a job with a variety of different task everyday. from cashier to cleaning, stocking, trash handling, cooking. building displays,charity work. and much more"
good,"Fast pace, a lot of inspections every month, I enjoy working and serving customers. We were always ready for walk thru daily checks."
good,When I worked at Chevron I really enjoyed the environment. I don't feel like this job was challenging enough for me. I wanted to work locally because I'm kids were in school. I actually worked as a contractor while I was at chevron. I didn't work there because of the pay. I actually took a huge pay cut from my previous job. At that time in my life I needed to go to work and leave my work at work when I left. This job provided this. When I left Chevron was going through a huge downsize. My department was cut in half. I felt like eventually it would be my turn so I decided to help my husband in his job.
good,Great corporate culture that makes all employees feel like they are part of something great. Inclusion and diversity are big considerations that drive workplace cohesion.
good,"Chevron is a good employer to work for gaining professional experience in Retail market segment."
good,The best part of the job is the people.  They are very friendly and I had the opportunity to work with very best people professionally and personally.
good,Overall an enjoyable place to work most of the time. Can be stressful keeping up with workflow and customer demands. Must be a people person and good at performing under high levels of stress.
good,It was ok. I learned about safety and how to be safe at work. I liked the people i worked with. It was very demanding and the only thing i didn't like was being scheduled 12 hours shifts
good,taking care of customers needs. meeting new people. fast paced at times. i enjoyed working at chevron and seeing different faces everyday. hardest part was dealing with an upset customer. but making sure the customer was happy was important to me.
good,This company is good. They give good benefits but too much deductions low salary because it is local rate in ph not international rate. but all was good
good,Workplace was too small but its fun to work with fellow coworkers who are willing to work. Management will always support the coworkers whenever a problem comes up.
good,Chevron has lots of opportunities if your looking for a place to get work experience and learn how to deal with every kind of customer. They were good people.
good,"I was a contractor working for Law IT (that is to say the IT department inside of the Law Department as the department is just that big).  "
good,"I worked at this company for 6 months. I did a lot of customer services, handing cash, closing/opening the store. Working overtime if required. getting called into work."
good,"graveyard was not hard, just lonely. time management is key. figure out what to do and when to do it. plan ahead and make sure you complete the task at hand"
good,Chevron was a good entry level job. It provided training in customer service and time management skills. It was a gas station so you basically deal with customers all day.
good,"I enjoyed most of the time i spent at Chevron, but I did have my own problems with the store management, who had asked me to bring in something to say i was never going to have another problem with my medical issues so i could return to work after having issues at home. Hardest part would have had to been when it was extremely packed but I pushed through it. Best part was working with my co-workers who were all very helpful and friendly."
good,Paid decently well but next to no benefits. Wasn't a very big fan of standing outside for eight plus hours in 100+ degree weather. Wasn't really for me
good,"Met lots of people, clean and friendly environment. Great work hours. The supervisor was a joy to work for. Provided great customer service. Allowed me to learn different aspects of the job, such as money handling, janitorial, and inventory."
good,"Very basic standard slow structure besides your occasional rush here and there that wasn't to much once you learned your cash register, but it was nice meeting people"
good,"Not bad, learned leadership skills, made some friends and overall enjoyed the job. Easy job, easy learning curve, many opportunities to advance in pay and jobs."
good,"Difficult schedule, with rotating 12hr shifts. Good pay and benefits, matching 401(k). Dangerous work environment. Opportunity for growth. Large corporation."
good,"chevron is a nice place to start your career. a lot of training on processes both internal and industry. emphasis on lean sigma, IT, business development and project management"
good,I enjoyed working with the public. I learned how to run a few different types of machines and/or computer programs. I enjoyed it because it was always busy with never a dull moment.
good,"Im not a big fan of the corporation, I believe it is turning people into robots. Zero emotion or empathy, making human beings no longer human beings. Corporations care more about the dollar than the heart."
good,I would go in count my register do my inventory for my shift make sure every thing clean and stock and put customers first/i like seeing different people
good,La empresa es estable pero tienes poca posibilidad de crecer.
good,Boa remuneração e preocupação com a segurança. Bons benefícios para os funcionários.
good,Meeting new ppl. On Vaca was alway great seeing the different cultures. And working on the beach. I really didn't care for the job bur I kept my mouth shut and done wat I had to do to provide for my family
good,A reputable multinational company that believes so much in human development. Safety of staffs is the outmost priority. They believe that safety is everyone responsibility and  an injury free environment is attainable.
good,Company under hard economic times and does not have any growth potential due to this.  Layoffs every year has made the environment very stressful.  The company used to care about worklife balance.
good,"Working With Chevron Bangladesh is a continuous learning process wherein safety at work is given great emphasis, you are  given a challenging role on how to keep all workers safe but then accomplish every job task on time."
good,I was recruited to work in London for a year then move with the project to Kazakhstan. After 8 months I was told that the project manager only wanted to use Kazak staff which meant that I was employed under false pretensions. If I had been told that the position was only a short hire I would not left my previous employment. I feel that the management should have decided their position before recruiting the team.
good,The Job was Great I was in my Learning Stage and some of the Older workers help me out a great deal the older guys did a good job in getting me right for the future in the Oil and Gas Industry
good,I fully intended to retire from Chevron Oil & Gas Corp. Due to a down turn in the industry their was a major reduction in staff. Other than that in it was a nice place to work.
good,"cashier."
good,"A typical day depends on the shift that I will be working. In other words, if I start my day at 10:00 am I clean the pumps outside, then I stock the cooler. Last, I'll get on the register and help some customers. In between customers I stock the coffee cups, soda cups, etc. I also sweep and mop as needed. Towards the end of my shift I'll cover for the next person who goes to a half a hour lunch.  While that person is gone, I start taking out of the trash and putting in new trash bags. Once the other employee returns from lunch, I clean the restrooms and close my register."
good,The company is a good place to work however some of its support of employees and management could be improved. One good part of the company is it does give an employee the ability to learn on their own through computer base training.
good,On a normal day I would work alone checking out customers. During my free time I would stock shelves and cooler and merchandise novelty items. It was also my responsibility to clean both the interior and exterior of the store. Management was moderate with high expectation with respectful and friendly co-workers. The hardest part of the job was keeping a steady flow at the register while keeping an eye on other customers throughout the store. Nevertheless it was nice to be able to set my own pace and control my work environment.
good,"owner was good to work for, only the pay wasnt that great, and some customers gave you a really hard time other than that a very easy job"
good,Very basic job duties and expectations. Small staff allows for working extra shifts available. Properly doing your job should keep managers leaving you alone for the most part.
good,"Being away from home was no fun, pay was good, most people were fun to work with, benefits were good too. Sometimes the hours were long."
good,pay not good only was a part time job until i moved to calgary was a well ran place to work just isn't a great career choice for anyone
good,I was happy to be able to work on my own and glad to get the experience although pay is very low as far as paying employees! I worked their under a private owner more like a family business
good,worked grave yard shift. did customer service as well at stocking and maintaining the outside of facility clean. Only 2 people worked grave yard shift.
good,"Everyday was the same just about. We had a checklist to go off of for daily assignments. Management was always on top of everything. Not only did they do their job but also covered for other employees who were unable to make it in. Co-workers for the most part were awesome, a couple took advantage of management and other co-workers. I learned how to be more patient."
good,Job was ok for a short term. It would have been better if some employees would have treated me a little better. I loved the work however some of the employees were not that concerned when I left.
good,Great work life balance with 9/80 works weeks. Hard to advance your career if you want to move up in the company (someone has to retire). Management is not transparent with their decisions and often will not communicate until the last second. Co-workers are all amazing people to work.
good,"early hours to make breakfast burritos, lots of regulars get breakfast there in the morning. poor management, high turnovers."
good,Assisting customers with purchasing items such as snacks and drinks. Assisting customers with lottery tickets. Also help customers with purchasing gasoline.
good,"Working here is a consistent challenge and you will get to do more interesting things in a week than you would in a year anywhere else.  However, first line management tends to be underqualified and they make decisions based on how THEY will benefit rather than how the organization will.  This creates an insulating barrier and keeps executive management out of touch with day-to-day challenges.  Add in the fact that the misuse of the Loss Prevention System has caused every single mistake to be placed under a microscope and root causes to be blamed on the individuals who can't slip out from under the charges.  Therefore, many management types getting promoted are those most effective at dodging blame rather than those who are most qualified."
good,we would clean stock cashier. i didnt work at this job long. i have a death in the family. i only worked here a few weeks. but no problems there every thing and every one was great
good,"I liked the fast pace and staying busy. That if you make the effort you can make your station number one on the west coast. A good manager builds a good team that work well with each other. Be there for each other, if someone is running late, stay until they get there. People driving off with are nozzles, handling the insurance forms. Working independently, and treating each customer fair and uniquely according to their needs."
good,"Enjoyed my job, nice and friendly people to work for.  Job was easy to do. Clean work environment.  I would enjoy working with them again."
good,"While each day is pretty much the same as the previous day, I enjoy the fast paced environment. Depending on the time of year and the weather, it can be a nice place to work. There is always something to do. I enjoy working with my co-workers, and have developed friendships with many of them."
good,"A typical day starts off with catching up with handling the sales register."
good,design build organization dedicated to improving energy efficiency for customers.
good,"I really liked working for this company. I got along with alot of the customers, and working outside never bothered me. The winters were cold, but bearable. The summers were hot, but also, bearable. I would work at another gas station if presented with the opportunity."
good,"Happly serving customers , love seeing the ""regulars"" serving others before /during/ after work can really make an diffrence in someones day."
good,"Making sure customers receive fast efficient service"
good,Management initiate activities that will encourage diversity within the team.
good,"I was scheduled to work swing shift, it was quiet most of the nights. Every once in a while you had to deal with unpleasant people but for the most part it was just people traveling that stopped for gas. There were few things that needed to be done at night when it was slower and the person working had the time. The hardest part of the job was trying to stay awake for the shift."
good,was a great place to get experience in cashier and customer service.
good,"Good Company, good compensation.  Offers 9/80 work schedule."
good,"Private organization"
good,I worked on my own 100% of the time which I enjoyed when it wasn't over night.
good,I would see this company being more successful if they retained a better financial management.
good,"Good hours lots of overtime, Great work schedule.  Good people to work with. very professional."
good,"count cash, open, make coffee, check customers, writh money orders stock shelvs"
good,"learnt lots, given challenges was great place to work provide work to life balance, training opps, etc."
good,Perry Brothers is a great company to work for only cons are no benefits were offered at the time of my employment
good,I was only at Chevron for a couple weeks for a school placement work experience to help me find a job and to see what its like in the real world.
good,"relieving night shift hoping monies are counted properly, cannot please everyone but try to make everything go as smootha as possible, lunch was the busiest time of day and shift change during that time was not an easy task, morning were my favorite part of the day enjoyed the moring task and talking to my moring coffee drinkers!"
good,good place to start for work if no experience in any other related fields
good,lots of opportunity to learn and folks that are willing to help you do just that.
good,"Meet may different people. Stock shelves, clean, processed all transactions."
good,Job was a challenge and rewarding. Worked with engineers and operators. Learned how to be productive in a growing company. Got along with co-workers. Sometimes got called out in any type of weather and accomplished goals.
good,It's a gas station and  a market. It's a good job and part time work and little pay.
good,"Chevron in Concord, Ca is a very large place to work with over 3,000 employees at the location."
good,Very nice establishment. Adjoining pizza parlor. Great job experience.
good,"My typical day at work consists of managing the register while making sure inventory is stocked at all times and maintaining the store clean. I had to adjust to different types of cultures within my co-workers. I learned to keep smiling and maintain a happy mood to some rude customers. The hardest part would be working full time, while being a full time student. The most enjoyable would be the freedom that I get to work at my own pace."
good,hours were great and worked a morning shift so i had the rest of the day off and management was not very good.
good,"Typical work day starts at 8:30AM. I worked on various aspect of financial analysis including budgeting, running queries, and analyzing and interpreting data, and presenting reports to senior management, quarterly forecasting and financial reporting,"
good,giving top quality service to customers. providing the best and cheapest gas in town
good,Good company with a lot a large number of turnover.
good,The owner needs to know how to run a business it takes a long time to get a raise management is great
good,some customers are super rude but you eventually grow used to it and can handle it.
good,"I work for Kisa Ent. (Chevron) for 4 years and in which time I was a full time, full service and store attendant and moved into a management role for the last two years at the job. In my time there I prepared work schedules for up to 25 people, monitored sales levels, re-oreder product when needed, and worked closely with upper management to insure a well run and positive workplace. I enjoyed this job very much. Having the chance to work with people that were motivated and hard workers made my position a very enjoyable one. The only reason I left this job was due to a lack of benefits and low pay."
good,"Work at the cash register, ringing people up as they make purchases of items or gas."
good,I was a cashier for almost a year there we cleaned the restrooms we got a free sandwich for lunch and free drinks
good,"Fui personal eventual, cubri una suplencia. Mucho viatico, y horario complicado por la distancia."
good,"I made all the salads for deli sanddwichs, sliced meats,ordered products, put away shipments, made breadfast for regulars, cleaned and sanitizedthe"
good,The job is okay .It doesnt pay well.You work hard.Its good for a part-time job.

good,I contracted out with T.W.I to chevron for a oilfield operator.
good,It has been several years since I worked there. However I enjoyed the time I was there.
good,"had to work 6 day as a manger did not have time for my family, learned to dill with difficult customers. was a good job but new management took away bones did not give a raise, was over work and mandatory to work on holidays."
good,It's a great starter job for anyone that wants to be in retail. It gives you a great experience in customer service and realize services. It's both medium passed and educational.
good,This is a job who likes people and doesn’t want to do all that much but remember jobs like this will burn you out. Anything else is typically easy such as cleaning and stuff like that then I guess it balances itself out. Sometimes though it does get boring and barely anything to do.
good,Challenging workplace but in terms of salary cannot occupy the needs of employee. But I am a contractual employee but for those who are regular employee higher salary they have a good income.
good,It's like any other company in the Bay Area. What's to add? It's a corporate environment that a lot of people want to work for simply because it's Chevron. Aside from that . . .
good,"The company says it values diversity. Having worked in different operating companies, some have good management but some don't. In general, the people I have worked with are collaborative as I value diversity and teamwork."
good,Not enough pay with the cost of living at a place like this. The station I worked at had great employees. Made friends and family. The pay sucked. Hours were okay.
good,"Opportunities available across a wide spectrum of job types and locations, even within a specific function (like Finance). Stable employment, except in an oil downturn."
good,"I enjoyed my time I worked at Chevron."
good,"Kindly refer to my C.V. Good company to work for. Open door policy with my manager, very diverse culture, respect all cultures within Chevron. All departments work towards one goal."
good,Chevron was a great place to work. I was there for just under a year and loved it. The management was very friendly and was willing to work with me. I also got a pay raise every 6 months.
good,Encouragement and support from other employees enabled be to complete my tasks in time. Detailed reports where written weekly and submitted to the supervisors. I learnt a lot about the roles of the different engineers at the company and how to write technical reports and other documents.
good,"A typical day at work is just watching over the store and handling all customers that come in and out of the store. "
good,"As a Project Manager at Chevron I was assigned several projects at one time. The projects included Solar projects, HVAC, piping and plumbing installations. Responsible to the Client, Chevron for completing projects on time and below budget."
good,"A good company to work for if you have good connections. It used to be good to employees, not anymore when the market went down. Networking is much more important in this company."
good,"I'm a contractor. So, it was easy getting in that way, but to get an actual Chevron job has been very tough. Typical day, I log in, check emails, and then go to my work program. I work out of spreadsheets a lot. Management is ok, it could be a lot better. Culture is like anywhere. I love people, so I tend to have an easier time, but, there's always people you love, and people that are just ok. The hardest part is staying motivated. I love to work and need lots of work. Most of what I do is very repetitive, so it can get boring. Having lunch with the crew and walks."
good,"I liked the job. Mostly made pizzas and chicken wings. Very sanitary, and good people! Clean up after yourself and don't be messy! And the customer is always right!"
good,"This is typical fortune 500 company. It can be filled with challenges' and changes."
good,Its an easy but fast paced job help customers get in and out to order filling and making sure is all stocked and cleaned. As assistant manger I learned more about order filling and entering invoices into the computer to handling customers and employees.
good,"Pays well, very secure.  There are definitely areas for improvement here as I am sure there are at every large company. Overall, I am grateful for my time with Chevron and would continue to work for them or one of their subsidiaries but my wife and I want to move out of California."
good,"Highly customer service and safety oriented. Stocking and making food/coffee are the highest priorities. Must be able to work as a team. "

good,I was an Assistant Manager for Chevron for 2 years and in that time I was left mostly in charge of the station I advanced in but was transferred to another station where the existing manager was terminated the same day of my relocation. I ran my station for almost 2 months when another Asst. Manager was made the new station manager. Later having employees bring family members in to intimidate me from doing my job. Manager and district manager new of situation but denied whole incident!
good,It was a good job and I enjoyed the people I worked with... I got to know a lot of people. I learned a lot within my job. My co workers were great people to work with also.
good,Need better management to support the workers.
good,Very compressive place to work.  They prefer chemical engineers over mechanical.  When the economy turns they cut grass in no time.  Stay on your toes and learn what you can.
good,"You can work hard and be very competitive or focus your time on building relationships and friendships with management.  In the end, it's who you know, not what you know that allows you to succeed at Chevron.  You will be paid well even if you don't try very hard, but if you work really hard, you won't feel that you are adequately compensated."
good,"Professional Profile:"
good,A regular day is always being busy and your multitasking constantly. I met people from other countries and learned some of their ways that was interesting.
good,I personally did not have a good experience. the management was very racist and judgemental. but as for the job itself it was a pretty easy job hardest thing to learn was lottery.
good,A day at chevron was a good day cause I got to meet a lot of new people everyday. It was nice to put a smile on othere people's face by just saying hi how are u doing today with a smile on my face . You would not believe how far a smile can go .

good,"The management is agreeable and understanding when it comes to issues in the weekly schedule. Very flexible hours for the most part, however the pay is very low."
good,"Used to be a great place to work. Some departments probably still are, but with the recent, unprecedented drop in oil prices that no one managed to predict, the company has scaled EVERYTHING back, and almost everyone has the Sword of Damocles hanging over them."
good,"This was a privately owned location and was tons of fun, very clean with friendly happy people operating the store. The pay was reasonable, raises were available and you are recognized for hard work."
good,I was very much interested in Quality management . Teaching the concepts to our holding companies was challenging but fun. Each operating company offered its own unique challenges .
good,"Had a blast working there, usually it was smooth sailing since people we're very good at communication and collaborating expressing what they need from the job."
good,"Big company with all processes developed, all you have to do is to maintain and update them.  Slow schedule and lots of polities."
good,Highly demanding career with constant worry about losing your job due to low price of oil. Huge expectations to do more than two person's job. Great pay and benefits though. The culture is that you sell your soul to the company.
good,Overall easy to work with coworkers and fair management. Manager worked around my school schedule and made sure everyone received fair hours.
good,The location that I worked at was pretty awesome it was a corporate location and it had probably the best pay for any gas station I have ever seen.  I was a lead within a year on my was to assistant manager.
good,"I am enjoying dealing with customers. I love to deal with people from different countries. I learn how to operate point of sale machine and stock up of products. I can manage customers at two till machines to prevent line up of customers. When customer wish me back with a big smile, give pleasure state. My co-workers are friendly. I enjoy the company of them. No specific break time for breakfast or lunch."
good,"I have learn how to manage, work as a team, follow verbal and written instructions, and great customer service. The best part is working alone side a friend."
good,days were ok kind of long at times  had great co workers that made it fun.  sometimes left there by yourself and you had to watch the store and ring customer up
good,I did not like this job. There was no chance for improvement and my employer was the type to hire pretty girls because he liked to look at them. this resulted in employees who felt privileged and didn't have to do certain things because they were females.
good,"Great work/life balance at Chevron. Typical schedule is every other Friday off."
good,This environment provides good hands on experience. The staff is very helpful and understanding. More interested in growth with the company. Open to new ideas.
good,"When I started in New Mexico it was a very fun environment to work in. The guys I was assigned to for training made learning the job very fun and interesting. It was because of this training that I was able to take over my own lease within only 4 months, with no pryor experience. The management at this office was incredible, very supportive and positive. They were very good teachers as well, but not afraid to let you know if you had done something wrong in a very stern yet constructive manner. When I went to Oklahoma it was much of the same. Great coworkers, great management. We became like family very quickly. "

Enter in fuel price changes, fuel deliveries, end of day fuel tank readings. At the end of my shift I make sure product is put away ( cigarettes and cash ) the store is clean and ready for the morning shift set the alarm and close the store. Most of my co workers are great people, absolutely fun to work with."
good,I really enjoyed my experience but the overall corporation was too split up. I was designated a task and was not allowed to overlap. But I am really glad I had the opportunity to intern here.
good,This job I learned good customer service skills. Management and my co-workers where great. It was a great job and I learded how to deal with the public and day to day tasks.
good,"Relaxed workplace and easy job, wont support a household though."
good,Be attentive about customer enquires.

good,Chevron is a worldwide company with great opportunities for advancement. A very devirse workforce.
good,"As a woman in the drafting department, it is my observation that work assignments are not given equally to men and women. Men are given more of the ""real"" work assignments, while women are given more ""secretarial"" work assignments."
good,Chevron preaches they are a global Co. and continuously outsources jobs.
good,"I thought this was an ideal place because I love cars, lubricants, oil, and chemistry.  But if you don't have the right degree (engineering), you get treated like a complete moron and can never advance.  You may report to an engine oil formulator who doesn't know what a piston ring or a camshaft is (true story), or to a mechanical engineer who can't change a tire.  But they have the right piece of paper and you don't.  I had 3 bosses over 7 years, 2 were terrible, and one was very good but still couldn't advance me."
good,It was fine when I was younger but now I see the errors they had in management. The manager wasn’t really there and things around the store were not completed before people leaving
good,Was very pleasant when I started wth this company. Had a management that was really concerned abt there employees. Bt over time that changed an it became more stressful an target driven.
good,"As an attendant you work all 8 pumps, handling cash and keeping track of customers. Job is entry level and a great position for college students (as I was) or people wanting part time work."
good,It's a big company. There are many cultures. The culture of my group was not necessarily for me. There was a lot of gossip and complaining among the core group.
good,Its a decent job to have. I liked working here just not enough hours to make at least a decent living from. The benefits are nice if you get hired to be fulltime.
good,"Well, a typical day at Chevron was fun with no stressed, Owner was  a great guy, the hardest part at work was to dealing with very rude customers. the most enjoyable day at work was taking care of the customers and makes them happy.."
good,Because of the chevron management life at chevron was easy.  The only problem I have is they really don't like to make there employees full time so that good employees can reap the benefits of vacation and insurance.
good,"Long hours,micromanaging environment and  unstable job security at the time made for an unpleasant experience for me. If you're willing to commit to this company it will pay well for many years but keep in mind that the oilfield has it's highs and lows and if the price of oil falls they will be quick to start laying people off."
good,"Typical day at Chevron included customer service, cleaning of company equipment and maintaining company equipment, Handling money in an accurate manner."
good,"Professional "
good,"Chevron was a good place to work, they worked with my schedule and were understanding about normal mishaps that would occionally occur, such as being late or not having any money to buy food."
good,"Good place to work , friendly nature of employes and my manager . My manager is known to me . Shes sweet amd nice to work with . Care for employes and healthy environment to work in."
good,"Tough location for work as conditions are poor. Weather is very bad, hot and big rain. Good senior management. Food is limited to mainly local food in remote areas."
good,"I've been an employee of Chevron from 2012-2015. During these times, oil prices have decreased from over $100 per barrel to the current price of about $50/barrel. You can really feel that the management actively looking for ways to reduce the costs and thus resulting to reduced employee benefits, no or minimal annual raises, and even layoffs."
good,"when the oil price was up, work fast paced, fun and interesting.  when oil goes down, the job is stressful, cut throat and moral is low.  there was a lot of empowerment, but at the same time there was a lot of ""naming and shaming"".  your career totally depended on what you were willing to do to climb the ladder.  this can be a good place for those that are good at tooting their own horn and thrive on a competitive environment, but even then it can be subjective to the whims of your supervisor."
good,"The oil and gas industry is quite cyclical, so when things are going well, it can be a very fruitful time,  and hiring occurs in droves. When things are not going so well, there are layoffs and job cuts which can be quite disconcerting. "
good,"They transferred our department to the Philippines - along with the Customer Service department"
good,"Chevron touts ""We are all one big team""...except when it comes to their PMP Ratings and their raises & promotions...then it's all about YOURSELF.  This causes employees NOT to SHARE.  If your the new kid...no one will show you the way.  And you are more likely to get bumped from your position."
good,"On a daily basis I had Drilling, Completions, and Workover reports. I also handle daily and monthly production. I handle incoming and outgoing AFE from our 25 plus partners in the Delaware Basin. I manage an outlook mailbox that contains 400 plus emails a day. I also worked on a Permian Analytic project for 2 years that contained parsing daily drilling and post. Once parsed, they were connected to spotfire for NOJV to Company performance evaluation. I update this every Monday for new data. I also manage LWD, mudlog, and directional surveys for hundreds of wells yearly. I have worked with an internal AFE database, Scada, Chervon Reserve system of record, and Petra databases. Chevron recently went through layoffs and left the employees working longer hours and more stress. I love a challenge, but management does not have a long term solution to our endless work days. I want to work for a company that values their employees. I want to continue building my skills and contributing to a company as the same."
good,"the money was nice, and the store was constantly busy. It was almost hard to keep up with everything without any help. I managed to monitor the store outside as well as in for any messes. Logged and cleaned any gas pump spills. Helped people figure out how their pumps work, kept all products stocked. I also promoted the gift cards as required, answered phone calls and handled any complaints. I also kept the register at a fixed amount. This job would have been ideal, however my manager didn't fully train me or explain things fully. When asked certain questions she floundered and in the end I had to learn from her boss just to do my job. I also had problems with unstable customers harassing me. My manager just brushed it off. I had no choice in the end but to quit."
good,"It was great working there. Great pay and you see celebrities every now and then. It stays fast pace during the summer and spring. But during the winter and fall, it's slow."
good,Productive and very busy place. The company culture is not easy to adhere to. I like the fact that safety is what they put 1st.
good,I enjoyed my tenor at Chevron. There were many challenges and it provided a good opportunity to use my experience and skills to resolve issues. There were many learning opportunities which helped me to hone my skills and knowledge in the oil and gas industry.

good,Working with staff of SHI-MCI is fun and also trying to understand the culture of the Koreans and their language. I learning to understand different cultures and working with the Koreans is very tasking.
good,"Ótima para o crescimento profissional, investe muito na área de segurança."
good,"I was assigned to check fluids on vehicles, change oil, customer service, timely manner of assignments."
good,"When I enter my work area, I take turnover from my colleague about what took place during the previous shift and what needs to be done on my shift."
good,"Chevron was a easy job for me my title was Utility, first I had to clean all the bathrooms take out all trash inside and outside wash all bucket refill water, clean pumps,stock fridge,finally work cashier"
good,I learned how to order merchandise and performing my out-most customer service. The job is really demanding and required extra careful.
good,"Operation of tank truck loadings."
good," The fun part about  Chevron gas was that, I got to meet  to a diversity of a people. Interacting with people dealing with sales and advertising. My co-worker was  not from United States and got  to share some culture with them as well. "
good,"It was my first job right out of high school. I enjoyed that it was full time and they worked with me around my school schedule which I totally appreciated. I enjoyed my co-workers and familiar customers. I did the basics of handling the cash register, cleaning the bathrooms, stocking food, snacks,etc. Management was nice."
good,"I enjoyed working here for several years, not due to work load or type, but because of the friendliness of the employees, management, and owners. They truly go out of their way to make you feel wanted and needed."
good,"Maintain monthly complaints records of customers"
good,"It was pleasure to working for Chevron during my 23 years onshore7Offshore and I learnt a lot from my co-workers and everybody in my work place, Chevron is a very strong in Safety Principles and provide an excellent PPE to protect the workers and also they protect the Environment by utilizing the best practices and methods avoid spill and others operations that can damage the environment."
good,"I think overall, it was just the wrong fit for me with the workplace culture and the management. They have some very good managers, and some that tend to manage with their feelings instead of with a level head. Most a workday is balanced between meetings, organization, and project over-watch and execution. The most enjoyable thing was the teaching moments provided whether that be about research or behind the scenes of the business. Some groups in the company are wonderful to work in, some groups are  not."
good,i am the ambitious young male with a passion of learning and hunger to achieve greatness in all sectors.I have always enjoyed learning how things work
good,"Repetitive work, wonderful customers, great incentives, great potential for advancement, and Free Beverages!! Family environment, strict working conditions. Big on safety!!"
good,"This job was close to home and helped me stay close to my young children after death of my husband.  The hours were flexible.  Being close to home, the cost of commute in time and expense was low.  I enjoy the customers that come in the store."
good,"Good place to initialise yourself in a new country by meeting hundreds of customers in a day. You can learn so many things here such as customer appreciation, customer greeting, cash register handling, preparing shift reports etc."
good,"Great pay, helpful co-workers  but too much overtime and an extremely stressful environment.  I am very well compensated for the dangers of the job and outside work but I would prefer an inside job opportunity with less overtime"
good,"Solving problems for foreign customers,cleaning & sanitizing bathrooms and the market. And learning some basic steps of what a manager does. So in conclusion this is a good starting job but...it doesn't pay all the bills."
good,"You have to be flexible and work all shifts (except graveyard, unless hired on for it).  "
good,"Working for Chevron was good."
good,"The job is not difficult. However, customer relations is a big part of it, and if that is neglected, it leads to an unsatisfying and dry working environment. It trains one to interact with people from different walks of life and occasionally learn a great deal from them. Although is not highly paid (some might say, very badly indeed), if one does it for a limited period of time, it is bound to make one more appreciative of the nuances of the daily"
good,"With the new management within the business unit, it has become more micro-managed at all levels."
good,"Tool box meeting and arrange of worker for the day of job ."
good,"To be completely honest, the company has always been really good to me and I can't personally complain; I believe that, in general, it's a good company to work for. Nevertheless, one of the main issues for me was that management's agenda was not what I considered best for the company, I felt we worked more for personal agendas than for the benefit of the company, and that was frustrating for me. "
good,"Personally I would have retired from Chevron had they not sold out to Sun.Oil four years before I was eligible for my retirement they ran out with all of a"
good,"Great company to work for. Need more room for advancement and job security. The work environment is great. Everyone is motivated to work, including myself. I'm a self-motivated individual willing to take on new challenges and running with it. I've learned a lot working as field engineer at Chevron refinery and this experience has broadened my knowledge of piping systems."
good,"The company has a wonderful culture which is people focused. They have a very steadfast safety culture which is sometimes exhausting but effective."
good,"Chevron is truly an American Blue Chip company that treats its employees very well and, generally, has excellent work-life balance.  However, the company is obsessed with processes, bureaucracy and personal silos, and is generally slow-moving and inefficient."
good,"Work experience is great, benefits are great and job opportunities are great unfortunately Chevron does not have the best performance review system."
good,"Good variety of work, good benefits. Challenges include language barrier, remote location, under-qualified employees, and poor living accommodations on base."
good,"a typical day/night at chevron went like this. Day was mid-shift 10-3 later sometimes earlier. walk in count the drawer, made sure my shift was cleaned, stocked, and organized. i would sign in and help the guest in line. when the rush was calm, i would clean and stock the guest area, continue with the daily tasks that were to be done before shift was over and assist the guests if needed. i learned from the experience of working for chevron that it would take someone leaving, being terminated, or transfered to be promoted. the manager i worked under was very understanding with how life can throw curve balls and dealt with each of her employees as people not replacements. co-workers? thats very tricky, different personalites, belives, and expecting one other as is was challenging, yet a learning expericence. the hardest part of the job was pleasing certain guests that could not be pleased no matter the situation. although, those one in a million unpleasable guests the other guests were human and understandable."
good,"Typical work day consisted of daily meetings and looking at troubled areas before going out to the field using top of the line software that were invaluable tools. My strongest trait I have to offer is my understanding of rod pump wells and the love I have for the challenges they bring. I had in the time being there a 9% decline in production from the time started to the time I resigned. It was challenging to up keep with 178 wells in the field that was rapidly declining since the end of its drilling program. Facilities with moderate and up to date software, such as scada, lowis etc. were a helpful experience. I liked the fact that I knew the field so well that there was no challenge to big nor a day to boring in fact it was the only refuge I had on a daily basis to put my mind to something productive. My co-workers were fun to work with. Hardest part of my job was to put up with seeing management misused judgment on popularity or friendship based. Although the most enjoyable part was working out in the field with fellow co-workers putting no mind to internal politics with personal agendas."
good,"Its a Global company. Very hectic as you deal with people from other parts of the words to fulfill your tasks. Communication made things a bit difficult at especially with people in the Middle East."
good,"A typical day at Chevron/Extra Mile was always busy because there was a lot of responsibilities held for me, and also dealing with the customers; for example, checking in vendors, doing inventory, and handling large amounts of money. "
good,"Daily, I ring up customer purchases, collect payment and make change.  Restock shelves and coolers as necessary.  Receive deliverables when scheduled."
good,"Very fast paced environment for some with a good mix of slackers. HR here thinks their benefits are worth far greater value than they are so the salaries are below industry average. You'll get tricked in your offer letter unless you get any discussions in writing and you'll end up with less value in the offer once you start. As an experienced professional, this was the worst mistake I have made with respect to employment. My advice, have a lawyer review your offer letter before you except it. Work/life balance is promoted, however, you'll put in most weekends for free."
good,"Easy job to do; however, alot of things to do not only register but clean and restock products. Not enough money for hourly wage. They help with children hospital so you need to ask every customer if they like to donate $1.00."
good,"A great and slow paced place to work, my direct managers were great to work with, however the ones above them were not very helpful or welcoming. I recommend it as a college job or a job of convenience if you live close enough."
good,Great place to work while in school or a parent. Room for advancement if working hard to move up. it is very demanding at times and could be a bit unsafe in the evening
good,"I worked a contract gig with Chevron while they were still in San Francisco, had to leave when the office was moved to San Ramon.   I would say overall the culture is great, with a lot of fun perks - at times there were some co-workers whose jobs seemed very ill-defined and unnecessary, but that's part of working at a global company like this."
good,"Not much career advancement in research and development especially if you do not have a PhD. "
good,"Chevron is a okay place to work at as long as your not in management but you get over worked and under paid"
good,Enjoyed the job and worked with a lot of great people.  The dangers of working in the refinery were to much for me to take on top of the long hours.  The job is very dependent on your coworkers as you will see them more than your family
good,"June  ’14     Feb ’17 		Chevron"
good,"Good company to take it easy, very slow pace, lots of processes to comply with. Good benefits, management is  not super, just ok. Could use some refresh in their policies."
good,"I bring my upbeat and energetic attitude to get things done the right way and with the desired results.   "
good,The owner is fantastic and very nice to deal with. Will definitely work with you as long as you provide work that does not create conflict. Very accommodating to your schedule but is still set by them not yourself.
good,"The work was challenging, but rewarding.  My supervisor was not as into the intern program as other employees were.  The culture in the IT area is very independent which leads to a very quiet and dull culture there.  The work life balance is great and they encourage you to work hard and then leave the work at the office.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I was able to interact with."
good,"Handle the cashier and meet and greet the customer. Give the most expentinal customer service. I also stocked and did inventory check. And custodial such as bathroom, sweeping, mopping, ans dusting.I got alolng really well with my Co-workers and enjoyed it there."
good,"3 out of 5. The company management is all about protecting one's position and not about encouraging people to do well. Chevron doesn't encourage great people to stay as they encourage mediocrity that allows the mediocre management to stay,"
good,"A typical day was getting to work and clocking in, I enjoyed the job very much and had a great day everyday. I enjoyed the fast pace environment and love working on cars. My co workers were great and never had any problems with them. The hardest part of the job was when it was busy in the mornings but I do not have any complaints about this job."
good,"Great pay, good people and co workers"
good,"great experience , learned many things, flexible hours,Detail-oriented, Cash flow analysis ,Time management"
good,As management its an around the clock job. when i start my shift i make sure me and the other person have the station looking good because we get random shops.
good,"Well-established people-oriented culture - not only are the results important but HOW you achieved them in terms of teamwork and treading carefully around people. In many instances, however, the seeming ""We are the company proud of its people and commitment to inclusive work environment"" are just words - you can get thrown under the bus without a second thought. Favoritism and informal tightly-knit groups forms a strong sub-layer beneath the facade."
good,"Working with Cheveron allows you to develop mentally and skillfully by allowing you go through all necessary documents that can help to achieve the aim and objective of that project. The quality compliance is nothing to non and they also adhere to safety as well. Staff welfare will not be left out on this because I was given a first class treatment on area of accommodation, security and healthy care to ensure optimum utilization of my time during working hours."
good,"Working there was an great experience  . I learnt a lot of skills from the customers service job . I learned how to handle the situations the customers face . Customers service requires polite , calm and kind nature that the reason I am still working there at the gas station."
good,"Working well with the colleague and supervisors. Have been dealing with support team and customers.  Promptly feedback to customers. "
good,"Strong company with inclusive and welcoming work culture.  Good benefits and conditions.  Demanding but worthwhile work. Robust safety, environmental and compliance culture."
good,Chevron is a good company some can be better with improved management. Hours are  sometimes long but needed. There is always an opportunity to come up into management positions
good,"The Owner was a great team player however he summon someone a manager and this person what with no legal documents and very threading to me, he would acknowledge the co-workers by negative and bad words."
good,I would work there again. Lots of good people with positive attitudes and the boss was amazing. Just wish I could have worked there longer. Miss that place
good,It’s a great place to work as long as they change management. The manger was too involved in the employees life to make her feel like she was part of the youngsters.
good,"I loved working at chevron, It was something that i liked doing there. I have worked all the shifts there, I liked all my customers. A typical day at work is checking the coffee and checking everything to make sure everything is stocked, then checking the trashes and checking the bathrooms to make sure they have everything, also wiping down all the counters, making sure there is two or more people working so you can going  the cooler to stock it. "
good,"I loved my customers, but not the grave yard shift, I did not feel safe working late at night. I enjoyed my coworkers and my manager was pretty great."
good,"a typical day at work consisted of doing all prep work from cleaning and filling ice cream machine to chopping veggies for later also slicing tomatoes and onions on a slicer. i also had to clean the slicer and slice ham and turkey. i had to cook bacon almost all morning while juggling the orders that came in, i had to clean floors and take out trash and also make breakfast for the owner when he came in. when i worked the gas station side i had a lot of customers say they would be back because of me because i was so friendly and helpful"
good,My district manager makes me feel like I'm walking in egg shells. I've never felt so much stress from one job. I don't see my kid I don't see my family but I do have some of the best staff and some of the most caring employees but the upper management is to be desired
good,Gas station positions are cool for young adults. Safe environment in wealthy neighborhoods. Not worth-it in getto neighborhoods. Beggers can't be choosers.
good,"I have nothing to say. It was not a fun place to work, dealing with drugies and ungreatful customers. Management played favourites so not all were treated the same."
good,"Chevron looks to hire and promote kids of certain colleges and those who have family members employed in the oil and gas industry."
good,Everyone in the city came to this gas station. This created a busy work environment and everyone came in with new information on what was happening in the world.
good,"Well there is not much to say about being a gas station attendant at any old gas station, however I will say that some of the things that will be the most memorable are the ones where about the customers. Some of the customers would make or break your day. There would be some that would make you so mad that your whole day would be thrown out of wack. Even if your day is great, your day would be great."
good,This is not a great company to work for from the location that I worked at. The management didn't know how to do their job correctly and blamed all the bad things on the employees who worked there. 
good,"Well, I love the experience I'm getting from working even after living in a state I had to pump my own. I always try to keep my work til less than 10 cents under or over."
good,Management needs to improve . Cause people quit all the time . And even some customers were unsatisfied.  I was always over looked... and I was the best employee there and reliable my customer service skills were great they all loved me .. but I was unappreciated.
good,My current management retaliate against my calling in sick and ignores my religious beliefs frequently. Also was promised a daytime shift after a few months now with no chance of getting it.
good,"The average day consists of mostly work at the register, the shifts tend to be very long and no breaks were given. along with that no benefits are offered and low pay"
good,Poor Management and slow development. Not many opportunity to grow. No management support. Not much family time with 12hr rotating shifts. Benefits ok but not the best.
good,Liked the job and the customers. I enjoyed working alone and the hour's were fine. The job was easy and i stayed busy. The manager was not around much except to drink alcohol. I hated it when him and his wife would fight in front of me and the customers. Yelling the F word and in a different language except for the F word. The customers got upset to.  It just added more stress.  The manager was nice but having to many personal problems.
good,"I loved this job! Had a wonderful time with customers, regular and traveler. Selling product, lottery things of this nature were fun and rewarding both for customer and being witness to."
good,"Typical day/shift is normally 8.5-12 hours long depending on the work load. Schedule is done atleast 2 weeks ahead, sometimes more. I've learned how to get along with a wide variety of co-workers who don't necessarily want to be working doing what they are doing. I've learned how to deal with homeless people all the way to high class with money, management is very passive and nobody is ever held accountable for breaking even small rules, there is no write-ups ever so therefor people tend to slack off without that accountability. We work without breaks and lunches. We eat as we are helping customers, etc.. Often times just one person is working at a time. I love the variety of customers that I get to help everyday. The hardest part is probably working with management that is very passive in not holding people accountable for their actions, positive and negative."
good,my store had very very poor management. other than that great expiierence. we where a 2 n 1 store with subway and it did not meet health and safety standards at all
good,As a cashier at Chevron I was responsible for running the gas station by myself on a 7 hour shift. I learned how to be self sufficient and use time management wisely. The hardest part of the job was not being able to leave the store for a break.
good,Management was extremely rude. My manager would cut my hours if I couldn't come in when she asked or if she didn't like what I posted on my social media
good,"At the Colfax location, you deal with rude customers, a lot of heavy lifting and busy work. The coworkers are great but the management favors certain workers and cuts them a lot of slack while being hard on the rest."
good,"Lead Consultant over all operation Drilling/Workover and Completions."
good,overseeing the Cashiers greeting customers keeping things stocked keeping the store clean the Supervisor was very likeable when ever he was around I was the manager and all the cashiers were most interesting people I have met The hardest part of the job was trying to keep people from stealing out of the store the location where the store was located I could walk to work
good,It was fine. A lot of sketchy people at night. Prisoners were let out in front of store so it got a lot of questionable people during graveyard shift. Not enough hours were available.
good,"A typical day of working at Chevron consists of making sure the station is clean, stocking the shelves, preparing the food, and making sure everything is ready for the waves of customers."
good,"fast passed  environment, got to have excellent people  skills  .also you have to be excellent  at counting  money , that way you don't come out short in your  cash register by the  end of your  shift."
good,was a pretty chill place to work. management wasn't too terrible. most coworkers were cool. a good starting job but don't expect to move up super soon. i was there for almost 2 years and didn't do anything more than cashier even though i had mentioned id like to move up several times. they always would train someone else before me.
good,"i would work the register wich includes lottery, set gas pumps, and make safe drops. "
good,I had extra hours and wanted to make extra money so I took a job  and worked a few extra hours before I went to work at the Plywood Plant in Omak WA.. This is not a place I would want to spend the rest of my life on .
good,"Good company to work for, however advancement opportunities are limited to sat minimal when you're assigned or working in a low tier market that doesn't represent much for the company."
good,Though otherwise do not work there. It is simply not a workplace in which you can advance in any way or if youre looking to build a career of any sort.
good,"I enjoyed being such a positive attitude with my customers.  "
good,"Overall, I would say that working for chevron was a great place to work. I have learned many things on the job for the two years spent working there. I do not have anything bad to say about the company other than maybe lack in benefits or time off. I enjoyed the relationships that I built with regular customers, it is always exciting to see regular customers."
good,"How to work with high level of intelligence."
good,No more than 27 hours a week. This was a private owned which made benefits hard to achieve. Great customers and overall environment.
good,"Enjoyed working with the customer, learned nothing, co-worker came and left (turnover) the hardest changing from day shift to night shift with little notice"
good,"This was a corporate station, which takes the reigns away from the store manager and ensures conformity throughout the brand. Working other service positions I can say that having one and only one way of doing things is a huge plus and a real benefit to both new hires and the non-managment employees assigned to ""break them in"". I would probably still be working at this same station had I not decided to move to another town."
good,"Usually was quiet no trouble, easy to learn after about a week. Fun co-workers. Hardest part is when its rush hour. enjoyable is closing down."
good,Count money in cash drawers at the beginning of shifts to ensure that amounts are correct and that there is adequate change. Greet customers entering establishments. Maintain clean and orderly checkout areas. Responsible for opening and closing the store. 
good,"a day at work in a gas station is to mange stand up for 8 hours attending cotumers complains and sales for example lottery, lottery sales numer etc. had to host the buyer to attrack for attention to the store for it to seee the same costumers evry day and not be just some one who work in the store looking for something to do in the transcurse of the daily work ."
good,You get to meet some amazing people here.  It is a good place for learning about many different aspects of the energy business.  They have a great diversity and inclusion policy.
good,"Good management skills,good salary, safety personified, it's really a good company.Chevron is a company that I will recommend to all within and abroad to for,I enjoyed my days of working there,there look into an take their staffs welfare so serious, achieving a zero % of accident and a 100% safe working environment through their safety team I think is awesome.i love the company and will like to back there."
good,"Fast paced & easy going . Just do your job and do it right. Hours suck , don’t expect overtime .management doesn’t care about you or personal life will show"
good,"Lots of old cars and fantastic customers, fun coworkers."
good,"My pay at chevron could be better, especially after my loyalty, dependability and dedication I have put in over the years. Chevron over all has its up and downs, they could also practice and provide more safety. If has paid the bills over the years which I’m very grateful for."
good,"A good place to work, hard to get hired as they tend to promote from within if you are a contractor be ready to be treated differently than employees they have a hard separation of employees and contractors at Chevron to the point you are not included in anything."
good,"Barely got a lunch break most days, worked between 50-65 hours a week, went most weeks without an off day, hours were not flexible at all, the pay was not enough for what all you had to do"
good,Good place to stay if you're in it for the long-haul and have found the right team. Culture can take some time to get use to and it can be a hard industry to work in. Company needs to focus more on renewables.
good,It's fun place to work. Can be fast pace at time but extremely slow  as well. The management need a lot of work. The training could be better as well.
good,"Not much room for advancement but plenty of hours. All hours are paid at minimum wage, which I didnt like. And if anybody calls in you are expected to work a double shift which can seriously interfere with a life outside of work. The shortest shift I worked was 8 hours, the longest was 18 hours."
good,"I started out as a gas attendant, with an 4 months I was manager. The work was easy enough but the company lacked direction and devoted staff, easy to he promoted but the payscale way subpar. Over all not bad but not the greatest either."
good,"My experience for the first three years she was great. After layoffs , it seemed  things started to go downhill and after losing a supervisor.   work was no longer considered important  in between tomorrow and say it majority of work was only down by particular individuals . As far as pay and responsibility, my  entire career was good.  Alot of backstabbing and cutthroat in the field.  This is a purpose position for someone young and single with no family. You can make great money"
good,"Mgmt needs to think about the workforce.This is a great company, but management is not up to the mark. In particular, the middle management. If this is the way things will be, the future is not bright for sure."
good,"It's Elm dead end job no benefits and paid my own medical insurance work 40 to 50 hours a week no overtime, lab work done long time they are six years should be making at least 12 or $13 an hour but I just barely and making 9 now"
good,"not for a career basis, no raises, no benefits. Clock in at 6 leave at 2 , busy day of stocking and running cash resister, cool owners, nice and polite"
good,"I worked as a contract worker so I can't give you an accurate review on Chevron. It seems like a good company to work for. As for a Desktop Support rep, it was great!"
good,I liked the management. It was a good job for someone who only needed extra money. I liked running the cash register and they defiantly train3d me good for the register and lottery machines. It wasn't a place to work and take care of a family.
good,It's an ok place to work.  Nice people in general but political which is the norm in corp america. Not at all a progressive  culture - HR and otherwise.  Good work-life balance.
good,"not much to do or say about this job. You will start graveyard, bring a book and some music it will be boring. you have to clean at 4 AM quick easy, and coffee every 4 hours."
good,"I enjoyed working there with nice co workers, and many customers were regulars. The manager of the store is nice, the area manager was ok and other managers were cool."
good,"The hardest part of the job rude customers or a unhappy boss every other day. Most enjoyable part to meet different customers and to help them with no attitude or dislike, treat each as an individual trying to purchase from your facility."
good,It was an okay job. Coworkers were very rude. Just came to do my job n left when it was time for me to clock out.
good,"A typical shift was stocking, cleaning the store, answering the phone and taking messages. Running the register, greeting customers, checking in orders from different vendors. The hardest part of the job was knowing it was coming to an end but not really getting notice until my last day of work. The most enjoyable part was seeing the customers who always seemed to brighten my day when they came in."
good,"The hours vary, the management was ok, mostly worked alone. The best part of the job was the customers the hardest part of the job was the pay."
good,"would always come in and start count on lottery tickets. I learned how to count lottery tickets and how to work the lottery machine. My manager was a very cool guy. There was nothing hard about the job. most enjoyable about the job is the customers, making sure they are happy and satisfied."
good,"I would recommend this job to somebody that doesn't want to do much lifting because it's an easy job , not that much pay , the pay rate was $12 an hour but i left due to a traumatizing robbery that occurred"
good,I really enjoyed the time I worked with them they where nice and the energy was perfect the training was a bit of a challenge but in the end it was a piece of cake..
good,I really didn’t enjoy working here due to grave yard shift and the lack of security that was available but I did enjoy the employees and the manager at the time
good,"Many skills learned in customer service"
good,We had a high turn over rate. Schedule was only made for the week so it was hard to make plans ahead of time. Loved most of the staff and manager always did what she could to help us out. Some days would be super easy and slow other days would feel like all I  did was stand at the register to help customers. While other workers handled the rest of our duties of the day.
good,This was an awesome company to work for especially with the benefits the hours but if you have children and hardly any family to help you this wouldn't be a fit. Sone if the co workers I worked with made me feel unwelcomed and just as if I was in the way . Very clicky and 2 faced I'm not one to talk about someone and them pretend to be nice and like them to their face . The job was awesome it's a great company to but the girls not so much
good,"They did not pay for  Paid time off, No pay over time and Low pay, 70 Hour a week, No Holiday Pay. Too much work some time 15 hour a days. You can make sick call when we need sick day of and want to day off for any appointment Boss was mad."
good,"Chevron is one of the leading Exploration and Production company in Nigeria. In Chevron,staff safety is made the piority. When it is not safe, dont do the job at all."
good,I enjoyed my time there but there was nor room for improvement and is a dead end job so I need to find space to advance since I am very young and would like to succeed in life.
good,A decent place to work. New ideas are welcomed and unique approaches to problem solving are encouraged at Chevron. The volunteer opportunities Chevron offers are a welcome addition to any ordinary workday.
good,the managers dont know how to scheduled and might forget to put some one in a shift and may make you work double shift to fill there spot some times after a double shift the next shift will call out and the managers say if your on the pumps you cant leave till some one else comes if you do you will get fired also if some one steals gas or something from the food mart YOU have to pay out of pocket before shift is over or you either get fired or suspended........but with all that said the customers are good and you get tips if you like or need long hours this might be for you
good,"I was the last contractor to be hired so when the project was nearing the end so,I was the 1st to be laid-off. I gained a few friends from this project which was amazing for me because I truly believe it takes a village to raise a child but also a Team you trust to complete a job by deadline no matter what the cost."
good,"Good  place to work just need more hours. Good  management Like the 4 -12 shift  I would like to keep working but need more hours to live. Customers  Service, Stocking ordering  stock."
good,"Ringing up orders at register and helping customers find things or assist them at pump. Face isles, stocking. Very relaxed and welcoming. Fun to engage with customers. Low pay."
good,"Loyslf things goingon at once phone tings, cars pull up, guy needs propane, guests at the counter getting snacks, tow truck drivers in and out of the lot. One guy to run it all for the most part."
good,"Good company to work for as far as getting job experience."
good,"Good company, family oriented, and willing to work with employees. Not much room for advancement or mobility. Great provider with great benefits to match."
good,"Got to have good manners gotta be able to bite your tongue, strong personality. Prepare to be a doormat to everyone. Patience is your best friend. But don't let them walk all over you."
good,Nothing bad to say it was a good environment good ppl and a safe place to work.pay was ok.i dont know what eles to say.they should give benefits to ppl
good,My review and experience with the company was pretty much 50-50. It was a part time job with 32 hours per a work week. I had my ups and downs with the customers. At end it all turns out for the better at he end. i just left on a good note.
good,Its a good place for someone who is good with the public. Fast-paced. You deal with all of the vendors and get to know your regulars. Overall it was a very satisfying job.
good,Chevron has lots of opportunities for an engineer. There are more than enough stuff for you to work on. But the manager will not lead you. They rule by fear and will back stab you when time comes.
good,"Easy-going job fun workplace and environment under right management. Keeps you on your feet most of the time, get to meet new people every day and interact with a variety of people."
good,"I was the opener, so I would have to start all the coffees, set up register and then my day would begin. I would take cash for all gas transactions. I would stock all cigs, shelves, and coolers. I also kept the bathrooms clean. At 2pm it was time to shift change and I would count all my money and do my paperwork. Also had to do a cig count at the end of my shift.On the weekends I had to do the daily deposits and all the paperwork for both shifts."
good,Don't do this job. The management sucks they don't hire enough staff. You work all the time. They expect you to work crazy hours and when you get sick its the end of the world becuz there's no help
good,"The work is easy, but sometimes there is a lot to get done. Friendly customers and fun coworkers make it a fun job most of the time. Pay is minimum wage."
good,"It is a uiet job but we find the day to day to the customer, where there are days very good but others not so good."
good,"In the years I have worked in Chevron, my development both in skills and knowledge of the job has been tremendous. Chevron helped me to grow through various in-house training, capacity building and a good safety culture."
good,"A typical day at work ...  there is none.  Customers can make or break you.  You have your regulars, and then you have those customers that you wish had never stepped foot through the door."
good,There is very little job security and almost no chance of advancement. Management does provide the necessary tools/equipment for job completion.
good,"I have developed a relationship with my customers and vendors. I love this job because it balances my home life and the fact that I am a full time college student. My only problem is that I have worked here 3 years and have more responsibilities, but I still make the same amount of money I have since my first day on the job. I can't always pay my pay bills on what I make. I have learned so much about how to run a business by working here, that /it has helped me with my assignments in school because I want to one day own my own business."
good,"Worked here during college and was fortunate enough to have an amazing boss and work environment. Most days were methodical if not mutinous, but with the right coworkers everyday can be a pleasure."
good,"Once taking a position expect to get stuck there due to staffing no matter the advances you make in education, or how well you do your job. The problem is that too many people (with great benefits) are allowed to cheat the system and take extended leaves, FMLA, disability and early retirement. The gaps left leave the good people who pick up the slack to be pigeon holed into their positions due to staffing issues. Advancement takes much longer than it should and it leads people away from Chevron, allowing them to cite on a resume several years experience, however little advancement. For people who do not care about moving up the ladder jump right in, it is a stable company that will allow you to take full advantage of them while providing an above industry average salary and excellent benefits."
good,shift work doing product analysis.  physical danger was always present in Lab and in plant production areas.
good,daily customer dealing and sales prespectives.interaction with new tasks and working in a growing environment teaches good team work.
good,It is a decent place to work as a first time employer. You are expected to have integrity and be able to count the money back to the customer. Chevron is a good place for fuel since they have the tech-tron.
good,"I learned to value customer service and the hardest part of this job was knowing that I could do so much more, so then I left for the Army."
good,"Daily tasks focus on site visits, morning safety toolbox talks, project meetings, kick off meetings. Huge focus on contract management, scope of work development, and generaql safety"
good,The job doesn't always proved the hours needed to make a living but is often flexible with schedule and is accepting of everyone. I would think the job would offer a little more in terms of wages and benefits.
good,Being a Safety Technician main goal is to make sure the Employees Leave the same way they came in. Chevron is an awesome site and really have a very high standard for safety for all employees to follow.
good,I absolutely love my job but the pay leaves a lot to be desired  very hard to pay the bills  pay is weekly but not enough   Live paycheck to paycheck and most often don’t make it to the next one
good,"If you are in the right team, under the right Business Unit, you might succeed. Bad behaviors within managers seem to be overlooked. The employee will find no support within the company."
good,"Its a average gas station job, was able to pick up extra hours if wanted, no pay bonus for graveyard shift, on your own all shift, bring a jacket for stocking the cooler."
good,"Flexible working hours"
good,"Chevron is fast paced especially in the area mine was located. We changed people and managers at least once every month/ 2 months. It could be stressful at times but when you have a good crew, it wasn't too bad"
good,The Drilling Representative position with the Drilling Department provide ample exposure to oil well drilling and workover operations.  The subsequent Production Engineering position afforded familiarization with project engineering and economics.
good,"Worked with a great crew, not a bad business, met a lot of new people. Hardest thing to do were the holidays, new workers had to work Christmas, and new years."
good,"Chevron as a company is a good place to work at but only in case you keep your mouth shut and keep following the older people there. if you give new idea, it will be considered as stepping in into the process that they don't want to change."
good,I got to learn all the working aspects of a gas station. There is never downtime so there is always something to do to keep someone busy. Always meeting new people.
good,"Working at the Chevron was a quite easy job. Just running the register and ringing people up all day long. Was very awsome getting to meet all kinds of people traveling through. Wikieup is a very small town that is after Wickenburg and before Kingman. It is on the highway going to Vegas.So it did get very busy at times. I also stocked the coolers and the store products while cashiering also. When we would get our big store orders for the week we would have to price everything and organize the products. It was a great work environment. Very friendly co-workers. Management was great also, not the best but i was not there to make friends. Just to work then go home. The hardest part of the job would have to be closing. Cleaning every part of the store and the counting our till which is the drawer. Making sure we had every penny accounted for."
good,Chevron was a good place to work. I enjoyed my coworkers and customers. It was at an office location with plenty of other business around. We had a lot of foot traffic on the interstate.
good,"It was okay, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend working for any gas station company as a full-time, permanent position.  That's only my personal opinion, and based on what I would prefer to do.  This was only a temporary job."
good,"Allowed me to learn new and exciting skills while meeting new people, learning different personalities, while allowing me to grow and learn different things."
good,"At Chevron, as an island attendant (pumping petrol) my normal duties included greeting each customer assertively and politely, while inquiring their specific amount of petrol to be pumped and how much. As the customer is about to leave, it is my job to insure that that the customers interaction with Extra Mile Chevron was a positive one to ensure another return. As a cashier clerk, my duties included handling cash in and out of the register or drop box. making sure that Oregon's age restricting laws are abided by when alcohol and/or tobacco is purchased. Interacting with customer at the counter while staying alert and aware of potential threats such as thieves. Maintaining a very clean, neat, and orderly facility using a broom and mop for floors, cleaning chemicals and wash cloth for the counter tops, and washing the dishes. Using a roller oven to cook and keep hot deli food. Counting product and inventory using a hand held inventory device. Finally, while on graveyard shift, the cooler doors accessing the alcohol are locked and secured in accordance with Oregon's liquor laws."
good,"Working onshore in Luanda, Angola, consisted of blasting and painting, fabricated steel sections, pan cakes, and carry out quality control before shipment to location, in Soyo, Angola for assembly."
good,"Working 12 hour shifts, night shift or day shift."
good,"Great employees trying to do the right thing for the wrong industry.  Someone needs to do this job, The pay is good, stock options are great, having to re-apply for your job because the latest MBA hotshot just completed their company divisions round robin, not great. Corporations love spending money on consultants to test their metrics and help them decide they need to reduce employees because they spent to much money on consultants."
good,"It was a good atmosphere and an equal opportunity employer.I felt welcomed and trained according to what my daily tasks were involved with. The management was very flexible with hours as well as making sure you got the best hours, according to your schedule as well as theirs."
good,"Cool place to work and laid back when it’s not busy. No bonuses, insurance, discounts or anything like that... even getting paid OT is almost impossible. Definitely low stress and low responsibility and most work is simple tasks. Definitely a dead end job and not something you’d look to as a career, but other than that it’s decent."
good,"401k match was great.  Good benefits.  Many goods people, although if you came from Gulf Oil due to the merger, you were not looked on a favorably as those that started with Chevron."
good,"Loved my coworkers but the hours were hard to adjust from a graveyard to a swing and never knew if the schedule would be changed on your next shift. Missed out on having a regular life outside of work. Pros. Discounts, Christmas and thanksgiving bonus. Cons. Weird scheduling."
good,"its fun, then oil prices plummet and its over  -- job safety is important but they get so crazy about safety that its almost hazardous. the onboard driving thing sucks"
good,Chevron is was a new experience for me and it taught me a lot in the field of Customer Service. I had to learn how to deal with all types of people and furthering my Sales experience.
good,"Chevron is a great job to work at while you try to pass the time looking for another job, or you just want to work full time. It's a relaxed job as far as lifting, or hard work goes. When it comes to dealing with customers you do have to be fast paced, in and out. There are a lot of cons to this job, which you can find out on your own. I have worked at a lot of places, but this job overall isn't terrible."
good,"A job where it will understand and work with you if someone has a specific responsibility/duty outside of work. Friendly people, great staff, and customers of all types of cultures and backgrounds that make it enjoyable to work."
good,The continued existence of this bizarre niche job is contingent on people voting for preference to have someone else pump their gas so they don't have to exit their vehicle. It is a good opportunity to get manual labor job experience and have some down time while at work. The real problem is that this kind of job has no pathways to anywhere else and is often a repository for ex-cons and financially unambitious people.
good,"The work was fast paced. Training was minimal."
good,"A typical day around the office, everyone shows up at 7 for the safety meeting. Most try and leave to go hide for the day. The ones who stay all suck-up to the bosses. The new main manager is on a big power trip due to a recent demotion of his career."
good,Was working overnight. didnt have any one to help me. and did not feel safe by myself the manager was very nice. typical day was cleaning and stocking.
good,This was a pretty good job. I was a cashier /stock person. Left because the owner sold out nd new owner brought in their own people if it weren't for that I would have probably stayed and not gone to Mobil
good,Very adaptive corporation when needed to meet the needs of work environment and achieve world class safety performance. Compassionate about safety as a core value instead of a job necessity.  Its a great company to express operational discipline and do the right thing for safety regardless the production schedules
good,Learned a great deal about how a major integrated oil company works. It was fun challenging work for the most part. HR processes to be completely revamped.
good,"I enjoyed working for Chevron, but needed a position with benefits."
good,"Good place to advance your career. Work life balance and training are excellent. Could be a tough place to work during down turns in the industry. However, I still like work here."
good,"i worked in the deli very fast paced always something to do. management was very receptive of any problems that you had with the way things were going or how other coworkers were working, nothing really was ever done about anything but she was great at listening. advancement was awesome you could ask to work a different shift or in a different part of the store an she would do her best to accommodate you."
good,This job helped me with customer service and how to handle complaints or questions regarding their concerns. I was able to help answer their questions and troubleshooting situations.
good,"Easy to learn how to make transactions, cash handling, maintaining the store and learning more about why Chevron has the best gas in town."
good,Good long term career for the person who is in it for the long haul. Chevron applauds good work and will work with you to improve.
good,Its a ok place to work during the day. It gets scary sometimes at night because u never know whats going to happen but it was also due to the location i was in. I loved seeing the new faces and also my regulars that came in. The owner was a very lovely person. I enjoyed conversation with her.
good,"I work in night shift by myself, I learned that it's small family company and there is no chance for advancement. co-workers are nice  and enjoyable job."
good,"I have worked here for 2 years now and have become very familiar with the company, and what is expected with the company. I have worked as management here and feel the company has provided me with great opportunities to excel and further pursue my career."
good,"I worked with a great group of people, but even though I was just a contractor so even though I was constantly offered to stay for additional 3-6 months at a time (total of 4.5 years), I was never offered a permanent position with the company."
good,"Control all operations on the well site, ensure daily reports are competed and in on time. "
good,"I clocked in, gave excellent customer service, filled propane tanks. I kept the store clean and was in charge of inventory control."
good,A great support group. Living on Lift boat can sometimes be tough do to limited work space and logistics can be sometimes even tougher due to limited space.
good,I enjoy the fast paced environment of being employed at one of the highest sales stores in the district.  The benefits are high in cost and the wages and not very competitive. I was employed in Riverside CA
good,Everybody wanted to everybody else's friend and as a result not much work would get done. I found it to be unfulfilling work.
good,"Great benefits and a solid company but with an old school mentality.  It is a great place to work but also very political and there is a lot of red tape to get through.  It is quintessential ""big oil."""
good,"Each day I prepared permits to work and reviewed JSA's.  Monitored three to four crews for job quality and safety."
good,"I like to work with Chevron because I am able to meet new people everyday, if not I'm able learn new things on a daily and help people who are not able to help themselves, such as handicap people. I learn that things are not always easy but if I stay on task it should work itself out. All my co workers and I work together as a team, if we don't know something we get together and figure it out."
good,"This was a very short term role, very intensive, challenging and great experience."
good,"Lots of safety training, great safety all around.  Too much middle managers, no job security."
good,"This was a high volume job related to approving 10 gas pumps and 4 diesel pumps, waiting on customers, watching for shoplifters.  Job required alertness at all times. I enjoyed my fellow employees and employer's.  We had great mutual respect for one another."
good,"i was a private franchise great experience the bad thing is lot of hours no social life "
good,"I loved the job, doing the work and even my co-workers, But the management seemed a bit unfair at times. I wasn't too experienced in a colleague's run and the management felt it was a good idea to send me out on an evaluation I have never ever been on with a misprinted map and the stress of being evaluated for my job. I then couldn't find most of my locations that day and needless to say I got a bad review. The benefits and the hourly wage given to the employees was great! But getting that much pay would mean you will have to put up with a bunch of upset people for no reason it seemed like. The company was a fun experience and it taught me a lot."
good,"work day is slow,at chevron me being a patrol security officer i learned how oil is monitored over the states/countries, the manager and co workers are very nice and polite,the duties are not hard at all very easy and laid back,the most enjoyable part of the job is i dont have to sit in one spot i get to walk around and get to know different types of people."
good,Most days were dealing with staff and customer concerns.
good,"At chevron I was respected but I never got recognized for the things I do to help my co workers. For example, when someone needed a day off I was the one to call because I was reliable. I also stayed late just to get my job done because the previous person didn’t finish their job."
good,"The work Load was not too much."
good,Someone I work with is always trying to get me fired because I was talking to the same girl as he was. I love the job but now I'm not getting enough hours.
good,Despite some negatives or downfalls in the workplace I absolutely loved the customers and being in the customer service field.  I loved being able to make a customer smile on a horrible day. I didnt enjoy having to work with some of my coworkers because of choices they made in their off time but always made the best of it and didnt let it interfere with my job performance.
good,Typisch Oelgeschaeft...Wenn Preise stabil sind geht es gut.  Bei niedrigen schlecht.
good,"I enjoyed my time here, my bosses were nice and communicated, the environment was good, I learned a lot working here. Becoming an Assistant Manager gave me more responsibilities such as doing inventory, filling orders, dealing with some store issues, scheduling. wish they didn’t sell company."
good,Great place to work and safe place to work. The pay is really awesome there. I suggest other contractors to go to school and get operation degree if you chose the oil refinery a place for your living as a painter contractor.
good,"Great company to work for. I enjoyed the fast paced work. I would do it again if an opening came jup,e shutdown was stressful at times but I would do it again!"
good,"When I worked for them I learned how to put things on file, check the dates on the receipts to see if they were up to date, I don't remember it being a hard job."
good,"Chevron was an easy-going job with exceptional, concerned management. Things were always in order from scheduling to inventory. And there was the opportunity to see different people or either the same loyal customers everyday. I would not hesitate to work with this company."
good,This was a really fast paced job that had me on my toes always. there was a lot of traffic in and out of the store so cleanliness and customer service was really important.
good,très bonne entreprise qui s'occupe très bien de ses salaries
good,"I liked the job, but it wasnt productive enough for me, after cleaning and restocking everything in about an hour or two I would just stand by at the cash register until my shift ended. I hated not being useful, I found it quite boring. This being my first job, they didnt explain very well about two week notice. So after getting two of my friends who are very capable of the job hired, I decided to quit. I found a replacement for me which was one of the 2 friends and handed in my uniform. That was that."
good,"Needed a more steady income permanent job status, temporary assignment and I enjoyed pay and experience.The job was good and informative, of 100 users"
good,"This was an offsite/remote position, manager was pleasant and professional and pretty easy to work with. If the opportunity presented itself I would definitely work with Chevron again."
good,I enjoyed working at Chevron while employed but it was confusing because everyone wanted to be a manager and that caused too much chaos.  I enjoyed my regular customers but wished I had more protection against the customers that were not so friendly and were actually violent.
good,"Typical convenience store job. You cashier, clean and stock. You clean the gas tanks and hoses, sweep the lot, change out the trash cans. Everything you would expect to do, maybe a little more. It is active work."
good,"I really enjoyed my work at Chevron for over 7 years with amazing team work who i will never forget.  my day work start 7 A.M at the morning until 3.P.M.  I met many issues during my work time or with my employer and i was listening first very carefully from everyone and watch the cameras before i take any steps.  The hardest part of my job was when i hire someone and discover later he is stealing or is someone been absent without giving a call,"
good,"Chevron was great.  I would work for them again if I did not have to relocate.  I was on rotation, so I did not work a typical job but they were safe and paid about average."
good,"Working at a gas station,it has it's busy and slow days."
good,Busy area so Time went by quickly. Management was supportivein both scheduling and job responsibilities. Provided necessary training for all aspects of the job.
good,"My title may be Cashier, but my role extends to almost all tasks in the store, bar management. Usually, for me, I begin my shift around 5 pm and check to see if any previous coworkers left me any notes. Those would usually be for food that needs to be brought out of the freezer for the next day. I then begin the process of closing the food counter. That includes dishes, filtering the fryer etc. I am typically the back-up cashier."
good,"It honestly was one of the better jobs I've had, though if we had better management I would almost certainly still be working there. Most coworkers tend to be interesting characters and not to mention the customers."
good,"I didn't see a future here. I was not being challenged, My manager never trained me. I had to figure things out on my own or ask employees. Overall, this was a new path for me to see my interest and where I fit"
good,I enjoyed working at Chevron for the most part. I really liked my second boss. I wish there were more development opportunities for non engineers employees. I like the 9/80 schedule and the collaborative work environment.
good,"I started working as a cashier at chevron and ended up as store manager, mostly i like to work over there but had to relocate, sometimes its really stressful place to work because of pushing to hours."
good,little stressfull quick pace no vacation  no paid vacations    no medical  no dental   little room for improvement    little work life imbalance  tight management
good,Over all the experience was great working and meeting a diverse group of people. Learning how to handling cash count cigarettes order merchandise and stock merchandise. In Santa Monica I met a lot of Celebrities so that was cool.
good,A lot of great people and also great campus with food and gym.  Loved the flexibility and benefits.  Had a great experience with the leadership as well as other groups within the company.
good,It was an amazing experience and I hated to leave but had to due to family related relocation but overall an amazing job and would recommend to anyone
good,"I learned a lot at a space of shot time, have worked with good bunch of people we enjoyed having each other around good cultute and vibe, company looked well after its employees"
good,"I worked on assignment at Chevron within the Law Function.  My subgroup had excellent leadership, strong attorneys, and good managers. As an older  and larger company, the Law Function culture mirrored that of a firm in ""Big Law"" so it's something to be mentally prepared for.  Across departments however, people seemed to really like working for the company and were invested in it for the long term."
good,"People were nice and everyone was very easy to get along with.  There was many restrictions on what you can do there a lot of red tape"
good,Non stop busy all day long. Makes the day go by fast. No breaks and you eat while you work. The hardest part was trying to make sure your required duties were done before next shift with little help. The best part was the customers that came in.
good,"It was a fun place to work at great entertainment and great people, the boss was an awesome boss. The employees some of them were ok and some of them were mean"
good,"Brinderson construction was the company I worked for in the Chevron refinery. Chevron was a great place to work,the attention to safety was the most important item we focused on."

good,Nice place to work. Every one are professional in dealing with job related problem. Friendly environment. Clean and environmentally friendly work place
good,•Relaxed job on a daily basis the only thing was the pay was not where I wanted it to be and there was never overtime or a lunch break but I did learn how to interact with different people with different types of personalities.
good,"Worked m-thu. 6am -4:30pm great schedule, learned about safety, family workplace culture have each others back work safe or not at all. The hardest part of the job is to make sure everyone is working safe so there is no accidents. Working with all my coworkers as they are like family."
good,"Rigid bureaucratic systems that focus on procedure and documentation but not within the framework of a quality management system that allows improvements.  A culture of expecting engineers to justify earlier technical decisions by others, however poor, rather than apply their own expertise.  Poor knowledge management and communication between operational groups."
good,I did not work for Chevron.  I worked for a construction company. The safety department was great to work with.  They were very helpful with company policies.
good,"loved working here just no breaks and i had to work graveyard alone."
good,"Great job. Fast-paced work, rarely a dull moment. Minimum wage pay but tips come frequently which makes up for it. Terrible management, which is why I quit."
good,Learned a lot as a cashier there.  The downfall is that there is no advancement to better improve yourself.  A typical day at work is interesting with new customer and different personalities.
good,Most groups have very good work/life balance. Awesome 9/80 work schedule with every other Friday off.  Lacking ability to work remotely or telecommute on occasion.
good,I worked as a cashier. A typical day I scan through items and clean the floors. The game room has to be kept clean also. I also hand out matches to customers who gamble in the game room.

good,"management can vary as always most of the time really cool know what they are doing"
good,I would help the customers at night and stock the store. I learned how to do those things. Management was relaxed and fun. If you did your job then if was a fun experience.

good,I took inbound calls from the customer about their healthcare. To see if they wanted to make any changes by adding or dropping something off of their plan
good,"My typical work day consisted of Working the register, making and preparing deep fried foods, restocking shelves, cleaning surfaces, cleaning windows, counting stock and making lists of what was wasted or needed."
good,Like working with the employees also was a really chill job. No was mean or treat you work. Definitely get to move up in the company. I learned that customer is always right.

good,Great place to learn customer service. Got to serve all kinds of people from different walks of life. Taught a great deal of patience dealing with some difficult customers.
good,"It is a fun part-time job or second job for extra money. Get to meet lots of new people. As i said it is a fun job, smile and greet people and you will have a good time."
good,"Chevron is more about the rules...even they don't make any sense. They are so big, so they can afford mistakes. Overall, the company is not bad, a little too bureaucratic, but they are hitting the mark."
good,"Too driven by market prices.  Company leaned from energy producer to a stock driven business."
good,"Good Company - Good Life / work balance , Flexibility at work , many International locations to work for Chevron  - Also very generous benefit package and Pension"

good,"typical day at work is to clock in and count my register to make sure the amount matches the amount on the computer to make sure am not short. I learned how to give customers outstanding customer service and to be able to interact with many people. Management was okay, the facility was always kept clean a lot of need for better work environment was always given if necessary. The hardest part of my day was to sign out count my register and collect all my paper work. What i enjoyed the most about my day was being able to relax and take a seat and occasionally take a 5 minute break since we did not have lunch breaks."
good,"Overall, Chevron is a great place to intern at. However, your experience as an intern largely depends on the group you are working with. I didn't have the best experience but that shouldn't discourage you from applying."
good,"Pretty straight-forward daily work."
good,I enjoyed thus job. I had many roles there and was always busy. They do not provide any kind of insurance and pay is minimum. My manager was an awesome guy.
good,work environment is very slow paced. you are the only one working so time might go by slow. there is not much to do after you have finished you shift checklist so the challenge is to find thing to do to keep you busy.
good,Fast pace job without  benefits privately owned .At the time I needed a job and took it .My fist time working a gas station and I enjoyed it .Meeting new people assisting with directions  or recommended places to eat or visit. I left for a better path job
good,"I am sure the above statement was in the particular store that  I worked at as I've seen many other locations that ran very smooth.The hardest part of this job at this location was knowing who to listen to and who not to. The manager there just let the employees do whatever they wanted to do and in the time I was employed there I never met or seen the DM at all. I enjoyed the learning part of this job there was so much that I didn't know and know and I was enjoying all the learning."
good,Did a lot over night shift took in a lot of co workers shifts to him them. Didn't mind working over time. Stocking in the freezer was enjoyable for me best part of the job for me. Sometimes cashier would get out of hand with people trying to steal but I would always have it under control. Boss was awesome .
good,"interact with customers."
good,"Bonne entente dans l'équipe, conditions de travail agréables."
good,Need to be mobile if you want to advance your career and to be able to understand the entire business.  Great place to collaborate and work with peers.  Don't expect many social events as people leave right after work.
good,"A regular day at work consists of cleaning up the station, running the cash register, and stocking the shelves with our merchandise in the back.Its a very easy but sometimes boring job but, only because I work overnight. Therefore only a few customers ever come in. The best part of my job would definitely be the customers however that can also definitely be the most difficult part of the job."
good,"A typical day at work:"
good,"Chevron is an excellent place to work for, they know how to take care of their employees by maintaining and safe and efficient work environment.  Chevron also invest in their employees by fair promotions based on employee contributions."
good,"The company did a lot of good for me and I had learned a lot from them before I returned abroad for another job. They're efficient and good people, especially with their project outputs."
good,This was a contract job that started out two months and ended up being five. It was a very friendly atmosphere with good people and work also. Various types of work made this job interesting.
good,When I worked as a contractor for chevron I was surprised about the instability of the work environment.  During my time there I slowly saw benefits I was promised be taken away with the instability of the field of work.  Over time the things I had appreciated about the job disappeared and I was left with the realization that this is no longer a company I would like to work for.
good,Great place to work with wonderful benefits and a diverse workforce.  I learned a great deal from so many talented people.
good,"Great workplace"

good,"Worked as an intern for one month, 5 days a week. My days would start at 8 am until 5 pm. As a business student, working in the department of supply chain and more specifically dealing with contracts was new and that way very educational. I got the chance to work with two people from SCMC department who were very helpful and professional. The working environment in general was very positive and friendly. The hardest part of the job was to make an actual contract, which i was able to carry out at the end of the internship with the assistance of my coworkers . Working for Chevron was very enjoyable, providing a multicultural atmosphere and this way very easy to adapt."
good,"Chevron Corporation is dedicated to helping employees succeed and develop skills that will help them excel in the workforce. "
good,"Always doing something different, which made the day go by fast and i met a variety of different people which made my insight on others much different in prospective. Great learning experience."
good,MY boss is great and I'm happy with my co-workers. The problem is not being able to actually work with the co-workers. On my shift I work entirely alone.
good,"The people who you work with are great. Everyone wants to see you succeed, and there is plenty of opportunity to demonstrate your talents."
good,"The refinery was an excellent place to work especially for those who like to have every day different and challenging. You get an accomplished feeling at the end of each day.

good,Empresa que trabalha apoiada no mais tradicional modelo americano de ser seguindo a risca todas as regras e necessidades oriundas legislações pertinentes ao negócio.
good,"Work at Chevron has always been enjoyable. I have worked there off and on for about 15 years. Everyone is friendly and for the most part supportive. There is an appreciation for writing, training, communications, and change management. If you have change management skills, it seems like they are always looking for that. Everyday is different because all projects are different. I was lucky enough to work for the inhouse IT writing department, inhouse ad agency, and finally on my own company's contract. While the latter didn't give me a lot of job security, it was great to work for myself."
good,Fast pace environment enjoyed my job but not the commute.  Organized work process with 3 shifts.  Enjoyed the job and worked with moving empty trailers and loaded trailers to the yard.
good,it was very nice to work in this office. i am very comfortable to work with this client. time period is very nice. but i have to move some other company because my contract is over here.
good,"All of my 35 years engineering experience has been on major capital projects, predominantly in the engineering contractor's office but has included field commissioning as well.  I value the travel experiences and working on a good team the highest.  The most difficult part of my job was conflict management."
good,Chevron is a good company to work for. Management are a little bit removed from reality and the company has too many processes so it is not nimble.
good,Have very much enjoyed working at Chevron for the past 4+ years. I have learnt a lot and met some great people. My knowledge in the Oil and Gas Industry and general knowledge of an office environment has grown considerably.
good,"A ordinary day consist of - arriving with ample time to discuss with other team members any problems they may have encountered. Counting cash drawer to ensure tally is correct. Cleaning store,stocking shelves,dusting and checking various products to ensure customers receive products that are not expired or near ""best if used by date"". Management is always available either in person or by phone. My co-workers are all friendly and helpful. Hardest part of my day is end of night closing when customer comes in at end closing time of day. My most enjoyable part  is interaction with customers."
good,"A team of highly trained workers, who work to ensure that Chevron is still top 3 Oil companies in the world. The people are motivated and the remuneration is splendid."
good,The majority of my experience with Chevron was great until a new manager was brought in from overseas.  He lacked the competency to perform his duties and micro-managed every aspect of the department leading to the destruction of a workplace where everyone had previously enjoyed and been proud of.
good,"I really enjoy working with Chevron and the culture there (referred to as the Chevron Way), focuses on relationships within the company and providing a safe and ergonomic workplace,"
good,Interesting place to work. Got along well with most of the staff but not all. Working with only a few staff there weren't a lot of flexibility about hours. The great customers made up for any other downfalls.

Project Manager were enjoyable to work with.  Did lots of sourcing and work to assist getting new suppliers qualified.  Chevron decided to sell off this portion of their business, so CES is no longer part of Chevron."
good,A typical work day included direct interactions with team members and unit manager in order to stay abreast of the days assignments. What I learned at Chevron is that team work in conjunction with dynamic leadership accomplishes company goals. The most enjoyable part of the job are the perks outside of just your paycheck. Gift cards are given out regularly for going above and beyond normal work and managers appreciate that.
good,"Stock shelves, clean parking lot, fill cold box's, do cash register by waiting on customers. Selling to customers gas and food and grocery items for their trips to Yosemite. Management was hard to deal with being it was a mother daughter team. Co-workers were fun and entertaining. Was being alone at night never knowing if you would get to busy for one employee on duty.

good,Definitely got to learn a lot about different people from all around the world. It was fun and a great learning experience.
good,"My managers and team were hard working, and very caring about each other. The hardest part of the job was staying current with the news and all the new projects in the global company. Community Engagement projects were great, and again, the money invested was good but not commensurate with similar companies. "
good,"Chevron on the whole is a great company to work for. Under new ownership there were many positive changes were great but they were shrouded by a lot of negative impact when the new owners began interacting with customers. I believe the customer comes first, and should be treated with respect at all times."
good,"day at work was long and busy, learned how to operate cash register and pump propane, management was good at times, co workers dependable, hardest part of day would have to be rush hour when pumps where jammed, easiest part would be end of shift when traffic died down."
good,"The motto for Chevron should have been, ""if you have time to lean, you have time to clean."" This is exactly how each day was working here. I stayed busy, and there was always something to do. I worked with the public as a cashier or customer service, did janitorial work, stocked and pulled food, food prep, and inventory. Each day I had to keep track of money going in and out of the cash register with a record written down and given to the manager at the end of each shift. I enjoyed working with my co-workers because we had to work as a team in order to finish our job duties for the day. We made sure the jobs were done, even if that meant helping one another. The hardest part of my day was being on my feet all day, but after a couple weeks, it was no longer a problem."

The hardest part was when I had to do double shifts when my co-workers couldn't make it I always cover for them so standing for 16 hours straight is never easy, but I got use to it. The most enjoyable part was interacting with the customers because I'm a people's type of person."

good,While the culture in the department I was in (FSS).  It was really difficult to post out to obtain other jobs within Chevron.  Also getting promoted was only available to favored candidates not due to their level of skill.

good,"loved interacting with a very loyal base of customers"

good,With so many engineering contractors at one time management had a lot of infighting that did not help the overall project. With that being said they had 7 years of work which was quite attractive with industry issues that were ideally suited with my skill set.
good,"Its Friendly management and working at chevron is enjoyable task. "

It is dangerous and has a limit of how much you can do, particularly when data is needed. Instead I would say “Information is power”. You can do more with acquiring the righty needed data."
good,"I enjoy working with my co-workers, and the owner is a very reasonable man, our customers make it wroth while coming to work."
good,"This was a business owned and run by my family, so some days could be extremely stressful, while others were very enjoyable. Just like any other family business"
good,"My personal experience was not a good one. The ""Chevron Way"" by some management was just talk. Overall it is a good company but in our present economy there were definitely challenging times."
good,"Chevron has grown into a company that has become so bloated with unnecessary staff that it has become nearly as inefficient as the government. Its as though one hand does not have a clue what the other hand is doing. "
good,"very busy and challenging contract ...but well worthwhile the effort with job satisfaction."
good,I learned about time management and tight deadlines. The ability to also interface with high level management and external stakeholders/
good,I really enjoyed working there. because I like customer care and interacting with people and solve there problems. management was really cooperative. I am a team worker and I enjoy working with co-workers.
good,"Chevron is overall a great company and I hate that I have been laid off."
good,enjoyed the hours that I worked early mornings and still had the rest of the day to  enjoy. learn how to deal with customers and doing payments In  a hurry. I also enjoyed working with other staff members.
good,"Chevron provided myself with a 6 year career that i worked up to a supervisor from an entry level field position, but just as fast as i got hired i was laid off due to corporate downsizing. Chevron as a whole is a very well structured company that does provide very competitive benefits."
good,"Overall Chevron is a great company to work for, I have enjoyed my time there. Of course due to the nature of the Oil and Gas Industry employment demand is cyclical."
good,"Awesome place to work, nice customers and employees, the only con is on certain day you have to work alone and there is no lunch break and if you didnt have money to purchase food in the store you could go up to 12 hours without eating"
good,"It was a great work environment at the location I worked at , We were a family . I advanced fast with my employer , got lots of responsibilities and trust from her. Unfortunately Chevron had alot of changes and we were all laid off . Hardest  part of the job was the drunk customers . Always had regular customers it felt like a place of home in the location I worked at ."
good,had 5 years of management experinced. Great leadership skill
good,There are daily meetings with operations at the field office. The management is experienced and provide focus. The hardest part of the job was getting access to the information that was required to perform my project.
good,"learned a lot about retail,good customer service,enjoyed meeting new people"
good,"Pretty tough place to work  but I learned a lot. "
good,"Co-workers and management were good, lots of work stayed very busy during the days"
good,"its a nice place to work, they treat you with respect. the manager is iffy. co workers are nice."
good,Chevron is always finding inovated energy sources to produce emerging resources not just in oil and nations but also through technology
good,"This job was a part time position, overall customer support"
good,"Clock in, inspect station, daily paperwork, cashier reconciliation, fill safe, order inventory, pump compliance, break cashier, cleaning loops, interact with customers. Back stock, health compliance. Check emails, daily report outs"
good,"A typical work day consisted of logging into the phones and the computer. Documenting and tracking all of the technical support issues that we would receive throughout the country regarding the leased POS systems from the different Chevron and Texaco stations. Most of the issues were fairly simplistic and could be handled in a matter of minutes, however the more difficult issues would usually end with some piece of hardware going bad and would require dispatch for hardware replacement."
good,"well organized, very friendly manager and coworkers. but minimum wage."
good,A place to work if you need a job but not a career.
good,Great fast paced enviornment with great customers. The enviornment for a small business does have some room for advancements.
good,"Chevron is the number 2 oil company in the U.S. It has over 5,000 employees in California, over 50,000 employees globally. The company has a very stable portfolio. It's very hard to get promoted if you are a non-salaried employee."
good,"i would open shift do inventory count money,i learned alot there worked mostly by myself.the hardest thing was when customers would forget to put back the gas line and they would take off ripping the hose off which it would be a pain because i would have to handle it alone the most enjoyable part was when the regulars would come in they would make my day."
good,Its a lot of fun serving customers and see them happy leaving the station.
good,The management I slayed back and really work with you on your hours. Could always use more money but it pays okay for a gas station. Not really a busy place.
good,"Chevron demands excellence and outstanding performance. That is difficult to achieve every single day. You are constantly compared to peers and there is a lot of crony-ism. That being said, it depends on the department you are in. For the most part pay and benefits are excellent and the company is a great place to work, if you can take the stress."
good,"Overall Chevron is a rewarding place to work with decent pay. Compared to some competitors, the pay is a little lower; however, the atmosphere is a bit more relaxed and less cut throat than some competitors. Generally, the work-life balance is good if you make your needs known. The company is a bit behind the times with flexibility on working remotely, but the nature of the business does not allow for that for many operations roles."
good,Good chance for starters. Changing environments with uncertainty. Using contractors is what they aim to get things done more tan their own employees. Still
good,"What i learned most from this job was working at a fast pace and working with different types of costumers. Many times in the morning they wouldn't  be in a great mood, so we needed a lot of patience."
good,"The hardest part of the job freezer"
good,i really enjoyed working there. i loved my customers and being a part of the community.i wish the owners and the company well and hope for their continued success.
good,Enjoy working with the people and the customers . The  owner is  nice  and supportive.  We are all like family.  The customers are nice once you know.
good,"When I started at Chevron, the current employees were friendly and very helpful on training me and showing me how to operate the registers and restocking."
good,My Job in chunchula Al from 2007-2014 came to end due to change in Company I very much.enjoyed working there. I learned a lot and had a steady pay. It had easy commute from home and I hated to see it end.
good,"Work culture was the most amazing experience I have encountered. I got to know my co-workers as more than co-workers. Here at this Chevron we all have been like family and the work experience was just an added extra. The work wasn't devious, rather simple as long as one had scheduled their tasks"
good,Good work. Good hours .  have a good time even thos you will have the same shift and hours for ever .  no ways to go up in the company unless its after 30 years of working there.
good,"a typical day at work, it was complicating, stressful but sometimes it was relaxed. the job was hard, hands on and you learn as you go. you got to meet new people and deal with different attitudes and different learning experience"
good,if U are a team player go for it. If u I ant advancement apply your self. Overall the company is well worth working for.  Always maintain clean environment. As well as excellent customer service.
good,"Great outdoor work experience.  A little nerve-racking at first since I was new to this trade and surrounded by hazardous oil/chemical production equipment.  But thanks to great trainers, mentors, and supporting staff, it made the job a lot easier during my time with the company."
good,"I liked most of the people I worked with and the work was challenging. My team lead was a good listener and helpful to me and others."
good,"I liked the manager I had there. He ran a tight ship and expected a lit from his employees and he always gave a lot more."
good,"Like to work there all the workers are good company."
good,My time at Chevron was good for what it was. They took care of me and I did make some good friends while there. Overall it's a good place to work and I did enjoy working there.
good,"I have more than 18 years experience in the fuel industry, from a site manager for the then Texaco in the UK to my most recent position as maintenance and construction specialist for the last 8 years with Chevron in South Africa."
good,Wonderful place to work but there are no Advancement and there are no Benfits.it was a privately own store.but the owner. She was great .had a wonderful schedule .
good,"Like any other cashier job just wasn't enough pay. ........................., it's okay job college student nothing full time good experience customer service skills."
good,"The place where one can learn gain knowledge, how to be punctual in time and work. "
good,for a brief period i left chevron and the manger was still clocking me in and out and cashing the check. i would work the night shift and my relief would be up to an hour or two late.
good,A very safe place to work. Safety in the workplace is observed and work-life balance is promoted. Challenging work with opportunities to deal with people outside the country
good,A good place although the refinery is somewhat old. I enjoyed my time there. Everybody is friendly and competent in getting the job done. Very challenging problems.
good,"It was a very relaxed environment. Lots of little tasks, none of them were hard though. My manager was great, you have a list of stuff that you need to do while you're on the job, but like I said, none of them were hard."
good,"not the best but good, its a regular job not to stay and live out of it just to help with your payments and every day life specially here in orange county"
good,"There are days that you can't even set for a minute to catch your breath. Then there are days that are so slow you are bored out of your mind. But there is always cleaning the shelves, keeping the pumps clean and stocked, cleaning the deli area if there is one.But most of all Team work is very important in places like this.It just helps everyone keep on a steady page and not just one or two people doing all the work."
good,A typical day at work involves team meetings and project related meetings. There is a robust training program for new employees and older employees are also given training opportunities but these need to be better tailored for their tasks and growth potentials. The workplace culture of Diversity and Safety are exemplary.
good,"The company values and promotes safety. It respects diversity and encourages work-life balance. "
good,"Too much racism at work place."
good,"people oriented but leadership roles are very limited"
good,I worked at Chevron for 1 year it was easy and almost all customers were friendly. I only left because I had to move. It was a great part time job but they only pay minimum wage
good,"Chevron as a whole company is a great company im sure, but the main and only one I'm really familiar with is my local gas station down the street. the employees are friends and its never a dull moment when you run in for a soda on your break. The owners and managers are great people who care."
good,"Chevron is too big to totally fail. However, the management in place is cutthroat and will never leave willingly. The typical day is stressful and over 10 hours."
good,Making sure the islands are stocked and cleaned. When slow front face products in the store. Work register when cashier needs a break. Learned to be a team player. And be self sufficient and find task when slow.
good,"The reason I say that my experience was scary is because I would usually work the graveyard shift and there were many creepy customers and I would be working alone with no security or no one watching for my safety. There was one incident that I had to contact the local police due to a domestic dispute happening right in front of the entrance to the shop. Although everything had settled down, I was still feeling a bit startled until the morning rush."
good,Its good to work at chevron because of friendlt environment and nice customers. The management is very helpful and supportive. I have learning a lot being with them.
good,You wont ever get your paycheck on time. And don't bother asking for it cause they'll tell you wait till next check or im not at the store and cant give it to you.
good,"depending on the shift, the pacing could either be hectic (morning shift) or extremely slow paced (night shift). The pay was low, but the management was extremely amenable."
good,Not too hard but not very fufilling after a year. Great temporary job for college kids. Simple work but there is job boards for growth within the company relevent experience may be required.
good,There was never a dead moment during the day. I was always doing something. The people were very friendly most of the time. It was a fun work environment.
good,Chevron is an excellent company to have worked for. People matter to them and there was a real atmosphere of togetherness. Management listened and actively sought feedback and input into most matters.
good,"Extremely large company."
good,"Job set great expectations in the productivity of staff.  Compensation was good, but benefits were sparse. Chevron is recognized positively worldwide for its professionalism."
good,"The Chevron is well organized company and I worked with the company consistently for almost 2 years. "
good,A typical day at chevron will be an active and faced environment. I learned how to do paper work and load money onto safe. The hardest part was dealing with rude customers. The most enjoyable time about chevron is getting over time once in a while.
good,Good company to work for but they are outsourcing their jobs to offshore now.  They are not looking at employee performance but the main focus is cost-cutting.
good,"Had a good time in Chevron, where we can have good work life balance. But coming to career advancement , it is not a best place."
good,"When I worked at this Chevron it was owned By A Young Asian Couple, that took care of there employees  and gave raises and bonuses. I left before the new owner took over"
good,Chevron offers amazing pay yet they lack career advancement if you're not already in management or non-operational roles. The working climate can get pretty political as well.
good,"To do one's task in accordance with the values and operational excellence of the company which are work with diversity and inclusion, high performance, customer focus, safety and work-life balance"
good,"I felt that I was given great opportunities to move up in the ranks of employment.  I started out as a graveyard shift team member and within 5 months was starting my training into the assistant management position and within a year, full store manager."
good,"Need improvement "
good,"A typical day at work was coming in and doing my count for cigarettes, lighters, lotto, etc. Then i would check to make sure the stock is kept up with and maintain cleanliness of the store while balancing customer friendly service."
good,Great Pay and benefits .. flexible work schedules available . Downside is they complete layoffs/ reduction in work force often. They offer great match on your 401k
good,"Chevron is a great company to get exposure and development in your career. It's a fast-paced, interesting environment to work. Major issue with developing experienced hires - the company culture appreciates what you did during your time at Chevron but forgets that you have skills that you brought with you outside of the company."
good,"A typical work day consists of being behind the register helping customers.  On times when there are no customers present you would go out and clean which helps pass the time.  Depending on the size of the store cleaning was easy.  Management was great and always worked with veterans around their schedule.  I learned a lot especially customer service skills, and management skills as well.  I would say the hardest part of the job would be dealing with rude customers.  Personally it happens all the time and it teaches you to be patient with people.  The most enjoyable would be getting to know people, and of course trying out different products that come to the store."
good,"I enjoy the team I work with. Great management. pay is less than desirable, but understandable for the turnaround rate here. super easy job. cleaning, money handling, light cooking. Frustrations because many items i find are expired and mngmt says its okay still. that the best by date is merely a suggested date. grosses me out."
good,"In the Safety space, Chevron is a leading company. I had the chance to work in many different places and cultures. Chevron supported me during my career, I've been working here since my 20s. Unfortunately, being an expat employee, turns to be difficult to find new assignments because of the cost."
good,"I had a good time working here, the customers knew me by name, and i always had their items ready for them. I was a hard working employee, and liked to work here."
good,Working at chevron was fine I enjoyed the customers and some of the coworkers seemed a little rude the management there was fine but I did seem like there was a lot of judgement going around
good,"A typical day included pumping gas for customers, washing windows, and cleaning the store. I learned how to operate a teller and how to stock the cooler. The management was good, helped every once and awhile. Hardest part was when it was super busy and was working alone. Most enjoyable was when it was slow and working with someone else."
good,"Chevron provides a workplace full of diversity. As an employee you are exposed to a multitude of different cultures, personality types, and opportunities for learning."
good,"Always working on a challenging environment, i enhanced my learning especially on the safety side of doings thing around the workplace."
good,"Experienced the glass ceiling effect.  Overall, the people you work with at Chevron are great.  Unfortunately it is hard to get management to help in your career execration unless you are selected as a high pot employee."
good,"Management was excellent, just not enough hours. They said it was a part time job (24 hours). But on average got 15-20 hours a week. Would have worked long if full time was available."
good,"Good co-worker with lots of knowledge and experiences.  I would enjoy good conversation, and learning new objectives and project."
good,"Good management, cooperative team mates, update technology used, Good Business planning but poor in Employee Compensation and Benefit. Employee end benefit was not good, HR not professional and Employee friendly."
good,"Very good company I enjoy working for with amazing benefits, wonderful pay and excellent structure.  Truly the best company I have ever worked for."
good,"Chevron is a great company to work for, especially if you are in either the Houston office locations or at global HQ is San Ramon, CA. They have gone through several Resource Optimization Management processes (read staff reductions) in recent years, which can be very demoralizing, but these were efforts the company decided to make in order to remain profitable (continue to issue the stock dividend) in the current barrel of oil cost environment. It is what it is."
good,"A typical day at work is starting early, and greeting many different customers, and mostly regulars at the station, fueling their vehicles, and other things such as tire pressure and oil checks. I learned how to check tire pressure, and add air to a tire, properly and safely fuel a car, and check and top up oil in a car. The management are good, friendly and pretty reasonable. My co-workers are so friendly, and are always nice to me, and are willing to help whenever i need it. The hardest part of my job is when I have to work out in a busy rush by myself. Most enjoyable part is meeting new and familiar faces of customers I've met before."
good,"Caissier vendeur et chargé des achats  et entretien de la station  discount zone "
good,team members are normally more than willing to assist and guide new personnel. Expected to jump in and run from the start. Managers tend to have favorites thus making it somewhat hard to get advancement. Not all managers are suited for the position they fill.
good,My experience with Chevron was truly educational... They were always teaching us something new. Safety being the number one priority.
good,"developed and testing and installed many oil and gas systems.  did all the training for all the users, presented all new systems using PowerPoint."
good,There were some issues with particular employees but overall this was a decent place to work.  I started my management career here and enjoyed learning with hands on experience. This job inspired me to move forward with school and management experience.
good,"very poor project management, great benefits, good work environment, talented people, world class projects to work on, way too much attention to non productive activities"
good,"This was the best job with the highest pay and the most responsibility of the 9 job offers I received. They appreciated my work experience as a coop student and allowed me to take on as much responsibility as I wanted while learning about the company. The oil industry gives new graduates the opportunity to take complete responsibility for managing projects from analyzing problems; devising, designing & implementing solutions; hiring contractors; inspecting work on all levels and giving final approval of all work. This is a lot of responsibility & power so Chevron was very discriminating in their hiring practices."
good,"The company promotes an operational excellence culture, with remaining safe as a top priority. Computers are set to enforce micro breaks to reduce repeated stress injuries. Safety metrics are regularly promoted and incidents and possible causes circulated to raise awareness."
good,I appreciate the level of training I have received from this company. Some managers have been accommodating and willing to help you progress as an individual and others are no so accommodating. Overall good working experience and some smart individuals. The issue with this and all major corporations is there are a lot of people that should not be in this industry but they insist on working here for the money and benefits  and they tend to give the company a bad representation.
good,"Not much room for advancement if part time, management is usually horrible but great benefits if station is corporate. Very repetitive if working full time hours. Swing shifts are horrible but staff is usually great. Not much room to advance if working less than 32 hours. Do recommend working at a corporate store as oppose to a franchise."
good,"Friendly Working environment."
good,I will always treasure my career experience with Chevron.  Since my beginning as a Human Resources Inter until my last role as a Human Resources Business Partner.
good,"I enjoyed working for Chevron, and the people on my team were excellent.  Unfortunately, due to the oil price drop, many good people were laid off.  Chevron relies too much on production to stay profitable, while competitors like ExxonMobil are more diverse and still benefit from the downstream refining side, when production is stagnant."
good,"Fun place to work most days and nights generally nice customers, good co-workers, clean work environment, Good team manager and assistants, breaks when possible,"
good,"Work environment with customers bad city to work in, but overall it is a job and you have to maintain a schedule."
good,"Always work to do, Not hard just staying busy keeping everything organized and well keep. The most enjoyable part is working with colleagues and meeting new people."
good,"Managing all queries and complaints by members of the public. "
good,"good place to work but not sure of the pipe line future for chevron, chevron has sold a lot of there assets and I don't feel that they will keep onshore pipe line assets. good people work here and benefits are very good"
good,A typical day was greeting customers and receiving money for purchases of gas and products. I learned about gas products with great management. The co workers were great. There really wasnt nothing hard about the job. The most enjoyable part about it was working with the customers
good,"I am cashier ,I have flexible hours, I like the team work with other."
good,I really like the location because its super busy and always gives me lots to do. the customers always find a way to brighten my day. Over the years i have gotten to know a few of them personally and make friends. The management is wonderful and always try to accomadate to our schedules.
good,"It was an enjoyable work environment with good people as a rule, however I found it too rigid in corpaorate terms.  there were those that would ""get in your way"" to promote themselves."
good,"A typical day would involve meetings to discuss the required output for the day."
good,"During each shift, we start out by doing an inventory of cigarettes, counting the till to make sure it matches reports and a quick inspection of the store.  On an average day, I process an average of 200 customers per shift.  Throughout the shift, I perform tasks that need to be completed before end of shift so that the next shift does not have to do more than their share of chores."
good,"come in and start filling cars then start cleaning while waiting for customers trying to fill time while waiting for cars to come "
good,"Strong safety culture. "
good,"You have to be flexible with everything at this job. You get all types of customers from the homeless to the richest. Rude customers, friendly customers, annoying, and all types of personalities will affect your work with all customers so you have to be flexible to succeed at that job. The hardest part is keeping up with the pace and your coworkers. Some might be lazy. The management was good and gave me a raise for being one of the best employees. No benefits for anything."
good,"I truly enjoyed work for Chevron.  I learned a lot about the oil industry, safety and working relationships.  The hardest part of the job has been moving on to other projects and leaving co-workers behind.  The most enjoyable has been starting new projects and watching them develop and grow."
good,"I loved my experience working with Chevron. My managers were always willing to help with any situation, and most of my coworkers were great to work with. I learned a lot about how people are and how a business is run. I was also able to sharpen up my communication and customer service skills."
good,Great company but many job cuts as well so find yourself the perfect position.. possibly accounting.  They've pretty much stayed on board since the beginning.  Super nice and knowledgeable people.
good,"At chevron, I was the only instrument Engineer working on their Major Isomax TA. I had to make sure all the 75 TA WOs get scoped and engineered correctly. I had a lot interactions with Chevron Contractors and provided supervision for their work. Completed multiple TA workorders during my time with Chevron. I enjoyed working with the TA group. Chevron had a productive environment which helped me grow my knowledge in the field of instrumentation."
good,A typical eight hour day would be from stocking shelves and cleaning up the store to take care of customer transactions and customer inquiries.
good,"Started at a very early age but advanced to assistant manager just before starting University."
good,Great balance; strong leadership.  No advancement for contractors
good,"Chevron is a good company and treats people fairly. It can be stressful at times, great schedule in 9/80 and great care for people in fitness breaks and ergo reviews and a safety culture"
good,"Chevron is a great Company to work for. It is very mature in all processes and policies. It is a global company that uses the value of diversity and applies it effectively to the business. "
good,Many meetings on a daily basis. Meet with individuals to gather all information needed to send up to management. review many spreadsheets and create power point presentations in what we are currently working on and what is expected.
good,Enjoyed working with many people in Chevron from different departments. Handled their visas or passports. Coordinated the process and organized the organization of which visa or passport to get in time for their travel date. Updated clients with new visa requirements. I learned working on short time frames with people that were traveling on such short notice.
good, First job I had. Arranged through school. Got to meet a lot of people. Learned more about cars worked under three owners. Left from under last owner was not good to his employes.
good,"great company, cut some people and made us run around crazy. 2 IT techs to cover 1200 users."
good,Tyipcal day at work would be customers service with a smile at a fast paced. I  have learn more skils in computer an about different products   management is on shcedule and organizated.  co worker are very friendly and will assisted with any help needed. 
good,"I have good time working with these companies, good work environment."
good,"A typical day at chevron is all about the customers. Ringing in all sales at the cash register, giving directions, full service gas station, maintaining cleanliness of store, keeping coffee pots full, stocking selves, keeping track of inventory and balancing the till at end of shift"

good,"Management very helpfull and concerned about employees. If there is a problem, management is careing and willing to listen and help to resolve any problems"
good,Typical day at work is review data for Procure to Pay and provide report to management. Data analysis is part of core job.
good,"Make sure everbody makes it to work on time,place order's for the store,just make sure the station runs smoothly with no problems.If there are problems i fix them."
good,I have learned more and better customer service skills because you never know what type of customer you will come in contact with from day to day. The management staff was and is okay no complaints. The hardest part of my job was the walk-in cooler. What I enjoyed the most was the customers.
good,"The nights were long, but with the right coworkers it can be fun. A neighborhood gas station. You will see the same customers through out the day. Low maintenance and honest work. Great manager he is very funny and the owner is really nice and understanding. Just do your job and you'll have no problems."
good,"Great place to work. I worked there for 30yrs before retiring. They offered flexibility work schedules.  I worked a 4/10 while I was there.  Benefits were outstanding.  Jobs in IT were being moved to Houston, TX, so I retired"
good,"Chevron is actually a wonderful company to work with, they have good safety culture which in turn protect the life of all employees and contractor working in the company."
good,"Overall a good place to work, Flight Technician average about 12-14 days  away from home."

good,"Keeping busy through the night cleaning stocking, and serving the customers as best as I could, helped make the night go fast."
good,I enjoyed my time at Chevron I learned how to prioritize and get things done in a timely manner. I learned a lot about problem solving with customers and work related issues.
good,Worked there nine years until merger with Gulf Chevron in 1985 stayed on working in Records Management to transfer records to California and took Severance Package offered with tenure retirement benefits included
good,The people culture is positive.  The IT environment is very challenging as it has been outsourced.  Data can be hard to get to.  Management seems fair but a bit distant at times.
good,"Chevron believes in employee development, and management will load you with all that you can handle.  It is not a place you will become bored working at.  "
good,"Positive experience.  Collaborative environment, very safety orientated.  Employment is dependent on circumstance beyond your control if you are a contractor."
good,"Get to meet all kinds of travelers, good first job or part time job while going to school or looking for a career. Helps teach good work ethic and responsibilities."
good,"Although Chevron is a global company, since the downturn, it's become very difficult to get positions overseas, and upwards mobility has all but stopped."

good,"Attend customers and handle currency. Maintain area clean. Aware of customers entering and exiting. Dealing with rude customers often but able to overcome them with kindness, no matter the situation."
good,"Best company I worked for."
good,Staff was very friendly and management was always helpful with carrying out tasks. This was a temporary job as I applied for college but soon had to move right before the gas station closed down
good,This company is known for being straight-forward with how it functions.  Everyone is mostly very serious and there isn't opportunity for team building. Employees are very serious about projects they work on.
good,"Working for Chevron Corporate was amazing!  I loved my job, and I enjoyed learning new things about the industry.  Being that I've worked Upstream and Downstream as well as handled Midstream, I have been able to utilize my experience from each area with each area.  Management couldn't be better at all locations that I've encountered at Chevron; however, the selection of team leaders in one area has caused Chevron to lose valuable resources in employees who have gone on to other areas or different organizations.  This single experience should not have been an issue as management was not informed until after the fact (after many left the department or company).  One individual's fears of being replaced caused discomfort for those of us who are always willing to go above and beyond for the department and the organization, but those fears caused them to provide false reports and unnecessary complaints to management."

good,"Chevron is a good company to work for. The company truly believes in promoting a safe environment. The work is manageable. The people are great.

good,Enjoyed working in this fast paced environment. Great customer service is a plus. Always greeted the customer's with a smile which would help my day go by so much easier!
good,"The Bosses and the employees were very friendly and in some cases caring . I loved coming to work everyday , and made some of the best friends at this job ."
good,"Chevron focuses advancement in only development Programs...so , If you are not part of a development program , then it will be very hard for advancement"

There is also a car wash at this location, which needs to be maintained and cleaned as well as repaired on occasion."

good,"safety culture is very important, flexible work schedule such as 9/80,  the most enjoyable part of job is the diverse work force, co-workers are easy to get along"
good,"Chevron Energy Solutions was the energy services division of Chevron Corporation.  A great part of my job function was managing the schedule of the President which required prioritizing the requests from staff for his time while meeting all critical corporate functions.  Another important aspect was to utilize his travel time optimally.  My favorite part of the job was organizing special events such as the annual Holiday Party, Town Hall lunches and the annual Giants Game."
good,A great place to work. Because I have taken care of sick parents their work/ life balance system is great. They allowed me to come in late and leave early. My co-workers were very warm and welcoming.
good,"Co-workers were very friendly, everyone got along with each other, I learned how to cook different types of food, the hardest part on the job was the pressure when the line would get extra or when a customer could not make up their mind on what they wanted to eat."
good,"I didn't get one Project to do! It wasn't mentioned during the interview that an External Company handled their projects."
good,Excellent place to work. Great atmosphere and friendly coworkers. The work is challenging and rewarding. Office spaces are well furnished.

You are off every other Friday.  401k is matched at 4-1 up to 8 percent of salary.  They have a lot of smart people that are willing to share knowledge. Of course their are always some exceptions!!"

good,"I have completely enjoyed my time working at Chevron.  This is a place that most people come to stay, countless individuals with 10-35 yrs with with company and they are happy to be there.  I have really enjoyed the culture and the people I have had the opportunity to work with."
good,"No place is perfect and there is always room for improvement.  I wish the company focused more on people development. I've been with the company since 2007.  Overall, I can't complain."

good,"- A typical day at Chevron involved daily safety meeting, meetings with drilling & completions teams for well updates, entering well information into company database and looking up well information in the company database, liaising with senior engineers and finance department for various tasks assigned,"

good,"Great benefits and nice people!"

good,Work day went pretty fast. 9/80 schedule. Good environment. Still currently working.
good,"A typical day at work was not only serving the people but also enjoying their friendship and having fun listening to their stories."
good,"A typical workday consisted of going to work and sitting around for work, most days.  Management was o.k, there could've been some improvements in the professionalism department.  I did not learn anything exciting while working for this company.  My co-workers was a barrel of laughs on a daily basis, very great people to work with.  The hardest part of my job was waking up at 4:30 in the morning to get a close park to the gate."
good,"Management at chevron was not very good. the management, would not care if your child was sick and you had to take them to the hospital if you called of you were fired. management was not very fair to employees nor customers."
good,"Chevron has a great work life balance they offer a 9/80 schedule which is wonderful since you have every other Friday off  (great for 3 day weekend trips). Everyone is professional and great to work with, nice campus with a gym and full Starbucks on site. What I would change is making it a more fun environment, it's a bit stiff. Also as a contractor you never know when you'll become a permanent employee you can go years as a contractor so you don't have the same benefits as permanent employees."
good,"daily responsibility to monitor, troubleshoot and manage network and security incidents which includes LAN,WAN,firewall (ASA),Routing,switching,Voip,and cabling."
good,Chevron Real Estate Services is a group that understands the individual who puts in the effort and is rewarded for their efforts
good,This was one job I won't forget about. Because I was living in Hawaii when I worked here it was cool because you got to know your surrounding very well. You to know what you were dealing with very quickly.
good,"Diverse culture, gives priority to the welfare of the employees, fun and young environment."
good,"Chevron is great. They have a safety culture that you take home with you and it grows on you. Sure, people think you are nerdy for being a safer person outside of work but, you really see the difference in how you perform daily tasks. The benefits for Chevron employees are beyond. I cannot begin to mention how great the employees are treated. However, if planning on working with Chevron, be sure that if you are working as a contractor, that the company you are contracted has the same beliefs. Otherwise, you will find yourself in a conflicting workplace where Chevron says one thing that makes sense, and your contractor says another that would conflict with Chevron ways. I would suggest applying directly with Chevron before accepting offers from certain companies contracted to Chevron."
good,"Get to meet new people everyday is exciting. I learned plenty from workplace like cash handling, full service, and maintenance. Co-workers are a good team-players. Hardest part of the job is when I have to do full service during mid winter time. Typically point directions for people."
good,Chevron is a good company to work for. The hours can be very very long depending on your department. The co-workers are really nice.
good,I enjoyed working at chevron because the people were nice and made you feel wanted. Everyone had a job to do and we worked as a team.
good,"Routine everday work making coffee and some food items, cleaning and restocking merchandise."
good,"A typical day at work would be making sure the customer has a safe, and friendly experience while making purchases. I have learned patience, and the ability to multi-task in a way I never thought I could be capable. Management can often change, and with that change I had to learn to be flexible, and understanding. My co-workers were more than just co-workers, they were friends, and people that I would feel safe working with. The hardest part of the job is while following company policy, you can be put in a situation where people try to get you to compromise your integrity. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I was able to meet new people often. Those 'regular' customers become more than just that, they become a part of your Chevron family."
good,great people to work for. good food. nice accommodation. Get up at 4am. have breakfast and make crib. go to work. finish work. go home and shower and change. go to wet mess for you limit of 4 beers. go for tea. go to bed. Get up at 4am.........
good,it was a great experience and learn a lot people there was cooperative taught us alot. they were always supportive during the period of my internship.
good,Too much internal politics in company-owned stores which causes disgruntled employees (management included). Working for Chevron in a corporate setting would be a much better experience.
good,as a team member it is always to be good to work there. fast paced environment. management system was good and favorable. most enjoyable part was learning and developing business skills.
good,Chevron is a great place to work for if you are looking for flexibility in your schedule. The only downside is the pay can be lacking and there is little to no benefits.
good,"They employ and contract smart people, however, decisionmaking is slow due to the size, scale, and complexity of their organizational structure and legacy governance. This can make it difficult to progress against strategic goals at times. It is an exciting time to work or support Chevron as they continue to innovate in the back office and in the field. They are in the process of shifting towards a more Agile and Gig Economy culture so being flexible to adjust to continuous change is a plus. Every company has a good, bad and ugly side, however, my experiences as a consultant to Chevron have always landed on the ""good"" side."
good,Nice to be work here but pay rate is not good thats why i am searching for new job.It is very difficult to adjust my expenses on this rate.So thats why I am looking for new job.
good,"Chevron does really well with taking care of its employees, whether through generous compensation and benefits to making sure everyone is safe. Management does what it can to push decision making to where the information is, so there is not a sense of micromanagement. The main downside is the thought that, while the oil and gas products the company produces is used everywhere, that same use contributes to additional warming of the planet."
good,It was good environment but just never enough help. I helped customers and made sure every customer was taken care of and pleasured with there experience.
good,"Just your standard everyday environment pumping gas and customer service and cash handling while using a till.  stocking shelves with new inventory, food handling and cleaning throughout the day.  I applied for Assistant manager position and was turned down for the position, so applied for Disneyland to find my new career in custodial and possible new career path within Disney."
good,"I enjoyed working in Chevron because it provides Work life balance , good communication , good management and work site safety is very good. These help me to enjoy my work at Chevron."
good,"Good reasonable salary, great culture. Experienced on project based Gorgon LNG along with diversified team mostly temporary expatriates. Short period in corporate environment transitioning contracts from construction to steady state operations."
good,"good nature and productive, management is very good and care for employees.Employees are are friendly with others and staff is very good,friday is typical day to work"
good,My position was a typical customer service job. Workload was varied depending on how many customers came into the convenience store. Better compensation and company culture than I have previously experienced at a gas station job.
good,"Critical thinking - get data, analyse it, make forcasts, projections, advise project managers and cost centre owners."
good,"it was a great company. "
good,They were very productive when doing the job. They wanted things done fast and efficiently. Managment was very helpful if you had any questions regarding your next task in your job if you have finished everything else that was required to do.
good,Better management skills needed to run an already successful location once that is controlled there's a chance of keeping a better staff or set team yep
good,I got to know the locals very well plus many people and stories traveling through. Miss my team and will never forget all the memories made during my time working there.
good,"I loved working for this company. I would work for them again in the future, given the opportunity. I really do not have any complaints. They are a very good company to work for"
good,Employees are courteous and abide by Chevron values and safety culture. The management is respectful of employees and employees are encouraged to work hard but maintain healthy worklife balance.
good,"There was always something to do, with opportunities for advancement. Great atmosphere and easy to get along with customers and other employees. The one I worked at was in a good location with lots of businesses to boost gas station sales"
good,It was great to work there. If your in college it can work around your time at school. Management was good and customer friendly as well. Go work there if you need a good energy job
good,"Have fun until the job ended. Employee are good and helpful."
good,"This is a great company, with many areas to get into, if you are allowed.  It's easy to get silo'd off and not be able to move.  there are two times a year they do company wide career postings, but there is a process and your lead/manager can block you from moving.  And once you get to a certain level (technically), there is nowhere to go upwards because all the architect roles are filled and nobody ever leaves.  You have to ""know"" someone to  move up at a certain point.  Also, the appointment of people with no actual operations experience into architect roles happens. So then you get to deal with decision makers that don't even know what they are talking about.  The company is awesome, silos and reasons for placement don't make sense."
good,As a Project Manager there was a lot of work available and I was able to work on several long term projects.  I was able to make lasting friendships and never felt anything bad about the job.
good,"Great place to work"
good,"I enjoyed working at Chevron I learned alot about working with many different people. How to do fuel payments for truck drivers.  I think the pay should be more ,but I did work for a privately owned Chevron ."
good,Gained great work experience. Always a busy work place which is great to keep you occupied. Making sure the store in neat and clean is always a must. Along with keeping the bathrooms and outside clean.
good,The job that I was doing was delayed slightly but the safety culture was challenged by some contractor and quickly chevron reinforced the safety culture
good,I enjoyed the organized professional work environment. Great entry level job! lots of training and annual recertification training. Follow ups by the management during the year to make sure you understand the roles you are to perform.
good,It was ok at first just later on it became very stressful to work because of the people around not wanting you to advance. Also hours would be changed due to people it showing up.
good,"I enjoyed my career with Chevron, the management cares about the employees and value family time. Had I not been laid off, I would still be employed there."
good,The job was cool but very boring at times. When there is not a lot of work to do I can really be painful but the manager was great and helped me to enjoy my time there.
good,"Simply put, the couple who owned the stations I worked at were the best owners and managers ever. They were friendly, flexible, and cared about their employees. They are big part of the reason why I've been able to live on my own and keep attending school with minimal interference. The people and community there are tight-knit and supportive, something that's hard to find in other jobs of similar nature. This was the placed were I learned all my best customer service skills, till and cash flow management, and site security procedures. Customers were always the hardest part of the job (dealing with various levels of deluded entitlement) but knowing that the team has your back takes a huge amount of the stress off."
good,"Most enjoyable part is getting to talk to many different people traveling, getting to hear where people are heading. hardest part is staying up since i work graveyard."
good,"I was always treated very well. very modern, forward thinking organisation with an outstanding care for safety. Good work life balance and easy going staff who let you get the job done."
good,"It a easy job, easy to learn  there’s not any benefits which sucks and you will get called in randomly. If you want a job that works you this is the place"
good,I was hired just after graduating college. I had no experience but received on the job training just as all other new hires did. Extremely safety focused and respect for following environmental regulations.
good,"I worked here and made many great friends, including the CEO. "
good,"The job is overall very easy, typically customers will come in one by one and sometimes small groups. I've learned how to talk to customers. The management is fine as the hours are pretty flexible. The hardest part of the job has to be difficult customers. The most enjoyable is the easy-going nature of the job"
good,Good Company to work for and work environment. The company cares about the employees well being (work pace breaks) and are flexible with family emergencies.
good,"Chevron es una gran compañía donde es un orgullo trabajar, aprender, tener ánimos de continuar y crecer. Difícil para ascender y difícil en el trato que dan a sus empleados. Aunque un ambiente de alto nivel, el manejo de información y trato a sus empleados suele ser complicado y no siempre en concordancia con las políticas internas."
good,Helping customers making sure the gas station was in working order and neat. Making sure food was at good temperature and gas pumps were neat I did learn how to operate a cash register for gasoline and how important it is to scan lottery tickets properly
good,"boa empresa, com muitas oportunidades de crescimento"
good,A strong company policy but very hard work and very high expectations sometimes exceeding the allowed tools granted to management. The hours allotted for work were less than needed for company image requirements.
good,"Good place to start your career. Learned a lot from peers and elder colleagues. Workplace culture is productive, although decision making can be slow sometimes."
good,cant say much about this company as im work just 3 months based on contract. in 3 months not much i can learn there. just the office environment is nice for me. a good place to work.
good,"Start at 5am with the emails to see where we've got major issues and concerns"
good,"working environment is very nice. colleagues are nice enough. they have flexible working hours policy.  good management. a typical day at work is meeting, meeting, meeting..."
good,"Slow paced, I learned a lot but was put to the side when I got my vehicle, no more learning just went off on my own. The management was good, he worked with us when we need something. The work culture was cut throat, people would tell on each other just for advancement. The most enjoyable  part is going around and interacting with the sub-contractors."
good,Chevron is a good company some can be better with improved management. Hours are sometimes long but needed. There is always an opportunity to come up into management positions
good,"Extraordinary place to work and develop your professional career. "
good,Good company to work for .chevron has good benifits and bonuses.chevron  has stricty  policy on safety and procedures.chevron is a company that also care about your family.
good,"Chevron is a wonderful company to work for, with great benefits, including retirement pension, and there are numerous opportunities to move around in the company."
good,I contracted for Chevron and was treated extremely well. They kept me working through the last down turn. Very grateful for the work and the relationships I made.
good,"Flex time, 9/80, cafeteria and gym in building. A room to relax if feeling sick. Employee appreciation twice a year. Sometime picnic or indoor"
good,"I enjoyed working at Chevron until January when I started to work with a new female manager who had a superior attitude towards me. She gave little by way of encouragement or career development and expected perfection. I have a reputation of excellent work however, when I started working for her it seemed that I could do nothing right. Consequently, after a lifetime of never being fired, I was released from my job with no warning."
good,"No stress in my daily work"
good,Highly collaborative and inclusive environment.  Values diversity as they sponsor 10+ internal diversity groups.  Safety first culture emphasizes security of all assets (including personnel). Excellent pay and benefits for the energy industry.

good,"Great place to work if you are an American."
good,Great company to work for. Corporate office in Midland very competitive and almost cut throat. That is pretty much why I retired. The environment at the Field level was much better and laid back. Everyone helping each other as much as they could.
good,"Work usually has its ups and downs, There is certain time frame where its fast paced and then its slow. If management is not fully staffed you are either left alone to work during busy hours and hardly get a set schedule."
good,"Never was there a time that there was not something (a project, daily work) to do.  It was easy to find things to keep me busy which is a must.  Sitting around with nothing to do is not for me, do not sit well at all."
good,"My time at Chevron was a great opportunity for me to grow in an industry where they are very diverse. It was a great starting point for me and I gained a lot of experience, work ethic, and love for customer service."
good,I did enjoy working here. Always 8 hour shifts and the management was very understanding of personal problems. You worked alone for most of the shift so having an independent mindset is needed
good,Chevron is a very solid company that has great potential to be a great place to work. It is a strong Engineering driven company for all types of engineers. There is not much growth opportunity for non-engineers.
good,"Best part about Chevron: Flex 9-80 Schedule. Having every other Friday off and the freedom to chose what time you arrived and left daily was amazing."
good,"great with customer it was like family in this chevron. had a great boss, and lets us learn different department beside our own area.he company i work for was fun but didnt like the hours at night"
good,"Chevron believes in the advancement of your career."
good,"I had a wonderful experience in chevron, my supervisor was great his supervisor was wonderful. My co workers were friendly and if needed a shift changed other employed were willing. If you wanted overtime you could cover other people and their shifts. It had great pay and benefits"

good,"work day starts 8 am "
good,"Coworker relationships are the most important part of working here (they really don't care how well you do your job as long you can play nice). The benefits are good, and the work/life balance is revered (except during S/D season). As with any large company, politics can be exhausting, and the 'Good Ole Boys' system is still as strong as it was in the 1960s."
good,"Working in the field as an HES field supervisor was one the best experiences that I had so far."

good,I am so grateful I have had the opportunity to retire from this company.  It has afforded me a means to pursue what I have always wanted to do.  The days were demanding.  I learned how to be tough and developed a tough skin.  I learned to be flexible and go with the flow.  The hardest part of the job was the increased productivity with ever diminishing resources.  This alone stretched my creativity.  I learned to be effective and efficient.
good,It was a good place to learn and interact with people. It was a nice learning experience how to handle the store with the help of co-workers.
good,Chevron has been a great experience for me.  It is a very collaborative work place and provides ample of opportunity for growth.

good,"CSI, Chevron Stations Inc. is a good company to work for. CSI is helping me pay for my school. CSI has great benefits. It's retail."
good,"Great Company but rotated CEO position too Quickly."
good,Chevron is a good company to work for. A typical day at Chevron is 9 to 12 hours long depending on if you are working out of the office or in the field. While working there for 10 years I did learn that they have a commitment to diversity but the atmosphere is very political. If you are not on the inside with management then you could get dropped from the organization. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the management egos and bias. The most enjoyable part of the job was traveling around the world and learning about different cultures
good,"Good company, treat you well. Shame about the downturn in the Industry due to oil price fluctuations. Other than that, would be a good company to work for."

good,I enjoyed the differences between the standard ABU processes and the Capital Project processes. Compressed Working Weeks (CWW) were fantastic.
good,The daily function would include arriving early at the office because my shift starts at 7am. Taking calls from customers for order placement is priority and normally we would be 4 staff members on duty. The next shift would start at 8am and our duties are divided amongst the staff members. The thing that I have learned is that being a team player is essential to a well oiled team. If everybody in the team pulls their weight that there is less room for error. At times you also need to work independently which is one of my strong points. Management within my department is fair and work with staff to maintain our Service Agreements. The hardest part of work is the workload when there is absentee-ism. We have extensive training so there is not a lot of issues. What I enjoy about my work is the ability to express yourself and the in-house training that is provided to improve myself.

good,"Controlling certain parts of the units,running lab samples, and maintaining a clean work environment.I leaned how to multitask on a much larger scale between three different process units.

Peaches is a very slow convenience store that relied on travelers from the interstate. There were only three associates that worked at the store other than the store owners. We worked as a team."

All my  boses are friendly nature and it encourage me to work more.
good,"we were slopping naphta and we did i did all the lines with the help of the team, so for a few minutes the console operator couldnt read any flow. We had to reverse the move and do a check of what went wrong? what we may have done wrong? what possibilities are there? what is the tempereture implications etc? we learned that we should do a harzard assessment before initiating any task to check for any devitians that may arise due to change of conditions. Management created a safety moment and filed the report for learning purposes. The team was very supportive as well. It became hard when we had to reverse the move but the fact that we had valid reasons of what we thought went wrong was the great part."
good,"I like working for Chevron. The pay, career development and education assistance are all great reasons to work for Chevron. In order to do well here, you must own your career and actively seek new opportunities."

The hardest part of the day was counting inventory.  I enjoyed interacting with my co-workers and customers.
good,"Over my 6+ years here at Chevron I have come to love most of the people I have worked with (there's always a few bad apples). Very smart, caring, fun co-workers.

good,Chevron allows me to perform my duties independently. It's nice meeting people from all walks of life every day. It's part time but the pay versus the excitement make it worhwhile.
good,"It's always a busy day working at a gas station you're management but you also do plenty of other tasks like stock the cooler, clean restrooms, take out the outside trash, assist customers and resolve customer complaints. Its a team effort so the store could look great at all times since we do have quarterly inspections. Quarterly inspections also have a plus to it because depending on your districts score and facility score that adds up your quarterly bonus. "
good,"My shift was a graveyard, so graveyard does most of the maintenance and stocking. I learned how to time manage my priorities in duties. Even though I was the only employer on the clock, time went by really quick towards the morning part of my shift(breakfast/making the coffee). The workplace was very easy going, a calm area but there were a few interruptions at night but nothing too crazy where I had to call the cops.  The most enjoyable part of working here was the friendly staff and the fact that I had very little supervision. Of course, there are cameras rolling all the time."
good,This is the first of its kind to be built for a refinery.  The concept is interesting and would be of great benefit to the refinery industry when successfully completed.

The days get busy at the station but there is a day where its calm and quiet. The manager was easy to work for, I've never had an issue with them. The hardest part would have to be not knowing what kind of person your going to be dealing with that day. It can be hard to deal sometimes but you have to learn to just stay calm and professional."

Large company and feels like it, painfully slow to get things taken care of.  Very Saftey oriented. Permiting paperwork is excessive, paperwork could be more streamlined. "
good,"I have utmost respect for Chevron and they have offered me the most amazing experiences in my 13 years. However, I feel Chevron is losing their way.  Corporate leadership (meaning Houston) is becoming short sighted and not building good mid-level management for sustainability.  Everything is about what is happening today, and the mid-level managers are thinking of their own survival instead of what is good for Chevron.  Disgusting, considering the amazing, committed people working in the trenches globally."

good,"Chevron corporate is a fantastic organization to work for overall, however depending on the Operating Company you work directly for career advancement opportunities may be severely limited. Because of the structure of the company some Operating Companies inside Chevron offer the full Chevron experience and work hard on employee development and include a solid process for advancement in place or into other roles, while others don't. You can have the exact same job being done in two different operating companies with a big difference in pay and promotion opportunities which can be very frustrating."

It was extremely busy and it was tough trying to keep up with everything since I was a new employee. However, my coworkers and my boss were very encouraging and they helped me out a lot with adjusting to everything and they helped me too learn very quickly with what I had to do day in and day out."
good,"I started this job going into college and planned for it to be part time.

good,Cost structure is high. Chevron misses out on opportunities because the economics are poor because of the high cost structure. Recent moves by management are getting the cost structure more in line with the rest of the industry.
good,"Through the various training and assignments, you quickly develop a broad set of technical experiences to help you tackle projects with an increasing level of challenge, risk, and cost. What makes Chevron enjoyable are the people you work with on a daily baisis and the network you establish over the years.

good,Management has always been open to helping employees advance and learn more about the industry. Good schedule and good benefits.

I motivate others to learn and improve their performance by my energy and ability to engage them, resulting in higher retention and ultimately greater performance.

Waking up and going to chevron was always a pleasure. I learnt to meet deadlines to be organized as an individual. The management was very tough in order to get things done. my co-workers were always competition to me but would never be my match but we communicated well . the hardest part of the job was when the company failed to meet a clients deadline of supply and i had to be the one to keep the client smiling sometimes i would win and sometimes i would loose and that really got me worked out i am not a good looser . the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting targets .

good,"Working at chevron was always a busy day at work. With constant flow of customers needing to fill up the gas tanks a well as their stomachs we always had to make sure the heated hot and ready food was up to food safety standards. The Hardest part of the day was when the big work rush comes in for their coffee, gas, bathroom breaks and making sure everything is stocked and the customers in line are helped in a timely fashion. What i enjoyed the most is when you i got all my work done before my shift is over without having to rush at the end to finish my shift paper work."

good,Chevron has a broad variety of people and assets that an individual can be exposed to and learn from to advance his/her career as well as become a more productive team member and asset to the company. Since hiring on with this company I was able to learn about SCADA control systems that I had not been exposed to before hiring on with them.
good,"I worked for Chevron 23 years and this has been my only job since I graduated from college. This is a good indication on how much I enjoyed working with this company. Despite the massive lay off that I was part of it, I am grateful of the work experience I gained during my time."
good,Chevron is a great place to work. The management is supportive and my co-workers were a real pleasure to work with day in and day out. Chevron believes in a work/life balance and it shows. The hardest part of the job is keeping abreast of all the internal processes. As in any oil company job security is an issue. The recent downturn in oil prices has caused many layoffs.

good,While attending collage I worked in the Pascagoula Refinery as an intern for 12 weeks. It was a positive experience. People were friendly and I enjoyed  working with them.
good,"My time at Chevron as a contractor was quite rewarding and mostly free of stress. We worked in teams so there was frequent communication and projects were always finished quickly and efficiently. Everyone was quite good at their job but had a friendly, casual attitude which made for a pleasant working environment. We were free to come in to work and leave as we needed so long as we met the required number of hours that week. However, as a contractor I did not receive salary, vacation time, sick time, or health insurance. I had been hoping to be hired onto the company full-time and was told that it would happen eventually, but unfortunately the company needed to minimize costs by letting go of certain employees and not renewing contractors. Safety is a major concern with the company, and while procedures could often slow down the amount of work we could complete I always felt safe and we had no incidents at our location. Overall, I very much enjoyed my time with Chevron."
good,"Chevron Richmond is an amazing place to work. /they have lots of career opportunities. As an operator, you will have to deal with swing shifts and 12 hour work days. If you can handle that and the occasional immature personalities that exist, you will do great here."

good,My job was hard but enjoyable.  Sometimes I had to get rough with an employee that was slacking in their job but most of the time things went smooth.

good,"A typical day at a gas station was easy yet tiring because I would usually work alone for half the shift or almost all of it. At the start of my shift, I can expect to have a long line of customers who are all in a rush; duties that include cash handling to stocking the cooler, facing, filling propane and of course janitorial work. Throughout my time working here, I learned and grew a lot as an individual. This job taught me the different types of people you have to deal with, how to use a EPOS system, filling propane to fixing the car wash. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unreliable co-workers. I didn't mind because I loved working, however it does get frustrating when they show up a few hours late or never show up leaving me on duty for 16+ hours without a notice. However, the most enjoyable part of the job for me was the customers. As everyday passes, you normally tend to see a lot of the same faces and sometimes new ones; getting to know these customers and building a friendly relationship with them was the one thing that kept me wanting to stay at work for hours and hours. Talking to different people from all sorts of age groups had to be the best part of the job because you get to learn more about life and how the world goes on."
good,"A normal day would consist taking on and executing great customer service and building relations with the people who are in our society. I learned from a business stand point  on the ups and downs of managing or owning a gas station and what it takes to run one,with the help of management and ownership,as of my coworkers we challenged our selves everyday to complete the task as fast and organized to be able to take care of customers when they are having questions. I enjoyed most was the learning experience and a opportunity to working for a wealthy company."

good,"I have to say that my eight years working with Chevron was a very positive experience. The company has a practice of taking care of their employees, and making sure that they have the career opportunities that they desire. One my most enjoyable parts of my job has been to work with younger, less experienced geologists and to show them concepts and techniques that they might not have learned before. I would say that the hardest part of my work in the last three years was being seconded to the Venezuelan government oi company (PDVSA), where there was an extremely intense political environment in their management, and a certain amount of animosity for the north Americans. However, on a personal basis, the people were much more friendly."
good,Love the company and benefits and the training program is good too. Every now and the the management would be a bit pushy but that happens with every company you work for so it's really no big deal. The pay was great too! No real complaints.
good,"A typical  day at work was busy; steady and upbeat. Working at Chevron I learned alot, being my first job, it taught me patience and how to work the register and many other portals. The hardest part of my job was being able to multi task when everything was busy and chaotic but, once I learned to handle this, being busy became the best part of the day. I enjoyed being under the pressure. Another part of my job that I found most enjoyable, was getting to meet all kinds of different customers from all over the country.

Our Manager was more than willing to work with us on our individual schedules, but the corporate office gave him a lower budget than he could use to keep the overtime down.

I learned more about the hazards that come with working at a gas station and improved my overall knowledge of the gas industry. My co-workers were very enjoyable to work with and we got along well. At this specific position, team work wasn't necessarily number one priority and you stuck to your designated tasks unless requiring to do otherwise.

good,"Not enough staff, I felt vilified when I had to go to the hospital in an emergency because there was no one to cover my shifts. Otherwise it was a good job, friendly staff, guaranteed shifts every week. After a while it felt like I couldn't go any further though, no benefits, no salary, no raises or better job titles."
good,Loved working here except the manager was a jerk.  Nobody liked him because he was always very rude  when he talked to his employees.  Favored certain workers
good,"owners were very nice but did not offer any benefits or opportunities to move up within the company. No extended time off, no insurance. Pay was great!"

good,"There is alot of favoritism, no place for advancement at all. The people that are there as management aren't going anywhere. Not as concerned about safety as they should me. They tend to sit and argue with customers instead of actually solving the issue. Drawers were never correct, because the safe was always off. If you weren't management you get sent home every day with anxiety that your drawer is short or over. Policies were not made clear about anything, so alot of associates wondering about what will and might happen. To many employees scheduled on one shift so it would lead to a lot of tripping over each other especially behind the register, alot of standing around, and still somehow managed to fail the health inspection."
good,I was responsible for pumping gas and filling propane tanks which was a learning was a learning experience I'm always open to learning new things
good,"Cashier, great customer and learn the register and help peoples, cleaning store. I enjoyed helping people and working with the public."

good,"Chevron is an outstanding place to work.  Everything about working there is all good.  The working environment, the advancement opportunities, the pay, everything.  I would highly recommend employment with Chevron, if you can get on.  The hiring practices are solid, but not necessarily easy.  Someone contacted me directly from a resume' I had submitted and forgotten about because of the time between submitting my application and getting a response was so long.

The life of a chevron employees was safety awareness and safety protocol and excellent customer service.

I learnt a lot about how to present ones self in the workplace, what life was like at a busy corporation, and the opportunities that are given to you just by working at Chevron."
good,"The best thing about Chevron is it focuses on Safety above all. it is a great exposure for me to b working on-site with El Segundo refinery. it is one of the oldest refineries so has many challenges when it comes to digitization of certain things. It was challenging for me make balances and gradually bring changes towards digitization of getting approvals and getting things online rather than sharing hardcopies. "
good,Worked here for almost a year and it was really great. Management are nice and work with you. And you get to meet many different people fron your city.
good,It is a great company to work for. I really enjoy working with the public even though you can get the rude customers. The environment all depended on the customers and the employee's attitude. The hardest part was being short handed.
good,"Chevron takes care of its employees very well. They are big on ergonomics and you get locked out from your computer (so you can take a little break) depending upon your key strokes and other metrics. "

In the 15 years that I worked in Port Coquitlam, 11 years for the Chevron station at Shaughessy and Wilson . 4 years at the Shell station at Lougheed Hwy. and Pipeline is because I had good & fare employers, I would've stayed longer working for them if they hadn't retired . During my time at Chevron I got ""employee of the month"" 13 times and during the time with Shell, I received it 7 times . While I worked for both of them I got a total of 11 perfect scores on ""mystery shoppers"" program . The hardest part of the job for me to learn was customer service, the most enjoyable part of the job eventually was customer service . Because once you get comfortable with all the different aspects of the service industry, the job becomes easy( at least it did for me).  The most enjoyable part of the job is when you start receiving employee of the month & perfect scores from the ""mystery shopper program""."
good,Great company to work for.  Lots of opportunity to learn something new. My job consisted of office management and customer service.

good,Working at Chevron Pascagoula Refinery as an intern is an awesome experience to see what how a refinery works first hand. Working in shift work is teaching me how to adjust to the odd sleep schedule required by this industry.
good,I only had a positive experience working with Chevron. I had a great team lead that was very professional and was always there to help. This provided me with an excellent opportunity to continue broadening my skillset on a daily basis.

good,"Everyday I accept payments in the form of Cash, Debit and Cr edit Cards"
good,"Overall a great company to work for. I consulted through Cenergy International so I was not a company man, but had the full support of Chevron. The company paid handsomly for the consultants knowlege and helped to further their training. Having never worked on an oil rig, the company placed me in the drilling department on my arrival and coached me the whole way until I felt competent and was effective in my position. This was a great learning experience. The hardest part of the job is seeing it come to an end."
good,"Valuable work life balance with flexible journeys, add value in Loss prevention system and worried about employees and their health and safety. Hardest part of the jobs is dealing with theft and fraud escenarios."
good,Safe work environment. Great people to work with. It was a great experience to work in that type of environment to prepare me for future employment.
good,"a typical day at work is to clock in count your register,  stock shelves, help customers, keep up the store. I learned how to work with food, learn all bout the gas pumps, the co-workers are fun to be with, we all got along with, the hardest part is when you have to id them, then they get upset, then have to explained, it is company police. then they understand. the enjoyable is to know the customers and your work place. management is great."
good,"I was able to sharpen my people skills while learning the aspects of running a convenience store. I learned more about keeping a fully stocked inventory according to the customers' shopping habits. I was able to build close relationships with my customers, so I would say the hardest part of this job would be saying goodbye."
good,The chevron I worked at was very accommodating to someone from out of town which is always nice. Always felt at home. Wasn't there for long but for the time I was there I can tell you it's a great place.

One of my main challenges was the bioremediation of soil impacted with hydrocarbon, as it was a new issue in the country and had to be solved. This environmental project included the design and construction management to build the land treatment units to bioremediate the impacted soil with hydrocarbon. Every day a work plan, a safety meeting and a risk assessment at site was done before starting work. I learned to be more consistent at work to meet my goals and  searched for new practices to improve the project. I always worked on the budget assigned to avoid a deficit without compromising the project design specifications and safety. The hardest part of the job was the searching and long testing of new methods to accelerate the bioremediation process, but the best part of it was when I managed the right method working, getting also great lab results."
good,Great company to work for.  Really enjoyed the employees. Hardest part of the job is most employees are contractors.

A typical day would consist of counting my drawer to make sure I had the correct amount of money for the shift, assisting customers with their purchases, maintain stores appearance throughout the day, stock the coolers, liquor and tobacco shelves. When a customer wanted to purchase alcohol, I would have to ask for their I.D. When we weren't busy we would clean the shelves, the back room, and make sure the store was always clean and neat. during the shift I would also have to drop cash ranging from $100 to $300 into the safe to maintain safety in the store. At the end of the shift I would balance the lottery sales and check that the safe wasn't missing any money. I then would turn in all our paperwork which consisted of credit card receipts, pay outs from the lottery, voided tickets and a chart of how much food we used the whole day. "
good,A typically day was usually VERY FAST PACED i learned alot about people from all kinds of different backgrounds the managment was really nice most of the co workers we're ok the hardest part of ther job was double shifts i would have to say my favorite part of the job is all the fun you can have while doing herd work....

good,"Help the customers"
good,"The customers made this job worth going to. the most enjoyable part of working for Chevron was meeting new people from all over and helping the ones that needed help. It would always make my day to see this one little old lady pull up to the gas pumps, she would sit in her car until I would walk out there to help her out. She was used to her husband pumping the gas and had no clue as how to do it, so I would do it for her."
good,Chevron has a very strong safety culture with a lot of focus on work/ life balance and promotion of employee advancement.

I worked alone for the majority of my shift. Due to this, I never learned a lot about my co-workers. Nothing about this job is too difficult but I could surely live without cleaning the bathrooms. Lastly, the most enjoyable part of this job is the hospitality. This specific Chevron is owned by extremely kind-hearted owners. Although I love this job, I have no passion or interest to work here.

good,My boss is great and pretty fair. She gave me chances to train me in retail store as a cashier/attendant. This job is very challenging and demanding to be aware of your surroundings because I dealt with a lot of money
good,"Boss/ Management is amazing, if you ever needed a day or two off just let management know at least a week in advance and they will most likely 100% of the time work with your schedule."
good,"It was a great place to work, but after almost a year I was still making minimum wage and people who came in with less experience were up for management before me, which is unfair."
good,My review as a stocker at Chevron was very easy for me . I had no problem doing my job and getting along with other people . And i love to do different things everyday so i had no problem doing something out of the ordinary.
good,Wasn't a bad place to work but hours are inconsistent and they don't fire people for no call no shows. They give chance after chance to people that don't really deserve it.
good,"Sunny days at work, I had my customers that would come to light up my day. I learn that every place has it up and down, but when does down would come the manager wasn't there to hold you up. Chevron has their core values in place but when it comes to a one store, one manager the differences where seen. Workplace culture was more like a favoritism environment. I enjoy and miss the customer and co-worker that everyday would show their hard work."
good,"It was a great place to work until the company was sold. When I went to work at the League Line Road location in Conroe we were one of the few stations on I-45.

good,"I loved my job until I got put in a position where i wasn't the most happy, got fired for what i feel was an unfair reason because I bent over backwards for my job and I enjoyed it. Wish i could have been in the position longer than I was but it built great customer service and cash handling skills as well as how to properly run and maintain the store."
good,"its a nice job if you find a right clean store , they just dont pay much and management not pro ,its a job that you can pass thro time ,you dont do much just jood customer service and good price protect"

Drink station consistently cleaned and maintained all appliances and items for drinks. Sweep and mop store at end of shift. Make sure tobacco is stocked. Also keeping track of cash drops out of the register. At the end of the day you count all of them up, close your shift and report how much money was dropped. Make sure store was maintained enough so next employee can open shift and start smooth."

good,Lots of time standing around then lots of time running around to help customers. Also discount on food and free drinks. Good hours and okay pay. No overtime.
good,I just couldn't work there for that long due to customers harassing and calling the store to speak to one of the employees . If they don't call they will pop up to our job and it's our right to feel safety as an employee and we felt like we wasnt safe at all . AND THE FACT they kept saying I stole 200 which was IMPOSSIBLE and that I'm always short but they never show me the videos or anything so it was kind of frustrating when they just wanna put the blame on someone else

The co-workers were all good, very pleasant and cooperative.

good,A typical work day would be going in after school and stocking whatever needed to be stocked. The rest of my day I would check people out and help them with whatever they needed. During evening we would clean the store. The hard part is having someone not do their job on their sift so it fell back onto the other persons sift.

good,"A typical day at work consists of running a Microsoft Access Database, working with my boss/co-workers on big projects for different oil fields in the San Joaquin Valley and keeping stats of daily and yearly work flow by projects as well as clerical work. I learned the process of taking a well file and being able to take information and then enter it into a computer system called LOWIS (Life Of Well Information System) which draws wellbore diagrams that fields need to send to the District of Oil Gas and Geothermal Resources in order to drill. From then I double checked my fellow colleagues work and sent PDF files off to the fields that needed wellbore diagrams. I also learned how to write queries in Microsoft Access to create a database and took Microsoft Excel Classes offered through Chevron. The hardest part of the job I would say is being able to keep focused for a long period of time because sometimes the work can get tedious. But we are required to take Work Pace Breaks during the work day so keeping focused isn't super difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people and the learning experience. I'm a people person so I love working with others and the learning experience I had here is unforgettable. Not a lot of people are blessed with the opportunity to work for such a great company."

I’m just looking to help my family some more and the pay wasn’t going to cut it no regrets working here whatsoever!
good,"This job is a lot of things, but overall, I would say it is a great place to work for. The manager is one of the best people I have ever had the pleasure to work under, and the employees make the environment all the more better. A typical day normally consists of keeping the place clean and stocked, and ensuring all customers are amicably dealt with and satisfied with their experience. The most difficult part of the job, I would say, is ensuring that customers are of age to purchase tobacco and alcohol, and ensuring that their identification is valid. However, I would say that the most enjoyable part of the job are the people I work with. I am generally alone on my shifts, but when someone else is there with me, it is nice to have someone to work with and talk to, and I like knowing they have my back."

If you're a local public figure employed with Chevron, you're more likely to get promoted before the guy working beside you who has a little more experience than you. But even at the bottom, your compensation trumps even those who have a greater job title at a different company. You're thankful to even be working there so to speak."
good,Lots of business as gas station.   Not alot of overtime.  Work was part time 20 to 30 hours at best.  If somone called in sick.  Then there were extra shifts.  Not a lot of overtime.
good,"I actually work for a Chevron contractor firm not as their staff."
good,"Very nice place to work, clean workplace, nice people, good food, sweet workers,  outside stay clean, a lot of things in store and you get paid weekly."

good,"Like other chevron entities in the world, in Bangladesh we have a very good work/life balance. Here I have learnt a lot about compliance related to my domain. As part of the daily operation, I had to work with colleagues from other regions of Chevron which provides a great cultural diversity. I have learnt a lot about 'Safety' here. We always follow 'Do it safely or not at all' here in Chevron. Door to reach  management level is always open here. I would say the hardest part of the job is to attend the meeting at mid night or early in the morning due to the time zone differences. However the same issue is most enjoyable as it gives us opportunity to meet new people."
good,"Attend morning Operations meeting before performing daily duties."
good,"Enjoyed working here. People are nice, work life balance is good. Will recommend anyone to work here. Management is nice too. Only thing is, since its a huge company, opportunity is hard to come by."
good,Working for Chevron is a priveledge for any who have been given an opportunity to do so.  Chevron management does have a tendency to overcomplicate its capital projects. This is an issue the CEO is aware of and has been working to improve upon.

A strong work ethic is obviously important but the human side is also important.  I really enjoyed with this team, who have a decent sense of humour and who, while they might take their work very seriously, don't necessarily take themselves overly seriously! And also I like this team because they are down to earth but they have a dynamic and progressive approach to their work"

good,great place to work. pay is low but management is humble and understanding. work is steady and the day goes by fast. i would work here again.
good,"I was kept busy at Chevron with general maintenance and cleaning, often running the store alone. I developed skills in customer service, multi-tasking, being quicker with numbers as a cashier, and working as a team to finish tasks."
good,Clean workplace with lots of perks. Paid training on safety so there is less accidents at the work place. They will pay 75% of your college tuition. Great job too.

good,All processes are well defined. Working culture is good. Team work is excellent and working conditions are very good. Good pay master.

The Gas station and the Food mart, really taught me how to manage employees, large sum of money, inventory inside the store, and the appearance and the impression of the store and the company as well. Over all a very great experience, with a lot of knowledge to accompany it. It really helped me gain management skills."

good,"Show up to work with uniform, clock in, sign in to register, that's if you would be working longer hours. I've learned to be socialize with my customers, but keep it professional. Learned to multi-task with cleaning my area around me, after my customers. Check the restrooms hourly. Ask customers if they need help or find something they want, or suggest them new items they never tried."

good,Some days were better than the others while some were long and hectic.
good,"I worked the cash register, cleaned, and stocked. I learned that I am a hardworker and I deal with impatient people very well. Management was great, very helpful and understanding. My co-workers were helpful and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job; dealing with people who got upset when I would I.D. them. The most enjoyable part of the job was staying busy and meeting new people daily."
good,"My work at Chevron had never been routinary. In fact, there was always new and exciting challenges. Employees observe high degree of professionalism and this had been regularly invoked in every aspect of work. It also emphasized safety in every area of its operation. Since I'm in the technical side of the business, the hardest part that I considered was making sure that I keep abreast of the latest and best practices in the industry. Travelling and being part of a team is one of the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,Customer services through out the whole day. Ensure the store is clean and stocked. Assist customers conflicts when needed. The hardest part of my job would have to be doing the propane. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet new people everyday.

good,"I have never had a job where i was able to enjoy both the people i work with, and the people i serve.  Normally you can find one or the other, it is rather difficult to find both.  I have been helped by my co-workers when i was in a time of need.  I have been encouraged by my peers.  Chevron has a few good benefits.  The schedule rotates every week, but the benefit to the company are the hours you work.  I work for seven days straight and i get two days off.  Then i turn around and work for seven days straight, and then i am off for five days. the rotation is the same every day and every week.  my first week i start with two morning shifts (6:30-2:30) afer this i work for five night shifts (230-1030) then i get monday and tuesday off.  when i come back to work on wednesday i work five morning shifts (6:30-2:30) and then the following monday and tuesday i work night shift (2:30- 10:30) and tghen i am off for five days.  It is refreshing to have a mini vacation every few weeks.  The other benefit to my job are my co-workers.  They, for the most part, play nice and encouraging.  they help me out when i need to switch for class.  i enjoy working with these people day in and day out.  I also enjoy our customers.  Everyone of them has a different personality and whether you catch them on a good day or a bad one they always seem to cheer you up."
good,Really a nice company to work for. I really enjoyed working with my co-worker. The team work was really helpful
good,"I am hardworking and dedicated. I believe in giving 100%. I have been awarded 100% 7 times on mystery shops. I have been a stay at home Mom for the last 5 years and  am ready to get back in the work place. I believe I would be an asset to your company. I am looking for part time work at the moment since I have to take my kids to school and pick them up as well, and am available at anytime on weekends."
good,"Love working for Chevron. Excellent management. Routine work, supporting the main office and surrounding field office in Texas and New Mexico."

good,I would strongly recommend this company to be considered as an employer. Chevron provides one with the tools to get the work done. Educational benefits. WorkLife benefits. Global opportunities. And the list goes on and on.
good,"it's busy, the management is great and talk and always friendly customers"
good,I was with Chevon for 25 years and although I was let go during a restructuring I would still say it is one of the best companies to work for.
good,"Great people, great working environment. Unfortunately I am a contractor on a short-term contract."
good,Assisting the various customers need even the impatient ones was the highlight of my day and to do it with a smile was so worth it
good,A typical day at work would include going in and ensureing that the store is prepared for a regular work day. I have learned how to have a very strong safety culture in the work place. The management team is very helpful and works with the employees to succeed. The hardest part of the job is at times it can be very demanding and takes away from my family. But there is adeuate balance that it is manageable. What I love the most is the interaction with the customers.
good,"Learned to be responsible, learned to listen and follow orders. Attention to detail, cleanliness, learned to interact with customers."
good,My time spent with this company was great I really enjoyed working with my co-worker. My manager showed me she appreciated me and valued my service to the store and that only made me strive hard for the successs of the company.
good,"I liked working here th only thing is there wasnt always room for advancement at the work you was working at because there was already 3 shift leaders unless someone m0ved stores or quite... I learned alot here tho I learned how to me more productive in a timely manner, I learned great management skills from my bosses, I had great co- workers as well.."
good,Cool place to work. Always in a safe environment.:........ ...................................
good,"The only bad thing about this job was they spun us off in a joint venture. We were chemical, not oil. Although it lasted another ten years under different names, this was the beginning of the end for most of us. I would go anywhere in the country right now to get back in with Chevron. I would suggest you do the same if the opportunity arises."
good,Chevron was always a good employer for me. There are many opportunities for advancement as an engineer. They were very willing to work with my schedule needs.
good,They are a global company who has the means to do things correctly. Exceptional company with the history and policies to keep you safe and let you truly grow.

good,Excellent diverse work force with excellent organisational capability that promotes capacity building. working for Chevron provides employees excellent training especially for new employees.
good,"I would recommend Chevron to any person interested in working within the Energy industry. They provide an excellent work/life balance and have a strong culture of being ethically, socially and environmentally responsible."
good,Great culture with great colleagues. There is definitely work life balance but the degree of professionalism and technical capabilities is important in climbing the ladder.
good,I loved working here I didn’t have problems with anyone it was a great working environment. The management was fair but strict. The best thing is that management will do their best to work with you.

good,"Management is good"
good,I really liked working there everyone was professional and knew how to answer any questions and knew how to properly train me and was always aware of safety.
good,"All the coffee you can drink and fun customers and coworkers to talk to! i enjoyed this cashier centered job! Mostly gas station food prep, selling scratch offs, western union money transfers and occasionally helping people pump their gas. The car wash was fun to work too!"
good,"I like the people I work with. We all get along very well and help each other out all the time. For the most part, you are standing and walking a lot, no actual breaks given. You have to eat in between taking care of customers. For the pay I get, and the fun co workers, it isn't too bad of a job to have."
good,"I learned how to deal with customers on a daily basis, stock different food items, and manage money and certain situations. Some days were fast paced but others were pretty slow."
good,"Na Chevron tive a minha maior e mais importante lição de mundo corporativo jamais imaginada. A excelência operacional aplicada em graus elevados e a constante preocupação com as pessoas eram as diretrizes principais. E sem que estas duas coisas se opusessem. Ao contrário. Lá aprendi que é possível exigir o melhor de cada um, mas com cuidados e respeito ao colaborador."
good,A nice stable place to work where your ideas can be voiced and listened to. Pay attention to detail and keep safety above all else. A relaxed environment with professionalism from the lowest employee to the highest supervisor. Many opportunities for advancement and position changes if needed.
good,i enjoyed working in this field. it was layed back an relaxed. i was able to work alone and not feel stressed. i was constantly busy though so time went by very fast
good,Safety as you drive onto the Parking Lot!  Safety on all sides and measures.  Very nice Environment upon entering job floor and location.  Security is very inevitable and accommodating. Supervisor's are just a step away and easy to talk and get along with.  Contractors feel like part of the Regular Employee Team.
good,"The statement that stood out for me during my orientation at Chevron Pascagoula Refinery was that ""97% of the people hired by Chevron, retire from Chevron."" My progression through the company from trainee to Company Rep (contractor liaison), was a continuous flow of joyous challenges and personal growth. I could never imagine that there was a company that would train me to operate lathes, milling machines and cranes and pay me as well, while I was having fun."
good,"Chevron provides excellent technical training and career opportunities.  They hire people who will fit in to their culture and I felt I got along with everyone, regardless of where they worked in the world."

good,"Each day was challenging and also rewarding. I learned a great deal about a fuel service and document retention. Upper management always willing to get involved to help you achieve your goals. Employs a hard working, diverse group of people. The hardest part of the job was to complete the daily requirements of the store management staff in an eight hour period. Knowing my hard work was acknowledged and appreciated."

You can also pay for health insurance through the company. Overall, it’s been a very reliable and great job while I was young."

good,"better management, more pay for more hours, good coworkers,"
good,"Each day was high energy from all employees. It was a very fun and learning experience. In will say 8hrs on my feet was difficult at times, mainly because of my age. Management was always willing to hear any suggestions or request."
good,The pay and benefits are amazing along with the work schedule. My only complaint would be the way very unexperienced employees can easily become management. A lot of them only want to make a name for themselves and it becomes very cut throat for no reason. Work environment is very political and if you don't drink the kool-aid of someone who is trying to make a name for themselves they will cut you down and get you canned.

good,chevron was a great place to work. I loved most of the customers. the work was pretty easy there is not any hard work. its a friendly environment. they have reasonable hours
good,"I was in a very demanding position, when I was the head operator for the diatomite team. The hardest part was being pulled in so many directions. I believe an operations rep position would have been justified due to the amount of work going on. It was a great company and they offered great benefits. I felt like I always had the support I needed to succeed. I will work for Chevron in the future if I ever get the opportunity again."

good,"Managing the whole work with the co workers is the important thing."
good,"I work pretty much all day long, but it's the kind of job you can leave at work.  Having every other Friday off is a plus.
