rating,review
bad,"this place is a joke, how is it still in business? The engineers are all jerks and management is a literal joke, like I laugh when I think of them.  and I have to jeep typing because there is a min, stay away."
bad,"Not a professional or safe company. The company does not enforce chemical safety procedures. The employees do not know or exercise Lab rules, chemical and soldering safety procedures or properly grounded out in the Lab."
bad,the work there was easy but it was slow and boring i would not work their again if they wanted me too.I did not like the management their they had no care for their employees.
bad,Company is focused on shipping jobs offshore and constantly under re-organization of business units. Management makes poor decisions and employees are under valued.
bad,Maxim a non professional corporation. Need to clean house in upper management. Like my days off. Hate the way maxim treat their employee. Treat fab tech like they are animal.
bad,I worked at Maxim for 14 long years. I find Maxim my second home.
bad,"Working in the strategic account department, the only atmosphere acceptable was similar to that of a mortuary. No talking no fun conversations...just get your work done in the quietest way possible. It was a real cemetery of a company. Strict clothing guidelines when we rarely met with a customer. Shirt and tie every day....such a joke. If you have no personality and do not get along with people this is a great job because you will have to interact with no one."
bad,Their Reliability Lab is being rotten. It's no longer high tech any more. Hard working is not recognized.They are still using many antique equipment. Their IT system is also very slow and tedious.
bad,"Maxim Integrated was an industry leader under CEO Jack Gifford.  After the Wall Street takeover and his ouster circa 2008, Maxim became a hellhole for all employees.  No one who works at this company will honestly recommend it at any level.  Just look at the gross profit margins-it all went downhill the instant Jack Gifford was forced to retire, and wall street started taking dividends directly from the pockets of employees.  Every time Maxim buys out a smaller company, the more draconian policies are applied to the entire corporation."
bad,"Upper management is totally disconnected operationally. High expectations but do not provide adequate resources. They talk a big talk, but do not back it up. Little to no appreciation for process improvements."
bad,"A typical day at Maxim Integrated leaves you feeling overworked and unhappy. Management had a very high expectation of their employees, that the employees unfortunately could rarely reach. They would hire new employees(Usually with no experience) at a higher pay than employees who had been there for 5+ years. The most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers."
bad,"As a Fab Technician level 1 at this Beaverton plant for several years and never got a bump up to any higher level even with my solid reviews/performance. Compensation is far from competitive, being low and it stays low unless you're good at sucking up to the supervisors. Cheap wages is what they're going for and you're expendable because they'll just hire anyone off the streets to replace you.  The culture is full of politics and favoritism. The supervisors either keep getting switch around to different shifts or they just quit altogether due to their dissatisfaction with their manager."
bad,"Cons: Most layoff  company i seen."
bad,The work it'self is good honest work. The twelve hour shift cuts into my personal life. 
bad,No job security! Inconsistent executive management leadership and direction... Headcount reductions used to make the reported numbers look good to Wall Street and Investor Community/BOD!
bad,"A typical day includes very little time for training, it's always hit the floor running. I learned the average productive lifespan of a maintenance worker is about 5 years, then burn-out occurs. The hard part of the job was never quite knowing what to expect. In my opinion management makes knee-jerk decisions and seldom has all the facts or bases the decision on bad or false data. The maintenance and production crew were a pleasure to work beside."
bad,Maxim is a good place to work if you work in any department other than Payroll.  Payroll is on an outdated SAP system that hardly no company uses. Payroll manager has no knowledge of Payroll. System has to constantly be updated
bad,"Some of my coworkers were awesome, but a lot were rude and went out of their way to make our lives a nightmare. It was one of the worst jobs I've ever had but I'm still friends with some of the people."
bad,Mandatory overtime. Pushy management to do more then possible. Overall stressful workplace and stressed employees. I would not work there again.
bad,"It is a good company for new graduates."
bad,"The culture at the time was dominated by favoritism and nepotism. My job was labor intensive drudgery with no recognition. That would have been OK if they gave me the tools and equipment to do my job, but I didn't get that either."
bad,"Low pay, little to no opportunity for advancement, you have to work there for a very long time before you can move up. They advertise that they’re paying up to $18, but i’ve never heard of anyone over $16.50, even with experience in the industry. They do not communicate very efficiently between shifts, and because of this, managers will tell you to come in on a different shift 2 weeks in advance, then when 2 weeks comes along, they will claim you shouldn’t be on that shift. You also work on machines from 70’s-90’s, so everything you do takes a minimum of five minutes. "
bad,"Company only cares if you show up. Will hire anybody regardless if they're elementary school educated or have a Bachelors. Doesn't matter. If you missed work due to weather or illness, you won't have a position when you go back. Don't waste your time. Company won't last much longer. They closed their plant overseas. Also, not really a team even though they blow smoke up your bum about it."
bad,"Very little work/life balance for those who believe in putting out good work. Compensation is very low compared to other semiconductor companies.  Job advancement only for those in favor with management.  Typical ""churn and burn"" culture."
bad,I was a Fab Technician for about 4 months here. The pay is terrible for the duties you have to perform and the price of the product you are producing. I met people that had been in the semiconductor industry for over 15 years and had only been promoted once at maxim. All of the temp to hire people have to wait a year before being brought on to receive benefits REGARDLESS of what they tell you. Upper level management has no loyalty to their employees and you are disposable. My last few weeks working there I witnessed 11 people get fired just on my shift. I suppose they did this to avoid giving out severance packages. I was eventually laid off. Maxim by far is the worst company I have worked for and also the most miserable job I have ever had.
bad,"Typical work day you suit up in the bunny suit get a pass down, then you would clean your area then get started on the work load and check what PM needed to be done. You would get three breaks and see the boss maybe 2 times a night it was in the back of the fab and you worked alone pretty much the entire time trying to make sure every piece of work you got was completed. The management was very inappropriate with how they would talk to some of their employees. the hardest part of the Job was to keep the tools up and operating while you are getting more work in by the hour. I enjoyed getting in my zone and just tearing though the work and checking the numbers seeing i was doing better then everyone else as well as never making a mistake."
bad,"Do you want job security?  Work some place else. Under the current CEO, layoffs have been the default method of cutting costs.  There had been several years where layoffs were quarterly.  In recent years they are less frequent but still loom over the horizon.  The Dallas TX location is a fraction of it's former size."
bad,Worked hard and accomplished a lot. Many engineering fixes and projects completed. Work was well received and appreciated by Process Engineering group.
bad,"I worked test maintenance and although the people were nice and the job was mellow, we were paid very little and had the worst benefits.  I hope things have changed."
bad,This company is ok if you are willing to settle for the restrictions of management. There is sometimes room for growth if you are in the right place at the right time.
bad,"Typical day is stressful with high paced environment.  Lack of personnel for maintenance, production and process tech's.  No lack of management though."
bad,"SG and other countries benefits varies. It should be equal or similar. "
bad,"Very short handed with a lot of micromanaging. Tools are very old and very hard to meet goals. Morale is not the best among production workers. Has a work out room which is very convenient when working 12 hours. Location is around a lot of shops and restaurants. They support a lot of foot and cycle races in the area."
bad,"A good group of people that want to do well. Just needs some leadership and organisation beyond the artificial deadlines."
bad,"I had wonderful coworkers at the Beaverton Fab, but other than that it's hard to say much good about the job other than above average pay."
bad,"The people that work here are great, however, the management style of the company seemed chaotic. Management was slow to act and often confused about what was happening within the company. The pay was below standard and turnover was high."
bad,Maxim provided stock options to their company which was fantastic. However the work environment is stressful and very intense. It was not atypical to work 12-14 hr days with no compensation for this OT.
bad,"Management sucks. Raises suck (if they actually give them). One of the big bosses is sexist so that sucked. It's near impossible to move up in rank. If you just keep your head down and do the mind numbingly repetitive work, you'll be fine. Don't go abound and beyond because you won't be rewarded, they'll just come to expect that kind of work from you all the time."
bad,"Security Department was in house, then got contracted out by Securitas. So job security would not be high on the list. I was able to find a job as soon as this happened."
bad,"Managers on up, never face lay-offs."
bad,"Tough place to work.  Management style ""fear and intimidation"" pay is good benefits are good. Most of co workers are fun to work with."
bad,"Maxim work site/plant location convenient. Pay and benefits were good. It was a great place to work, but the plant closed. People I dealt with daily good working group and most were team players."
bad,Company isn't growing.  Focus has shifted to cost cutting and layoffs.  Upper management seems out of touch and completely uninspiring.
bad,"Fast growth 2009-2012, but mgmt stumbled into this growth, so when it stalled, they didn't know what to do to fix it.  For the last 3-4 years, their only plan is to re-org and lay people off to cut expenses.  After every re-org, they say ""We are positioned for growth"", but there still is no growth."
bad,"When I work at Maxim a few years ago (Security Dept.), most of the team members that I work with were helpful and team oriented. The salary was average and the benefits are great. Medical, dental, & 401K was a big plus."
bad,"Feedback is hard to come by in this job, and you don't get it until a few weeks after your manager has received the feedback from your coworkers. especially on night shift, the culture is nice, with close staff, and the work can be a bit confusing, especially in the beginning, although can be quickly understood if you try hard enough. You work 12 hour shifts 3-4 days, depending on the week, so it is pretty much wake up, go to work, and go to bed. This means 3-4 days off, depending on the week."
bad,Challenging work.  Management in my area was easy to work with. Business units fight each other for projects. A lot of inter office politics in engineering and production groups.
bad,That position I had there at Maxim integrated was a Wastewater a w n upw water operator. I worked for a manager that didn't care about his employees. He didn't provide training. Maxim integrated is a unsafe atmosphere to work in.
bad,"Processed silicon wafers through chemical baths in the computer chip making process."
bad,Maxim was always coming up with different ways to do things but it only frustrated people because projects took forever and weren't always pretty to see implemented. They have a fear based culture where anyone is expendable. There have been outsourcing of so many jobs. Management has blinders on and don't know how to treat people. Too many negatives to list. Saw so many seasoned employees leave in droves...voluntarily. 
good,"How does a company tell their employees to be the difference, but the company will lay off any entire department with no severance or any other compensation just because other companies contract out for that departments work?  doesn't sound like ONE maxim if they have a whole department that is contract.  "
good,Semi-conductor facility that seems to be losing its identity as a leader in the technology field.  It is not an enjoyable facility to work in since management has changed.
good,enjoyed working with Maxim and it had growth but is now focusing on down sizing for sale to the highest bidder. CEO can not communicate with the his o wn subordinates
good,"Maxim had wonderful products and a very tough culture.  The only way to cope with it was in a remote office.  In the early 2000's the management offered minimal benefits and terrible pay, but they offered accelerated stock vesting.  The company's stock had doubled three times in 15 years.  There were lots of wealthy 30 year olds running around the company.  So there was incentive to put up with the bad conditions. "
good,"Management made Maxim a bad place to work.  It looked nice and shiny on the outside, but your performance reviews were completely subjective to how well your direct supervisor liked you. I was offered a promotion, and then was told it was given to someone else because they had been there longer. It only got worse from there. I learned a lot about the semiconductor industry, but that's about it. They claimed to have an open door policy, however when I suggested changes that could improve workflow, not only were the ideas shot down, I was labeled a troublemaker(even if the ideas didn't work, constructive feedback would have been acceptable). "
good,Shifting schedule 6:00 am-6:00 pm and 6:00 pm-6:00 am 4 days work in a week. I learned how to encode daily inventory of materials and different kinds of application. co-workers very nice to me they teach me how to do in work and bonding. The hardest part of the job is in encoding in different application like SAP and Comet by codes.
good,"It is an OK company to work with. Lots of good people, but management is weak, especially middle level managers, lots of polities."
good,Changing culture - becoming more competitive and less sensitive to your needs as a person.
good,"I am a current employee for the Security Department at Maxim Integrated Products at San Jose, CA. I have been with the security department for over ten years."
good,"In my 2 1/2 years there, every September they had lay offs."
good,"Chicken Little was an employee of Maxim. Consistently needing CEO approval for higher dollar purchases, the purchasing manager who employed me was tied over a barrel and always miserable, almost always powerless. He wore it on his sleeve and made for an uncomfortable work environment."
good,"Very stressfull, low pay, if you get along with your boss you will do great otherwise nothing much else to say. It’s not a bad place to work. But maxim does not pay much. Raises are pretty bad unless you get along with your boss really well"
good,I worked for Maxim for 8 years and was promoted only one time. Most of the equipment was very old. There was never any sign of the company investing in newer or better equipment. Not a safe place to work.
good,"The company sent out entire payroll team positions to another country to save money. Not very encouraging to the employee culture. It started a a great place to work, but as upper management changed so did the atmosphere."
good,"Since 2005, Maxim started re-org every year, and change department head ever two years. Can a company keep downsizing and growing at the same time? I don't think they execute well."
good,"Good company, long work days. Generally management is very good and helpful. All employees are great people and very friendly. Most enjoyable part of job is working together as a team."
good,"Top-down in managing projects"
good,"Maxim's upper management does not seem to care about the employees but only in what benefits them the most."
good,"Maxim Integrated is a great company with good benefits."
good,this job is meh. you walk a lot you learn some really cool stuff if you've never made computer chips before. But its very easy and its very boring and no physical stress at all other than walking and standing for long periods of time. The pay is to low honestly your doing a very technical job that's more brain than brawn.
good,"I worked for Maxim for 3 years.  In that time there was a big layoff series every six months or so.  Also, every six months or so the direction of the company would change.  But, if you work for the right group, you can be have a stable job in a decent company with way too much red tape."
good,When I first started the current CEO was just coming up to speed. And then the layoffs started. And the benefits were starting to get cut. And you had to burn vacation time. And a couple of years of 2% pay increases despite great reviews. And bonuses get cut because we only made 650 million last quarter instead of the 700 million that was projected. And more layoffs. Some big but lots of small under the radar layoffs. I've never been laid off before and don't plan on working for Maxim long enough to let that happen.
good,"very fast paced"
good,"sometimes very tiring. stressful but at the end of the day happy because you fulfilled your work in a correct   way base on their req."
good,They provide components desperately needed in todays market place.
good,maxim is a one of kind company. the culture promotes questioning things and giving feedback etc. but the core values are missing ...the management has no clue about what the teams are doing technically and there is no clear roadmap.. there is a lot of time wasted over unwanted meetings which are usually out of sync with the actual project issues. They need to really define and understand the roles of each engineer and the lower management . book keeping should be really kept to the upper level . one more observation is the top level is highly analog and have no practical background in digital design ( just pretend of having it ). no digital /mixed signal people at the top
good,Maxim gives opportunity to recent college grads show their skills and the knowledge they'd learned in college. Working at Maxim has been fun.
good,Maxim is an international company and offers very good benefits
good,"• Use SAP ECC Production"
good,Management team needs a lot of work. The majority of them don't understand the basics of what they are instructing people to do. They do have a tendency to play favorites as well when it come to vacations and promotions.
good,"Though management doesn't necessarily say that you need to work long hours. The culture of the company is so. Many people there are dedicated individuals who tend to put in long hours because they want to get the job done at hand quickly. "
good,meeting and email. planning and scheduling. promotion and pricing. define and architect. manage and coordinate. implement new process. review and control. average work place.
good,"Situation may differ among different groups. In my group, project cycle is kind of short, workload and pressure is relatively high. After each project, boss will give you some break."
good,"Clean working environment............. Average pay rate................Very Good compensation severance pay is 1 pay check per year................. Very good in hiring interns...............Mixed work culture, some department are good some are bad. .........Production morale is down due to scheduled lay offs."
good,They have a really good program for worklife balance. you can swap restdays with any other days. you can also go halfday given that youve done everything during your working hours.
good,"Great place to work to show your knowledge and skills but, in line to salary.. Newly hired had good salary rather than regular employees.."
good,Good for fresh grad applicant they will learn a lot if they work at Maxim. they will experience the pressure of being a employee
good,"My co-workers worked as a team."
good,company more concerned with the bottom line than keeping US jobs.
good,I was contracted out to work at Maxim Integrated. My boss wanted to hire me on permanently but upper management would not allow for it. They constantly overload the engineers and technicians with work because they refuse to hire. They have horrible policies and if you work there under a temporary agency HR treats you poorly. I have been working here for 3.5 years under a temporary agency. They had a change of company policy regarding temporary employees and now temporary employees can only work there for a year before they let them go. Seeing how I have been here 3.5 years I was the first to go. What ticks me about the situation is they did it without warning or a decent notification about being let go. Instead they told me I had five days to work then I could no longer work here. They should have told me a month ago that I needed to search for other jobs if they new there was going to be a change in policy not at the last minute. The problem is not the workers. People I worked with were awesome the problems is HR and upper management creating bad policy and refusing to spend money on new hires or on new equipment needed to perform work.
good,"Okay to work there just do your job and go home, supervisor will leave you alone as long as you are doing your job, the only fault is the working schedule. Start night is Sunday,"
good,I was an intern there. The people around me are nice. Not a lot of work assigned to me so I can't rate much. What I did noticed is they are very cheap. A manager won't even approve a JTAG cable used for testing.
good,"working on maxim is fine and ok because im a qa inspector here from dec 2003 up to present, but the only problem is the salary,we dont know how the yearly appraisal is doing"
good,"I worked for them for less than a year, because of their strict quality policies.  Having made one to many mistakes, I was let go.  If you can work for them, they are good."
good,I enjoy most of the people I work with. Good spirit of cooperation. Management not so great. Great benefits and significant stock-based compensation. Has good design tools. Many experts in their fields.
good,great benefits and good people to work with. bad management directions and very hard to move up the career ladder. Good place to gather lots of experience though.
good,"Work-life balance is tough at Maxim, but you will learn a lot at this company.  There are many good people to work with as well."
good,"During the early hours i'll check my email and reply. Find out the priority task on the day, meeting with team for half hour and discuss about the status. Updating my status with the client. Reading reach higher program."
good,"I enjoyed working with the team I was on, very nice and supportive people. However, I was not impressed with the internship program. I felt it could have been organized a lot better. I didn't have a burning desire to work for the company after graduating."
good,"I learned more about my industry at my job than I would have at other companies that afford career specialization. "
good,the staff always makes it a fun place to work with each new shift offering new incentives and even offering a end of the year event as a reward if you sell enough!
good,Not the worst place to work but not the best. Semi conductors are a mature technology so it doesn't feel like we're on the leading edge of anything. Its steady work and decent pay. Not too many paid days off or extra amounts of vacation time. Decent coworkers.
good,"Challenging working environment that provides window for each person to explore new technologies."
good,"Initially it started as good experience but as months are passing it looks like growth opportunity is diminishing."
good,". 12 hours shift"
good,"This job was all manufacturing, there was no wait time.  It was continuous work, but the hours were great.  You would work 3 days one week then 4 the next and would rotate.  The only thing that you had to get used to was smocking up.  You would wear a smock covered from head to toe."
good,"Typically a busy day everyday. Got a lot of work to resolve issues."
good,Good work Life balance but company should retain good talent
good,"Great place if you're a recent grad. There is a big age gap, which is good because you'll learn a lot of business experience that will help you grow."
good,Management was not a typical everyday kind. Ensured Network systems 99% up time. Company will not spend resources to train / enhance employee growth.
good,Enjoyed the last 9 years at Maxim. Learnt a lot in terms of Technical Knowledge and what it takes to grow up the management ladder. Friendly co-workers. Working environment improved quite a bit after the move to the new building San Jose.
good,It is a small company so everyone knows everyone . Nothing is really confidential . You will have to take calls from home as well .But I would not say it is very stressful. Culture is relaxed and not really process oriented. Management is changing from previous mishaps.The hardest part of the job is probably the politics.
good,I was hired as a contractor upon they acquired Scintera.  It was a 9 month contract to help transition our products into their systems.  I completed my assignment in 6 months.
good,"Busy place, too much stress for too low of pay. There are some really great people that work here. Shift supervisors are great, and the company has excellent benefit packages. 12 hour shifts; work 3 days one week, 4 days the next week."
good,"Worked as Trainer at Maxim. Flexible hours, high paced demanding high tech environment. good pay, full time job with excellent benefits. Overall Good Experience."
good,"Maxim had good pay, benefits, and good hours. but the people were always in their own groups. Trying to get people in trouble. The building was always hot. went home sweaty a lot. Even with air conditioning"
good,"Happy to work here, good working culture, able to learn new technologies, "
good,"Overall good company to work at.  Coworkers are friendly and helpful.  The health insurance, stock and company activities are examples of good benefits and perks to employees."
good,"In being a long time employee of Maxim Integrated I have been able to develop many different skills sets and advance within my career.  Each day i'm challenged by a team member, management or an application.  These challenges have helped me learn on the job, reach outside of my comfort zone and ensure i'm pushing myself and those around me.  We strive to push past our current limitations to come up with new ways or solutions."
good,A good place to learn in every aspect but not a good place for accelerating life positions in terms of position in work
good,"Have been given a good position to learn and advance my skillset of tools I repair and maintain.  Daily challenges and accomplishments along the way.  Can be very frustrating at times, but learned through the struggles."
good,"Employee benefits are wonderful. "
good,"Very good management team and values individual ideas."
good,The most enjoyable job I ever had. Friendly and nice people.
good,"12 hour shifts can really get to some people when they first start, but can get used to it after the 2nd week working in the fab. But then again the 3-4 day weekend is a major plus as well. The fab is a very interesting place to work in: we dress up as astronauts, working on different types of expensive equipment, like something out of a Sci-Fi movie."
good,"If you work on the production line, then you are part of the machine. No career change, no career advancement. Keep the wheels turning. Fair management, but no upward Mobility. No career advancement path"
good,"Maxim Integrated was a nice company to work for. Pay is low at the operator level. Typical days involve a fast-paced, competitive environment. You will sweat because of the gear you have to wear in the labs. Culture is relaxed. Good people work for Maxim."
good,Very fun environment with fellow engineers. Kept documentation and interaction with counterparts consistent. Always dependent on availability of resources.
good,I enjoyed the working with many of the employees but the main problem at Maxim is the managers who cause all the unnecessary stress in the company. Other than that the employees they do higher usually have a great attitude.
good,"Work environment is good but some employees have bad habits. but with regards to the company itself, the management, i dont have anything to say but Thank you, because the experience was really good."
good,"My typical day at work was operating the Scanning Acoustic Microscope, ordering consumables for the lab, assisting the engineers as needed in their analysis. I was trained to operate as the testing equipment in the lab and worked closely with my co-works to help get projects out on a time.  My  co- workers were helpful and we all got along."
good,"During Battery Management, everyone functioned collectively from top to bottom as a group (informations feed thoroughly).  After migrating to Automotive Business Unit, upper management changes several time that created skeptical concerns although design, application and test still succeeding as a group."
good,"Good to work with teams in US, Europe etc. Cannot say the same for India."
good,The employees are friendly and good at what they do.  The benefits are great compared to other companies.  The lower levels of management are supportive of their employees and back them up.  Upper levels of management are disconnected and lay people off without having any idea what they are working on.  This causes the morale to be really low because people are constantly having to worry about their job security.
good,"Maxim has the right size.  You can make a difference through your every day work there.  It is engineering centric though,  it is fun to work for Maxim."
good,"The workplace culture appreciates strong work ethics, very talented and smart individuals.  Our leaders are strategic with their vision and strongly support employee development."
good,"* Overall very structured and purposeful work environment."
good,"Work long 12 hours shift with dependable help when needed."
good,"Decent compensation and benefits, work life balanced, rewards hard working and success, open door policy of upper managements. Not too much chance to learn new technology and advance career here."
good,"Innovative Analog IC company with top notch engineering co-workers, that has been struggling to re-gain its former success.  Last 8 years have been mired with reorgs, layoffs and sub-par financial performance."
good,Great place to work and everybody is really nice.  My most enjoyable part of the job is updating the web site.  A typical day at work is updating the website.
good,"Its culture is not so good. Overall company direction is wrong. company officials is just for benefits for them self, not for sake of the company. In my previous group, the jobs are just fro a reason to ship the products despite of quality concern."
good,"I read my specs, emails, set-up tools, visually inspect wafers with a microscope. I've learned that quality and quantity does not go together. Management was very quiet and never observe other people's progress. My co-workers were a mixture of negative and positive people. Of course I stayed in the positive way of things. The hardest part of my job is visually inspecting the dies of the wafers and to match with the paper map that needs to be inked to be discarded in Test. The enjoyable part of my job is working out at my workplace."
good,"Very thorough, exact match, have that direct mind set! Need to have a customer service personality. Always in meetings. Hay a full understanding of the software!"
good,"The direct FA manager always feels threatened.  Not a good environment to interact with management."
good,"Maxim Integrated has great intelligent people, a safe campus, and a culture that promotes and supports an active lifestyle. There are many great tools and resources available for you to learn and cross train at work."
good,I worked here as a temp. It was a good experience for the time being.   The job assignment was just okay. The campus is nice. Everyone is friendly and there's always free coffee.
good,"- I work as Equipment Technician 3.I work on shifting 6 to 6 (am/pm)"
good,I have learned how to work with others to get the most production with qualify done per day.
good,"This company was a semi-conducting plant, great way to build my work experience. I loved the people that i was always worrking with but management was very poor in the decisions and the overall support of their employees."
good,"It's fun to be working here at Maxim Integrated Philippines. As QA Inpector/operator , we have a lot of exciting and interesting experiencs working with my peers. Being with them doing my job is a lot more easy because they're always there to help me out in times of need and  they've been very cooperative. The company envisioned to be innovative in working with their products giving them an edge over their competitors. In such a way, we also do our part as QA by sending the product to our customers more dependable, reliable above all quality product that would satisfy the needs of our customers. Spending my time here in the company for almost 16 years, I think I already do my share in the improvement of the company."
good,Its a big help for me working in this company .I hope i can work again this company.That time my daughther is 2 yra old no one toke care of her thats  why i force to stop frm my job.This time i want to work again at maxim.
good,My position had highly demanding but rewarding technical tasks that encourages perpetual learning. The company has decent management that exhibits meritocracy along with a good implementation of the company's principles.
good,it was an amazing place to volunteer at everyone is friendly and helpful. they provided you the resources to do your job efficiently and affectively. I would recommend this to a friend
good,"Good work environment. Joined in as a fresh graduate and was welcomed well. Good work/life balance and friendly people."
good,"Retrieve and receive wafers from FAB, sort wafers, prioritize testing, test wafers and ensure test results are accurate.  Visually inspect all wafers on microscope.  Ship wafers to Assembly. "
good,The pay for me was good. But was let go because of personal feelings towards me. So I thought the company was good and had a lot of good employees. But it can be very clicky. I would work there again giving the opportunity.
good,"Maxim is a good company but, I felt that I was being underpaid. However, in spite of that, I do hope that I will be able to work there once again in the future."
good,Good local management but disagree with decisions made by upper management. Great place to work if you're in a growing group
good,fun work place with supportive mangers. with a nice work schedule you work 3 to 4 days and have the rest of the week off. its factor work and you work 12 hours straight. but the management is very helpful and caring.

good,"Talent people with humors, daily interface with friendly working colleagues and teams, but need to work hard too. Managing style is changing for good."
good,Great place to work but work-balance is not being addressed by the management. There are lots of training available but workload is too much so training can't be the priority. Work load is not properly/evenly distributed. Work turn around is too short. Typical day of work is negotiating and preparing contract also attending end-user's request and requirements. Co-workers are cooperative and supportive and happy to work with. Hardest part of the job is not being trained well before handling work assignment. Many tasks to handle that sometimes affects the quality of work. Not much have of work balance due to job requirement and and urgency of request/s. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning on your own without any issues encountered while doing the job/task.

good,Typical day at maxim was supporting the equipment. The hardest part of the job was trying to repair equipment with no parts. Budget was always a consideration when trying to repair equipment.

good,"Good Place to Work,Good Benefits,Great Work/Life Balance"
good,"The start of a typical day is catching up with the most recent issues and understanding what has been accomplished and where I should begin my investigation. I like to have a full grasp of what communications have been made about the concerns and the steps to figuring out where in the problem lays. Management wants to have a clear picture of the concerns and this was accomplished through various channels of communication. Documentation was a living, breathing system that continued to grow the factory in a level of comprehensions to better serve future issues and historic paths followed. Having learned that there are different models in each situation and developing the responses to the conditions better resulted in long term successes of tool operation. I often found it difficult to sift through the many levels of communication about an issue and taking it to the next level of understanding. I found it to be a pleasure at being challenged to a concept or a paradigm shift that provides a new idea."

A lot of exciting projects in the analog space, and a very respected player. Non political, collaborative atmosphere. However, structure in many teams is flat, so vertical growth (promotions etc)  opportunities might be limited."
good,Fun place to work.
good,"I worked at Maxim under PYTHOS TECHNOLOGY INC."
good,"maxim is a good place to work, the facility and grounds are maintained well, free coffee and wifi in the break room, lots of benefits  and a fair system, but once you get assigned to a shift you're stuck there for about the next two years, so pray you get a favorable one."

good,"Maxim seems to be undergoing a great number of strategic reorganizations recently to stay competitive.   They built new buildings and tried to re-brand the company but now they are having to cut jobs in  the US, possibly because some of their investments did not work out as they hoped.  In spite of this I am still optimistic for Maxim's future."
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company.

But my team members were very helpful and by my effort I became more and more familiar with those stuff and finally I could finish individual project including design, test and debugging. The hardest part of this job is to find out what is wrong and to improve the performance. Fortunately I got a very good tutor who is my boss and lots of team members from whom I learned a lot of practical skills in analysis and lab. I really appreciate this great chance.

They could take a break whenever they wanted, if they were tired they could leave early too. But one thing was very clear, nobody lagged behind in terms of work.

Managing my time when it was break time or if it was a decent time to take a break depending on how much work I had at the time. The co-workers were great and easy to work with the hardest part of the job was accepting a situation from the previous shift who may have had a bad day and had work left over to complete.
