bad,They point the finger when goals aren’t met.  If you are a financial rep be careful because they want you to sell life insurance to everyone whether they need it or not.
bad,I was working for a new agent who had no idea what he was doing. After I quit the agency continue to call my Family still trying to sell them insurance. The worst part is all state as a company is a scam. They will never pay for a roof which is the whole point of homeowners insurance.
bad,Your metrics continually change and your ability to meet those metrics depends on the time of day you work. This company is sales driven and offers no training for anyone who has never done sales of any kind
bad,Agent was a egotistical hothead.  Awful pay and hours.  No sick time.  No support or training unless you do it in your own.  No leads provided.  Be careful of the agent you work for.
bad,"Employed for 5 years now in medpay office and still no opportunity or advancement to grow within the company. I have witnessed over and over again, and managers only promote people who they favor and show favoritism to, even though they are horrible at their work. Managers get together And use a form of retaliation to prevent an employee from growing or advancing within the company just because they do not like that person. "
bad,I worked hurricane harvey..we were not trained enough and were just thrown to the wolves..iworked 6am to midnight every day.i did not get paid for many jobs and ended up losing money on the whole unfortunate experience
bad,"Terrible pay, unprofessional atmosphere. I was miserable every day at this job and nothing improved over the many months of working there. False promises and little return for a difficult job."
bad,"Allstate isn’t worth anyone’s time. Agents treat you like dogs. Many Allstate location have even shut down for doing shady business, trust me when I say you aren’t in “good hands”."
bad,Use to be a friendly place to work until management decided to clean house. Management now does not care about the employees that help take care of the customers. They do not care if you're out sick they want you to come to work even if you're dying and have documentation from your doctor. They have supervisors that are racist and expect you not to report them if so you're retaliated against make you quit
bad,"By far the worst job I've ever had. They refused to give raises, I was there for over 2.5 years, did better work while taking 700+ calls per month while the rest of my team had half that many. Come to find out it was not the teams fault, they just gave me more calls than others. Absolutely abusive employer who only promotes favorites and diverse individuals."
bad,"I did not like the hours and the managers are not flexable, it's hard to take time off of work even when you have the PTO to do so.  I would never work there again!!"
bad,Terrible training and no support! No help from management! Just throws you out to the sharks to try to sell by yourself off cold calling! Would not work for clay Baker Agency!
bad,"Agent's practice is shady.  Does not know very much about insurance so he gives incorrect answers. Will not listen to experienced employees. "
bad,Management is overbearing little to no vacation time salary is horrendous and there is no one working there longer than 2 years. I would not recommend working at this company.
bad,One of the worst companies I’ve worked for I would never recommend anyone to work in the met subrogation dept especially with he micromanagement and being unappreciated
bad,Absolutely a horrible place to work with. They didn’t follow through on anything they told me they would do. The person I worked with from day one said she wanted to cost me my business. Do not work with this company or for this company.
bad,Horrible. Stay away. Worst job I have ever had. Claims are the worst jobs period. The work load is insane and you are extremely stressed from being screamed at on the phone all day. It's MISERABLE
bad,"Allstate is a company that is set up to only benefits the owner!!! There are no residual income. It goes to the owner. The commission is so low, and they work you to the bone. If you have a bad day that's what they notice not any good you do. On a spur of the moment throw you away like and old pair of socks. The money you pay to become an agent and the test etc. It's not worth the job at all. Especially since you are the face of the company!!! I  regret the choice to sell insurance period!!!"
bad,Their training and management is the worst I have ever experienced in the last 20 years.  I would never suggest working for them.  Agency owners have no management experience.
bad,"Very fast paced job. You'll take a lot of calls, and get burned out quickly. Most management is either unavailable or doesn't care. Opportunities to move up are virtually non-existent."
bad,"Don't do it. I would not recommend Allstate to anyone. There is no work life balance. The health insurance plans are high deductible plans. There is no real room for advancement. Working on holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years Day, etc) is mandatory. And the pay is not competitive."
bad,"Never again will I work for this company. The company itself is OK, but every office is independently owned, so you will probably be treated not very well or paid well at all either. Trust me."
bad,Thumbs down management in HR at least the person I worked for has noy recruited in ahile and has gotten out of touch with what it takes to get the job done. Clueless
bad,"I have no comment to make.  it is a typical day of work. really do not want to comment. the hardest part of the job is putting up with management when they constantly throw things at you to do. the most enjoyable part is going home,."
bad,"They tried to steal my last pay check from me, they even tried to take me to small claims court however I had reported them to labor board , needless to say the court threw it out. Not to mention the most stressful job ever the owners do nothing they put all the work on their staff after upsetting customers with fake promises."
bad,"Horrible company, horrible managers , they treat you like garbage. They don't care how you are treated, they give a ton of pto days but no time to use them. They lack at continus training and consistent training across the board. They fire people when they have over hired new trainees."
bad,"The pay is significantly less than what anyone can make as an agent. The reality is you will get back what you put in, and in order to make decent money you will need to put in alot"
bad,"No real employee benefits or even discounts. Rules consistently change for qualifying lines of insurance and customer discounts forcing Sales Agents to do a bait and switch. Rates are not competitive unless customers are a older (but not too old) married couple, no kids, homeowner with fantastic credit. All insurance companies are greedy but I’d say Allstate is greedier than most."
bad,"You get customers screaming at you every day. Your manager does not help you if you need help. They get mad if you take more than 2 minutes between calls even if you are fixing stuff on a claim. Every department expects you to do their work. Benefits don't cover anything. They make you make up time if you are late if they allow it. For more than 2 minutes, you have to make up 15 no matter what. Anything over is what you have to make up or it's a day that you left from work. They don't care if you are past your shift. You have to document when you go to the bathroom. It's ""personal time"". You can't have more than 13 minutes a day. They are more focused on numbers. They don't care about quality. They are more worried about quantity. If you want to feel like you are nothing and don't matter, work here."
bad,"They throw you to the wolves from day 1. Nobody is willing to help you learn and train for the job role in claims. Management will openly talk about you or other, so the entire office will hear. Management from the top down is very manipulative and back stabbing. The office as a whole, is in constant turn over and its for a reason."
bad,Management hired sketchy people to work in the office and wanted me to be a telemarketer. Not my idea of being an insurance agent. Management was lazy and unproductive or motivated.
bad,"Working in my office used to be enjoyable.  Our job roles were clearly defined, and the workflow was organized.  Now we no longer 'own' our work-- bits and pieces of our job were outsourced or sent to work groups for people in other parts of the world to complete.  We are no longer encouraged or allowed to think independently in our job roles.  Grossly micromanaged.  Avoid."
bad,"•This company is far BELOW State Farm or Liberty Mutual. NO year end raises, NO company bonuses.  The building is OUTDATED!!!!!!!!! "
bad,Competitive and hateful coworkers.  Unrealistic expectations in the claims environment.  Tons of politics and favorites being played.  False sense of opportunity.  Spare yourself and look elsewhere.
bad,"I would never recommend my worst enemy to work there. There’s no sense of doing the right thing, ethics, integrity or a team atmosphere.  No honesty, no transparency, no communication except behind your back.  Manager is poor mouth.  Lied about bonuses and commissions.  Just keeps it all for his self. He’s fake and not very smart.  It was tortuous to have to work in such a negative, high pressure and stressful office.  So glad I was offered opportunity with a solid company."
bad,"Stressful work environment, non inclusive culture, hardest part of job disrespectful customers, no enjoyable part of the job, management does not care"
bad,"They don’t care about you! Don’t want to see you advance. The management is terrible, don’t listen to the employees only try to get people fired. Don’t want to see you advance"
bad,"micromanaging at its finest, pay is far too little and I was ""sold"" the job prior to saying yes then all of a sudden oh we have to be here earlier than you were told every morning, oh we split quotes coming in but in reality you fight for everyone you get. Oh we aren't giving you leads because you coworker has higher closing ratio than you so we will give her the warm leads and you get the cold ones but you know you should have a higher close than her. It is honestly a mess and I wouldn't send my worst enemy there."
bad,No work/life balance. Management is unprofessional and hostile. They will yell at you in front of others. No mobility for advancement. Don't recommend
bad,The training is horrible I really dislike the job I look for a new job all the time the management sucks they don’t know anything and too much volume on one person
bad,This is one of the worst companies to work for.  Way too many people in charge and not enough ants in the race to see what really goes on.  Constant dishonesty with the clients and their employee.  They expect you to sell your soul for sale.  Life life life is all they know.
bad,"I have 18 years of legal experience and I've worked in 4 insurance defense firms in the past, but I have never worked in a sweatshop before! That's what Allstate is about! The money and the numbers and they work you to death for $20 an hour. The attorneys get 40 to 50 cases a week and I work for two attorneys so that means I get 80 to a 100 cases a week that I have to on along with my attorneys. The workload is unrealistic! You get written up if you don't work faster! You have over 200 tasks weekly with unrealistic due dates that are computer generated on top of the work that your attorney gives you.... they don't want to give you overtime to catch up because they expect you to catch up during your 8-hour day which is impossible! You are a legal assistant with many paralegal duties but you don't get paid paralegal money... one of my attorneys is new fresh out of college and she likes yelling at me whenever she please. When I complain to management they just sweep it under the rug and do nothing about it, or tell me to work faster or they blame me for the attorney being upset. My other attorney is nice. You are not respected! Do not apply to this company! It is literally the worst place I have ever worked for! They lie to you during your interview and tell you the pay is low because the benefits are wonderful! But that was all a big lie! The benefits are worse than the benefits I have received at a small insurance defense firm.... not to mention their computers, monitors, and printers are old and are always breaking down and you're constantly frustrated trying to fix them because"
bad,"I worked for this company for more then a month. They paid for the training to become an insurance agent. I was not able to pass the license test. they then told me, thats fine we have other positions. i then became a telemarketer, cold calling to Florida, also Nevada. It was chill up in till they lied to my face.  was telemarketing for only a week, then they told me as i was just walking into the office, that they needed to talk to me. I said sure. Walked in and the recruiters (not the actual boss ) told me today is my last day. I asked them why. I was #1/#2 for the passed three days calling companies. then they said it was a ""Mutual Decision"" to let me go......what exactly does that mean, so i asked again what does that mean, a ""mutual decision"" of what?  The recruiters replied the same, its just a mutual decision. I dont understand why they cant explain the reason to let me go."
bad,"I have worked for 5 Allstate agents with 3 of them being within the same family.  Most of these agents don't train you and are barely in the office.  They send you to school through Allstate for 2 weeks or have you learn through modules on the computer.  Base pay, if any,  is so low you can barely afford food on your table.  If you have a family don't work here. You will be homeless. The leads are recycled leads and no one ever answers their phones. Michigan has the highest rates in the nation so with Allstate already not competitive, don't expect to make anything but your base of 1600 a month. Most Allstate agents are fraudulent and write policies with coordinated medical when they know the health insurance companies won't cover the medical bills from an auto accident. They take forever in their claims process and due to such high rates the consumers could care less about the value."
bad,Basically you need a $4 million book of business anything less is setting you up for failure. The ECP Program is robbing Peter to pay Paul. New agents support is non existent. Under $4 million book your a slave to the stupidity of the  powers to be at Allstate. I played football and you are given a playbook to use. Throughout the season you make adjustments to the playbook. The morons at Allstate can regurgitate their playbook but do not have the mental capacity to think outside the Allstate playbook. They will say whatever it takes to get new agents. Do your homework the numbers they will show you will be near impossible to meet. Run for the hills
bad,"I paid for my own classes and licenses, I didn't get paid for the 40 hour week it takes to ""TRAIN"", I got paid HALF of what I can make WITHOUT the licences I have now. It's a very cut throat job and TERRIBLE JOB CULTURE. My boss was a JERK."
bad,The common impression of Management is that they are immature and demonstrate a  lack of knowledge. . Unprofessional environment.People are promoted on who Management is friends with and not merit.
bad,"Micromanaged to the extent of worrying of you can use the bathroom."
bad,Working at Allstate was one of the more slow paced jobs I have had in the past. If you love the cubicle life then this would be the job for you. It is not a job I would recommend.
bad,I worked at two different Allstate companies and both had very naive business people and very unprofessional people. At the first Allstate I was worked at the manager was stealing my production. Beware!!!
bad,My Manager did not understand the software or how to use the computer.  It was difficult to work for him.  The company was a good company but The agent was very poor at his job
bad,"The management here are young, inexperienced. They lack, as an organization, in so many areas. They also don't care about their top performers. Favoritism is very high in this workplace. Very unprofessional environment. I see people running around in their socks, to say the least. Highly stressful and demanding with no rewards."
bad,I was hired as a non licensed agent told at the hire date I have 90 days to have my licences. but dates of employment. I was told another story that she wanted me to have my licenses within in 2 weeks and have the Level 1 (Allstate University) done asap. I asked when she would like me to have it done. I had the level 1 done within 2 days. and on top of studying for the P&C licences. Come Monday I was let go because she believes I could not handle the position. I am was thrown in knowing nothing. I had no orientation. The Allstate says you are in good Hands. Hahaha. not there you are not.
bad,"Retaliation is very high there is no open door policy, if you don't have a family member there you have a better change of being promoted if not then not so. Also they know how to promote around so they wont look so obivious but if someone investigated they would find this,"
bad,This job was a total deception.  I was told the agents wanted me to sell for them but I was constantly asked why they should give me the commission.  The agents nor anyone else cared as long as they were getting the numbers they needed.  This company is very self-centered.
bad,when you arrived you were there all day got a 30 min lunch break to sit at your desk and eat if customer walked in say good bye to lunch.  NO paid Time off if you took time you were always talked about
bad,"I was excelling and writing almost $100,000 a month but Allstate came down on us for a few policies and customers that lied about their coverages.  The company basically threw me under the bus"
bad,"Worst training, worst management, horrific practices, lack of leadership and care. A true sinking ship that you should not board no matter what you were promised because it is not going to materialize!"
bad,"Allstate rates are probally the highest in the industry. On average rates go up about 10 percent at renewal. They have unrealistic expectations. The lead systems they say they provide is usually 1-2 calls per day and usually dont even qualify for a company line. Allstate has too many stipulations and rules to even close business. Between the disqualifying and horrible prices you are lucky to sale 2 policies a week. They want 2 sales a day or 10 quotes or 100 outbound calls. That great when you have leads otherwise remember its 1-2 a day coming in, so be prepared to be a magician and pull it out of your hat or backside as it were  Go with Eerie or State farm as they are competitive."
bad,No morale awful manager that micromanages and constantly lies and they will deny your FMLA if your relative dies. The old regional claims leader was awesome. That new one they shuttled over from Bridgewater is a hot mess.
bad,"was hired with the intent to dissolve the department, then had to pick up duties of employees they fired without raises even if your work made up for it"
bad,"Ignorant Agents, very few (2 or 3 knows) how to build a team. Discrimination to the core!!! Not appreciation for hard work!! Agents needs training how to build a team and believe in people!! They are there for the money. Not yo serve and actually help customers. Very few Agents are willing to see you grow in your career. Lots of talk none True!"
bad,Allstate is a for profit insurance company so you need to be constantly selling products to more people. It is a waste of time to help current customers for producers who are paid on incoming customers.
bad,I would not recommend anyone work at Allstate Insurance. I have worked for them several times and their program is not user friendly and the management was poor.
bad,"Slow steady paced environment.  Great potential for learning.  Quiet environment.  Allstate is a wonderful company, will definitely recommend should you be looking for employment."
bad,I did not like working at Allstate. The work atmosphere was threatning. Managers from higher up would come harasss the owner agent with attempts to force him out of business.
bad,When I worked back east I enjoyed the people I worked with and the management.  The job itself was okay and the pay was low but it wasn't bad.  I came out west and it was a complete 180 in terms of work environment.  I couldn't wait to get out of there.
bad,"What kind of company puts tracking devices in their employee's automobile to spy on them during the work day?  What kind of company would install an agent who is clearly not a good fit, charge them 100k for the privilege, and hang them out to dry just to make short sighted metrics goals?  This company does!"
bad,"This company is a good one however the work environment is horrible. New management taking iver with little or no experience in the legal field, trying to push the seasoned employees out the door. They work you like a dog then discard you like trash."
bad,"Worked in an Allstate Agency for 14 years, 220 Commercial Lines Manager, no markets, Commercial Auto was not competitive, brokering companies were terrible( Northeast Agencies). Management was terrible. Allstate wants to recruit agency owners that know nothing about Property and Casualty Insurance. I guess Allstate wants to train them their way, smoke and mirrors. Plus, I don't know how Allstate got away with the way they implemented their rate increases back in 2012, used credit (illegal), some insureds got a 3% increase, some got 25%. I have readouts. I'm done with my rant : ), never should have stayed that long, that's another rant. If you take a job as a producing 220 licensed support staff, stay a year or two learn their system, then search for another position, but don't make a lateral move, move up."
bad,Not a great company. I was ripped off on my checks and bonuses and let go for things out of my control. I can see why her company is no longer in business.
bad,Underpaid and no work life balance. They do not pay you the commission which you deserve and you do not get to keep your book of business because they make you sign a non compete.
bad,Since this was a franchise I don't know how other offices are but this experience soured me on insurance after a 12 year career. I'd rather be homeless and panhandle than work in the insurance industry again
bad,The amount of work one does is not rewarded. They put you at salary and make sure you get no overtime even though you are asked to work more than 40 hours weekly.
bad,"It costs the agency owner zero dollars to bring on a new agent.  The whole commission only thing just means the owner doesn’t have to parlay out one nickel on you.  They promise you 100,000 like it is nothing.  The leads are all from poor areas of whichever state you are writing in.  No benefits whatsoever.  Training is done by a group of kids who cannot or have not sold even lemonade.  Alliance and computer software are ancient.  The owner would change his mind daily on how he wanted things done.  Agency owners here do not even need experience selling this product, just the bamkroll to open up shop.  Agency owners are just looking to get rich by playing the law of large numbers- hire a bunch of agents and hope they work out.  Favorites are played by agency owners and the good leads are directed towards their friends and/or the attractive women who work there.  These are the people making six figures and no one else.  Don’t say you haven’t been warned."
bad,"Just like the title says, don't expect to advance your career here. Only way you get ahead is by kissing up and even that doesn't work. Worked there for over a year and did everything correctly metric wise and never once was considered for a raise/bonuses. I wont employee of the month one time as well as metric goals for 3 months and still no advancement."
bad,This place likes to micromanage.   It's hard to move up unless you kiss up.   They don't have sick time so if there is not time on the Calendar it's an occurrence.
bad,Although the owner and his wife are good people the family that works on the inside they do not like outside people they are very cut-throat they will steal your cells and they lie all the time they're not very knowledgeable and they do things that are very much unethical.
bad,the company has a high turnover rate and lacks insight on how to retain hard workers. Salary is below average pay for adjuster position within the New York Market.
bad,"I was so surprised that every job offer came from allstate agents, want for you to advance their agency but not willing to pay for your knowledge, it was an error from my part"
bad,"The boss would change his mind every other day on the rules.   The boss wanted me to watch the other agents in his office to make sure they were doing their jobs."
bad,"They tout work/life balance, but in reality it is only considered when it benefits them.  Policies are inconsistent and selectively inforced. I would not recommend working for this company."
bad,"I haven't worked there in years, but I have several friends that still do and the morale is very low. I would not recommend anyone to work there. Poor management decisions."
bad,Phone calls and people coming in to change their policy in some way.  Management didn't manage.  The culture was to make money.  Seeing people who didn't understand the policy not being taken care of.
bad,A typical day a work consisted of managing a Insurance Agency. responsible for sales and employee production in all lines of insurance products. Very difficult with no control over rates.
bad,"Allstate is no longer looking to be the company that you can work at for life. They would rather have a cheaper, more mobile/young workforce that has no idea how much better the company once treated its employees.  The Allstate stock price seems to be their main focus."
bad,Management here has total power trips and is completely ridiculous.  I left the company because I was tired of the abuse.  The people that work there harass each other daily.
bad,"Never work there. Terrible management, horrible hours, low pay, stressful, and bad culture. Management is always on your back because their numbers are always down and they come down on you. Work every other weekend. No work/life balance."
bad,a okay place to work but not ideal I would not recommend this place at all to anyone any would not suggest based upon stress level this job brings or the requirements
bad,"I think that they are an extremely unfair company to work for.  They expect A LOT and give back very little.  No benefits,  poor salary and high stress.  It's also very slow paced and their systems and lead sources are seriously outdated."
bad,owner stole my comp that he promised had multi-able law suits from past agentsLied about comp plan worst job ever worst job ever i would nevr work for private owner again
bad,"Watch your back here, If your not part of the good old boys club your not worth the time of day. case in point Lead tech continuously disobeyed the not touch orders and would take down systems during working hours yet my team was scolded for putting a label on upside down after a long 12 hr shift."
bad,"Frustrating, poor management, favoritism, upper management promotes follow ship not leadership, does not appreciate talented people is almost like they enjoy having paycheck collectors. Very sad."
bad,"Promises promises...never delivered . Supposed to work with allstate agency owners as part of this great team concept. Never happened, the Agency owners are held hostage to do a certain $ amount yearly in Financial services, they could care less about Financial services for their auto customers, but it is an all or nothing for their yearly bonus. So they scramble at the end of the year and write life policies on friends and family to get bonus. They could give a rats behind about truly working with the Financial Representative who is assigned to work with them."
bad,"Difficult hours and shift"
bad,"owner agent  keep doing against compliance, he already got terminated from HQ. now re-openned business under spouse's name, but, still doing same thing against compliance. terrible people."
bad,Not a good place to work for. Pay is proverty level. They do not care about their employees. Never give out bonus and my boss gives me so much work to do that tts overwhelming..my boss doesn’t do much and puts everything off on me while only paying me $10 an hour. I’ve omly gotten 1 raise in 8 years and I’m the one that does all the work. It’s completely wrong. Agent blames everything on me even when he’s at fault. This is the worst place I’ve ever worked. I don’t recommend anyone working here. They do not care about their employees . Agents need to start valuing their customers. Also stop putting so so much work with me.. I don’t know how people consider working here.   Allstate has become greedy and are raising premiums on.everyone
bad,"Terrible company to work for.  People yell at you and are nice to the customers.   There is micro-managing and negative reinforcement in training. "
bad,This is the worst Insurance job on the Planet. I would not wish Encompass Insurance on my worst enemy. Everything about it is awful. I believe that this is one of the most unprofessional places I have ever worked.
bad,Worst job inhave ever had. Lead Agent constantly changed rules to benefit others. Did not follow through on incentives. Very low pay and terrible training.
bad,"Stressful business based on metrics. Workplace culture is not the best. No tools to advance, more based on who you know as opposed to who can do the job"
bad,"I can honestly say leaving Allstate was the best thing I could have ever done. It is a highly stressful work environment & I can't imagine anyone loving to work there. They are highly cutthroat & even if you always meet your metrics, miss it a few times after hitting it for years, watch the outcome. Not a company I would go back to for sure."
bad,horrible management and lack of knowledge and customer service from the management and training staff. they do not care about the customers just making sales.
bad,"As a LSP you recieve no benefits and bad compensation unless you produce over 10,000 in new business each month. The managers are employed to fire and rotate staff keeping a fresh office with producers. If you not producing your not getting paid and you will be fired soon after."
bad,"Allstate insurance is not competitive in price and qualifying potential clients in Florida. "
bad,was a racist agency owner. Didn't like to offer business to ethnic customers. He required office bible study once per week. He was very unfair to the women. thats why the office closed down.
bad,The Human Resource department had poor leadership which trickled down throughout the HR department. With the lack of leadership it made it very hard to build skills needed to succeed.
bad,"This place has a terrible management. They have their own group and if you are not part of it, they will make your life impossible for you to leave the office. All the attorneys here are incompetent and a pain in the neck.  Avoid this place at all costs. The staff is always wrong and the attorneys are always right. That is their mentality and the truth is that most of the time the staff is correct. Depressive place to work.  Salary is also low and no bonus."
bad,I was stuck cold calling for 8 hours a day. You do learn a lot about personal communication but be ready for the grind. You get told no constantly. Push yourself.
bad,"No new leads only existing customers and customer calling in.  Low pay and little benefits.  Poor management, no raises and commissions depends on a point system."
bad,Poor business management. They did not have any marketing skills or training that was helpful. A lot of false expectations were given from the beginning and the whole thing will fall apart soon.
bad,"general filing and answering telephone calls. Faxing, copying, making payments are all part of your typical work day. Nothing exciting but insurance is not supposed to be"
bad,"The commissions are 2 months late, never on time, they'll try to cheat you out from paying commssion, financial at Allstate are idiots and the worst are Allstate Benefits they pay 1% commission."
bad,Management needed to know your exact location at all times of the work day which adds one more layer of aggrivation on top of an already stressful job
bad,Manager was really bad. Would not ever work for Allstate again. Sales are few and far between because they did not always offer the best rates or products.
bad,Worked at the same place for 5 years. Agency was extremely successful but the money did not trickle down to the employees. Didn't know any better and wasted 5 years of my life in a dead end job
bad,"Very cut throat company with poor management decisions. Do not believe the story they tell you about agency ownership. Allstate causes agents to pay for management's failures.  They want you to invest your retirement savings, and then you waste it marketing for them while they use their internet and 800 numbers to compete against you. It's a poker table with great marketing to prey on those who want to own a business. As a ""Captive Agent"" you will be a small boat chained to the bottom of a very large ship; when they start to sink, you are pulled under first! Heed this warning. Don't fall for it!"
bad,Stressful work environment with unrealistic expectations.  Management did not listed and were unapproachable or willing to listen to suggestions for change.
bad,"Management is awful"
bad,"At first it was fine, now everyone is waiting for the other shoe to fall. We have had major lay offs and lots of upheaval. I wouldn't tell my worst enemy to apply."
bad,Great company and products for customers not reccemonded for an employee. Working as an employee was difficult and the support system was faulty. Underwriters were impossible.
bad,"I am not interested in speaking about my position at Allstate.  It was not a professional business environment,the small agency had the highest turnover of any company I have ever worked for."
bad,"Even though you think that working for a P&C agent would be very helpful in terms of getting customers, think again. The agents feel that the advisors are their adversaries and only out to take money from their pocket. Even though they themselves can't or won't sell financial products like life insurance or mutual funds, they strickly stick to selling P&C products. So not much help from them or their staff who really doesn't care as long as they get paid."
bad,"Millennials run the place and have absolutely no idea whats going on. Just keep drinking the kool-aid, the management from the top on down is all about the quantity, not quality."
bad,There are good Allstates to work for in the area. I have worked for a few. There is one that is so bad even their customers hate them. The customers go to the other Allstates because they refuse to deal with them. The workers there are nice but the owner is horrible. Filled out reports daily of customer complaints for the owner.
bad,"No chance for advancement, but as you already know, all offices were independently owned and operated. I happened to work for one of the bad ones. Better luck next time."
bad,"Unless you plan on owning your own Allstate Agency, do not waste your time working for an agent. There are no benefits such as group health or 401(k) Plans. Allstate's Insurance Premiums are more expensive than other insurance carriers. The company's sales strategy is to up sale to justify the higher cost of insurance and does not work."
bad,"The most awful place I have ever worked, the owner would guilt you into doing personal stuff for him as in church etc... he wouldn't give pay raises at all.."
bad,"As a telemarketer, we didn't get much. The job was pretty simple, but we were the ones that got the brunt of those who did not like our cold calls, and we didn't get much for the leads we did provide."
bad,"Pay is no where near what it should be for the work put into this position. Effort does not reflect the compensation. Unless you plan on owning your own agency there is no room for advancement and no incentive to increase pay. Management made this position unbearable. The amount of micromanaging and degrading was enough for 6 employees to leave in 4 months. If you enjoy cold calling and telemarketing for 8 hours straight during the day, this job may be for you."
bad,I learned a lot about commercial insurance and underwriting.  Was very micro-managed.  The workplace culture took a severe decline the longer I was there.
bad,"Not my cup of tea, liked helping customers who were in accidents and needed assistance ASAP, but as far as the company, not so much. Thought that they would be better."
bad,"If you like working hard to make your boss rich this is the place for you. no benefits, zero job security. You do not work for Allstate if you work at an agency , you are working for the agent. "
bad,Doesn't hire quality candidates - just tries to fill seats. The work of performers suffers due to having to do the work of non-performers and the lack of leadership and management's refusal to deal with the non-performers. Very stressful environment that spills over into home. Many coworkers began taking medications to deal with demands of work. Not unusual to see coworkers crying at their desk or binging on junk food. A good raise may be near cost of living increase. Performance measured by arbitrary goals.
bad,The management at Allstate in the specific area I was in was not good.  They are not organized and are not flexible with employees.  They push you hard to sale but do not care about employee's home life.
bad,"A typical day at work was very relaxed."
bad,"Horrible.  Hypocritical Librals,  Not for me. Coworker tired to run me over with her car in the parking lot and i was treatedpoorly for filing a police report on the matter"
bad,"The customers can get away with murder, but the employees are micromanaged, nitpicked, paid the lowest possible for their field of specialty.  Raises are so low usually between 1-2% a year.  You work like a dog services the customer and put in extra hours that you don't get paid for, but you're treated like everything you do is wrong."
bad,The pay was horrible. The Managers weren't a good team.Very cut throat environment. Favoritism was ridiculous and very unprofessional.Cold calling sucks as well!
bad,"every day the senior sales representative told us she had 15 years experience, she criticized my make up, clothes, hair, every sentence I made all while shopping on line and talking on the phone to her children,  I was only allowed to do cold calling and to a list where no one answered I was required to repeatedly call it.  In so much as I was suppose to be trained to be an agent I was given a script to be a machine in case I did get an answer.  When trying to be myself and creating a repore I was beat down.  Success is not for the new person just her and the owners son."
bad,"Would not want to go down this path again, looking for more freedom and opportunity. Very rigid guidelines and underwriting requirements to close a deal, very old technology. Bureaucratic processes slows down deals."
bad,The agent never paid me for two weeks of work and when I complained to Corporate I was fired. Still have not received pay!! One of the worst managed companies I have ever worked for!!
bad,"Strict Company, Does not like to approve a lot of businesses. Bad guidelines, bad claims service. Barely able to sale to any businesses because they do not like risks."
bad,Lots of bullying by co-workers and management that was just swept under the rug. No work-life balance.  You can only advance in the company if you are friends with or dating/married to the right people.
bad,They fire people quickly and they hire temps for only a month. I did not like the unstable and over bearing of the manager that was there no respect what so ever.
bad,I would never want to work at this hospital. Former employees try to micromanage new employees and that created a very uncomfortable working environment. Very chaotic and disorganized.
bad,The company did not take the time to understand what we did for our agents and insured. Management was very poor and long distance it was very stressful and Allstate just did not care.
bad,"I've been with Allstate going on 3 years. The only way to make more money is to quit and go back. If you leave they will hirer you back as a senior adjuster acutally making 60 plus a year. You get Cat pay which adds an extra 15-30 thousand to your salary. Per diem is 41 a day total, so your eating fast food to get by, they put you in decent hotels with a cap of 130 a night, and fly you to the location and include rental car and gas."
bad,"The owner is not a people person, so business died down because of his rudeness he had with the American customers. The rest of his clients were foreingners that needed his help and just had to tolerate his behavior."
bad,Company only cares about cutting costs. Does not care about it customers nor its employees. Put people in management positions that have no clue on how to communicate with people or even how to deal with situations.
bad,"Poor management, you will get promoted if your in the club. New management is going to RIF the auto division. Back stabbing, lying, cheating organization."
bad,Worked for a small Allstate office and there were not enough employee procedures. If you sold more than others it seemed you have more privileges than others.
bad,"This one in englewood closter and 32nd new york"
bad,"My father was an Allstate Agent for 38 years , and in that time period he has always told me that Allstate has the worst Management of any Company in the United States. "
bad,The over all job was and probably still is terrible. Working for Allstate Corporate would probably be a better opportunity. Working at the agent level was a waste of my P&C license.
bad,Working for this company expect to be burnt out and overworked. The company only cares about productive and numbers. Only promote if they like you. If you have any college background please......stay far away from this company. The individuals that are in mgmt doesn't have any college education however are responsible for your future. If you want to work for insurance please go to Progressive or AAA...where they actually pay you a decent rate. Oh yeah you will have no personal life once you work here. Your coworkers will throw you under the bus to make themselves look better for mgmt.
bad,"This place doesn't care about their employees. As long as there are butts in chairs, they seem to be happy. I do not recommend this job to anyone with a family."
bad,"There is no such thing as a work/life balance at Allstate.  You only advance by who you know.  Every single individual in Management is corrupt.  They make you tell very particular things to customers which in turn makes the customers yell at you.  But if you don't say exactly what management tells you to say then you will get fired.  You are not in ""Good Hands"" with Allstate.  This is the most untrustworthy and corrupt company someone could ever work for."
bad,"I've worked in the Charlotte Claims department for 2 years now. This has got to be the most unprofessional place I've ever worked in my entire life. Most of Managemnt  is a complete joke as well as the work load. They expect for you to do so much on every single claim and ""connect"" with the customer but you're given unrealistic goals. Allstate likes to pride it self on being a great company but trust and believe you're not in good hands. Adjusters are told to open up every single coverage on a claim.. Which can cause premium increases. The Charlotte MCO plays favorites and its not what you know but who you know environment . My advice to people applying.. Get your experience and get out!! You know it's a bad place to be when senior adjusters who have been with the company for 30 plus years tell you to quit before your 5 year mark. The PTo is good, you start with 21 days pto but considering the amount of BS you have to deal with its not worth it. There are Customer service surveys which are silly and it actually effects your raise! If you're not in a committee.. That effects your raise too. My advice to Managemnt: GET A LIFE! And Start listening to your employees. The pay is below average, the benefits are not that great.. They decrease them every year. Allstate is an extremely unethical company.  I'm also planning my escape!"
bad,I did not like the owner and manager of the Allstate office I worked at. I am so glad I do not work their anymore. It was a small office and I liked my one co-worker. He was helpful unfortunately he was overworked and could not help me get acquainted with my new job.
bad,"Training leaves little to be desired.  Taught in a rush situation as the employee was moving to another position.  Heard all the negative comments and warned about the job and people who work there; even told by other employees they would hate to have the job for which I was training.  Claims department has cliques and back  stab each other.  Many employees quit due to stress, lack of compassion from the office supervisor; only interested in the profit margin and employees staying at their desk to receive phone calls.  New, younger employees don't speak to you unless you are a part of their team.  You accrue time off, but if you take it you get swamped with work when you return.  Super stressful environment and very little respect.  Your job is for Allstate's benefit only and that's all they care about. Employees that have been there for awhile only stay because they can't quit due to high cost of personal health insurance."
bad,The owner does not care about employees and degrades you behind your back to other employees. So in turn he pretty much talks about everyone. Hard to work for someone who does not appreciate you.
bad,"I had worked my entire career in life insurance and investing. Working for this company was horrible.  It sounds great when the managers tell you what is going to happen with leads.  The P&C agents are forced to do a quota of life and financials to earn the bonus they need just to keep a float.  The bonus is unfairly biased in that they keep putting more and more restriction on how to earn it. "
bad,"Allstate Insurance is not a loyal longterm employer. "
bad,"I was with an Allstate agent for a very short amount of time. When they let me go they stated it was because I was not a good fit for the agency. How can you get to know someone's individuality or what they can bring to the table after only a month, two weeks of which was spent in training? I know this is not a reflection of the company as a whole however I would not recommend the particular agency I was with to anyone. Very very high turnover rate, no time to breathe. I can only list cons unfortunately sense I was not there long enough to establish any pros."
bad,"do not work for this company - they are not employee or family friendly.   they will find a way to make up things to get you fired.  again, do not work for this company.   dishonest and corrupt"
bad,"The current moratoriums in place prevent writing many types of business.  This company uses consumer reports, MVR and prior insurance to determine who they will insure.  This eliminates many people.  Also, the rates are higher than many other insurers so producers are at a disadvantage."
bad,Management only cares about bottom line numbers.  Half of the employees have to make up for the half that don't collaborate.  I was required to break state statutes in order to meet goals set by management.
bad,the same type of sales job you get a lot of incoming phone calls. easy product to sell. Sell home auto and commercial. Like I said before a typical insurance agency.
bad,"Trying to ask questions to the managing sales producer, but constantly finding her unavailable.  Trying to talk to the Agent was also difficult as they were constantly together behind closed doors. Very low morale among the entire staff of 5."
bad,"allstate overall is ok , it all depends on how professional and knowledgeable the agency owner is and also if they have your best interest at heart."
bad,"A typical day at Allstate, starts with me clocking in and opening up my gateway and E agent screens. I like to go through my emails to see if any leads have been sent  to me. I make calls based on what was sent. I also contact customers for policy reviews to go over policies and see if there are any concerns or cross sales needed. I quote inbound calls inquiring about AP&C insurance. I also cold call based on leads given by the  agent. I have learned so much, I learned first of all how to deal with different personalities. I have learned how to multitask. I have learned product knowledge. I have learn professional telephone etiquette. The hardest part is the pressure of sales, you always want to hit your target. The office flows better when everyone is on one accord. The most enjoyable part is the people I work with with and the customers. I love pleasing the customers, I try to treat them like I would want to be treated."
bad,Training could be better at allstate northern ireland. more support and mentoring would be an idea in future for the company
bad,My Boss was very rude to me and cussed profoundly in the office. He was just overall very unprofessional and happy I left. If you value personal time this will not be a job for you. When numbers are low your forced to work longer hours. No consistency and business is very slow.
bad,"Was chained to a desk making 200-300 phone calls a day. No help and or experience from the agency owners. Not trying to bash Allstate all that much, just the owners did not know what they were doing."
bad,Allstate has an emphasis on educating new hires on the culture and value of their business. They have multiple offices in Central Ohio that provide a prospect the opportunity to find employment in their area.
bad,It was a very disorganized place to work as it was a new agency and it took along time to try to get it started but it ended up closing.
bad,Working for this company gave me the confidence to provide accurate and detailed information to prospective clients about their auto and home insurance. I was given the opportunity to expand my knowledge of the insurance industry and work with a great employer. The hardest part of my job was simply trying to explain the advantages of great coverage with a reasonable premium and the potential client not accepting the policy offered.
bad,"the agency owner promised pay and benefits that were  never given.  Very unpleasant person to work for. Expected you to work nights, without being compensated but docked you for snow days, he did not open office."
bad,"This company is the worst of the worst.  You will go broke working for them by needing to spend your own money."
bad,"This company was based on collecting debts. I did enjoy helping clients to set up payment plans to pay off outstanding debts on credit cards and medical bills from the U.S. My coworkers at this job were okay but the culture of the workplace was far from positive and encouraging. It was a basic call center environment so i learned to speak with people on the phone, manage files on a computer, set up payment plans and manage clients payments. It was a good work experience overall."
bad,"Very friendly work environment,"
bad,Both Farmers and Allstate have poor management and retention with local agents and employees.
bad,He will not pay you correctly. He lies to you. He will lay you off because he is a broke fool.
bad,Keeping busy but quite....no co-workers only an agent. Lonely job too much pressure trying to sell a product not worth your tine.
bad,"good day"
bad,"Great Company, Great Benefits Great benefits and ;longevity with this company"
bad,great benefits and location great staff andgreat customers
bad,back to last review on allstate I made this review the first time
bad,Terrible job alot of lies in the company. Hours were okay I worked 8-5 for a temp agency
bad,"At Allstate you do not get a raise based on how hard you work."
bad,nothing that I can rememeber nothing nothing nothing nothing
bad,I did not like working here. I did not enjoy it. It was a bad experience.
bad,Selling the right policy as per customer requirement. Also recommending Savings due the multiple purchases. Explaining all the coverage and saving due to multiple purchases. No complains from customers due to right recommendations.
bad,"worst job i ever had"
bad,this company is one of the most unprofessional and unorganized companies I have ever been involved with.  let it suffice to say that this company has succeeded in spite of itself to date.
bad,"I handle customers insurance policies from identifying their needs starting their policy and service as needed."
bad,Bed bugs the pay is very bad novo 1 allstate not a good look I hate I hate
bad,"Current agent with over 20 years with the company. You are a captive agent treated like an employee with no benefits. You do not own your book of business. Commissions rates reduced and will be reduced. You can be terminated without cause or reason with 90 days notice. Thousands of agents have been terminated in the last 4 years. Company mandates you roll over your phones when you leave the office. Phone center writes your leads. You get no commission. Independent agents get paid 15% new bus. and renewal commissions. Captive agents get 9%. Independents get a loss ratio bonus of over 11% on a million dollar book. This is over $110,000 (Per Year). Captive agents do not get this bonus. Independents own their book and do not have to get approval from the Region to sell their agency. The Region can approve or not approve a sale. Regions very often refuse to approve a sale with giving a reason verbally or in writing. Allstate is the last place, the last place to be an agent. Go independent if you can."
bad,"Terrible agent to work for. No benefits offered, low pay, nepotism etc."
bad,"I worked from 6:30 to 3:00, I worked Audits which required me correcting insured polices and issuing them the proper credit.  I enjoyed my co-workers, management not so much.  I was laid-off in May I was there for 14 years. I am glad I was laid off due to the fact I can now pursue my Culinary Arts Degree."
bad,"Out of the 32 trainees that started at the same time at Allstate with me two years ago, only two of these people are still at Allstate.  The atmosphere was chaotic. Allstate was big on ""cross-training"" their supervisors and managers, so the management was never able to learn their jobs, or more importantly learn from their mistakes, because they got moved to different departments every couple of months. "
bad,I worked there a month and they paid me under the table not giving me the correct about of money I actually worked.
bad,"Was a two agent office, then one of the agents got smart and severed ties w/Allstate. The remaining agent was very cheap, rude, and disrectful. His slob of a DM was even worst. The agent would come in late, take very long lunches, leave early, and expect you to run the place on your own. All for very little pay."
bad,Allstate agencies offer nothing to their employees but expect employees to go the extra mile. I worked for two different agents and had the same experience with both.
bad,Was hired here to sell insurance and was never given a chance to succeed. Was let go because the office wasnt making any money. Allstate does not have a competitive product.
bad,Mass exit of nearly half their agents in the last 8 years. Management from the top down have a totally negative attitude towards agents. Rates are extremely uncompetitive in most markets. Absolutely no benefits for agents. They just lowered commissions by 10%.
bad,"if you want to work somewhere for 3 or 4 years and get lied to then this is the company for you. no work life balance, don't get sick because they will expect you to work anyway. don't plan on getting promoted unless you are a certain race or liked by certain people."
bad,Not at all flexible with schedule. Requires a lot of customer service and sale skills.
bad,Worked as 1099 contractor for a franchised agency. Pay is low no benefits other than writing off expenses for taxes. Unless you work for an established agency and owner that values hard workers it is a waste of time. Very political environment.
bad,The company does not have much opportunity or room for growth. The management is not very fair. Not the best work environment
bad,banking appointments helping others all of the above no idea whatelse u want me to write here i just want to go to next step
bad,The company does not appreciate its employees. I would not recommend this job to anyone. I have been here 3 years and have been promised numerous raises but have not seen 1. i need a job where i feel appreciated and will provide me with the means i need to support and raise my unborn child.
bad,Allstate does not care about you as a person at all. They will do what they need to do to get ahead even if that means walking over people that have been there for years. They back door you on things and are never true to their word. They always leave you feeling insecure about your job.
bad,i had to call people all day and ask them if they wanted a free quote then transfer them to an agent who could further assist them. I learned to deal with angry customers on the phone. The management was ok not the best. The hardest part was sitting there all day in a room for hours talking on the phone. The most enjoyable part was my paychecks
bad,"Too many mergers and acquisitions with Home Savings of America, Washington Mutual took over and then they were bought out by Chase Bank. Irwindale call center closed and hundreds of people were out of work."
bad,Extremely stressful with high workload. Weekends and Holidays are required.
bad,The company was very unprofessional and with no benefits and there were always trouble that follows at this job
bad,"The agent that ran the office I worked for, was not really nice and not a family man. It was very push people to get insurance that they did not want."
bad,"Allstate as a company is more concerned about the bottom line. Working in an agents office, I did not get to see how it really worked in corporate, so my review of the company would only pertain to my experience within the three person office."
bad,"The Atlanta office has had an incredible amount of turnover and morale issues over the last 12 months-in all depts- especially sales and mktg. Don't walk. Run. Away. Fast. Talk to allstate agents in ga, sc, nc, al. They will tell you about that office."
bad,"What Allstate hiring personnel promise you on the front-end is very different what you'll experience when on-the-job. Insurance experience gained, but Call Centers are for those who've never worked before or retired grandmothers who just need extra spending $'s but not the job. Otherwise, if you work there, you're dignity and self-esteem will be squashed due to you're treated like a horse in a race= EVERY second of your time will be tracked, measured, graded. If you need to go to the bathroom at a time other than the 2 breaks, you'll need to 'electronically' raise your hand for permission. Any computer or phone problems will count against you. At the Allstate Claim Call Center, you're graded for speed, productivity for the company, not quality, thoroughness for the customer ."
bad,"Unrealistic Expectations. Trully a bad work environment.  The company has laid off many employees, closed many offices, is outsourcing jobs to india, many new hires don't last long, existing employees have been picking up the slack, internal auditing practices do not foster a positive environment. A lot of customer service issues.  Benefits are average for industry. No real bonuses."
bad,"Allstate looks for anyway to screw the agents.  No one in management has any accountability.  I has no email for 2 weeks and they have no explanation, called tech support the first two days.  Phone says no talking calls.  Talk to people in support and they tell you one thing, then the are wrong but I relied on that information.  Turns the people have no idea what they heck they are doing."
bad,"Management does not value differing opinions.  They prefer to have employees who agree with them and not offer differing opinions, options or process changes.  Very difficult place to work if you have a mind of your own."
bad,Pay is NOT all that great and raise is just a few pennies. Management plays favoritism and stresses you out with loads of work. The benefits have gone down hill and aren’t worth the hassle (medical insurance sucks)
bad,Dysfunctional work environment. Lots of misinformation and mind games. They talk a lot about work/life balance because there isn't any. They talk a lot about wellness because everyone looks beat down. They talk a lot about dress code because there isn't one. See how it works? Has a cultish sort of feel to it. Don't believe it? Go ahead...take the job. I dare you.
bad,"Don't do it, typical call center drama. Leaders have favorites and don't care about anything other than numbers. You will only move up in the company if yiu kiss your leaders tail. If the office drama isn't bad enough the ticked off customers and constant computer issues will do you in"
bad,"When you have been with a company for 15 plus years, you shouldn't have to go from working Mon-Friday to working every Saturday with a day off during the week.  And was only given a weeks notice to change our schedule and if you had plans on a Saturday was told oh well, you will have to change your plans or call in.   Management also told us that we could all be replaced.   They also blocked our PTO book so we couldn't take PTO on a Saturday.  Another manager's team continued to work Mon-Friday and they had let seniority and our PDS numbers was better than theirs.  That just goes to show you that Allstate doesn't care about there employees with tenure."
bad,"Get ready to work 12 hours per day plus weekends just to try to keep up with the overburdened workload.  No help from co-workers who will also be over worked.  Workers will retire or quit then never be replaced,"
bad,"The agency owner was mean and uncomfortable to be around. He gave the manager sales and would yell at the other licensed agents for not meeting his unrealistic goals. The agency owner didnt know how anything in Allstate worked and didnt provide us with any leads. Expectations increased DAILY while we tried to figure out how to operate his business for him. We had to research lead companies, figure out how to advertise for him, and magically come up with sales without any tools in place to make us successful. I worked hard for this agency everyday despite dreading going to work and feeling unsafe. Then I got fired for being PREGNANT, which is illegal by the way. Allstate has done nothing to help me with this tough situation, and they should be more careful of who they let open an agency to represent their company. Allstate does not care about agents and allow agency owners and management to treat employees however they want. Overall, it was the most unprofessional, stressful,  and the worst place I have ever worked in all of my sales experience. Just dont work for them."
bad,The Allstate Corporate office needs to evaluate the conduct of the owner and manager. Together they execute a systematic effort to terminate employees.
bad,"For Allstate to be a major corporation, I expected more career advancement opportunities to be available, especially for people who have the qualifications.  Instead, it is very political, and you must be a part of certain clicks to advance.  You can get a position if you know the right person and you don't have any experience, versus if you don't know the right person and you have experience.   Also, the lack of work life balance is very disappointing and creates a wedge between the management and staff. Coming from a major mortgage company, I expected Allstate to be in the rankings as it relates to benefits, career advancement, and work-life balance. However, the lack of leadership and leadership training places them below the competition in my opinion.  Lastly, the cleanliness of this company is horrible, as the employees experience roaches in the workplace making for an uncomfortable work environment.  What is disclosed about being in Good Hands, is really not what is experienced behind the scenes."
bad,"The major focus has been on avoiding issues and problems rather than addressing them."
bad,As an agent you needed to fit the click of Allstate culture.  If you weren't one of the good ole boys you were not going to succeed.  There was also no understanding for family emergencies.  Keep the business performing or you'll be shunned.
bad,"It was a nightmare. Teamleads are not helpful its not about the customer, its 100% about their daily numbers. They want to fire u for everyt3. They tell u to follow one thing then u follow it only to get in trouble because u should have made the conscious decision to incorporate something else, when u do that u still get in trouble. Teamleads and higher up ppl only like u if u suck up to them. It's horrible"
bad,"Management are terrible and do nothing to help progress."
bad,"I was paid 9 dollars an hour and was expected to do way to much work for the pay. It was a boring job and very little achievements, I would not recommend that it to anyone."
bad,"Allstate teams, in many cases, are trying to become Agile. However, there seems to be a lack of training for Product Owners. The Product Management area is minimized or doesn't exist. The workplace culture seems to be a defeated attitude of resources feeling they are not empowered to change things for the better. Management expectations do not align with resource capacity and budget constraints. High stress environment with poorly managed teams creates an unpleasant work place."
bad,Selfish Management that only cared about their own personal interests and not the company as a whole. No training system as employees have to figure out what works for them. Rampant racism toward people of color. Unlawful practices towards employees in terms of workload and job descriptions. Disgusting. Human Resources HAS to be more involved
bad,"Constant fire fight of emergencies. Expert knowledge ignored. Root cause must be politically correct, not true cause. Always acceptable to blame DBA when not the cause."
bad,"All state over works their employees and manipulate the pay scale by using job titles that pay less. As an example, they call their legal secretaries administrative assistants so they can pay them less. They trap employees with their good benefits, but the stress of the job is not worth it. If you are out of the office on vacation, you will come back to work to a huge mess to clean up as no one will cover your work while you are gone."
bad,"It's an okay work-life balance. The PTO is great, but there is really isn't room for growth unless you are a favorite by upper level. The appreciation is mediocre"
bad,"Started out great, ended horribly.  Morale was horrific, micromanagement at its worst.  I had some wonderful coworkers, training was good at first.  Unfortunate ending to what I had hoped would be a long term company."
bad,"Claims office employees are treated poorly. Tenured employees are not valued. New hires have more opportunity and are respected more than loyal employees. Workload is beyond unmanageable and there is no such thing as work/life balance. Pay is not adequate for the hours an employee has to work to meet Allstate's requirements. The majority of the leaders in the claims office are not qualified for the job. Promotions are unfair and not given based on skill level or personal drive. Claims employees are held to very high standards and reprimanded when they fail to meet them, however, leadership does not adhere to those same requirements. This is a horrible company to work for and continues to get worse year after year."
bad,"Mass layoffs , no job security. Pay okay if considered for 8 hour work days , but be ready to work 10 hour days or more. Company does not care about their insured's just about profits."
bad,I did not enjoy working for this company. The owners told me several different things I would be able to do but after I got there their minds changed. Management wasn't what it should be. A lot of harassment towards the employees by the agent.
bad,"i have not yet been here 2 weeks and this has got to be the most unethical person I've ever worked for ..i literally was reprimanded for following company rules , the agent also writes bad business and falsifies documents I'm not sure how its still running"
bad,"I worked the call center in charlotte, nc it was the worst job i have ever had. People were doing drugs on 2nd shift and the managers did not care..HR is useless..its like a free for all to work there. they change what you should say every week to customers, it ALWAYS  headache..."
bad,This is an archaic sales organization with delusions that they have a better product. If you aspire to telemarketing please apply as the axiom of 100 calls a day to get 5 quotes for a single sale is an adhered metric.
bad,"In the big picture Allstate was a nice place to work. I, for the most part, enjoyed what I did. It would get monotonous, but there were different things that happen regularly so that helped. My co workers were very clicky. To get promoted its who likes you and who you know. There have been promotions for people who have been there significant less time than someone else, but because that someone else wasn't ""liked"" or as well known the job was given to someone else. Management is terrible. There were a few Team Leads who were open and honest. There big thing is Transparency, and let me tell you, don't be transparent. The way the office is run is semi organized, but felt very fake."
bad,The people who work at the bristol ct couldn't be nicer but the boss is too cheap to buy leads and the cold calls are the same people everyday.
bad,A very unorthodox work place. The boss doesn't care about the well being of his employees. Worse Job I've had but stayed with it to support my children.
bad,The company seems to be moving forward direction around its IT Vision but the staffing model and support structure has large holes to support the vision.  There are Huge gaps in the PMO process and how it relates with the business sponsors.   Work redundancy etc.
bad,"Telemarketing, cold calling. Your not an Allstate employee."
bad,"These people contacted me when they were understaffed and workload was high.  I outperformed their existing slackers on an exponential level.  The raises they promised me never came.  they were able to reduce work load by cancelling policyholders in FL resulting in the workload returning to a reasonable level.  Once that took place, they fired me.  I was a claim litigation specialist.  I was about 5 for 1 on wins/losses for trials.  I never made a mistake resulting in loss of funds for the company, while I watched their existing employees make mistakes that LITERALLY cost MILLIONS.  They SUCK, AND if you poll the existing employees their that are ""trapped"" because of the economy, benefits, etc, and if you got their honest opinion, they would tell you the SAME THING.  I CURRENTLY HAVE A WONDERFUL LAWSUIT PENDING AGAINST THEM THAT THEY DO NOT KNOW ABOUT.  ;)"
bad,"Company has no respect or concerns for agency force. Although you are, in the eyes of the IRS, Independent contractor, you are still viewed by the company an employee."
bad,A typical day at work is making outbound cold calls. The company as a whole cares about their customers and make sure they are given the upmost respect and customer service.
bad,"Allstate as a whole needs to filter out some of the dynamics. This is a nationally recognized organization; however they don't think enough of there employees to even give more PTO then 21 days in a 365 day year.I'm not going to elaborate on a situation. That isnt going to change by far."
bad,"Culture-  Allstate Field Sales ""Leaders"" are borderline narcissists who care about one thing- Money.  The Northeast Sales ""Leader"" who's name starts with a F lacks knowledge of insurance and monitors sales and numbers with an attempt to micromanage.  The culture within Allstate corporate is disgusting.  They will put you through training and emphasis customer service, and being a trusted advisor.  When you get on to the floor, all of that goes out the window.  Allstate's cronies who oversee the ""independent contractor"" agencies care about one thing and that is themselves.  The agency support specialists gossip and are highly immature."
bad,They sold company left employee behind. Don’t care of employees unless you sale and give no raises ! Slavs employees just go make agents happy give no bonus and pay no holiday
bad,Terrible environment. My agency owner suspended me when my MALE COWORKER sent me a Di*k picture. Awful. She blamed it on me for “taunting” him in. Wtf
bad,"Avoid this company at all costs.  They pay their underwriters about 60% of the national average, and their turnover rate is about 50%.  Poor training, favoritism, and retaliation by management for poor surveys.  They refuse to put things in writing to avoid accountability, same reason their agents are independent contractors.  They let the agents insult and curse at underwriters and expect you to be all sunshine and rainbows.  They change rules on a daily basis, and you are given an email for notice, and no burn in period to get used to the changes.  Benefits are mediocre at best, and the only way to be successful is to see something/hear something once and have it memorized.  If you miss one word, or have one detail not correct, you are giving wrong answers, and you are not given any time to write information down, or review to make sure you have correct information.  I cannot express enough how terribly this office is run if you have any other options, choose them."
bad,Allstate and Encompass are 2 different worlds. Encompass is owned by Allstate and has different rules.  There should be a separate review for Encompass.
bad,"The company focus is so number driven they forget their internal customers are actually human brings not robots. Employees are stressed, overworked and under paid. Heath insurance is so high your can't afford to be sick."
bad,Culture has changed from great to horrible. All decisions driven by bottom line & new presidents vision. Backstabbing & other poor qualities have become prevalent across the board.
bad,Employees complained and were very negative. The atmosphere was  depressing!! People hated coming to work. Very unrealistic expectations to get people to buy.
bad,"The ASIC department will at first seem very friendly, warm and fuzzy. They throw the word transparency around alot and make it seem like a great place to work. That flips 360 degrees as soon as training is over. You feel overwhelmed pretty quickly with no time provided to learn and improve. Most calls are telling the agents no to things and being treated poorly by the agents. Leaders are never around to handle irate agents, which we get alot. They tell you ""fake it til you make it"" and you learn 70 percent of the job on calls. You do start out with many days of PTO, which you will need to keep sane. Daily huddles are used to just talk about all the numbers that need improvement, barely being positive. Morale is very low within the staff and senior management has no clue about what the average rep's daily grind is. They watch EVERYTHING you do and micromanage it all. Numbers is all they care about, which seem unrealistic when you are understaffed and taking calls back to back for most of your average work day. You have been warned. Run!"
bad,"NO work life balance although they promote as such.  You work 10 plus hrs and 7 days.  the workload is horrible....do more with less is the mantra.  They let folks go and rarely replace.  Surprised they have positions available now.  Training sucks you are on your own.  Message to newbies......don't take the job then stay too long to move on, if you get too old and end up here for 40 yrs its your fault."
bad,I did not have a good experience at Allstate Financial Services. I would not recommend it. Corporate culture does not support entrepreneurship. I have nothing else to say.
bad,150 dials a day total joke glorified telemarketing encourages friendly intimidation base salary at some agency amounts to about 10 an hour unless no accidents no claims and excellent credit hard to write
bad,"Allstste was a horrible place to work. From the day you are hire you are set up to fail. There is very poor training and all manager go by their own set of rules.  The managers treat employees with a us/them mentality. There is poor management from top down. If an employee speak out, management will retaliate."
bad,"Just...don't. The manager might seem great, in which case continue with extreme caution. Once the temporary salary disappear it becomes extremely difficult to continue using their lead generator."
bad,"No opportunity for advancement,  high turnover rate was disturbing, but I found out why, personally,  before my year was up.   I would definitely NOT recommend working for Allstate as a career choice to any of my friends or family."
bad,Allstate didn't care about its employees. Leadership is a bunch of bullies that don't know how to lead people. They are totally ineffective and can't make their own decisions.
bad,The owner trained very little for the position and as part of a sales goal for my position as service was if you didn't reach the goal she took $250 out of your paycheck. Crazy
bad,"I have been with Allstate for 7 years as an inside property adjuster. They pile on more work than can be handled in an 8 hour day and then say  OT is avaliable, but only if you take on more claims. There is barely any advancement unless you know someone. Several people take a leave of absence due to the stress. You’re constantly arguing with people , your phone rings non stop. You’re expected to handle atleast 5 new claims a day, while also handling supplemental claims.  While also answering the phone. The metrics are very difficult to meet. You’re constantly being emailed or told of what you’re doing wrong. Upper management is only concerned about the numbers. The computer systems freeze or go down everyday, which prevent work from being done."
bad,"My minimums expectation was to sell two lines of insurance a day, do 10 quotes a day, or make 100 calls a day. I didn't meet my minimum daily amount of phone calls in the beginning so my manager upped my required daily amount of phone calls to 400/day so I could meet my quota. At this point, her expectations just became unrealistic. On top of this, she literally told me to my face I was the worst employee she ever had, I should pursue a different industry, and that the industry wasn't for me. Job performance related criticisms aside, your responsibility and duty as a manager is not to give your opinion of my fitness level for the industry OR to make deliberately hurtful statements about your subordinates. That is HORRIBLE management. Plain and simple. At the end of the day, maybe I wasn't good at the job. But..the boss sure didn't help!"
bad,Allstate has bad business practices. Fake introductory discounts to get you in the door. Agent puts himself on top of the pyramid and provided false promises of advancement or pay in order to string you along. Employees benefits are terrible if any at all.
bad,You will not Advance within six months of working at Allstate.  the management is very micromanage they are not friendly and they are very Cutthroats and cliquish.  The called environment have changed you have to work 5 Saturday straight before you can have a Saturday off that's not a very good work-life balance.advancement is possible if you know the right people and talk to the right people and that's sad because it should be fair for everyone to dance and move up if that's what they choose to do but if you do not talk to the right people if you do not speak to the right people then you probably will not Advance as fast as you thought you would. Allstate started out great but now it is terrible.
bad,"IT department is filled up with political poison with new management vs employees working for decades."
bad,when you apply for an agency just make sure you work for people that have patience to train new people because if your new to insurance your screwed and observe your surroundings... it was just very bad... very bad experience.
bad,"the position i had with Allstate was very stressful, i was overworked and discriminated against while working there. the was no opportunity for advancement and most of my issues there were ignored."
bad,I had a bad experience. I upset a co worker by not say good morning and she went and told the supervisor and lied about things  and I was let go after the supervisor made up other stuff also. It was terrible and very unprofessional.
bad,"Boss never bought leads, he only answered the phone id showed someone wanting a quote while employees had to find their own leads. no incentives less then minimum pay. withheld comissions and trips won by the workers. overall terrible boss at this agency"
bad,Underwriting was ever changing someone's during the same phone call. It always depended on who you got on the phone. The rules were ever changing and mostly wrong
bad,"The model the new  agencies are all using is heavy call volume phone sales. They will make you grind sales out of your friends and family, initially, and then make 100+ calls per day. The reality is that people believe what they see, and not what they hear. The picture sounds very rosy at first, but cold calling all day, trying to find someone who is willing to switch insurance companies is a drag. If you are serious about getting into insurance, you will get some good training, but will quickly realize that it’s time to go. The industry is changing to a direct buyer model, and Allstate agents are whistling in the dark."
bad,"Allstate created a Business Information Security Officer roll, and provided no job description, or management at all.  They provided no feedback on job performance, and, my manager, who was located at another location only met with me once for less then 30 minutes every two or three weeks."
bad,"Very stressful, poor management. Only cares about sales numbers even when allstates price is higher than what the customer is currently paying. Management plays favorites and never has answers for questions. Your opinion is not valued unless your a suck up. Certain managers are generally high while they are at work and for some reason others can't see it."
bad,"terrible management terrible place to work due to lack of honesty"
bad,You would not grow within this agency.  Commission wise she dies not give good commissiosns on what or how much you sell. She is hardly ever there.  Spends more time out if the office.
bad,"I find the culture to be very immature and unprofessional. From many colleagues we've all said the management in claims to be horrible. They do not care about their employees, the training is unorganized."
bad,"I remember starting at Allstate. I was intrigued and eager to learn as well as to be at work, but overtime that changed. I grew unhappy and hadn't even made it to a full year of employment.  I worked in the RMBC department where the retention rate is 80%. There are well over 10 Underwriting processes. But they don't tell you that when they offer you only 15.00 to start. Which by the way is deception #1. The training is poor. The instructor is clueless and is notorious for gossiping and getting ""even"" with those whom she isn't fond of. I guess if you are smarter than the trainer there's a lot of intimidation. The PCs are really old and abused. The RMBC department was pretty much given leftovers. Management is disorganized and just sort of wing things as they see fit. The morale is not there. People are coming to work for the money, not the passion for Allstate. I don't think things are well balanced in the RMBC department. During my time at Allstate I've witnessed several people quit before they even made 6 months with the company. That alone speaks volumes. The leadership is very demanding without understanding. They outage model and occurrence guidelines do not make any sense whatsoever. I truly hope overtime that those things will change. All in all I will never recommend anyone to work at Allstate. During my time there I've never so much in my life felt like I was working in a library due to management not liking anyone talking. I'm not sure to call it controlling or patronizing. But whatever it is the management must realize their children are at home not at work. There"
bad,Work environment is very stressful and there is no job security. The company is now being run in an effort to increase the stock price at all cost. Future employment at Allstate is precarious at best.
bad,"I do not want to write a review. My experience here was not the best with management, no advancement, and the pay was horrible. They want you to make numbers that are impossible to do with not enough time and many other things that you have to have done as well."
bad,"very boring after awhile, no new experiences. The goals are always unrealistic, when you perform better than the rest you are still scolded. Besides that the only room for advancement is becoming an Agency owner. There is better companies out there, but it also depends on who your manager is."
bad,"He frequently changed the rules, refused to honor previous commitments to commission, hours, and treated staff with utter disrepect.  He frequently broke many insurance rules."
bad,Allstate is not fair. it does not offer the qualified person to actually do the job. it does not give people proper notice to what is going on in the organization
bad,"Allstate cares more about profit margins to pad bonuses for Upper Management and Officers."
bad,"management has their favorites picked out from thew beginning and will only promote those people no matter if their are people with more degrees or who are more qualified. they claim to have full transparency and want employees to be honest about what does and does not work, however when the negatives are expressed you're automatically labeled negative. the pay for what is actually required is laughable the RMBC has an extremely high turnover rate, most new hires dont make it 1 month after training before wanting to quit."
bad,"The company overall has a good mission statement and tries to live into it. There is no way you are moving up in the company unless you are completely flexible with your time,..so in other words not ""older"" people with families. Unless your the friend of someone in management or dating them. The local office atmosphere is a positive one because they ""make it"" positive. You are encouraged to speak about better ways of working but only if you regurgitate all of the company culture language. The recent Tom Hanks movie ""The Circle"" is pretty much this company. This job is like a bad relationship where you are never good enough and there is always a complaint that you can do better even if all of your ""numbers""  are near perfect. As long as you can act like a pliable sheep with a blank stare, a fake smile, and sound like a robot you will do fine. The compensation is on the lower end of fair and the benefits are just average.  The over all company image outside of the local office  is great. The company has longevity and is one in the service of helping their customers in crises but only the bare minimum of help allowed.  If you generally like to help people its a great job, but please do not apply if you can't just read scripts. Don't show your own personality and for the love of God do not have an opinion of your own."
bad,"Unreasonable expectations"
bad,Allstate is very well known but terrible to employees. There are no excuse or exceptions for the behavior of unneeded management and micromanagement. Very hard to do a job when you are criticized for everything that you do. No matter if its a sick child at home or a spill that ruins documents on your desk. You are reprimanded via the worse thing you could have done.
bad,"Allstate is a great company to work for , if you do not have to work in the ""Express"" environment, which the Yuma location is. Express is nothing more than a call center. The lying, backstabbing, and manipulation that takes place within the leadership team sets the tone within the rest of the office. You will not have any opportunity for advancement unless you are one of the favorites. If the senior leadership team doesn't like you, they will find a way to get rid of you. If you are one of the leaders, you will need to live and breathe your job, work 60+ hours a week, and pretty much hand over your life to corporate America. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this place. You will be glad you did."
bad,There is no room for growth in order to make money you must be willing to submit to long hours. If you dont make the sales your salary will suffer. Not a job for everyone
bad,"I had to try to drum up leads myself or work phoning many lists. The ability to get to bonus was way to high. Company keeps hiring and then the people don't make bonus and they are gone.  I didn't mind the work if there was some sort of bonus to be made. I had a 440 and it didn't help me anymore than a job off the street.  "
bad,"Employees who give Allstate a rave review in in the 20% portion of the company's staff.  The 80% portion that really do the work either don't care as long as they get a pay check or mentally distance on the company.  Allstate took a rate hight in the state of Georgia at 25% to 65% and blame on the state insurance commissioner. Allstate blames the need of rate height on more people are driving due cheaper gas & more people are working.  Not because of claims.  Allstate took away employees Thanksgiving & Christmas off.  Allstate thinks that it is a company that has family life balance.  Allstate is a company that will penalize an employee if they are out sick. Allstate does not offer sick time.  Allstate gives an employee an occurance & forces an employee to the an vacation payment for the off.  Allstate gives their employees popcorn as a treate for working on Saturday or play bingo, hura.  Allstate moved into a new work location without bathrooms in the office space."
bad,"No matter how hard you work or how well you do you will only get ahead if you become friends with managers,getting any sort of promotion depends on who you know not on what you know."
bad,"Insurance, homeowners, and life insurance agent. Perform excellent customer service for walk in customers and via telephone. Provide with best quote rates for customer. Make endorsement and take payments. Also marketing."
bad,"Allstate system is set up to make you fail.  They give you 7-10 claims aday and expect you to stay as long as need to make the numbers or they give you 30 -60 days before they fire you.  The pay is not good compared to other companies.  This place is like a highschool.  They have clicks, and if you are not part of a certain click, they can care less and this is managerment.  This place needs undercover boss to come in."
bad,"I was at a West End agency for 10 months. The office had grown to 3 sales agents and a receptionist. We all had quotas. We each divided up the few call-ins for quotes but otherwise were given telephone lists to check against the NO CALL list, then call those that were not on the list. Few people even answered their phones. The few people that did pick up we were to read a strict message to gain their interest in an insurance quote. All 3 of us and the receptionist are long gone and now the owner has new chumps to try to meet their quotas."
bad,"A typical day at work just answering the phones and taking in payment, transferring calls as much as I could hoping the agents would ""be available"" for our customers. Most of them didn't want to talk to customers after they sold them insurance which I think is pretty rude."
bad,I enjoy working with the ladies at Allstate. I just feel as if there isn't enough room here for advancement with me being the new girl in town. The manager and owner are family and have worked together for many years by themselves and pretty much have a set routine which is awesome but there really isn't a lot of things that I can do due to their set routine and schedule.
bad,"work hard low pay, poor mangement, hire too many family members, managers hand picked and not qualified to manage. trainers not qualified to train new hires"
bad,"Bring yourself to work but only if your overall positive to the point where it hurts. With that said I did enjoy the people I worked with. I formed a great bond with people from my training class, and with other members on my team. "
bad,"Internal clients with applications maintenance, support and development. Created , developed software and applications for various Allstate departments. Enterprise Applications work supported "
bad,"You will be assigned more work than you can possibly keep up with--even when experienced.  You were be encouraged to take all your vacation time, even though there will be no way to catch up on your work when you get back.  You will feel that you should work through your lunch/breaks and/or work overtime to keep up with your workload, but if you do, you will also be chastised for that.  Its a no-win situation. No one will help you, although a manager may say that they will try to get more staff--it will not happen.   Manager may also say ""we are a family here"" - sure, the Manson family.  Run, don't walk away from this company."
bad,"If you have a disability of any kind you better be able to walk on water. "
bad,"- Prospect for new customers using computer and phone"
bad,"Management lacked vision. Operated on the ""Good Ole Boy"" philosophy. Highly political environment with a culture of back biting and stabbing."
bad,Overall Allstate offers a great product for a reasonable price .
bad,"the worst job i ever had duing my 25 years in insurance claims. as a former employee stated ""the company will leave you dead on the side of the road in a blink of an eye."" Take their training and then find a job somewhere else."
bad,"My co-workers were often very good and talented people, sadly, in some departments, 75% of the employees were layed off (outsourced)."
bad,It pays the bills sometimes. It is part-time with no chance of growth
bad,The insurance business is a generation behind. The culture was exhausting and meaningless.
bad,The management at the Tampa office does not care about the attorneys. You will work more than you have ever worked for less pay and no recognition. Management is incompetent. They have lost 8 lawyers in two years.
bad,"No inclusion, all employees are friends of the owner's family, very little training, manager is unknowledgeable but always insists she's right and is rude, owner is absent 90% of the time & does no oversight, refused reasonable accommodation for disability, customer service is seriously lacking, calls are not returned as promised, if primary service rep is unavailable manager will guess"
bad,"They do not, do not prep you for the amount of work you really have to do. You handle everything and I mean everything (contacts, inquiries, shops rental follow ups an voicemails, email, agent calls, liability, other insurance contacts other people’s work when they are out.) favoritisms is clear and shown. You ask for help and you are mocked by management and others. There is no sence of team when that all they push "
bad,I've had the most terrible experience i dealt with lots of racism but it made me stronger. i learned to show people with hard work what i am capable of achieving
bad,"The first few years were great  it was extremely laid back, very easy job and easy to excel at. A few years ago “Continuous Improvement” was introduced which kicked the department into overdrive. More rules and restrictions were placed on employees. It was no longer a laid back environment. The job became ridiculously stressful & no longer worth the time."
bad,"A great company once upon a time with great agents.  Unfortunately, corporate, in their desire to win-back market share abuses both agents and employees with an abusive, hostile, discriminatory, fear-based culture where gas-lighting is strongly encouraged.  I didn’t know such a primitive culture existed in today’s corporate culture,  but he** does exist on earth, wrapped in the mantra you’re in good hands."
bad,Agent owner lost in what direction to grow the company.  did not know essential data engines or how to work them.  kept changing my job description and direction to lead the team.
bad,"Working for Allstate was one of the worst experiences of my life. They are all about caring for the customer and employee, but really all decisions are made by the big wigs at corporate not keeping in mind either customer or employee. Whatever they can do to put more in their pocket they will do. They made our jobs so incredibly stressful and inconsistent that I was literally having to take certain medication to make sure that I was mentally okay ie I would take a call getting absolutely screamed at & start crying only to be told to get back on the phone in 5 minutes. I wouldn't recommend working for Allstate or having them for insurance in any situation. Since I started with Allstate, I've lost patience and am no longer an extrovert. Started as an extrovert left as an introvert. Probably from verbal abuse from customers. The only positive thing is that it gave me the experience I needed to move on to somewhere new that actually knows how to make employees feel valued."
bad,"Initially I was very impressed and felt privileged to be working a regional role in Allstate as an employee. Regional leadership non qualified, no insurance licenses or direct experience in the area they managed, and unethical. Employees were advancing due to nepotism, & nepotism. Tmiddle "
bad,"Company changed there 5 year plan every 6 months and started using agents as a profit center.  fake bonuses they had no intention of paying, mysterious chargebacks on December 31st"
bad,"Too much emphasis on metrics. "
bad,"The management is very sad. Immature, first and foremost. Bully mentality also. The top bosses are almost in a slave mentality in their thoughts towards they staff below them. I was truly shocked on the ethics of this company. I would never ever buy Allstate Insurance on any angle of their offerings after seeing how they operate. Typical corporate soulless large domination capitalism."
bad,It's a big name but to be a Financial Specialist is a horrible role unless you are already retired and you are looking to keep busy. Their model is horrible. They try to match you up with property and casualty agents who know nothing about financial products and half the time they write the business themselves vs. referring it to you.
bad,Each agency is privately owned but Allstate does nor provide alot of support. Their rates are shady and have vanishing offers so it is hard to keep customers
bad,No chance for advancement.  60 to 70 calls daily.  Only opportunity to help lower their bill was to sell them more insurance.  Which only upset the customer more.
bad,Unfair pay. Doesn't pay your worth. It's metrics driven. The pay is poor. The metrics are always changing. You have to ask every candidate if they have 100k in there bank account.
bad,"Would not recommend this company to anyone. 300+ cold calls per day to mostly unlicensed drivers, volatile management. Agent had a tentative grasp on the industry, just expected to buy the agency and make a lot of money with zero knowledge of how to run a business. Location didn't even have warm water."
bad,"The job itself is a good job even though it can be stressful at times but the franchise owner is a bully and throws tantrums and Allstate lets him get away with it and does nothing about it even though he goes through employees like underwear. You also receive no benefits, medical, dental, or anything."
bad,"managers only concerned with saving money for company so their bonuses are bigger.  they tell people primary concern is customer but when it comes to claims, they get bare minimum so they don't get in trouble with dept of insurance"
bad,My boss has bad money management skills and currently owes me two checks we only get paid once a month so this is really messing with my life. Since we work as independent contractors it is nothing corporate will do.
bad,The work place is very chaotic. Management allows its people to be overly abused by its customers. Work load is unimaginably very high that you don't have time for a break!
bad,"As a contractor you should expect to be lied to. Providing road side assistance has never had a bleaker outlook on communication. They will tell you that you can choose to refuse a job at no expense of you. They also tell you if you show up and can't perform the job due to certain circumstances they'll pay you anyway at no penalty to you. These will of course be lies. If you show up and can't perform, refuse a job, or get a bad review you will not be given any jobs for the next three days. You can not rely on this company to be professional."
bad,The management is very inefficient and out of touch with what it takes to succeed at business on a daily basis. The training is archaic and hardly relevant to successful partnerships.
bad,"Very rude staff, rude to corporate trainers, in-house trainers lack common social skills. Very poor customer service, should not talk about customers like they did."
bad,"It is a very stressful job. I have learned a lot of skills and you are critiqued on every thing you do. I have learned about production type work, developed a keen eye to search out problems. The hardest part of my day is all day, every piece of work that you touch could have the potential of being placed under scrutiny and you get dinged on minute issues. The most enjoyable part of my job was PTO and office recognition times which were far and few between."
bad,Don't work in claims if you're a creative or outgoing person.  If you have a family or a social life it will be ruined.  Prepare to give your life to a company that could care less about the toll it takes on the person.  They'll work you like a horse until something gives out then they quickly find a replacement.
bad,Half of the sales floor quit the week I quit. The sales environmernt was high stress and micromanaged. the bonuses were almost impossible to make. a top agent would make 1450 in bonus a month. and that was about all that was possible. The recruiters sold the job as the best thing since slioced bread but in actuality it was the bait and switch show. the month we hit the floor from training the incentive program changed that we were hired under. no way to get close to the money we were promised. and one lie after another. upper management had a chosen 5 moved up with them and snubbed everyone else. CHarlotte cic is the worst place to work ever!
bad,Allstate is a reliable and affordable insurance company for its clients.  The agent can make all the difference in how employees and customers are treated.  An agent without any insurance experience who just likes the idea of owning their own agency without the dedication and passion to help people could be Mayhem.
bad,"answered phones collected and recorded payments,computer filing input data"
bad,Management is volatile and immature. If you enjoy talking about people behind their back this is the right place for you.
bad,There was  more structure on the Property and Casualty side of the company
bad,"Allstate provides great benefits, but their work environment sucks and they have the worse HR department, did I mention it's overseas? You cannot understand what they are saying and the like to play pass the bucket with your manager or your manager's supervisor, if you are trying to get something resolve make sure you have a full battery and your charger with you (you’ll need it ). I have been underpaid several times or listed as no call no show when I worked overtime, I cannot recommend this company as a place to work at."
bad,"There was too much in-fighting and favouritism amongst department members with no support from management. Work was not distributed equally, while some did too much work and some too little again with no consequences."
bad,i worked 20 yrs for an awesome agent. i left the agency upon her retirement and returned 3 yrs later to work for a new agent. at first it was good i shared much insight as a long time LSP. when i questioned her orders not to inform clients of credit checks reiterating the Allstate must read script. she terminated me.
bad,"I was employed for 5 years with Allstate. I left for a better job opportunity. I will never return. For an insurance company, there were no benefits offered. I paid for insurance out of pocket. Management leadership declined year after year. If there were operational questions, there was no clear direction on who to ask. Agent owner was not always knowledgeable."
bad,"It was ok working for Allstate, until we moved locations. I was laid off for not having my license, but in my contract I was hire as a receptionist and no where in my contact it said I had to have my license"
bad,"No job security, heavy work load, stressful work. Only good job as a role fr team leader and manager cause they don't have work. Team leaders jobs doing by team meats."
bad,micro management is not the way to go. work takes up to much time with home life. was a great company to work for but now it is not so. unfair how work is distributed. everyone is afraid of their bosses.
bad,Typical workday-opened office-owner came in late-she was on personal calls and media most of the day. She didn't answer phones or interact with clients.
bad,"Need an example of micro management this is the place. No integrity in management. Favoritism is the way to advancement. No work life balance if you are a parent. 2-5% pay raises annually. I worked for this company for over 12 years, and did not make $20 an hour (my fault). I stayed with the company for so long bc it was hard to leave the people I worked with they helped make days shorter, and bc I was a loyal employee."
bad,I am not one to slander prior companies. But I have work for three large national insurance companies. At first I was excited to be working for Allstate. And quickly learned about the culture of control and questioning the ability to do my job. The field adjuster position by far was the worst. Two other positions I held there I actually enjoy.  That enjoyment came from years of experience and knowledge.  At the field level given work that is just unattainable to accomplish in one day.  And then judged under a microscope for all decisions you may have made line by line. And then given a grade on that performance. At performance rating determines if any race is determined. That process was extremely unfair as one person dictated your career path.  At the time of my last position I had a chance to go back to the field at time of layoff.  I chose to be unemployed versus going back into such a stressful world.
bad,"Even if you are the only one making sales, they’ll just fire you and steal all your leads that you had been working on for weeks. And the work you till your brain dies."
bad,"I hate this place and as soon as I find a new job I’m out. The benefits are expensive and don’t cover much. The one good thing is the PTO, however everything else is horrible. We are disrespected every day by customers and our workload is impossible to do. No one cares they only pretend to."
bad,I do not recommend people working at Allstate. It is a very unhealthy environment with politics . People working on syload. There are no career advancements even after working for several years. they make you work overtime on name of worklife balance and remote options.
bad,"Let me start by saying that Allstate is agreat company to work for, however, the California/Arizona claims division needs to be monitored closely as its leadership lacks the ethical integrity to manage such an important operation.   "
bad,"After giving almost a decade of my life to this company they decided to move out of state, which would be fine if they didnt torture the employees left behind. They didnt care if one employee was given 100+ files when people left on top of your normal work load. Management where not transparent and lied to our face. The was bare minimum and your treated like just a number. It use to be a good company."
bad,Overall Allstate pays really well and there is plenty of room for advancement. Workload balance needs improvement. This company has very high unrealistic demands.
bad,"Worst place ever.  Owner was horrible to work for, manager was horrible to work for. I felt like every time I gave a quote or sold a policy the customer was getting ripped off."
bad,The day to day was the same activities offering no additional skills for outside jobs. The management has favorites and doesn't think of policies before putting them in action overall a terrible company for customers and employees.
bad,"Company uses employees on countless TDYs for free labor, then easily disposes of them once unneeded.  No room for real advancement unless you are part of the Allstate Click.  What started as a great possible career, after many years committed, has become a joke of a job thanks to Sr. Management."
bad,"difficult work place unprofessional, not enough training for what was expected to do. Was interviewed and hired on the spot. They had my resume they knew what my previous jobs had been. Needed more training and patience."
bad,The property services department has an outage model that does not support employee morale. If two other employees have received approval for a planned absence then no one else can have an unplanned absence without receiving occurrences.
bad,"I went to a new department and it was the worse mistake, the DOC has no structure the team member control the managers. "
bad,"I have never worked in a call center, and miss dealing with people face to face. I don't like having angry customers call me on the phone all day. I come home at the end of the day really sad."
bad,Metairie office has a tendency to not advance women of color or women period. Most of the tenure and senior employees are women and they rarely if ever advance. Work load is typical of any claims environment. Management is archaic and so are the claims processes. I would not recommend this place to any women or minorities as they are the least likely to advance without getting outside HR involved. Unfortunately men are paid more than women.
bad,"A company that only accommodates friends and families to progress up the line of command."
bad,"Position can be extremely exhausting mentally this isn't something I prefer or take lightly.  My direct leader is great as well as my team but being cursed out, on the phone back to back to back with several issues concerning a claim is daunting.  It's difficult to sit in one place majority of the day and you can't even think for yourself or go to the restroom without everything being digitized let alone write a thought. It's a catch 22 working in this realm of the company.  I see why the turnover rate is extremely high, you can forget about a work life balance.   This job has created the worst version of myself that I and my family have ever seen.  Needless to say this isn't an enjoyable place for me.  I'm in counseling it's so unbelievable.  Will be leaving VERY Soon!"
bad,This would probably be the worst job I have ever had! The agency owner made the employees call list after list of phone numbers to get leads for sales. The owner was never there and eventually my coworkers were fed up with the attitude and left. I was the only one in the agency for a while until he just decided to call it quits and close the agency down.
bad,"Fun, Working with different ages, Learned all the options that a receptionist needs to know, the customers were happy with who they use, not being able to learn anymore, being able to be on the phone and talk with customers face to face and over the phone"
bad,"Busy "
bad,"The Business Insurance offered very friendly co-workers. However, the Department lacked structure. Senior Leadership did not filter information down to the frontline."
bad,Hardest part of job was the demanding phones; very stressful position.
bad,"I was excited to start a career, however, once training was over the truth about job came out. The computers are extremely slow and old but yet you are held to an adherence schedule and call volume goal. You are told to arrive 15 to 20 min early to open your system and read emails, but you only get paid once you log in to phone. It's very loud with side conversations and daily huddles. We were told double headsets were ordered, but never came. It is a regular call center job with strict guidelines and goals, but yet employer not accountable for providing up to date systems, or worse, not recognizing clients suffer in the long run."
bad,"Agencies tend to expect more out of the producers than they pay for. Producers must be licensed and pay for the license and continuing education every 2 years (in Indiana). If the agency is well known, the commissions might not be bad, however in my case the office was very hit and miss with much more miss for customers reaching out. The majority of my time was spent cold-calling prospects instead of writing business."
bad,"This company has no empathy for disabled veterans. Despite numerous disability accommodations requests, Allstate failed to provide any adequate accommodation after nearly a year"
bad,This place was terrible. The company might be ok  but not this location. The management was the worst. It is a micromanager atmosphere and you will only be promoted if your are liked or a suck up.
bad,"Was hired when the management of the company was still from American Heritage Life. Very close knit and friendly where everyone worked as a team. Then along came the acquisition from Allstate and their new Senior Leadership team that all came from Met Life. Mass exodus took less than a year to happen in the IT department. Many employees that had been there from the 80s and 90s left. They replaced almost everyone with off-shore contractors. Horrible display of ""If you don't like the new management style, there's the door""."
bad,"I do not wish to make any comments concerning my tenure with Allstate. My ratings speak for themselves, as I mentioned above...Horrible Management...."
bad,"High-volume, very stressful workplace. They say it’s all about customer experience, then assign so many claims, you cannot give them the attention they need. They say it’s not about chasing numbers, then apply metrics to everything making it all about the numbers. If you don’t meet the metrics, you’re gone."
bad,I worked for Allstate customer contact center and now working as licensed sales producer. Was at the contact center for about 5 years the pay was great benefits good but zero work life balance. The last year before I left was horrible. Not only did they capped our annual raises but the sales metrics increased ridiculously. Keep in mind I was in the service not sales department we still had to sale and meet metrics.  The stress took a toll on my health and that's when I decided to move to a local agency.  Now here things are more slow pace but that's not a good thing either because the base pay is not that decent and commission percentages are ridiculously.  I guess you have to compromise between your well being and a good paycheck. I'm seriously looking into a different type of career after doing insurance for over 10 years.
bad,"Favoritism culture, if you’re in with the in crowd you can do no wrong, if not, nothing you do is any good. Promises of raises not kept 2% raise for 10 years was pathetic."
bad,"working for Allstate was ok, but I would not recommend anybody just start out in the insurance industry, the  work load can be over whelming, and your are asked to give a lot for a little bit of compensation"
bad,"My last day of work my supervisor advised that I was her best adjuster.  I had always maintained a good attitude and was always wiling to assist co-workers, even when the work was overwhelming.  I love handling claims, I enjoy the investigation, all aspects of coverage, and I love to evaluate a claim once we have all of the medicals and are in a position to review and make an offer.  The most enjoyable part is either a successful mediation or trial."
bad,"Allstate Claims has horrible morale, workload is not balanced, there is really no home/work balance. It’s a very micromanaging environment with little to no trust from management."
bad,I was sent to work from home to later find out that upper management thought that work from home was not beneficial to the company and they got rid of hungreds of us in less than a year of being sent to work from home.
bad,"Employee turnover is extreme and constant which results in workload shifting to an already over burdened staff. Management can be wonderful if you're on the right team or horrific if you're not as some managers lead with intimidation & bullying.  Not many ""true"" opportunities for advancement unless you have support from the right people. Team dynamics vary greatly which can result in isolation/dissension of team members. Moral fluctuates from day to day with more lows than highs.  Management attempts to compensate with frequent food days but a free lunch eventually pales in comparison to overall employee satisfaction and/or general well being.  PTO benefits are outstanding and new hires are enticed with 20 days PLUS the option to buy an additional week however,  health benifits are extremely poor. Vision benifits are fantastic and dental benefits are mid range.  Current company focus is on CE (Customer Experience) which is great in Allstate's theory but rarely practiced when it comes to actually keeping customers ""In Good Hands"" as their motto implies.  Overall the pros are shadowed by the cons. I loved my job when I initially started but through the years I've witnessed/experienced far too many negatives which has severely damaged my opinions of this company as a whole. Unfortunately, in the end, the negative outweighed the positive  and resulted in a decision to obtain healthier employment."
bad,"On a daily basis, I was expected to answer at least 80 calls from customers that have been in fatal accidents. I had to use the highest level of empathy that I have."
bad,"Allstate is a good company, its the staffing agency that made it stressful. CMS Staffing, you never knew if you had a job from one day to the next. You were under paid and over worked"
bad,"Horrible! This company will work  you down to the ground. I was never at home with my family, and the management does not care.  Everything is about numbers.   The moment you get behind your work, prepare to get fired.   I was recommended to leave the company by my doctor, because I had so much stress from my job that it was really affecting my health."
bad,"I guess it depends on which department you work in. I worked in the staff counsel office.  Initially, I thought I had landed my dream job UNTIL the moment I felt as though I was back in high school. Seasoned employees would bully the other staff and management had NO back-bone.  I'd never worked at a company where ""regular interventions"" were needed just so everyone could be told how to get along with one another. All I can say is RUN, this place will surely cause your blood pressure to rise!"
bad,Easy job but under paid. I learned a lot about installment loan and how the interests works on them. I loved the customers and I enjoyed helping them as much as possible.
bad,Excessive amount of work relative to staff and expectations. Expectations are set from the top down and have no correlation with how to actually accomplish them.  In my department 6-8 hrs of unpaid overtime per week are required inorder to meet goals. Management is totally disconnected from day toi day operations. Not an enjoyable place to work.
bad,"Intense work load. "
bad,"What I learned from my time at Allstate is depending on your immediate management, you are not judged by the quality of your work, but by the friends you keep. I enjoy the challenges that come with helping people on a daily basis. The unfortunate part is being a part of a team where drama and gossip place such a major part in acceptance within our regional office. I am the only male on my immediate team, and one of very few within our department. I don't mind, as I communicate well with women, and have no problem working along side of them. In this particular situation though, my team has been together for the better part of 7 years and they have their rapport well established. Some personalities aren't always accepted into established circles. My aim is to work hard, and be appreciated for that. I just don't feel that is the case within some parts of the Allstate world. My immediate manager is just as guilty as the rest of our team, and it makes it hard to work for someone like that, as she doesn't appreciate you for your efforts, but more so for your social standing with her. That's what makes it hard. But the job itself is enjoyable. Everyday challenges in providing the help desired by customers and agencies makes it worthwhile."
bad,"Allstate  pairs you with an agent or agents.+Hardest part of job, was working with Allstate Agents, generally slugs that were booth agents. Management at company consists of field management that requirements that they be 6'2 or above and never sold a thing in their life, extremely poor.I made ALOT of money fist year (6) months made 87K, second years 200K and my last years with them I made 269K."
bad,"I ran a successful profitable agency for 12 years, one of the larger P & C books of business in the area. I couldn't keep up with the life insurance requirements and was terminated."
bad,"I am a peoples person I like helping customers when I get to meet new people at my work I make them feel as if I already know them very well and i serve them best as much as i can. My typical day at work is all about serving my clients need and selling the product educating them with the product knowledge so they can make their own choices while buying the product and also sometimes lestening to their problems even though if its not job related, they appreciate that a lot. As a manager at Texas Insurance Advisors, I increased the sales by selling the product according to the clients need and help other coworkers to sell more and take care of existing clients by letting the clients know ahead of time if their policy were late or going to get cancelled or if they had any concern either regarding their bills or in their financial hard ship worked with them in their difficult time waiving their late fees talking to the insurance company. So far I have had a great and very friendly working enviroment and when my coworkers needed my helpi was always there for them and vice versa. Sometimes my job can be very demanding, though apart from job i am a mother too sometimes i wouldn't be able to attend my kids special functions or sometimes i would be late to pick up my kids from school because i had to stay longer at the office serving clients by issuing new policies or serving them with existing policies, i find this very challenging but at the same time makes me feel good about myself as i was able to serve my clients and they appreciate that."
bad,Great company name
bad,Let me start by clarifying that the insurance side of the company is great - my thoughts are about the financial services portion. Unfortunately there exists an unnecessary layer of middle management whose only concern is their own well being and often create more problems than solutions to justify their positions in the company often resulting in the little guy getting stepped on and treated poorly.
bad,Was not paid properly. Owner withheld commission and was always late to pay commission with excuses. Employed family members who acted entitled and un-welcomeing. Very rude to customers and owner didn't care the way customers and unrelated staff was treated by her family members. Very unprofessional office and staff as well as the agent/owner
bad,"I worked as a contractor and was loving the work and environment.  One day out of the blue, after I finished a big project, in which I dedicated long hours and hard work, I had a new boss and she decided to let me go. They NEVER told me why but I think the expected wirkload never happened."
bad,"I was hired on to second shift with the verbal statement that I would be able to move within the company. The only way to move is to move states."
bad,At first I was excited to work there but after a while it got very hairy and very unstable Not enough experience team leads or supervisors and when they are around you couldn’t get any help from them
bad,"Training was a joke, trainer had us watch 25 to 30 minutes of you tube videos each day instead of getting us prepared for the job.  Once in transition the lack of training continued."
bad,"LACK OF ADVANCEMENT. This company states growth and career advancement, but that is not true. You can pay out of pocket for schooling, but when the time comes for advancing your career you are literally stuck in your position. you will be told ""just because you work for a company does not always mean you will get hired in certain positions'!"
bad,Allstate is competitive company. They don't have room for advancement. They treat you like a child. If your not friends with supervisor your going to be in the same positon for years.
bad,Management is very slow to market.  They are promoting white and India resources into higher paying roles.  There are very few black and females in management roles.
bad,"The Company is a place where we spend half of the life and Its very difficult when your HR's are very lenient for the complaints of Employees..."
bad,if your in insurance you can not sell this product and feel good about yourself at the end of the day. Overcharging customers for mediocre service. GO TO STATEFARM
bad,"No words to describe the stress of working in this environment. Would not recommend to anyone. High school atmosphere, lies lies and more lies. If you have a family that you need to support this is not the job for you."
bad,"I joined Allstate under a franchise owners and operator agreement, I would say if you enjoy office politics, petty, vindictive and poorly educated management teams this is the place for you."
bad,"While Allstate seemed like a great place to work on the surface, and many people have worked for Allstate for 10+ years, they didn't work in the IT department which is a whole different ballgame. Allstate has developed a bad reputation with hiring, then firing people before they hit their three year mark which would normally make them eligible for a pension and to be fully invested in their 401(k) plans. It turns out that those people who have worked for extended periods of time are generally in the Claims area, not in IT. My co-workers are good people and a pleasure to work with. Management, on the other hand, is not. I've already been told by management that I should look for other work."
bad,great company - need more leads. Co-workers were great! Need better pay and more hours
bad,"While employed at this corporation, I did a college project for an Ethics course. I compared the company's ethical guidelines with standards taught during the course. The company failed."
bad,"Answering phones and providing quotes to customers for auto, life and home insurance. About the insurance business, due to it being only one Agent in the office I basically managed myself. No coworkers. There really wasn't a hard part to this position and I enjoyed working with customers and again providing service"
bad,"I would not recommend Allstate. High work load, low morale, no freedom or individual thought process allowed. Everything is controlled by processes. Not a fun environment. Lot of turnover and stress."
bad,"No advancement,..and hard to sell their products. Too expensive and very selective with clients. They wanted people with money. And you have to call clients over and over again. Harassment is the word. Awful experience."
bad,"Lots of discrimination goes on in Houston staff counsel office. The management is the worst, they each have their favs. You will never learn legal work."
bad,Allstate is a great company if you work anywhere but Idah ccc..  The top management runs it by who they like not how well you do.  If you make a mistake it will be held against you forever.  There is a reason they are always hiring in Idaho.  People are stuck there because it pays well.  Its a do as I say not as I do culture.
bad,"They pay hourly $15-$17.  Not a lot of traffic to make enough commission. They won’t take customers with 2 or more tickets. So there goes most of everyone. No paid vacations, no health care. Basically nothing. Calm place to work if you’re okay with mediocre money. Our office was so slow sometimes. Allstate is expensive. Don’t plan on making money here unless you’re the owner. Don’t bother working here."
bad,"The lack of corporate IT leadership affects every aspect of daily work life at Allstate.  Backward decisions are responsible for major losses of revenue, which then have to be compensated by draconian cuts.  Lack of focus and direction results in a ""deer in the headlights,"" frenetic environment in which little of real value is accomplished.  Since most people have been there for many years, many folks are not even aware of the environment that they are fomenting.  Allstate IT is the source of many humorous anecdotes, but the humor soon becomes embarrassing.."
bad,The work environment is was strenuous. It was not an ideal work environment but I made the most out of it for as long as I could. It was definitely a learning experience.
bad,I hate coming here every day. I need to get out before it ruins my life. This place haunts me. When I leave here I have bad dreams about coming back the next day
bad,This job was not difficult. Unreasonable production goals. Not flexible at all when it comes to personal life. Difficult work environment. 14 years of service to the company means nothing
bad,Ripp off artist i dreaded going to work every day. This place wennt out of business.
bad,I was told from the beginning that I had to make so many calls a day and send out so many quotes a day. I continued to do this on a daily basis even when I worked half days.
bad,"Agency owner cheats you out of commission. No benefits or off days. Pays 3% commission with no renewals.  Constantly disrespected, please Run!!!! There are plenty of great agencies to work for but this is not one of them."
bad,"Could not bring myself to push people to buy something that was really no better than any other large insurance companies coverage, claiming that what set us apart was our customer service when I knew that it was more than likely the same as every other large company. I also got the impression that all of this was known, but I was expected to shut that part off to just sell. It was a soul sucking experience."
bad,Most of the jobs there are moving to different states and they were not very transparent about lay offs or when they were going to happen.  The management cares only about themselves and not the employees or customers.
bad,"When choosing your benefits, you get to choose that your not a smoker/ tobacco user which is what I did. Well they came back and told me that I choose that I choose that I was a tobacco user. Even when I offered to show proof from a doctor stating that I'm not a smoker and never have been, they refuse to stop charging me extra money. Your only in good hands of you pay them enough for the privilege"
bad,Allstate help me maNage An budget Due to any other jobs it’s helps my increase My Credit Rate An Also Taught me how to keep A Job N communicate an network with others
bad,Good company... Able to gather great work experience and get to know some great people.  Have good and bad days.  Overall good company that has development opportunities for employees.
bad,Company has a long way to go on standards and employees satisfaction. Only reason Im still working is the people who works there. The review is 100% facts.
bad,"I loved the hours M-F 8-5, loved the pay, and the small team of people I worked with. I worked in customer service, so I took calls incoming from customers that have insurance and helped them to pay their bill, explain their policy concerns etc. "
bad,"Wonderful people to work with."
bad,Pay is low given the work and treatment of insureds/claimants per the company guidelines. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work there or carry their own insurance through this company.
bad,"When I first started with Allstate, I fell in love with the way they treated & serviced their customers.  Over the years, this has changed.  Their claim department would  disappoint the customer, they had huge rate increases, and it was all about making the company money instead of what was best for the customer."
bad,Good local agency although the pay is too low. Allstate is in decline and is losing customers almost daily. They do home inspections and the customers complain. The complaints are falling on deaf ears at corporate level.
bad,I moved to Allstate after several years with State Farm.  Not for me.  Job culture really focused on new business not retaining or satisfying existing business.
bad,"Simply not worth it.  Worst decision I could have ever made.  I came in 2019, I left in 2019.  The ship sailed and sunk very quickly.  In this line of work, as an agent, it’s important to make sure your capital is enough to keep you afloat in tough times.  Otherwise, it’s not going to last."
bad,toxic place of business i would not recommend anyone to work here the training is not good the team lead staff only cares about their advancement and you have to try to navigate your own career with no assistance
bad,"Hectic and stressful but lots to learn about. Good fun people to motivate you and an amazing Team  Spirit."
bad,"For starters, nobody qualifies. Allstate is so picky on who they will write its ridiculous. Secondly, the pay sucks. Third, i get no benefits. Definitely do not recommend working here"
bad,not for me. great office for people who want to do this type of work. i didnt so it was not a good fit but its still a great place to work and good company
bad,"No type of training ,cold calling, cold calling very very unorganized lots favoritism going on.   Manager not professional, unobtainable sales goals. Hire letter had one set of hours and then the old bate and switch are not the hours that are required. No communication of the manager to the staff."
bad,"You are either part of the accepted clique (Mississauga office) or your work life will be made miserable until you leave.  "
bad,"My agency was great in the beginning until it relocated to a low-income area. Sales were poor there, no big surprise. My managers blamed it all on me and let me go, and they did this knowing that I was having family problems. Wasn't that nice of them? Now that I'm gone, I'm sure sales are still low, and perhaps they now realize it wasn't me holding back the sales?"
bad,Very old software programming the training is awful low pay for a lot of work!The company as a whole is not good for a new job In insurance agent! The location of the office is terrible!
bad,"The company overall is great to work for but the Agency, not so much. The Agency owner was rarely there. Hostile work environment to say the least, as well as poor work ethics. There was no training to start off, you were expected to learn all the information for the state test and purchase all educational supplies out of pocket. There was no HR so when there was a dispute you only could turn to one person, the Agency owner, which was his way or no way. Constantly being fearful of not being paid or correctly paid is no way to run a business."
bad,"Allstate is changing their ""footprint"" in the US and are closing many offices. Many people are forced to relocate or they will lose their jobs. Would not recommend."
bad,it is a very risky move they can terminate your contract for no reason or for any reason including another agent complaining about you taking their business
bad,"Allstate is NOT a good product. They have too much mayhem. Not enough quality training, or resource tools that are needed to perform sales in 50 states. The lack of support when you get on the floor is atrocious. They literally throw you out and expect you to be perform when most of the time in training the computers froze or the trainer couldn't access the needed materials. Team meetings were how you didn't measure UP. But no tools or help in improving. Coaches were very condescending or blew you off when you were trying to get the needed info. "
bad,This particular agent that I worked for is no longer an Allstate agent so this review is no good. Learned a lot about insurance and the insurance adjustment process for a wrecked car.
bad,Awful place to work never would work for this company ever again unsafe work environment. Do not care for employees especially female workers treated poorly and victimized by management and corporate
bad,"•	Performing in a high volume processing center, responding to agent inquiries, risk eligibility, as well as underwriting policies and procedures."
bad,This job is really for young adults who are looking for a easy money.  You are basically taking claims all day.  The management at the time that I was working there were young and really not fair at all.
bad,This place is very productive very knowledgeable and very fun to be at. The workers are very great people to work with and are very energetic.
bad,"a typical day at work fro me was taking phone calls, filling out quotes in my computer. "
bad,They tell the employees that they are a dime a dozen and they do need to worry on how they make their employees feel.  They also hire you giving you all this hype on the things they offer the employees and then take them away once you are out of training.
bad,this job does provide plenty of options but it was not the right fit for me. IF this is your type of thing then you will likely do well in this company
bad,In my work atmosphere there was too much drama caused by my co-workers and so it made working at allstate not very fun at all.
bad,Woking in a fast paced organization keeps you busy but  has a wealth of learning experiences. Open door policy means communication with supervisors is at comfortable level. Great place with a supportive and energetic team to work with.
bad,"•	Reviews, evaluate & processes claims & make recommendations for resolution for routine injury claims based on coverage"
bad,"pursuant to the client contract (cancer, accident, disability claims)"
bad,I go in to work log in and begin taking phone calls. my experience there was i learned how to process an insurance claims. I was in my own cubical so it was rarelly any communication with co-workers i was not there long but when I had contact with co-workers it was always great. the hardest part of this job was trying to figure out what to put certain claims under. The most enjoyable part of the job was finishing clams.
bad,"unorganized management, poor customer service and unproductive work environment"
bad,"management and ownership cant agree on anything. wharehouse supervisors doesnt speak english well and loves the words ""right now"""
bad,data entry-entered information of hand written applicatins for life insurance
bad,I don't like to Bash the companies I work for I can just say take heed before you except any job from them because you can end up unemployed like I am.
bad,"Administrative and sales positions for Exclusive agencies are not regulated or protected by Allstate Insurance. Allstate does not have minimum pay or benefits requirements for employees or staff working under Exclusive agents. This is an ongoing problem that puts Allstate at the bottom of the list when marketing for jobs within an agency. "
bad,"It was a great place to work to meet people and be social. However, the work is very stressful trying to reach metrics. In addition, you take phone calls that either show the best in humanity or the worst. You can have someone who has lost everything and is pleasant to speak with, or the rich dude with a scratch on his Mercedes loosing his mind as if you were the one to damage it in person."
bad,A typical day at work for me would be relaxed on the computer and working on insurance claims. I would also be talking  on the phone with customers and helping them with their problems or any issues that they had with their claims
bad,STAY FAR AWAY...........................................experience is not valued over new and impressionable recruits. there is no loyalty to employees.  every thing is micro managed.
bad,"My mom actually owned the office. And, she put in so much hard work and dedication. Allstate fired one of the best insurance agents ever. More than half of her customers left Allstate altogether because they closed her down. Since I was only in my teens, a typical day at work would be pretty easy. Talking to people, answering phones and so forth. I learned that Allstate is not a company I would recommend anyone to work at unless they've already established their business. My mom was in charge. And, her assistant was great. There wasn't really a hard part in the job. But, the enjoyable part was being able to be with my mom."
bad,"If you choose to work for Allstate, do your research and know the agent you will be working for. Allstate as a whole probably isn't a bad company.  The agency in which you will be working in, is a whole other issue. You do not get paid more than a fast food job, no benefits and only get a max of $200 a month bonus IF you meet all the criteria. So if you sell 10 p&c policies but no life policies that month you don't get that bonus or commission of any kind. If your agent is self centered, you will bust your butt to produce just so they can win status and trips all the while you get absolutely nothing. And like others posted, good luck if your agent is actually there ever. You end up running the whole office alone and get nothing in return other than harpd on to produce more. Its definitely a sales job, customer service takes a back seat, if a customer calls with an issue,  you don't handle it, you are there to SELL.   I feel bad for those who have Allstate as their insurance provider."
bad,Agencies are owned by a private owner who is pushed to produce so much per month. Some months it was a very high bar that could not be possible with the type of environment and culture around the local office. Too many regulations on their policies. I had a hard time approving homes for home Insurance as well as life policies pended for 6 months and then they were eventually denied.
bad,Inadequate training and overall organization. Personal relationships affected working relationships. Focused on numbers not customers. High employee turn around due un reasonable goals set by trial error
bad,********************Highly recommend against working here unless you are trying to become an Exclusive Agency Owner **********************************
bad,I enjoyed working there and I was top in sales. Unfortunately I worked for someone who was dishonest with employees and clients. I take pride in my honesty and did not want to work in a hostile environment
bad,"okay for a temp, pay was low only 11 an hour, looked down upon for being a temp, no room for permanet placement, onsite gym for permanent employees to use"
bad,"A typical day at work involves your own daily tasks as well as the multiple tasks you are given a day by the agency owner. The work environment is a clique and if you don't fit in you are talked about behind your back and then given attitude. "
bad,The agency owner had no formal training for someone new to the business. Would teach you one thing then a week later come back and say that wont work and why are you doing it that way. Agency owner claimed things were one way but in reality things were the opposite. Would not ever want to recommend this agency to anyone.
bad,Answer calls and assist customers with various policy questions and encourage them to have the coverage they need.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers.
bad,"hours didn't work for me. seemed as if the employees ran the building, management seemed absent. not many rules to keep order in the day. Didn't seem as if there was room to grow."
bad,I enjoyed my job and coworkers but the agency owner was cut throat to say the least. He had no compassion and was very rude to his employees that is why my time there was so limited.
bad,"Unless you want to work with people who continually lie to you, throw you under the bus, treat you like you are stupid, give you no training, have pointless meetings all day, then try to make you feel bad when the job doesn't get done, don't work there."
bad,Imagine waking up everyday not knowing if you're still employed just because you have terrible management. I've worked four years here and not once felt i can continue my life here. Everyone is on a chopping block
bad,"While working there was rarely given a schedule more than a day out at some points called with as little as 15 min notice not to come in. Training was nonexistent had to study personally for Insurance test property and fire with no compensation from employer even after promise of fees being paid for was given. Learned Insurance systems, Outlook, homeowners, auto and boat quotes. Co-workers were fine though high stressed with overloaded tasks. Hardest part of the job was the lack of professionalism and the lack of consideration. The most enjoyable part of the job is the sense of accomplishment at learning on your own to navigate operating systems."
bad,"A typical day at work would include but not limited to calling clients and following up with them on sales. I would have liked more structure of management. As far as the hardest part of my job would have to be dealing with an unstructured office, and not having an opportunity to grow in an agency. "
bad,run by some great employees but brought down by management.
bad,Not knowing if your going to get sent home early. Not understanding people hand writing or to small. The point system is not cool.
bad,"This is a on call job for whenever a catastrophe happens! The job pays very well! However, recently they decided to terminate their entire staff over this statement! Due to your last performance we have to terminate you over this serious matter. On my last day working for them we all sat at a desk for five hours waiting for them to get the phone system up and running! At that time we were using a room in Allstate until Pilot/ Castrophe Management finish thier building! Now keep in mind done people received these letters and have not worked for them in over a year!"
bad,"No room for advancement, false promises, great office manager, bad owner,"
bad,"baptism by fire! over worked and underpaid"
bad,"Honestly, if you’re in need of a job go for it.   Each agency is different.  I will say, Allstate has their expectation and your agency owner has theirs; there are some conniving AOs out there that don’t care about you, and only care about the bonus they make because of you.   If you don’t meet your quota, you risk losing your job.  You will always be just a sales person, unless you take the leap and open your own place.   The rates are higher than majority of the competitors and the training they give you does not set you up for success.   If you know how to talk to people and get in their minds, you will do well, if not, you’re screwed"
bad,"n/a I have nothing to say about the company badly, I was wanting a job were I could advance my career and I feel as though this is not the place, so I am seeking other avenues."
bad,I worked here for a very short time. One manager and myself.  Old office building with no great accommodations. Business location raised security concerns and did not feel safe with clients entering the building
bad,Profits before people is the central focus. The customer should come first and does not. Company never considers excessive workload and  the impact it has on employees.
bad,No benefits.  Poor management.  Local agent who did not adhere to company standard.  Commission structure changed all the time. Tenured employees are not given raises.
bad,"Poor management, lack of understanding of how an office should work."
bad,The best part of the job is helping others. As for Cheyenne Express office is not an enjoyable work place.there is no advancement unless you are in the Team Lead click.
bad,I dont actually work for the company it was an agency and it is very unorganized. Not enough hours and no benefits. The work is slow and you could barely understand the customers
bad,"It is definitely a ""What have you done for me today?"" culture.  The opportunity is good, but the environment of upper management is hostile and not supportive."
bad,"they do not provide workplace accommodations, bully/ micro manage those who ask questions, manipulate, and refuse to show where HR in office is located.  questions or concerns are viewed as hostility"
bad,"A typical day at work you on the phone all day, generally you do not work directly for Allstate you work for their agents which usually do not offer benefits and very limited vacation and sick days."
bad,"Allstate is not the place to work if you have any self respect or dignity. Working in Express drains your soul, body and mind. Managers are useless. They only care about themselves and are constantly not on the floor helping specialist. Can't find any managers at all? It is because all of them. YES, I mean all of them are down the street at Starbucks while you are stuck on the phone with a lady screaming for a manger to take the call. If you want job advancement, you need to be able to be best friends with the leaders or you will never go anywhere. You only get moved up if management likes you as a friend, it has nothing to do with your performance at the job. You will be constantly talked down to as if your a child by customers and your managers. You will never be taken seriously. This company with throw you under the bus any chance they get. DO NOT WORK HERE."
bad,"My experience is not typical.  Working for a different company with different computer system took a little bit to learn.  Policy differences in any company change from year to year, and sometimes month to month."
bad,Can not be competitive the rates from Allstate are too high. They loose clients on a regular bases. There risk management is too stringent.  Working in an environment where I am the only non related employee.
bad,Starting in insurance sales with a startup was exciting and also very difficult to weather. not having a substantial book of personal contacts also slowed the process.
bad,I worked for a total of 9 years with Allstate for 2 separate Sr Account Agents. They got rich while I got tired. They went on expensive company paid trips that my sales qualified them for while I worked 60 - 80 hours a week with little time off. I hated leaving my client though. Liked the work.
bad,"Was a great job to work; payment is very low for the work you do but if you love what you do it really wont matter. Customers here are great to work with,"
bad,I worked in the customer complaint department and was under extreme stress everyday. They were very critical of your performance and changed performance standards all of the time.
bad,Having a very bad experience so far!!! Not what I was told i was getting into by any means!! They job description changed and so di the location randomly and I was not giving everything I was told to be successful!!
bad,Toxic Management.Owner gave you just 5 leads a day if that we had to go out and create your own business. the coworkers worked harder to keep you down then making sales.
bad,No potential to advance and pay is below competitors. The amount of claims given is huge and quarterly reviews are nearly impossible to achieve.
bad,Very heavy workload with no work life balance. Unattainable goals given the claim volume but told by management we are adequately staffed. Ridiculous measures to get authority on files even when the value is within your personal authority.
bad,They are constantly asking for donations for all different programs but won’t reward hard work with any raises. The management is very underwhelming!!
bad,The management in the legal office treat you as a SAP number. They preach about diversity and inclusivity but  management displays favoritism and exclusivity. Could be better.
bad,"Needs a lot of improvement with management. People hired with lack of professionalism, style and scruples. No push to further ones education or insurance knowledge."
bad,"If you are a mother or father to a child that may have a medical condition this is not the place to work. Management seem like they don't know how to manage. Benefits are horrible, might as well not have a paycheck. Stressful environment, they even get on your case if you need to use the bathroom. Pay is nice after you work there for a few years. but initially don't expect any good raises."
bad,I see that they are pandering to employ former military and if you have any PTSD this company is not the one for you. I worked 7 years on the National Catastrophe Team as a Senior Outside Property Claims Adjuster. I regularly worked 14 hours a day and on my days off to keep up with the work flow. I've also had opportunities to work in both the Northbrook Illinois and Dallas Texas offices and they are human cubical factories with people who are afraid to even smile and to draw attention to themselves. The training is almost nonexistent and management support is weak.  By the time I reach my third year I was the last person on my team of nine still remaining and by year five I had gone through five managers. They treat their employees like the enemy and I have steered several people away from this company.
bad,"Unfortunately the office I worked at cared more for the sale then they do the insureds.  Agent and staff write policies in ways to save money, but not best protect the insured due to rates being higher than area competition."
bad,The agency I worked for did not help with training and paid me next to nothing since I was young. After speaking with friends from other agency's they confirmed that my agency owner was completely taking advantage of me for my sales. They did not allow me to take any leads that came into the office and instead I had to cold call customers from very old lists all day to meet my goal. I was constantly getting yelled at and hung up on which was not fun. With an extremely low salary and little to no commission I was unable to live so I quit.
bad,"When working as a Sales producer, you are not an employee of Allstate. You are employed by the agency owner. Zero benefits, not much room for advancement, any and everything is at the discretion of the agency owner. "
bad,"Expectations for Sales goals are not provided until you have been there for at least 30 days. Very outdated leads provided. "
bad,This means that younger employees get stuck in their jobs because there’s no room for advancement. Compensation is not competitive for today’s market.
bad,"I worked there.  I liked the sales reps.  The owners, I will keep that opinion to myself.  It was right on Route 110, training is very minimal and that is what I am saying about Allstate."
bad,"I find the corporate culture to be very immature and unprofessional. It's like an episode of mean girls. Managers are very pushy, micromanage their staff & constantly create drama and tension that caused friction amongst staff due to their gossiping. How do you sell me on top employer award or why you need insurance in the first place.. tsk tsk."
bad,"Very flat management and organization.  "
bad,"If with a decent agent, make sure you research them first and even talk to their employees if you can. The job can be stressful at times, and you are always pressured to sell or at least help steer potential clients into purchasing policies even if you are not an LSP."
bad,"Typical day at Allstate you come to work , no metric bonuses only gift cards or tangibles between coworkers, unable to use vacation time to cover family emergencies and sickness to avoid being given a point but they offer at least 33 days that you can only use pre-scheduled."
bad,Appears good on paper but don't let that fool you.  Management leads by intimidation & nepotism is strong.  You are held back unless you are related to someone.
bad,This agency was managed by an owner with no sales focus and no strategy for success. He regularly took accounts away just prior to my closing them and treated all of his employees in a very dismissive manner. He obliged me to work 6 day weeks 11 and a half hours on three of those days and further neglected to compensate me for half of my health insurance cost as he promised when I was hired. This should not reflect on AllState as a Company.They seem to engender everything that this agency owner was not.
bad,"Hard company to work for. Management has NO clue on the work load, how to handle there employees and only cares about numbers. There is zero room for advancement.  The office is run by a bunch of young kids who have no knowledge of how to get things done! Over the years it has been like a revolving door.  If you can't keep up with the work load they fire you or employees just quit.   There are no teaching moments.I truly have nothing positive to say  and that is sad!!"
bad,"Expectations and plan is very unattainable, unless you want to put in lots of hours.  "
bad,"I had previously worked only in the independent channel of investment services and was deceived about what to expect in the captive world."
bad,"I have worked for many agents the past 10 years and have had mixed experiences. In the Sacramento area you will make more $$ and have more demographic clientele.Agent was a New agent, organized, competitive pay $14 and hour (in 2006)  and nice person overall. So I moved to San Joaquin area, took another for another agent and within 6 months out of business pay was no where near comparable, no clientele . Business closed of OUT of work again. Then another  New agent in Tracy hired me as an LSP and was not a great experience either. She was hardly at the office, always paid us 3 to 4 days late, had a camera installed behind us and when a customer came in she turned it on to hear what we were talking about. In the middle of dealing with client she would text us to see how it was going. Pay was a real joke in the area you will expect to make with your California  insurance license (P&C)  between $10 - $14 and hour, commission varies by agent but is not much on a policy. Policies usually pay $5 homeowners and auto $10-$35 commission. MY ADVICE: Find an agent that has been in business for more that 2 years that way they will have already passed the Series 6&63. If the agents don't pass Series 6&63 then,  Allstate will come in and close them down. Leaving you with no job and unemployment will not pay enough to cover.                                 We all need a stable career to remain a sustainable world."
bad,"maybe it was just a bad experience but it truly was a BAD experience... nothing but drama in the office i worked at. all drama was from the owner, the other co workers were great to work with!"
bad,"Allstate is a great company with bad people, unreachable metrics, with low pay. Right now, they are killing the works and trashing customers to protect the rate. If you fraternize enough you may get promoted within a year-As long as you drink the cool-aid. Soon, as you start to use your brain, your out the door. The pressure is high and so is the politics...If you can make it throught their drama you can do it all."
bad,"It has been a long time since I have worked here and the only things that I can remember is back to back phone calls. "
bad,"Look somewhere else. Allstate does not respect its employees and promotes unethical practices towards staff. Allstate consciously  provides minimal training and understanding of the technology they have you work with. It seemed as though Allstate wanted its employees to make mistakes in order to pass on responsibility and get them to pay out of their own pocket. Personally, I never caused an ""Errors & Omission"", but I was fully aware of that fact that it could cost you up to $10K out of your pocket."
bad,"The job could be enjoyable, but management drives into panic mode at the slightest negative result.  The work/life balance is awful and the starting salary is insulting compared to other companies.  More work is added that only deters the important tasks and holds you back. Everything is micro managed which creates a very stressed work environment for all."
bad,Unrealistic sales goals. Market is too saturated with insurance companies and agents all trying to get the same clients. No room for growth or market share.
bad,"As far as working for an independent agent goes:"
bad,"I really don't like it , It's cost me more money then I've made"
bad,"Not the place you or anyone wants to be. No benefits, no vacation, no bonuses no nothing"
bad,I worked at the Buffalo Claims office for over 20 years.  The work was extremely stressful and the goals placed by management were unattainable. The best part of the job were the other employees.  The company also placed so much pressure on older employees that they either retired early due to the stress or were fired.  The company does not value experience and merely wants to hire younger workers and pay them less.  I would definitely not recommend working for this company.
bad,Too much work for the pay. There is no room for career growth.
bad,"I was open from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm Mon. thru Fri."
bad,"Don't be fooled by a 3-5 Star review.  Check the position that is giving that review.  Find your job title and read those reviews.  They will probably be more accurate for your position.  "
bad,"Environemt is unprofessional, the HR department is unknowledged, and there is no ability to advance."
bad,"Typical day at work would be taking claims from customers, filing, answering switchboard. I was crossed trained in every area which was helpful. My co-workers were great and management leaves a little to be desired. The hardest part was filing on my feet all day. The easiest part was co-workers."
bad,Answered phone calls and entered information into computer regarding Auto and Homeowners Insurance claims.
bad,"This is an independent role in which Allstate Mgmt matches up with new Allstate Agents. The concept is good, but many new Allstate Agents are doing everything they can to write new business. Often times the Allstate Agents have had a number of EFS in which they are less likely to refer you to their clients due to high turnover."
bad,Not a highly respected position with Allstate. Stockholders are number one for them. Corporate tells you they are on your side but they don't care how they get the business and actually turn the agency owners and staff into our competition all the while still wanting us to train their offices for free.
bad,"a lot of employees worked there for over 10 years, very clicky, no advancement, judgmental management. Everyone that I worked with has left. a supportive environment is much needed!!!"
bad,"Not everything is as it seems at first. Although the managers seem very friendly, employee input does not have any effect on the overall environment. The manager has remote access to all the computers in the office and does not have an issue taking over the computer even when an agent is mid quote and on the line with a customer. At times, the computer takeover would happen when guests were in office for a quote making it a rather awkward situation. On the other hand, the co-workers that lasted longer than a month were generally hard working and extremely pleasant. I personally only made it three months, but that was longer than four other persons hired during my employment."
bad,The culture is far from diverse. The work environment is very dramatic. Everything is always unorganized. The training was subpar. They do have great benefits and vacation time that is about it.
bad,It was a great place to work at.  I learned a lot when I worked there.  The only problem we were never paid on time and we could never get a hold of primary agent.
bad,Sitting in an office for 8 hours and having a 30 minute lunch and a boss that is constantly watching over your shoulder. If we made conversation with other coworkers it was suddenly a problem. The office was dead silence. Im surprised i didnt go insane
bad,"The management treats you like children instead of a capable adult."
bad,Allstate cares more about metrics than people  in the claims position.  Very rigid rules and time watched and monitored as well.  Did not disclose 3 working Saturdays a month nor that an 11-7 or 10-6 became an additional 45 more.
bad,"They are the lowest paying company in the business."
bad,"Management doesn’t care about workload and life balance. Average Pending is about 75 to 130. Expectations are unrealistic for quality, they expect you to settle in injury claim with the claimant for $250 or less for minor damages. Favoritism in this office I’m not sure about the other home Offices if you are not friends or buddies with management then don’t expect to advance"
bad,"Agency owner was terrible to work for. Pay was barely enough to survive, especially for a job that requires you to attend classes and hold a special licence (all of which I paid for)"
bad,"The hardest part is catching up with all the daily reports, claim follow ups, reviews on existing plans due to phone calls, walk ins of claims, payments, or sales.. "
bad,I worked at all state for two years as a contract employee. They boasted about how they always hired the temps but to me it only seemed they were just danglingthe carrot for you to never reach. You are not an employee to them you are nothing but a number. And thats concerning
bad,In 5 years I moved between 6-8 units and had 7-8 different managers.  The facility is a revolving door.  You can do a great job the whole time you work there make a single mistake and get shown the door.  Proceed with Caution.
bad,It is a small business that has many benefits. But balancing my life with a job that tracks hours when I have many doctors appointments is hard. It makes it hard for me to spend time with my family when I have to schedule everything before 9 or after 5...
bad,Had bad experience but that does not mean everyone else will or has! Was just not a good place for me personally. Dealt with rude co-workers and unorganized new office. Was not listened too or respected! Agency owner was great but always felt like I was desposable
bad,I was not told it was a team based sales goal. If everyone did not work hard and we did not meet the goal no one received a commission.  The commission goal seemed to raise each month with no explanation.
bad,"dont really care about their employees"
bad,"Allstate insurance as a whole is a okay company to work for. In the claims department, the pace is fast. Not a lot of experience on the floor which include management and directors."
bad,At first I thought this was a good business to work for but as time went on the Agent owner/Manager made the office very stressful and I felt he micro managed me as other in the office felt the same.  He would leave without telling us most times and would not support us asking for time off and contradicted what he would tell us. Didn't feel I could contribute to this office and the reason I didn't put more effort into learning more is because I felt uncomfortable asking questions. Also there was no formal training.
bad,"Commission on property and casualty policies are minimal when compared to the amount of time required to close sales.  Worked more than 40 hours per week, only compensated for 40 hours.  Agency did not have a clear marketing plan to generate new business.  Agency did not reimburse for costs of obtaining licensing."
bad,If you are looking to start a franchise run and run fast.  Allstate has restricted business to an extent that it is incredibly hard to make money as a new agent surviving on new customers.  The underwriting is oppressive and the risk management is clueless.
bad,Having spent over 30 years I can say once the company split off and went public there was a huge shift in internal culture. Staff is generally overworked in all areas of the organization. Most longer term employees are financially trapped and the internal culture in the organization leads most people to believe they have little value in the general job market so most are afraid to leave despite the skill set they could make available to the open market. The company recently (2017) laid off over 600 employees on a conference call. That lack of caring is demonstrated in the day to day operations across the organization
bad,Very political environment. Pay and promotions are based on favoritism instead of ability and experience. Most managers are promoted having little to no claims experience and are unable train and guide new employees. Experienced employees are passed over for promotions and used as mentors to train new employees. Goals are constantly changed so that hey are unattainable the lack of salary increases can be justified.
bad,A typical day at All State was great except for trying to sale auto insurance with premium much higher than other companies. Servicing clients and writing home insurance was great. The auto rates were the main issue.
bad,"Allstate will give you plenty of advancement opportunities, but they only give you a 2% annual raise if you're not in management and they work you to death in almost every department.  Claims is awful and the MI PIP department is the worst.  Do not work in PIP -- it's way too stressful and they overload you with too many claims -- like 130-150."
bad,Allstate has no respect for employees or customers.  Bad management decisions are made to advance stock prices but place employees and customers in compromised situations.
bad,"The office I worked in was ran by a small clique of managers that placed a very low ceiling for everyone in the office.  Unless you were friends with upper management, any applications to other teams or department were squashed due to 'being short staffed'. There is no HR staff to refer to beyond corporate headquarters, who were not helpful at all."
bad,"There's not One good thing about working for Allstate insurance (at least that's my opinion about the office were i worked at)  You'll be treated like a machine, No paid time off or benefits of any kind. The office Principal agent is an older Asian man, I don't know how good or bad are the other offices in the santa clarita area but, now i wish I wouldn't have accepted a job at this one!"
bad,"Allstate is the epitome of overworked and underpaid. On the surface, the job description is doable in the 8 hours a day you are there. However management makes the job harder than necessary with micro-management. Even though you are capable of managing your own desk, the managers are constantly adding to your workload with lists of additional items that are not necessary to complete your job. Completing the lists only make your manager look better in their managers eyes. There is constant competition pitting you against your peers by comparing your production to your peers in meetings and emails. However Allstate's new claims philosophy is to not focus on what your production numbers are, but instead on the quality of your work, your production numbers are still constantly being used against you against your peers. "
bad,"Every day you will start off where you ended yesterday, because there is so much work that it never stops coming or slows down.  You just jump in and get at it.  That part was great!"
bad,not enjoyable it was ok I dont care to speak about this company a typical day as busy learned i can do it managed my no one i dont have co workers nothings hard
bad,"Thought it was a great place to work my first 6mos....but they want you to work for peanuts compared to the other insurance companies. They push more and more and more work on you and if lucky you'll get a 2-4% raise (maybe). Management changed too much for my liking and all they care about are the numbers not the employees (don't be fooled). You're sold a bunch of wooden nickels at this company, a lot of pipe dreams.... To many meetings and not enough development of employees.....I could go on and on ....only gave two stars because a few of the co workers were great"
bad,"You are expected to be a robot and do your job without any regard to family. Advancement is not based on how well you do your job but on how much the ""right"" people like you. Adjusters are not treated like adjusters but like Sr. Processors who are expected to answer and address phone calls that come to the wrong department with no accountability for those who may have sent the call in error."
bad,Agent’s office big  promises of high income  and little pay out.  Can be the top sales person one month and then treated like dirt the next month. Plays a lot of mind games and blares disco music.
bad,Ok  job leadership isn't great they sell lies to you and making you think you are doing good but then snatch the role from underneath you. They use you when they need you by making TDY roles that never go anywhere. If you go against the grain they talk about you to other leaders and they never get reprimanded for it. The co workers make the jobs.
bad,"Allstate is a large name in the industry but there are no benefits when working with Allstate, no salary, no benefits and long hours."
bad,There was no medical insurance if you did not have enough employees in the office. There was nothing to bust moral. There was nothing to do with the Corporation itself just the name of the company
bad,The Allstate corperation is a great company to work for but it veries agent to agent. some are ok others are not it really just kind of depends
bad,"I did not like working here. The company was not work/life balance friendly. Management was not supportive. In fact when I left, I had a manger lie on me"
bad,Terrible company to work for. The benefits are good but the salaries are terrible and very LITTLE room for promotions. Very negative environment and work/life balance is terrible.
bad,"A typical day at allstate is Inbound/ outbound customer inquiries, internet literacy, Microsoft office, releasing funds for settled claims, verifying facts, performed data entry into the NextGen software system, scheduled appointments, fax, file, copy. Clock out"
bad,"I start out a typical day at work organizing and preparing my call log for the day. I would go through my tickler file and follow up with with clients & paperwork that needed faxing etc. My day consisted of working no less than 9 hours a day and only being paid for 40 hours regardless if I worked 50 to 60 hours. I was not a salaried worker, I was commission sales w/an hourly wage and felt over worked and well underpaid for my position. I was a team player and also trained new agent's when needed but was never appreciated for the extra time and work I put into my agency. The most difficult part of the job were the expectations constantly changing, the constant belittling from the agency owner to his employee's and the lack of support he showed to his team."
bad,I mostly answered the phones but management was using me to do grocery shopping and cook everyone food for lunch. I was the only woman working there and I didn't like that.
bad,"Doesn't pay enough for amount of work and stress it involves, inappropriate conversations aloud in call center while others are on the phone with customers. No room for advancement; you may change job title but your not paid for it they call it a temp position. Experienced rude unethical Manager on a daily baises, ""OK company"" but wrong people in management. New Employees start with higher pay than many current employees have; How is that Legal ? Also very unstable if you work there be prepared to move your assigned cubicle at any time."
bad,"Not a bad company, but the claims department and how it is managed has a lot to be desired. Promotions given based on popularity and no integrity. Coworkers were extremely gossipy...the day after Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve are regular working days. Rotated weekends. No time for family! If you like this kind of atmosphere, be my guest but WATCH YOUR BACK!!!!"
bad,Good luck working for these folks. They basically just ripped me off.
bad,"Work/life balance is not terrible.  If you have a ""fussy"" manager, it could be a nightmare trying to get a day off without a guilt trip from him or her.  Managers tend to play favorites and love people who are ""moldable"".  During the recent layoffs, a few jobs were saved for people that upper management thought were worth saving.  That is not a fair policy by any stretch.  Most insurance companies are trying to get more work out of fewer people these days.  My advice is get hired, get trained and look for something else."
bad,"Lip service is paid to work life balance. Watch your back and ""play the game"" if you are caught up in this ugly picture of American corporate politics."
bad,"Of course was sold a dream when initially hired. You have to follow up with management. They base your salary off what the market is in the area. Nobody knows how they really get this data. You are overworked, underpaid, and stressed. Their focus is mainly on customers and not missing too many phone calls. Miss one call and they sending you an email about it. The workload is not even. You find yourself working late and working weekends just to work things out. Don't let too many people take vacation at once or you'll get all the work dropped on your desk. There is no morale there but there is a morale team. They think buying ice cream and cake boost morale but it doesn't. Don't feel valued as an employee, stressed everyday. The pros are your coworkers are friendly, get a good amount of PTO. The cons would be there is NO work life balance and for all the work you do it's not worth it for little pay. However happy to have something to pay the bills."
bad,"Need to be open to candidates that you won't get paid hourly, its all commission based work."
bad,Allstate is a good company to work for but the the way that the Coppell location is ran is ridiculous ! I’m not saying it because something didn’t go my way! I’m saying it honestly based off the time I’ve been there things change frequently and unexpectedly! And they don’t care if your okay with the change ! Some of the managers are only there for the bonus you will get them and not for your success that you offer the company! I highly suggest you to NOT work in sales unless your really awesome at sales!
bad,"Definetely not community. No supervision nor encouragement. Kind of isolated type of environment. Poor training, no communication, no structure and absolutely no intercommunication between staff and management."
bad,I answered phones and took premium payments. The customers were diversified and some were just crazy.  Dealing with the customers that did not understand what their policies stated.
bad,"The agents you work for are either really good or really bad.  Mine refused to resolve at work conflicts and expected me just to make cold calls all day.  "
bad,"Job isn't bad but the company is very demanding of the staff for targets and requirements. Work life balance is absolutely horrible, the company now requires that every employee regardless of role take their laptop home daily. Office dynamic is fun most agents get along, there's a lot of laughter that goes on most days but production isn't always top of mind. Agency does different team building exercises after company hours which are fun, we also try to do potlucks a few times a year. Overall the office has a good atmosphere but the company's requirements make it very difficult."
bad,Change in CEO began the caustic and toxic environment and decay of a great workplace. Customer service is no longer the priority it was. Metrics replace reality. You’re faced with conflicting directions from management that result in poor performance evaluation due to constant changes by direct manager for their own benefit at your expense
bad,"Thanks for nothing Allstate. "
bad,The company would rather hire men with their pants dragging on the gound or high schools kiddies than experienced pros.   Its a joke to work there. Managers have no skills
bad,Management treats their employees like dirt.. I would never recommend any of my friends or family members to ever go over there to work. The pay is horrible too.
bad,"Allstate Technology Organization (ATO) employees do not share many of the companies benefits because IT is considered to be a burden on the rest of the company. IT salaries are generally much lower than industry average by 20% - 50%. You really are stuck in your 'band'. Some new hires in high demand areas- such as SAP or Big Data get an OK initial offer, but then they can forget about any annual increases. No bonus or monetary recognition unless you are very high up the career ladder. Very limited growth opportunities, no clear career transitions, lots of nepotism and favoritism. One example is that after 15-20 years of service you may get the chance to become a team-leader, maybe. Lots of silos, with poor communication and coordination, even within the same departments- example between Windows and Unix support. Extremely restricted budgets for education, training, conferences, or travel. Lots of experienced people have been layed-off or have left leaving large gaps in knowledge. Younger staff have not been trained properly or paid properly to fill more advanced positions yet management still demands same or increased levels of service. IT leadership is full of legacy managers- rude, unavailable, and ready to take their frustrations out on you. Constant risk of being layed off, especially if you are experienced or well compensated. Employee share of cost of benefits went up drastically in a very underhanded manner. Morale is quite low. Company earnings are linked to catastrophic weather events- if you believe in global warming this company is in trouble. The auto insurance business"
bad,"They are really big on all things ""Corporate"" at Allstate. There's a catchphrase, abbreviation, or tagline for everything. They will constantly tell you ""This can go on your LPs"" like that should be the highlight of your life. There is a certain type of person who will be fine working here, but if you are not one of those people, you will very quickly feel trapped and overwhelmed."
bad,All we did was make cold calls all day.  It was a bit rough trying to gather private information from someone over the phone who didn't request any information in regards to quotes or insurance.
bad,"Busy..lot of over time. "
bad,"Company has changed a great deal over the last 4 years regrettably not for the benefit of its front-line claims workers"
bad,"Tough job. Started off well. Claim volume unmanageable. Once you start to get behind, you never catch up unless you work on days off/vacation. It's the expectation that you will have to work over or come in early, but when you first start there is no overtime offered and management will let you work as long as you want knowing you aren't getting paid for it. Once they release you on to full claims receipts, you'll get about 4-5 a day and need to call everyone involved and make contact with everyone with in 24-28 hours. You will get 8 claims on Saturdays when you work and need to make all contacts. You're expected to be on the phone almost all the time and document all claim conversations. If you forget to document the file, the conversation never happened. The claims, the calls and the work never stop. The changes to how you handle claims don't either. Your liability decisions will be questioned ever for claims with identical facts of loss may end up having different outcomes. Needy customers will waste your time and you are expected to deliver great customer service, but not waste time with them. To go over everything and get a recorded statement will take you about 20-30 minutes a call for a quality call. If you get 5 claims a day though, you should eat your desk to make sure you try to call everyone. If they don't answer, you're expected to call them back later in the day and basically harass them until you make the contact. You're instructed on inbound calls to do everything for the other adjuster and own the call. Not all adjusters do this though and you'll figure out who"
bad,"Allstate has the reputation to underpay claims....Deny, Delay, and ""Not Pay""....We had to  justify every claim payment and had to include in our report applicable claims provisions.  Then we were reinspected"
bad,"Worked in IT for a long time in various roles. In the past three or four years, new senior leadership began who I feel do not value the employees as people. In my opinion, the focus has become to satisfy under resourced productivity commitments made by over ambitious management with little input or even against recommendations made by senior staff. I think Management is trying to implement a high paced sales management style into an IT department. Director level Management have emphasized in staff meetings that staff are coddled babies and how they should be happy they have jobs. As well,  when productivity requests from the Business increased, Senior Leadership's response was to hire new Directors and Managers - not staff ( staff are leaving in droves btw). The new management ""style"" was in stark contrast to former management and this ""change"" is causing quite a lot of stress for many who work there. I believe it to be a toxic work environment that for the wrong person could definitely impacting one's health."
bad,"Busy work atmosphere with phone calls and quoting. Quoting system is good, however, too many office systems to enter in information not one platform.  Too many places to look for information.."
bad,"Nothing different, same thin everyday.  It is a entry level position.   Not chance for advancement.  If your not in sale, you don't count.  Salary was not what was promised.  No benefits."
bad,Was lied to at interview and after being hired and starting to work everything I was told during interview was changed the agent wasn’t a man of his word
bad,"Allstate has gone through several countrywide layoffs that effect tenured personal as well as new hires. The job itself is not bad but management needs to be addressed. There is too much oversight on performers. The oversight comes from many different people and departments, it is inconsistent. The feedback is mainly punitive and there is no real coaching behind any reinspects."
bad,I didn't feel the organization was very ethical. On more than one occasion I was coached on how to manipulate sales results. I didn't feel comfortable. The compensation was extremely generous but the environment was not one I considered to be ethical.
bad,"cliques and incestual. Not for the intelligent or anyone who has experience. Good for young kids of managerial people."
bad,This job is only good if you own your own agency. It is nearly impossible to make a decent living when working for an independent Allstate Agent. Don't waste your time.
bad,"Management is driven by playing nice with upper leadership, ""Don't rock the boat."" Complaints about workload fall on deaf ears and are responded to with a smile as validation. Pending is 300 or more per person, constant call rotary, pd, rental, ttloss calls. All thrust into your lap with the expectations of  doing all this before handling your own demands which come in sometimes 5-10 at a time. Processes are NOT smart choices and they waste thousands  on. professional training. Poorly managed company. Person who needs to ve remoced is Kathpeen Abed who is having inappropriate relationships with some male employees. Tocic. While they vie for ""transparency"" that couldn't be further from the truth......tell us how you feel but it better be how we feel. So much  brown nosing to curry favor.disgusting. Promotions to unqualufied while the qualified are constantly overlooked. Forced inclysion into company activitues, donations be a part of the team. Time spent on useless meetings, roubdtables, RCPS. Waste of time."
bad,"Express sites are the worst out of all Allstate job sites.  One should avoid the Cheyenne Express site at all costs.  That is a career killer location.  They management is petty, and they play favorites.  It was hard to be around them as they would constantly bash and belittle the folks out on the claim floor.  They do not value their human capital."
bad,They are all over the place in the Texas legal offices at Allstate. The managers are disorganized and unprofessional. They are not fair and discriminate.
bad,"For a company that preaches teamwork, there isn't a lot of it that actually takes place.  Every man or woman for themselves. Poor upper management, and a serious lack of leadership at the local level."
bad,"A lot of drama involving management.  Office staff was 1099 but we had set hours to work and were provided office space and equipment.  No walk in customers, all sales done on the phone cold calling."
bad,No other comments it was stressful and very unpredictable. Good ol boy atmosphere there was always some one that was playing games with what they were offering. Lies
bad,Micro management that grew up in Allstate and don't know of other ways to do anything.  Some good people but too many only concerned about themselves.
bad,"Making 100 plus calls a day looking for sales in auto, home or life insurance. Provide daily assistance to customers who callin about current policies."
bad,"Sadly I was criticized about everything I did. Even selling 26 items and bringing in18,000.00 in monthly premium was not good enough."
bad,"Ms.Brown was great. But there aren't any benefits and you're paid once a month so you have to budget. And by it being a Family owned and ran business,, there was zero room for advancement. Overall the staff was amazing, Me. Brown was really nice and very fair."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers with their insurance needs and educating them on other products that could help protect their savings, retirement and other investments."
bad,"It was a lot of things I disliked about working here, one was the attitude I received from the owner, she wasn't always nice about things! I worked there for years, and got treated worst then the newer employees! but I learned a lot from that experience."
bad,"Great benefits including a pension, 401k plan and PTO. "
bad,"Work environment and culture very negative with incompetent managers. Huge gender bias in favor of men. Workload completely out of control; claims is busy by nature yes, but the workload here is absolutely ridiculous."
bad,"Allstate is a large, complex company that is in the process of transition.  The running theme is, ""change"".  They emphasize self improvement and professional growth and have several programs with online education providers and even reimbursement for job related continued education."
bad,"There was no incentive to maintain customer base or go the extra mile for the customer. Unless you are the owner for this location, I would continue your employment search. Nothing to motivate the staff."
bad,"A typical day at work you would go in and take calls, there is very unrealistic expectations of the role. also working in this role there is always another department transferring calls over to us when it is not something we support, about 8 out of 10 times it is the department that transferred the call supported the issue and nothing is ever done about the issue. Causing irritated callers when this is not needed. However in the site itself you work with very friendly people and make good friends."
bad,"low pay for the workload. too much expectations for the pay, no commission when you bring a lot of customers to the company. not fairly compensated."
bad,Overall the claims department lacks direction.  The people that work there are amazing but without direction there is not much room for advancement.
bad,They need to upgrade to a bigger space for productivity.  It was very hot in the office and the boss was never there. You had to bring in your own bathroomr and cleaning supplies to keep everything clean.
bad,when you are done with it. Able to go home.  When you are able to help a customer out in a time of need. Being proactive and becoming an advocate for others that don't know what to do.
bad,"This company was actually an agency of ALLSTATE, ran by an individual who had bought into the company. A work day would consist of direct marketing and promotions, sales and customer service. The agency owner has extreme potential to be successful, yet there are some serious flaws within the system set in place."
bad,No opportunity for growth and not an enjoyable place to work
bad,"I currently handle third party Auto liability PD and BI claims of moderate to majority complexity, that are attorney represented."
bad,"Very fun atmosphere. Paid for your property & casualty license. Paid training. I learned a lot about the company and future plans for the company. The hardest part of the job was the hours: working late at night during the week, every weekends and holiday's. Most enjoyable part of the job was the competitive atmosphere and the fact that you are able to learn something everyday!"
bad,"The owner is wonderful.  He's focused on success for you and his company.  It's a scratch store front, so there's so much to do."
bad,"This job was customer service based which i had no issues with at all however I was in college for medical assisting at the time and this job proved to not be right for me, I enjoyed my co-workers and assisting customers. I did not like that although i was an intern they gave me a work load too big for me to manage along with going to college. This job also required me at some point to get a license to sell insurance, This was not within my career choice so there was no way for me to advance further within the company."
bad,Management is crooked. They offer no benefits. Favoritism is present and too much drama.
bad,"It was a very small company. The office consisted of three people, there were four but one quit. Within 15 months the office had already hired and fired 15 receptionist, so I would say it has a high turn over rate."
bad,"I am an established IT Project Manager with an extensive record of implementing and delivering projects on schedule, within budget and with customer focused quality.  As a proven team focused leader with high performance standards and a goal oriented approach, I am confident that my skill set will bring value to your company."
bad,"I loved my job at Allstate because I like helping people. "
bad,Very fast paced work place.   Met many great people and enjoyed the challenge.
bad,The hardest part was dealing with customer who were taking out their insurance frustrations on myself.
bad,"The corporate structure can definitely use some cleaning as there are some regional managers that are very proactive to help their agents grow, and then those who really don't even care. As for the individual agencies themselves, the environment is heavily dependent on the leadership of the agency owner. Allstate as a company does provide a solid value proposition to their customers, but in the end the delivery falls upon the agents themselves. "
bad,"Learned how to sell insurance. Enjoyed working with some of my co workers others I did not because they were mean and rude. I was unhappy and when voiced my concerns and complaints I would be threatened that I would be terminated, if I didnt get my act together."
bad,"I can't speak for every department at Allstate because I have only worked in claims. If you work hard in claims you will always have a job, the benefits are great, great work life balance. However, if you want to advance or move to another sector of the organization Allstate is not the company for you."
bad,The atmosphere is nice and the people are very friendly. Everyone works together as a team
bad,Beware of the IT department. Everyone is related to someone up there ( they keep it in the family). Doesn't matter how hard you work your efforts will go unrewarded.
bad,"a typical day was to answer calls about insurance, add change delete and remove cars. take payments and the intense pressure to always get them to upgrade to renters, condo, home, or an auto if they didn't have one. The co-workers are your equals however there are some people in management who know nothing about insurance and that they let you know so by being absent or sending you everywhere to get an answer. The hardest thing about working here was that they don't have shift bids for English for over year and a half and that you have pressure to always sell when you are in service. The most enjoyable is being able to speak with people from all over the united states ."
bad,"I worked in the SIU department for Allstate claims here in Mesa, AZ. The older employees who've been there for 10 + yrs have a chip on their shoulder as if they're better than any new new employee. I also noticed that the old timers look at new hires as being a threat to their existence with the company so watch your back and keep your distance because they will act quick to place blame and throw you under the bus when things go wrong in the unit. The manager who runs the SIU unit here in AZ is shady and she only cares about her own status. She was very unhelpful. and personally sought to get rid of newer employees since they didnt have the amount of time and experience that the old timers did. I feel as though they set new hires up for failure for whatever reasons they have."
bad,Worked as an CSR for an agent. Allstate's technology and systems were awesome. Pending on how the agent can manage his own office will either make or break this job. The agent I worked for was gutless and very dishonest with his dealings with all office employees and did nothing but throw everyone under the bus behind their back.
bad,"Leadership team does not value long term dedicated employees, very poor levels of employee engagement, ineffective management, high employee turn over and unrealistic work demands producing stressful and unhappy work environment."
bad,"Great place to start if you have NO EXPERIENCE. It is a fairly stable company, so the risk of being laid off unexpectedly is low; however, this place will overwork its employees, overwhelm them, underpay them, and underappreciate them. "
bad,"There are No benefits. Pay is ok. Depending on your experience level with sales. Get under the right Agent/owner. Preferably one who has been in business 3 to 5 years or more. Alot of new agents in Georgia with No experience. Not a help to the Lsp. Commission structure with new agent unobtainable. You pay for your own license.  Most agents do not. "
bad,Allstate was a great job. Terrible boss who promised to train me but never did. Instead went on long vacations and was never in the office to provide help when needed
bad,If you don't mind being under paid and over worked than this is the company for you. Unrealistic expectations for the demands of the job. Every employee talks daily of seeking new employment
bad,I feel that the culture needs work. Frontline staff are usually more skilled and educated than their current manager and this creates rifts between the employees that are not needed.
bad,"Coming in from another state I was expecting to come to a similar working environment. I was wrong. Pain was low, work was stressful and agent was pretty much hands off doing anything. Benefits were just ok. Too much stress and low pay. Went to work for another agent with State Farm"
bad,Answers call for iNSURED THAT ARE STRESSED and are in need of help this job is very stressful and one should be offered more pay due to the stress level
bad,"I did not have proper training on policies. They expect you to get I car certified and take their learning courses on your own time. They are always changing how they do business. Uncertain of which direction they want to go. "
bad,"Algorithms for auto insurance rates are based on good credit, homeowners, marriage. Not a fit for most Americans."
bad,"Not only are you going to feel bad after a while for convincing people to buy overpriced products, corporate is designed only to protect themselves and do not care about the sales staff."
bad,There's isn't a split second to breathe without panicking about how much work you have. All they care about is surveys and cycle time. With over 40-60 claims at one time it's impossible to please anyone. Maybe spend more money on hiring not more employees so that the work can be more dispersed. Terrible place to work for the pay they offer and obscene amount of claims you're responsible for.
bad,"Unfortunately, I found myself working for a revolving door agency. As soon as she would hire someone new, another employee got fired. This happened multiple times until I was eventually fired too. The sales quota is very difficult to reach. The compensation is pathetic for the amount of work you have to put in to just keep your job! The market is super saturated with insurance agents. Do yourself a favor and choose a different career path."
bad,the job was ok the pay was ok the management was not great need improvement company closed down an no longer exist at location had an ok commission structure
bad,"This position is the wave of the future for claims handling and it is awful. Customers don't trust you because you haven't been to the site to inspect personally, management and authority consultants give conflicting instruction/advice and blame the adjuster by calling it poor decision making. Workflow is out of control and precious few customers are satisfied with the level of service able to be provided. Salaried/exempt role so expect to work many more than 40 hours a week with no additional pay/benefit. Not worth it."
bad,It did not turn out to be as great as ai expected. I think that it's between transitions and i hope that it gets a new direction and momentum. I beliecve most of the people feel a bit confused.
bad,Opportunities are given to a select few who are personal friends with management (according to Facebook anyway). Otherwise you're doomed to sit in the same desk until you rot.
bad,"I loved working for Allstate; however, once the President of this particular Allstate made a co-worker the office manager, many things changed. Work was unbearable, due to her demands."
bad,Stressful atmosphere and some what discriminating.  Found some favoritism but tried to make the best until had to take care of elderly parent.  Left them for this reason.
bad,"Pilot Catastrophe had great pay, one of the best that I have ever found. When I first got this job I was very excited and knew that I would succeed. The problems started when I realized that Pilot is very 'group' oriented. If you aren't part of that group you won't get help. They throw you into a week training, then put you on the phone with insureds who have lost their houses or property from a natural disaster without telling you how to actually help them. You would have to pay the insured out anywhere from $300- >$1million, and it was very hard to find someone who would help you make sure you did it right. Something as simple as trying to get approval for a mandatory evacuation could turn into a 2-month ordeal due to management denying it and not telling you why they did. You could have everything correct with one manager, but when they inevitably moved you to another manager, everything you did was wrong."
bad,"Run far away unless you like to work up to 80 hours per work week on a salary that is lower than some companies in this industry. "
bad,"Worked for two different Agencies of which one was absolutely great and the other not so well. It's not fair to survey one and not the other combined, therefore the information provided is not applicable."
bad,Agency owners for Allstate seem to have one goal in mind. Make as much money off of their producers while paying them the smallest amount possible to do so.
bad,It was my first job and it was a horrible first experience. The work culture was very clique-ish and there was no opportunity of advancement. Everyone is for looking out for themselves.
bad,Accounting Department is not following what the company is promoting.  Managers don’t advice you on you career. They promote “Own your career”. There is flexible work life balance but that does not apply to us.  Healthcare employee contribution went up. Quality of employee recognition went down.  They did a lot of budget cuts throughout the 10 years I have been there.
bad,Everyone was focused on numbers and not the humans behind them. plain and simple. My father use to own and operate the former big Allstate office on Everhart. I had been around Allstate most of my life and i can say that is all that the people are focused on. That is why my father sold his building and created his own business as an insurance broker.
bad,"Chasing the corporate welfare to North Carolina, leaving longtime veterans (and the institutional knowledge they have) out on the street...this is not the Allstate I have known for many years."
bad,Had good co workers and friends. Felt like a big family after working for around 15 years. Became the first Indian female underwriter. Allstate gave me tuition reimbursement to earn MBA.
bad,"I've worked here for about a year and a half and from day one the expectations were ridiculous. With the amount of claims we get the pressures are too much to handle. You are constantly being told what you're doing wrong as opposed to doing right and the environment is very toxic. Managers not agreeing or notifying us on the proper procedures and not notifying us as soon as they change. The employees in all departments pass of work to others by saying ""its not my job"" instead of handling it professionally and trying to assist those of us that are struggling. The only time we get to do our work is at the end of the day and at that point we already have many complaints as we don't have a breather."
bad,They only care about their numbers and do not respect or take care of long time employees. They do not care if you have to work on weekends or holidays.
bad,I did not enjoy the time there as I was a captive agent and there was too much interference from the head office while I was supposed to be running my own business . I had all the risks but not all the rewards of running my own business.
bad,"Strict, nothing like I'd ever seen in a workplace. I knew it was a mistake on the second day.Extremely unpleasant. Very disorganized. Impossible to proved happy customer service. Excellent was 38% of PAID claims."
bad,if you enjoy sales than this is a good job. 
bad,I have worked for Allstate before with a different Agent and the grass is not greener on the other side. Things told to you in the interview aren't always what they make it out to be.
bad,"I was a bill adjuster for 1 month before I left. Poor training, loud work space, long days, heavy traffic in the area and demanding productivity standards. You will process claims by paying for services or denying payments. You will answer provider and member calls concerning their claim. You are assigned claim adjusters who oversee the claim, I was assigned 3 in my second week. The best thing was that I met a few pleasant people, who really tried to help out."
bad,"I really have no feed back for this company, was a temp job during hurricane Katrina. Good pay, long hours, no benefits. Fast paced and the superior team were not well trained."
bad,"Management at Allstate is pretty much non existent. They upper managment gives them so much to do that they have no time to work with employees. They like to say how great it is to work there, but with no encouragement or coaching from your leader it's hard to keep a good morale. Due to the way they do their payroll, when I left they are now saying that I owe them money. I will give Allstate a big thumbs down. Run quickly the other way folks."
bad,If you don't want to shave years off you life stay away and look for employment some where else. It's a bend until it eventually breaks type of business.
bad,"The headquarters is too stringent, creativity lacks and it's too far from the city. They low ball employees and want them to work too much. I learned a lot but it gets old quickly."
bad,"Sitting at a desk all day and answering phones and filling can be very tedious. If you're a person that likes those things, this job is for you! On the other hand, those days you're tired, its great."
bad,"Lack of focus on priorities and no focus on performance management of poor performer if they have tenure.  The work is weighted heavily on those with strong work ethic and less for those who do not and are not performance managed out of the organization. As a result, burnout is likely for high performers.   Organizational priorities are to large to establish synergy and focus so there is constantly a new ""shiny object"" to follow."
bad,The hardest part of the job was how sad it was to work with accident victims paperwork and contacting them to say what was covered and what was not covered in their car repair or hospital bill
bad,this job is a great place to gain experience talking on the phone and learning a lot about different insurance situations. The work timings are very flexible and easy as well as the pay is good.
bad,"Call center office - inbound calls."
bad,"I answer phone calls all day about very complex problems on policies. Most days you're micro managed and scrutinized under a microscope and no matter how much training they give you, you still don't feel like you know what you're doing. "
bad,Great company to work for. A agent office job with no benefits. If you like customer service then go ahead and apply. They are located at the Nissan dealership in Morrow.
bad,"great place to work"
bad,"again, this is a lot to type for an application and care less to provide an opinion on a company I no longer care for, this process should be a voluntary decision of the applicant to participate not a mandatory asset of the application"
bad,"I work in the total loss claims department as a processor.  My manger, was very unprofessional.  The system would auto assign claims and you get behind easily.  My day consisted of working new claim contacts, calling lien holders and issuing checks.  Problem was the system would assign claims unevenly and my manger played favorites. She would take her favorites off of claims and the ones she did not like would get slammed.  She would yell at you in front of others and threaten you with your job.  She states that we are a team but clearly she and others in upper management are in it for themselves and have only their own interest on their mind.   They throw you under the bus if you are not making your numbers but yet, there is no way one person can get through 10-20 new contacts a day while answering inquiry calls, returning calls from irriate customers, calling lien holders, prepping power of attorney and or title instruction documents plus making out checks to customers.   The best part of my job is my co-workers.  There was only one that was a issue who would throw you under the bus and try to get you in trouble.   I have seen my boss, who has only been a manger for 1 1/2 of her 3 years there, fire someone who worked there for over 20 plus years.   They say to be transparent but that is a joke.  If you speak your mind, show your frustration when you get screamed at, you are gone. If you like being humilated in front of your team mates, stressed out and over worked, breaking down in tears no matter how strong you think you are and kissing the bosses butt etc., than the Claims"
bad,While the work isnt the worst out there i find that it is rather tedious and something i do not have a passion for. Unfortunately the Agent that employs me is not the best in the management aspects and can be quite vindictive. Overall its not the worst environment but exceedingly tiring for someone who has no interest in this field
bad,Great place to work if you like to sit all day and talk on the phone while trying to sell the insurance to others. You have room to grow if you communicate well with others and are very professional and love what you do.
bad,"answer calls and document conversation  educate the agents meet all metrics on a daily basis"
bad,"I was only with the company for a short time and it was somewhat helpful and got some learning. I went into the company striving to be better and wanting to continue my knowledge and helping others. Even though this didn't work out due unspoken reasons, I am thankful for the few short months I was able to learn to help me continue to grow and where I'm at now"
bad,training the kids was fantastic and inspiring.  Getting to watch them grow as a person and a martial artist was amazing. Co-workers were fantastic.  Good school to learn martial arts
bad,After being at this agency for many years I have learned that many of these direct agents tell employees one thing- to only mean something totally different.  I bonus structure is very different and hard to keep up with. Working with a broker is much better.  You are able to help your clients much better with more choices and options.
bad,"Have been employed for over 20 years with Allstate and within 5 years I have had 5 different managers and 22 employees have left my work group due to job stress, workload etc."
bad,"I worked at Allstate almost three years. I was promoted to Office manage, this was to add to my work  and also the office staff work. The staff members would come in hours late in the morning and take two hour lunches. The owner of this office would call me while I had taken vacation days and sick days to ask for assistance with the office over the phone. My typical day was to prospect for new client and do endorsements on insurance policy's."
bad,"An average day at the Allstate call center is like any other call center, you take calls and that is about it. If you are a supervisor at the call center, then it is a great place to work because it involves being on the phones very seldom, you get to talk to other supervisors all day, walk around the center aimlessly, and if someone has a question you just tell them to check Rio and disappear.  The management there seems to be great until you need help."
bad,The employer was not helpful. There was constant issues with claims and rental contract delays. When I helped out with long distance calls to recent customers - the employees would delay the process for me to contact them back.
bad,"It was a job. At the end of the day, they get free labor out of you and call it a TDY as if it is some huge opportunity...no, it's just an internal internship.... Benefits were great.... work life...none... management...it depends on the department.. Job culture was pretty decent....cool people, cool programs, lots of activities going on all of the time."
bad,"aucune place à l'erreur"
bad,The company was good to work for. It is a good stepping stone to better things
bad,Looking for a company that offers growth and advancement. I did not really like working for this company.
bad,Not much opportunities or development.. Did not learn much
bad,I produced P&C policies to generate revenue for the company and maintain a healthy and professional environment for the customers.  I help with any questions on their policies and claims.  I manage the office and 4 other employees make sure the office is up and running at normal business hours. Handle Commercial Claims processing. The management and staff were unprofessional.
bad,"Allstate operations has gone through a fundamental change in the last ten years.  The current overriding direction is to cut expenses by reducing on-shore staff.  How this is achieved is determined by the highest level of management in the company, with little involvement by any local Senior management."
bad,"In a structured, Insurance Call Center environment, maintained policy changes in the Property, Specialty and Casualty sector of the insurance industry. Responsibilities included: communicated with policy holders about changes, premium increases/decreases, billing, rate changes, insurance quotes, along with cross-selling, continuing education, as well as seminars and education of services and products training. Licensed Insurance Agent in the State of Illinois by way of passing the Property &Casualty licensing exam."
bad,"I worked at the Cheyenne Express Claims Center in WY, but I've talked with people in other Express centers and it's the same nationwide."
bad,"Taking claim calls on insurance for auto or home. People were nice to work with. The drive was a bit far and when the wheather was baf it was difficult driving over the bridge, especially during a hurricane."
bad,"Lots of changes with this company making employees expendable. Point system in place puts customer service on the back burner. This creates a culture of short cuts resolving claims just for the points, not the customer experience. Estimators are being hired have little or no experience on how to repair a vehicle.  As more departments are being removed to hire employees in other countries and additional tasks added to estimators the point systems doesn't change but expectations are. When asked if adjustments are being made to the points system they will tell you there looking into it.  Its been almost a year and still no adjustments made.  Leaders don't lead by example.  Enjoyed the comradery of the teams and working with customers and shops across the country.  Benefits are great but for a reason."
bad,"General experience:"
bad,Increasing high turn over rate. Fifteen people have left in the last six months. Company not replacing those who leave. Unmanageable work load unable to complete task to company requirements.
bad,Training process is the best I've experienced.  Once actually in the position you are expected to meet strict metrics and are micromanaged to the point of annoyance.  This is not a company to begin a new career at if you are over the age of 30.
bad,Management was unprofessional and often said inappropriate things that made the whole team uncomfortable. The main office was in Florida and felt very removed from us. Training was terrible. The most senior employee was responsible for training all the new employees. That employee was cold and did not give knowledge easily. Not set up for success. They implemented a grading system for our calls but withheld what we would be graded on.
bad,"Like most jobs you work your but off for the boss, and they know how to work the turnaround that is constantly happening. Allstate is very conservative and with the same products out there, how can you justify the same coverages for hundreds more?"
bad,"Lots of favoritism, impossible to move up unless you play favorites with management. You’ll do the work of people two pay bands higher but not get paid for it. They’ll tell you you NEED to apply for an opening position and then not even give you an interview. That being said, they offer great PTO and benefits. Just be prepared for stagnation."
bad,"The compensation is barely above minimum wage, communication was lacking, background check took a long while for unknown reasons, had to learn on my own."
bad,"This is a high stress environment. The pay and benefits aren't worth the stress. Not even close. Find a better place to work. On the other hand- if you want a place to work where you're under-appreciated, business practices change every day, you work long days but still can't get all your work done, and you feel like you're always ripping someone off, Allstate's the place for you!"
bad,The company could be much better with better leadership. The BIS position may be the worst position at the company. You're talked down on and not supported by leadership. I would not recommend this position to anyone.
bad,"Management is the biggest downfall of the company. They expect so much but appreciate and motivate so little. Their benefits are okay but have high deductibles, so don't bother getting sick. They drive numbers so much that they forget about the actual overall quality experiences that matter most. The turnover rate is horrendous."
bad,Management in my department has unrealistic expectations with their resources.  Team Leader was promoted even though incompetent and made a hostile work environment in the department and when reported to Allstate HR the Manager did nothing about and was retaliated against even though against Company Policy.
bad,Loved working at my agency; however certain producers made working there hostile. I didn’t wish to leave but issues with said producer refused to be addressed. So I resigned and got my letter of recommendation.
bad,"Claims adjuster are given a large work load. Allstate is the only insurance company that makes adjusters answer the phone calls, there is no customer service call center. Adjusters must pay all bills and check payments to be made for mileage by processors. Too many hands in on pot. You are graded on everything you do."
bad,"if you're able to find a better job....take it as soon as possible."
bad,"its been 15 years since I worked at allstate, clams dept. the center has since closed and employees were laid off or moved to different locations. the experience was surreal: it was basically my first ""real"" office job, coming out of the mid 90's. it was a call center. turnover was high. pay was so so. good cafeteria food, free coffee, tea, hot cocoa. loved the 401k and stock options, and for those who stayed and made a career, they also offered a pension. very rare these days. again, I loved the people I worked with. management, so so. it was my first real job, I made the best of it. relaxed dress code so that was pretty cool. being in a call center, with angry customers or dealing with the aftermath of a storm (quite a few), weather conditions or fires, car accidents, yes we handled that. even had a few celebrities call in for claims. that was pretty interesting. bottom line, its a big company, and like most big companies, you tend to get lost in the shuffle. it was a call center, so you get what you get. would I do this type of work again? I pray I never have to."
bad,"Great place to get you license. EXCELLENT licensing classes.  Get to know your principal agent.  BE SURE your work styles mesh.  Be sure YOU have a good warm market. DO NOT rely of leads provided by Allstate.  Many are old.  Lastly, get to know the office and be sure that you fit their culture."
bad,"Sqa Team lead_ jayalakshmi is worst lady i have ever seen"
bad,"Vendre, vendre et vendre à tous pris. faible perspective d'avenir."
bad,"I worked at this company for many years however the last three years of my career and my supervisor was horrible!!  That supervisor was very manipulative,  dishonest, two-faced and not a good leader at all.  This supervisor fired more employees than any other supervisor in this department and had favorites."
bad,"Hired to do life and investment sales but they really only want auto insurance sales-very little support which may producing enough revenue impossible month in and month out. "
bad,"A typical day at Allstate"
bad,"I called on bills and did cold calling. Management was talking about me behind my back to another employer and i happen to over hear. I do not suggest working at the one in Trophy Club, Texas."
bad,Promotions seem to be entirely based on political reasons. I see lazy but political employees promoted to management while others that work extreme hours are repeatedly snubbed.
bad,Loved my job the first 10 years then the work culture and ethics of the company and treatment of adjusters started to  go down hill.  We became micro managed and upper management became obviously biased and favorites were obvious.  I still loved helping the customers  but the extreme pressure put on us became disgusting.
bad,called out accounts and sat at a desk all day not anything like i was told it was going to be like.  It really wasn't a place for me I was expecting a better atmosphere. The other sales person was very cut throat.  I wouldn't work there
bad,Requires a total commitment to excel with Allstate and unlimited amount of personal funds to invest in your agency. Having a good Sales Manager is very helpful. One is not overwhelmed with work and is a good communicator.
bad,"Company is transitioning but they do not seem to have a direction for the business."
bad,"I liked my coworkers but found the work to be very sales-oriented, which I'm not.  I'm much more support-oriented.  The questions customers asked were warranted although the right answers were much harder to come by."
bad,"The heading of this review says it all. They feel Allstate should be the first priority in their employees life. The workload is overwhelming, and they have no urgency to assist the employees in the workload."
bad,A typical day at work is you sign in at 7am and hope to get calls there are no primary drivers no minimum amount of calls so you can work 20 calls in a week very unlikely or you can do 0 calls in a week.
bad,"I can honestly say that this was the worst job I have ever had. Management was pushy and pushed quotas on to me even though I was not a certified agent. There is some advancement opportunities but all Allstates are owned by individual managers, maybe some are better than mine was....."
bad,Micromanaging at its best! If you are the type of person that will bend over backyards so management will like you then it is the best job!!! You have a coaching session every time you make a mistake. Team Leaders are suppose to develop & encourage you but they only do if they like you.
bad,"Employer did not provide any benefits for medical, dental, etc."
bad,I enjoyed getting to Intern for an Allstate Agency. I learned a great deal about dedication to servicing a business. I learned about keeping detailed call records and payment records. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers. In the Insurance business most customers are not calling to get insurance most are calling to complain about having to pay for increases in their premiums. The most enjoyable part of working their was working with others in a team. They were some of the best people to work with because they kept the work environment light while still getting work done.
bad,All this company cares about is your credit history. If you have a bad driving record but good credit they will insure you. If you have a perfect driving record and bad credit they will not. It's bullcrap. Working for them is not a piece of cake either. Almost everyone you quote is ineligible so you need to be calling 100-150 people a day and you'll be lucky if you get 1 sale. People are constantly fudging the reports and applications just to get a sale which is illegal. Just all around the worst insurance company I've worked for.
bad,"A typical day at work for a new advisor is 100% cold calling. To be honest it was a struggle day after day--I was advised that there would be a fair bit of inbound and in office traffic which was not the case. I learned how this industry works and how employees are expected to succeed. "
bad,"no benefits, no opportunity to advance, high stress. It really depends on the agency owner you work for as to what they can offer you. If you are good at sales youll excell if not you wont."
bad,"Good compensation package and competitive pay but no empowerment.  Fast paced, a lot of work, very thought provoking.  Trust and transparency are the company's claim however that doesn't always translate from leadership to the employee."
bad,Management does not stick up for employees. Constantly getting talk down to by management and customers. Company talks about all the great incentives but does not assist in reaching any of them.  Expected to work more than the 40hrs to manage work load. Very stressful environment with very little appreciation
bad,"Supportive management and upper management"
bad,"I enjoyed my team, although management was always coming and going."
bad,"Pay is not good at all for all the work that you do which is why turnover is high. They have start, stop, continue which encourages employees to express concerns but nothing is done about those improvements"
bad,"take calls for insurance claims"
bad,"Schdule change all the time with no notice."
bad,"The office is very busy and can be extremely stressful with all the customers upset about their rate increases. The pay is good, but not worth the amount of stress. I am looking for a calmer and more possitive atmosphere."
bad,"When I started it was a great company but with some of the Senior Management changes, from the CEO to the VP of HR, it is more about the profits and keeping the stockholders happy than about being what Allstate prided itself to be....a Family.  They cut staff to the minimum possible, pay no more than the absolute bottom market value for jobs and then, if they feel they are understaffed, hire new employees at the very bottom pay grade. (after letting go higher paid employees a year before).  I do not recommend them anymore.  10 years ago, I would have no questions asked recommended them as a great place to work."
bad,keep the clients happy but with the companies best interest first.
bad,I was excited at first to get this job.  I knew it was to be temporary but thought that I would have a good six months of experience.  Instead I had the books up to date quicker then that.  I worked with an incredibly snotty lady.  Every mistake she made was blamed on me.  She consistently lied to the bosses about me.  When they asked me to become an agent I asked if I had to work with her.  They said yes and I would have to work second shift which they knew I couldn't do.  So instead of continuing on as an Agent we agreed I was done.
bad,"Experience as a Physical Damages Manager for a major insurance carrier, with additional responsibilities in the Subrogation unit."
bad,Job was a good fit for a person meant for sales. I had to manage books for 2 agents and the work load was alot to manage and maintain sales for
bad,"Allstate is crushing under it's own weight and bureaucracy. Very nice employee group, but mind-numbing layer upon layer of management. Senior leadership can be charitably described as weak...very few strategic leaders, with most concerned about simply preserving their role). A very slow moving ship that is getting eatin alive by its more nimble competitors in the market. It's a sad story of self-destuction."
bad,Job included Sales service and negotiation for 8 hours per day.
bad,"I would give customers Quotes auto,and home insurance,And i would take payments.And also i would sometime open and close,And deposit money in the bank for the company"
bad,Everyday was filled with disaster. My Executive Agent never tried to show me how to do things or train me properly from day one. It was always a guessing game of how to do HIS job and my own.Agent was never there to work his own business.
bad,The company has inconsistent values. Co-workers were great to work with. Management fostered a hostile even threatening work environment. Unrealistic deadlines for compliance issues in comparison with work. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with clients in their time of need.
bad,"I enjoyed the quiet work atmosphere, however, my position there often became quite hectic with little support from management.  Despite that, management was kind and flexible."
bad,"I had my list of duties, Monday duties, Tuesday duties, etc. etc.  My manager would call me over to his desk before I could even sign into my desktop.  I would get handed some assignment that had to be asap, then he would come and ask me why my other tasks had not been completed.  Too many assignments and not enough time."
bad,The owner purchased the book of business and offered to pay for me to state licensed in property and casualty. The day to day task included cold calling prospects to essentially quote them on an insurance policy that would save them money.
bad,The managers need more training.  Laid back dress code - shorts and flip flops in the IT area.  Told you can work from home but reprimanded for medical appointments - mixed communication.
bad,Unrealistic work load and evaluation of work quality. High turnover in the claims department. Very high turnover. Employees with 6 - 10 yrs experience are leaving or actively  looking.
bad,"I'll cut this review very short as most of you probably know what it means and how it feels to work in a call center environment, just less stressful. Our positions were moved to work from home over a year ago. Since then, all morale declined when we were turned into numbers. Since we no longer had a personal relationship with our supervisors, it was very easy to get terminated for not meeting standards even once or twice. At least at the call center, they worked with you. My supervisor fired several of us who were meeting goal but not exceeding goal. The issue is I didn't find that out until later. My supervisor fired me because of a write up from 2016 for being distracted while on the phone. Never happened since then until Dec of 2018 when my roommate came in the ask me a question. ""Distracted"" The real reason I got fired is because my supervisor got in his feelings about the way I talked to him after he accused me of causing my own system issues. I wasn't going to stand for it and he retaliated against me and used a write up from years ago to fire me. Needless to say, he was trying to please his superiors and not get fired from his position for his team not exceeding goals. Now, from what I'm told, he's boasting and bragging about how well his team is doing now. Your supervisor is not your friend. He is your supervisor and will always be because you will lose your job WAY before he loses his if it came down to it. "
bad,"Like most jobs, Allstate is about who you work for and which department you work in.  Some are awesome, others are all politics and no leadership.  The Senior Leaders (executives) seem to genuinely care about the company and spend a fair amount of time doing town halls to keep employees informed, but there is a bit of a disconnect between those at the top, the middle, and everyone else."
bad,Some agents are great and pay well. Some are drivers and don't pay hardly anything. Company is good. Just depends on the agent you  work for...............
bad,"Flexible schedule your paid for each job you complete and you have a lot of down time"
bad,"Quality and lots of meetings"
bad,the work was boring. insurance is too expensive. pay not so good. hardly any advancements. people are ok. not a fun place to work. need better managements
bad,"The job itself was a lot of work. I worked in claims so pretty much 58-75 calls a day. If you do well you are noticed, however it could be bad cause you could be put in a set queue that requires you to deal with some pretty heavy calls which can be draining."
bad,"There were not enough property adjusters to support the claims that were coming in. You were required to maintain a high amount of new claims daily, while managing your current claims.  Allstate looked for every reason not to cover home claims and often made the process difficult. This falls back on the property adjusters, as they are the ones who interact with the customers who are more often than not beyond angry with Allstate for one reason or another. The constant berating from customers becomes tiring and the onslaught of new claims made it feel like there would never be an end to the stress."
bad,"Searching for potential customers is tiring and stressful. Work is extremly competitive. The pay is low and your money comes from selling policy in order to receive bonuses. Some customers are highly impatient and will yell at your for everything because you are responsible for their insurance. System glitches often and are not up to date with current needs. You dont get pay for overtime, but its mandatory for Saturdays. Full time job, no exception. Deals with lots of paperwork and rude customers."
bad,"The people in the claims office in OKC are amazing. Coworkers are more like family, with true bonds. Management has taken a turn for the worse over the years, and is too far removed from the desk to understand daily struggles. Even with feedback, management shows no desire to make changes. Immediate unit managers were amazing, but the Office Manager and upper management above him have lost touch with reality."
bad,"Took time to train people, but overworked for pay. Everyone's friendly. Long hours. Heavy workload. I dont know what else to say. I dont know what else to"
bad,"Customer service is the worst place to work in. You get paid the least, you handle 4 to 5 times calls than every other department. You do not get holiday pay, You will work pretty much every holiday and will more than likely have to work a weekend day every week. If you want to work for Allstate, go to an agency or get licensed for sales or claims. It will be the only way you can make some actual money and be able to have a life outside of work"
bad,"Allstate is not a bad company but they are currently moving a lot of their claims positions to India to cut costs. If you are an adjuster, this is a good place to start. Otherwise, I do not recommend it."
bad,"It's extremely stressful working there. Your only a number to them, and your in constant pressure from management to get your numbers up, because it makes THEM look good. They say it's a transparent workplace but management will go behind your back to again, make them look good. Hostile working environment from  some co-workers, and especially customers. You have to have a thick shell to take the constant abuse. This is why it pays good with benefits. They have to dangle something there to keep you there."
bad,Long hours and heavy case load. Insufficient staff to had trial case load.  Lack of supervision for existing staff who had no accountability for their performance.
bad,"Corporate, no benefits. There was no room for advancement, rates kept rising customers would be mad, you had no control on quoting, a lot of drama, and you are just a number."
bad,"Spent 21 years dedicated to company in numerous management positions . In the end , was released under new management that is now removing employees for tech options to perform job functions"
bad,nice place to work and meet nice people. Could have a little more discipline through out the company. I enjoyed some of the relationships made while I was there
bad,Worked as a contractor. Was told it will never go permanent. They treat you like a contractor. You are definitely an outsider as a contractor. The directions for doing the job are vague and are constantly changing.
bad,"long hours, I-car trained yearly, management poor, cutthroat work culture - get used to being run over by a bus, not being able to provide what you read the policy as giving a customer, Vacation was the most enjoyable part of this job"
bad,"Check the mail, faxes, voicemails and any emails that come through. Answer all the calls the come through the office and direct them to the right person. I learned how to be more confident in myself when I talk to the customer because you become more comfortable with them."
bad,"I was an intern at Allstate. Everyday, I did more of what interns normally do like photocopying, filing, etc. They were not looking to hire the intern full time so there were no advancements either."
bad,I left when the Independent Allstate Agent retired after 40 years as an Allstate agent - but enjoyed the job and learning about the Property and casualty side of insurance.
bad,"I was given autonomy on the job, management was not available most time for leadership and/or training."
bad,"Growing company so job security isn't an issue. Management and processes can be very trying as many of them don't make sense. Work-life balance is terrible. To succeed at Allstate you must have a strong will, adaptable to constant change (even if the change is unnecessary) and be willing to sacrifice your personal life."
bad,"Typical day at work is you go and sit at your desk and take anywhere from 40 - 90 calls a day assisting customers and local agents with information and changes on policies. "
bad,"At All-Sate Credit I develop and process loan applications for new and existing customers. Handle all delinquent accounts by phone and receive payments on a daily basis. Update all present and former borrowers’ information when applying for loans. I also perform clerical, bill paying and general filing when necessary. "
bad,The owner was terrible giving directions and working with the staff very little communication was given. I would never recommend this company.  The product was good just a bad owner
bad,"Over my 17 years, Allstate seemed to steadily decline in the way that it focuses its attention to it's customers and employees.  Focus seemed to revolve on stock price and only what would keep it from falling.  Morale was low in the department I was in."
bad,"Sales and marketing. Field sales, generating new leads database, multi-policy sales drive. Home , Life, Auto & many more valuable products."
bad,talented workforce that has a challenge with work life balance.
bad,"management changes to often and new rules come with each or other year."
bad,"Normal routine is to come in and take inbound calls from customers reporting accident claims. The hardest part of the job is hearing that someone was badly injured or died. However, the best part of the job is knowing that I could help someone."
bad,A typical day was answering four lines with only two agents available to assist the clients. I learned how to look up customers information regarding their vehicle incidents and DMV reports. Management was very stressed and understaffed. I got along great with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was trying to give quotes to customers without the knowledge and/or education. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and seeing the same clients and established rapports with them.
bad,"I was able to improve my skill set, my customer service skills as well as my knowledge of the corporate business world."
bad,"I worked in Accounting for a while as a temp (some temps work there years! as temps) , and saw multiple people of 25+ years service lose their jobs to cuts. I was the most productive of my group at RATs so I was moved to subro - with no training. Should be a good learning experience, except: I received no training, no direction, manager was gone the entire time so no one to ask questions, no mention of expectations was made, they did not even give me a desk or chair. I had to hopscotch between people's computer before they got to work or after they left. They got rid of me and all of my belongings (!) with no explanation after 2 days. You deserve better."
bad,"is a stressful work environment. By the end of the day is all about meeting your metrics. You are measured for every little thing. Workers don't really have the freedom to even go to the bathroom without them getting on your productivity! if is low you have to hold it till your break or lunch comes up. some management people can be cruel and humiliate you if you are not meeting their ideal numbers, they can even embarrassed you and put you on blast front of your co workers that you are not doing well. Go figured."
bad,wasn't the job for me. i originally started with 5 days a week. i got all caught up with everything that needed to be brought up to date and they cut my hours to 2 days a week.
bad,"The other LSP's that work there along with the manager will help you the best they can and always be friendly and approachable as can be. The owner however is a different story. His jokes are distasteful and always seems to talk about himself in any way he can. The owner at this agency is borderline harassment, as if we went a couple days without selling he would always threaten to fire everyone in the office."
bad,"It was very difficult to build and maintain sales momentum due to tight underwriting guidelines and unwillingness to compete on price even for top-tier clients."
bad,"First of all you need to have money to start working as an EFS here"
bad,"This company in itself is incredible, however Summit Hudson MCO has been anything but. While Allstate is dedicated to customer service; my office was dedicated to favoritism and minding one's own business."
bad,"slow and boring, no office structure,  management not professional, lack of training poor working conditions, lack of communication between employee and employer."
bad,"Negligible opportunity for advancement, base pay increases didn't keep up with cost of living.  Inconsistent management; 24 personnel changes in 21 years."
bad,"Working in a call centre dealing with queries that customers were having with their online accounts, talking through and advising customers how to solve the problems they were having.  Providing high quality customer service over the phone and via e-mail.  Experience in using all Microsoft packages and providing PC support with full after purchase service.  Meeting and beating all targets and ensuring quality calls to pass monthly checks carried out by management."
bad,"Everyday something is changing , you a required to join committees to advance. Management needs training on how to be managers. No Onboarding no real training . They will throw you in the position for you to figure out"
bad,"You only received your earned bonus if the agency, as a whole made it's goal. That is fine if company is properly staffed and everyone pulls their weight. That was not the case at my agency. Furthermore, goals were cumulative and progressive, which made it even harder to catch up. The pressure built daily, by week 3, I dreaded going to work."
bad,"The pay is decent, along with the benefits. Extremely high turnover due to stressful workload. PTO is biggest plus, but leading up to, and following can be even more stressful. The fact they have a pension is great but a high majority don’t last that long. Personally seen many leave mid way through third year and miss being vested because they can’t stand it. Training is very poor. Some people work during PTO to catch up.... OK pay is not worth the stress."
bad,"Workplace culture changed from workload balance between work and home life to all about the numbers. The committees were team building and gave back to the community, until they made work so stressful that you have no time for it anymore. Once a family, now just a company. Great benefits if you can deal with the workload."
bad,"a typical day, the manager walks around. makes you feel like you're doing something wrong even though you aren't. "
bad,"Nice variety of work"
bad,The opportunity for growth is not determined by work ethic or loyalty to the company. it is determined by politics. Allstate will have to do some internal cleaning to gain its reputation it once had as one of the best companies to work for.
bad,"Allstate was a great place to work. I'M extremely grateful to the staff, management, and administration for the opportunity.  Allstate promotes a great workplace environment."
bad,The work was not hard and I love working with customers so the job was pretty easy. The hardest  part was dealing with some immature employees that like to harass me for attention.
bad,"Each day you start with a pre-shift huddle in order to review duties and changes withing your department. More often than not, there are changes that contradict guidelines that were just established the week before. The managers are hard working and very personable, but they are so busy with their own work that they are unable to provide proper assistance to their teams."
bad,"This is supposed to be one of those jobs where there are a number of partnerships that, through that relationship, should provide one with an inexhaustible supply of warm leads. Not so. Nobody cares about life and health. Too many agents are unhappy. Not interested in having you come in and sell life to there customers because of the few policies they will sell in there career, they want the commission."
bad,"While working for this company in the North East!!!  It was the very best!!!!"
bad,"There is alot of multitasking involved and plenty of problem solving. The pay is mediocre and the headaches are endless. Dealing with the angry public, along with trying to keep production numbers up, and keeping the agent relatively satisfied are things you continuously worry about. Too bad Allstate takes rate changes often. We probably would have less migraines and a smaller pool of angry clientele."
bad,"There was always something new to be learned which made the job rewarding for both myself and the customer.  Helping a customer with a situation that may have seemed hopeless was the most enjoyable part of the job which allowed me to provide the highest level of customer service even if the customer was irate or difficult. Management was not always helpful or able to help you to properly attain your goals, which was the hardest part of the job.  However having a team that was knowledgeable and experienced forced a cohesive team environment that was dependable and efficient."
bad,Was a great place to work until outsourcing. Many colleagues lost their careers due to their jobs being outsourced.
bad,"Initially felt solid job security - found out that is a false sense and at any time the company will downsize, and no matter the situation.  "
bad,"Usually a day at work seems to take forever to go by. With the exception of a few, management is usually unresponsive to what the workers need. I do enjoy my coworkers but the hardest part of the job is motivating myself to get up and go in."
bad,Expected a week of training without an expectation of a job after taking the licensing test. Training was extended due to not having enough seats for training class available after training was completed. Translation; they had not fired enough people to allow the new hires into spots on the floor.
bad,If you don't mind being micromanaged then Allstate is the place to be. Don't understand why someone can surpass daily quotas yet be reprimanded for spending an extra minute or two on a claim to ensure all information is correct. They don't seem to get the big picture that it will take longer for the claim to get paid if mistakes are made. The focus should be on maintaining good business relations with the vendors as well as the customers themselves not numbers. True epitome of greed; nothing more. They say they care about their employees' health but apparently that doesn't include stress. Never had to deal with this kind of work culture at all. Former managers never agreed with employing micromanaging because they know what it does to employee morale. We are people not robots bottom line.
bad,"Brown nosing office I worked in. If you weren't in with the ""new""managers..you were outside the circle and being micro managed. Our offices in california are leaving to Arizona, so everyone was stressed out."
bad,"The ability to work from home or have a flexible schedule as well as workplace assistance benefits were fantastic. However, as each year went by, benefits decreased, additional workload was added and the company was unable to hire more employees. This made a very stressful working environment for everyone. "
bad,There was no clearly stated policy and procedure about advancement. It was very arcane and seemed to be a popularity contest. There was very little management support for a very stressful job. Even the desks were horrible.  The only plus was the great benefits.
bad,"Worked here for many years in the claims department.  It's really really busy.  Over the years, the company has grown and staffing has not kept up.  This place used to be a fun place to work, now it's become a large claim call centre with little employee engagement.  There always seems to be customers waiting on the phone queue as there are not enough people to handle the workload."
bad,Very stressful. Goals required by Home Office are constantly changing. Home Office only cares about shareholders and bottom line so there have been many layoffs in the past five years. Many offices have closed and relocated to states such as Texas and North Carolina.
bad,"Very poor HR management dept. The Field Sales leaders do not provide support/training to their sales agents. Overall, you may be better off working for one of their competitors."
bad,Sell p&c and Life & health ins to eligible customer and educate them on coverages which include policy reviews and cross sales.  Some offsite work is sometimes required.
bad,"-The part I mostly enjoy about customers is being able to help them out."
bad,"Typical day at work, I check voice messages from the night before and also check after hour service calls. I answer inbound/outbound calls and helping"
bad,The supervisor didn't seem to have any trust in his employees. He seemed to think that everyone should always know what he was thinking at all times.
bad,"In a captive agency, there is no upward mobility unless you move to a different agency."
bad,"I learned everyday! I love to learn about businesses I utilize everyday. This job was challenging due to the low staff and very high demand for assistance from the customers. The extra staff would've assisted in much of the overflow of need with claims, documentation, renewals. The benefits of this job were not as beneficial (i.e. no company insurance policy for staff). The most enjoyable part was establishing a rapport with all of the businesses we handled."
bad,This is a new agency and although I love Allstate as a company. The agency isn't doing well .The company is a great learning experience under the correct management .
bad,"I organize my day by my work load given, so I can have them done all in a timely manner. The hardest part is getting others who are unorganized to fit your regiment. if you guide in a good manner other will follow. I am a great leader, and I also learn fast."
bad,"working on computer all the day, learned everyday, enjoy to work with people at allstate."
bad,Spent a year here. Good place to work if you can handle the stress and constant increasing of production goals. I understand not staying still and always striving for more but it leads to an unethical work place and lack of team dynamic.
bad,Very busy daily with clients coming in to review there policy and make payments.
bad,They do not take pride in the american employee as they are sending their jobs to other countries and taking them away from us here in america.
bad,"At first, this was a pretty good job, but they offered me a TDY (temporary assignment) which I worked for about a week and decided it wasn't a good fit for me. The manager ignored me so because the job was very different from what I had been doing I did poorly. No one offered to help, my quality was poor because they failed to fully train me, they then outsourced, so I wasn't able to go back to original assignment, changed my schedule 4 or 5 times,and then changed the availibility of our weekends off...They mistreat a lot of their best workers here."
bad,It was a small independently owned company with no benefits. Business was slow on most days. I learned about insurance.
bad,No consideration for work-life balance. Difficult to move around in company. Lack of benefits compensation. Metrics more important than overall well-being of employees.
bad,Good hands university is a great place to learn. I'd definitely suggest everyone work at Allstate for a year then hop to the independent side of things. More opportunity
bad,"I worked claims and every day before our shift we would have a meeting or what they called a huddle. The company wanted to let us know call volume, stats, daily business etc.. but what my team got was an onslaught of how much we sucked, were the worst team on the floor and our stats were low. Then we would get on the phones and get yelled at for 8 hours by the customers. Not fun. Very high turnover."
bad,"It wasn't necessarily a bad job, just one that didn't feel right for me.The most difficult part of the job was dealing with angry callers.I learned Insurance is very beneficial for peoples needs."
bad,I loved my job I took care of her personnel needs bathing shopping cleaning cooking personal care for her like stretched her out cause she was not able to get up with out help get her dressed brush her hair etc
bad,I enjoyed working for This company  great benefits great people to work with. Management was not the best they lack work ethic. Work load at times was overwhelming
bad,"I would answer the phone, take insurance quotes, take payments, assist customers with their claims, contact the District Office if there was any issues."
bad,"The environment at Allstate is fun and inviting.  Training for the telephone rep job is thorough and even fun!  But once you go ""Live"" on the phones, it gets very difficult.  People can be very mean and degrading on the phone.  Perhaps it's because they don't have to look at you face to face, but sometimes callers don't even treat you like a human.  Also, I suspect some callers are angry because their policy has been canceled, or the payments have not been consistent."
bad,"Critical thinking is discouraged and there are no incentives to work hard.  They pay below market but give you many PTO days.  If you want to enjoy your career, look elsewhere, this place is depressing."
bad,"Calling dead leads. verify insurance for car sales, only problem was we couldn't beat to many other companies prices. People would deny quotes on act they were already purchasing a car for 4 hours."
bad,a very comfortable place to work at and you can work at your own pace a part time job that is flexible and anyone who works 2 jobs or goes to school it would benefit them.
bad,"Decent place to work, I just got hired into the wrong department which is why I plan to seek other employment. They only look out for certain employees they like and hire very inexperienced young managers to manager experienced workers."
bad,Down sized because of Quick Photo Claims. What a failure to customer service.  They want you to take a picture of your damage. You cannot give a good estimate from a photo. The repair shops are having to double their work load let alone the time it takes for a insured to get their car repaired.
bad,"Allstate was an excellent place for me to grow my sales wings. However, their insurance products have been increasingly difficult to sell! I was not only unable to sell new business due to rates but also losing old customers to any other insurance company that quoted them. Yes, Allstate rates have become that bad. That's not counting all of the red tape that they have: Audits for everything, proof required for everything, etc. In my last 1 1/2 years any producer we hired quite within 30 days. Allstate bought me my house, you could say, but I wisely got out while I could!"
bad,"It has been too long a period of time to give a fair assessment of Allstate. Contract worker. I delivered mail and company material throughout the Allstate campus ,while being a component for logistics for outside delivery. Wasn't treated fairly for being a college educated employee with an extensive work experience. Wasn't once considered to achieve within the corporate culture. Effectively was a person who created a logistical system within the building"
bad,Working corporate takes a special person.  To have every second at your work monitored is not a good thing.  I would not recommend working at allstate.
bad,"I have worked Insurance previously.  Nothing like this,  from the moment I would walk in the door until the minute I left.  Dialing numbers and asking people if they would like a comparison quote on their auto and homeowners Insurance.  Now days, a lot of people do not even answer their telephones, because of caller ID and cell phones."
bad,The company moved from Cross Plains....the environment was very clique (e).  I wouldn't want to work for this company again.
bad,None at this time. I cannot provide a fair assessment of this business at this time. I cannot provide anything further about this business
bad,Allstate is a great property and casualty company but is very limited in the investment field. Decent life products but very limited in the investment arena.
bad,I wish they paid more money at this company. they were very strict with the schedule too. it was a typical call center had to be logged into the phone at a certain time if not you would get in trouble. and you were always afraid of being let go. but the pace had a good culture.
bad,"High pressure job ,  a lot of responsibility. Need to make sure all flight is in and out on time the terminal. Need to take care of other coworker work , if they didnt finish the work whoever work last need to do all the missing information."
bad,"Very unprofessional, poor work environment, favoritism, no room for growth."
bad,It is a very stressful job and the customers are not the toughest part of it. Management is unexperienced and there is not much training after the first initial class. They are mostly unorganized. I gained good experience by becoming a supervisor for a few months but it also exposed the company to me that it was not a good company to grow with.
bad,heavy call volume emphasis on being on time and always at your desk. Accountability on calls taken. Treating all callers with respect
bad,"Manage up to 85 on and offshore employees that support the Claims Application for Allstate Insurance Company. I have 26 years of insurance experience that has provided me opportunities to learn management, claims adjusting, release management, business analysis, release management and testing. Being a global company has challenges due to the time zone difference from India to the US. I am a people person that finds motivating my staff very rewarding. I am highly motivated myself and enjoy challenging work."
bad,"More of a reactive company than proactive, especially with technology. Typical day can be varied, management should have classes on how to work with employees. They do not know how to handle a lot of situations and don't motivate employees. Co-workers for most part are nice, most have been there a long time and are just there to put in the years. Hardest part of the job is working with people who are demanding and all want their way. Most enjoyable part of the job is working with other offices and working on compliance issues."
bad,"The majority of my day is quoting, selling, prospecting, customer service, and  talking with customers and prospects. My co-workers are team players, we all work together. I enjoy talking with customers and selling. There's really no hard part about my day."
bad,"worked individually every day"
bad,Leading people everyday that are responsible for helping restore customer's lives is very rewarding.
bad,"A typical day would be long lines with only 10 cashier lanes open out of 30."
bad,"I worked for an indivual allstate agency in the atlanta area. Earning potential was high, however there was poor management in place which made then opportunity unfavorable."
bad,"See summary."
bad,"Unfortunately, although my department was profitable, all 70 employees were given the option to move from Pennsylvania to Georgia, or lose our jobs, as the office was permanently closed. "
bad,"Not suited for cubicle work, being timed for everything. Felt I was in grade school. Enjoyed the people who I worked with."
bad,"I had applied for a position with the company in my city as the job description matched my work history, and I had worked for an insurance company (but in the life/ltd area) before. Came to the end of the interview, and found out the position was not a position - they didn't have any current openings. They were just gathering a list of potential candidates for potential future openings. Though I would have been willing to obtain the licence they eventually wanted had there been a position, I was not in the position to, nor willing to, spend the money to obtain a licence for something that I may or may not have been able to use since there was no guarantee they would have an opening any time soon."
bad,"I enjoy Working at the Huemmer agency. I protect people against the unexpected. Taking the financial burden off of them and their family, allowing Allstate to care of it. I enjoy talking to people all day long building value in Auto/life/home/commercial products Allstate offers. We have a great team atmosphere in the office because everything we do is interconnected. Working in a small office environment has taught me that everybody's goals and aspirations may not be the same but we all offer value to the team and everybody has a role."
bad,"reviewed policies. worked on a team. worked second shift.review policies for discounts to be given or taken because of accidents, children old enough to get the discounts, etc."
bad,"It’s a hamster wheel. Do it as long as you can. Learn the business, get the sales, then move on. When I hit goal the pay was decent but it’s not consistent unless you make sales. It’s stressful juggling new business, inspections, underwriting solicitations, cancellations, etc. You have to be motivated, smile and be on the phone all day at a desk to be successful. No option for benefits until recently. I was lucky to work for a good agency owner. It depends who the owner is too."
bad,"Allstate was a great place to work but 2 years ago they started a strategy to only benefit shareholders. To save money, and increase profitability whatever can be relocated to India shall be."
bad,Great environment. Upset that they closed down and did not give us COBRA benefits nor did they help us find another job as we were told they would do. Very disappointed and would not recommend Allstate to anybody I know as they are very unreliable.
bad,"Upper management cared only about money saved and nothing about supporting the staff. Entire departments were outsourced to other countries, whole offices closed, thousands of employees displaced, only to have corporate hire temporary workers in place of keeping/paying seasoned, employees - then fire them before hiring on. Benefits package was very good, but expensive!"
bad,Friendly and personable clients. Autonomy in day-to-day responsibilities. Management was supportive and willing to invest time into staff for advancement opportunities.
bad,the typical day is spent calling maybe 5 bad leads that get calls from 5 other insurance agents. really no way to sell unless you go and knock on peoples doors. Really boring work not enough business.
bad,"The environment of working in a cubicle is not for me. I feel it does not promote teamwork. I love working with a small team of people; this environment did not provide that avenue. If our large team was able to consult with each other on a regular occasion, this job would have been more enjoyable."
bad,"Fun experience. Nothing worth mentioning, I prefer to leave past work experiences in the past, and move one happily."
bad,"I enjoyed performing my role as an adjuster and believe that this is a sustainable career. The job was always interesting with several different opportunities to become well involved with customers. I learned an abundance of information regarding insurance coverage and policy application."
bad,If you have a disability do not expect Allstate to work with you. If you are harrased in the work place All State will not fix the situatution nor will Humane Resourses.
bad,"Basic Claims handling, It is broken up into PD, Unreped BI and Atty reped BI"
bad,I've had other postions that i enjoyed more. The hardest thing about working here was working with difficult collegues.
bad,This isn't going to be the case for everyone because every Allstate is independently owned. In my office we were pretty much family. If it wasn't for them then I wouldn't still work for this company.
bad,"Nice place to work, but the company was not the proper fit for me personally. Great benefits, very understanding when I had to take my bereavement when my Grandmother passed away. I enjoyed my time there, but I found I never grew a passion for the Insurance field."
bad,The pay is very low. I would not recommend this job if you are expecting decent pay. I would recommend this job if you just need something to keep you active in the insurance field.
bad,"Allstate is a good place to work.  The pay and benefits are good.  Management works with their employee's to make sure they are meeting goals."
bad,"The work requires long hours and weekend work. The 20 days of PTO are much needed for the amount of work that is required. After training adjusters are required to handle four or more claims per day. Adjusters continue to receive claims on the weekends leading to a very busy Monday morning with over 6 claims coming in and receiving four or more throughout the day. Benefits are great, but this job is best for someone who has little to no home life."
bad,it is ok of a job. It will fit most but it was time I move on. I think it can be a great job but it is time I moved on for greater things. the people the people are loving but not a career path for me.
bad,good job. i love the place i worked for never had any problems there just looking to support two kids now instead of one.
bad,"Typical day: unexp changes"
bad,"The company is a wondeful place to work, unless you want job securoty and dont care if you get fired for makong a single mistake, then they will fire you and provide a horrific reference that prevents you from getting work in that area ever again."
bad,"My typical day was made up of designing work processes for my staff to follow in order to sale insurance policies. Some of the processes included, cold calling in areas or zip codes, calling current customers to come in for policy reviews and I would meet with certain age groups to sell our high value customers our investment products."
good,"There is a lot of paperwork and filing involved with working for Allstate, constant datelines to meet and constant phone calls. You must make sure to deliver a great customer experience no matter how the other person on the phone may be."
good,"Experience may vary depending on which agent you work for. NEGOTIATE your salary and commission for sales up front, otherwise you maybe taken advantage of."
good,"I worked for this company for a short while.  As I began the job I noticed that the owner was slowly letting all the employees go.  It turned out that he sold the business to another Allstate Franchise. While working there it was pleasant and relaxed.   The boss was fair and compensated everyone fairly.  My job was answering the phones, Sales with all types of Insurance.  Wrote Insurance policies and followed up with customer with all of their Insurance needs."
good,"A typical day at work consists of me arriving, opening the office, making phone calls, answering and transferring phone calls as needed, and processing the occasional payment for 8 hours a day."
good,"I was with Allstate for four years. It is all around a good company , unfortunately the management at the office made the environment stressful. I love Allstate as a company, small agencies however can put a bad taste in your mouth."
good,"Most leaders and employers were of other divercities, they were given special jobs and recognitions"
good,"Very little training for my expectations going into insurance."
good,Allstate will protect their agents even to the point that they will allow them to do not only unethical things to their employees but illegal as well.  Make sure you see that taxes are being deducted day one.  I've seen several employees fight to receive W-2 forms and proof of state and federal tax payment.
good,In the interview he stated the the position was salary. HE LIED
good,Allstate is great as a company.   This particular agency was not a good fit for me.
good,A new agent opened the office and hired me to run it. I did all the daily functions and took care of the employee we only had 2. I wrote all the business and took care of all the customers. He decided he did not want it anymore so he sold the book of business back to Allstate and therefore I was without a job.
good,My manager's style of managing was unconventional. I believe we are put where God need's us. We have lesson's to learn or we are there to help.
good,"Assisting clients with insurance policies, questions, changes pre underwriting of insurance."
good,typical except for impromptu meetings with prayer. paperless and paper..referrals given to other agents unfairly. Management changes their minds about procedures on at least a weekly basis. I enjoyed the customers. Too much micromanagement.
good,Allstate offer benefits 1st day and they offer 21 PTO days with the option to buy a additional 5 days. Until 2019 if you didn't have any dependents your health insurance would be free. Now they all the benefits went up and the coverage isn't good. They boosted up the deduction. They start the call center out at $15 hour. It's not worth the work you do there.
good,"The owner never paid me on time  and ai would always have short checks he never paid me what he offered the day of the interview, thats the reason I left this Job."
good,It was a small office of 3 people.  The owner was easy to work with. The work load was pretty non existent .  I prefer to be busy and there just was not enough to do.
good,"At Allstate you have to make sure that you hit your goals for the week or you will not get paid. You can have a solid week, but if you did not meet the set goal by 1 sale then you will get no commission for the sales that you did make."
good,"Im just going to cut to the chase...working for Allstate was fun until they started lying about pay and hours. Management, HR, & team leads are unprofessional and misleading. They tell all of your business to whoever is sitting in their pods, will tell you that they're busy so they won't have to take a ""sup call"", get attitudes if you ask for help, and will do coaching around others so that people could hear how bad or good your doing. I got fired for refusing to leave my scheduled shift so that they wouldn't have to pay me for ot. Yes, your read that correct! Im honestly glad that they fired me cause i found better opportunities where i can grow as a person & career...far as here there are no raises, no growth, or anything like that."
good,"Working at a local Allstate agency (like any other insurance agency) is different at each agency. The agency is purchased from corporate and managed by that agent. You can get a great agency if the owner is great or you can work for an awful agency if the owner is awful. It can be good or bad. Unless you work for the corporation directly, it depends on who owns your agency you work for."
good,You're productive but you never knew who you were working for until you were there and the atmosphere of the place. Some can be positive and a lot can be very negative and not encouraging at all.
good,"This job did not pay well and the management was non existent. I learned everything about insurance on my own, there was not much training. I enjoyed the people but I would not want to make a career here."
good,You're worked to the bone and the rates sucks. Its hard to make a buck. No benefits or vacation or sick days. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. You would be better off somewhere else.
good,It was what you make it. It depends on the agent that you have. Your experience can be much better than mine was. Very little room for advancement when you work for small agencies. You can learn a lot depending on your management and eventually open your own office.
good,"Learned experience for personal lines. It was privately owned. The owner was great, the manager was not so great.  Would never get paid on time.  I like the interaction with customers."
good,I will never work for an Insurance company again. Very bad experience. The Office Manger was very rude. The nature of her ethics was playing on the company computer and not doing her job.
good,"A typical day at work is making calls, following up with potential insureds.  Workplace was fun environment.  I learned how to file claims.  The hardest part of the was the uncertainty of knowing if I would have a job tomorrow."
good,Manager is the foundation and well It not on a solid ground if you really want to know. you will do better at a traditional office.
good,"Excellent training for new employees, however starting pay is very low causing a high turnover.  Impossible to reach goals are in place.  They lack understanding of how much is really attainable.  Employees are nothing but a number.  I wish the working environment was better.  Not worth staying as the stress is not worth the low pay.  Also little to no mobility or growth."
good,"I like working  at allstate i learn a lot about the company and how it worked, But their was to much personal stuff going on in the work place. it was family own and the family brought the home lives to the work places."
good,"at first it is an adrenaline rush but it wears on you over time,specially when you have a family. investigative work and patience is what you need in this industry. working with this company has been interesting,plenty of characters around the office."
good,The company does not do the best for their customers it is strictly a numbers game and they think only of the bottom line.
good,nice and good place to work. Some days are busy some are not. Had to deal with customers over the phone mostly and some come in. 
good,Managers have openly advised us that out positions were costing the company substancially more than if they would continue to keep the business overseas. The pay is low and NO bonuses or raises are in sight. The morale is depleting but production is increasing. But overall it's a job! The upper management is well known for making haste decissions that are not well thought out in terms of lower level employees work/ life balance. The eduation department is subpare at best. But in terms of call center work production stats... Allstate isn't the most strict. If you do what is required than you can servive the rest and out last the best.
good,Management was not organized and overall experience was good. Learned a lot and very happy with what i achieved. The hardest part was dealing with customers why the insurance went up and most enjoyable was dealing customers in person and working with new quotes.
good,"Allstate is a wonderful company, the really back their teams up. You work for an agent however, they decide your salary, benefits etc. I haven’t had a great experience with my Agency."
good,"A normal day would be reviewing each file as they would come up on the daily calendar, file motions, send out correspondence and then forward to attorney for review."
good,"I did not have a good experience. The agent did not work, he watched golf all day and wanted us to do everything.  The energy in the office was negative always."
good,"No benefits at the company.  No options to advance. Lead system is not very good. Friendly work environment, not alot of coaching or growing. Independently owned."
good,Allstate as a company is great to be apart of.  The office environment owned by private party was not  entirely a good environment.   Wish there were more involvement by corporate.
good,"Did not have a good work experience with this company. I feel that being new in the industry, I was not given a long enough period of time to see my work efforts come to fruition."
good,"Allstate is a great company. However, it depends what office you work in and what deptment. Claims is the worst. It’s 100% a numbers game. They will chew you up and spit you out. No loyalty. If your office numbers suck, the leaders will throw anyone they can under the bus to save themselves. Chicagoland Auto is probably the worst. The office is under staffed and it’s impossible to service the customers properly. Leadership knows that but they still expect you to receive all 10’s on your surveys. The leaders are drastically over paid while the people who do all the work are under paid. I would rather juggle chainsaws for money then go back to that place."
good,"Good company to work for, but management is arbitrary and inexperienced . Different rules for different people. It’s who you know, not what you know. Not merit based."
good,"You had to be able to walk in and run the book of business and create it on your own.  No training/coaching provided until after it was too late.  "
good,"At the Allstate branch that I worked for I did telemarketing work, calling the customers about deals that the company was offering, as well as aiding around the office in anyway possible. At this job I learned how to deal with customers over the phone and work in an office. I left because I did not feel comfortable in the work environment I was in."
good,"Agent centered, agents tend to walk all over employees, no real fostering of employees or training, poor owner attitudes, poor treatment of employees, no direction,"
good,"A week to get your system up and running, training was horrible, lack of leadership and horrible communication.  The work was easy once you knew what was exactly needed of you.  Trained by 3 different people who have been there for 15+ yrs and expected to do the one assignment 3 different ways and then blamed for errors on work you were never trained on."
good,The office was independently owned and operated. Therefore the owners made there own rules with regards to policy and pay.
good,"Highly stressful, short staffed, fell behind and had no help available because office was short staffed. Was responsible for heavy inbound calls and heavy service.  As a result, kept if difficult to keep up with job originally hired for."
good,"The company seems to be a great place to work, but after 8 1/2 years of being scheduled for every Saturday, and then to be now 8 1/2 yrs later having to be scheduled for every Saturday and Sunday, does not fit into a work/life balance, "
good,"What to say about Allstate I worked at the call center. well It started off ok then it began to change to the last place you would want to work. Nowadays they will use you up and throw you away. I was there for years. I had to hop around the company like a trapped employee because they closed department after department after office after office. Every department I went to they would change your title to match new responsibilities as they prepare to fire more groups of people and dump their job duties onto yours. Then as you work they demand more and more out of you in every aspect of your duties. So I hope memorizing constantly updated scripts and demanding sales quota's is your thing. They have a bonus structure that changes almost quarterly and not to your benefit. Last I was there one mistake in any of the bonus structure requirements can land you a zero pay out even if you have sold a million items does not matter.This is the most mentally straining job I have ever had and there is no job security as stat's predicted by a faulty computer system can get you fired. They have high turn over because they are constantly looking for ways to reduce having to pay employees internally. If you have bilingual skills is the only field they seem to care about granting job stability to, but I would take that with a grain of salt. I only gave them a rating of a three star because the employees are great and don't mind helping each other but you kind of have to since managers are never around, barely show up to work more than an hour, and often are leaning on other managers and team leads"
good,I Learned how to handel claims and how to help our customers on what they need to do to get there claim started to set up there car rentals and help my customer get the right covrages for there cars what they really needed so they wouldnt pay for extra covrages they didnt not need. The hardest thing about that job was making my customers understand why there insurance went up and explain there bill. Most customers did not like that and would get up set. my co-workers where great to work with I worked great they them we help each other in what we needed and I would also train them since I had more experince then them. 
good,"I would answer incoming calls and service client’s account by making changes or taking payments. Quote auto and home policies I would also quote small business policies. We would have call nights to quote new business twice a week. I only wish that the agent would have stayed true to his word and honored our agreement that as a mother I would need to have flexibility for my children. The office co workers we nice, fun to work with and helpful. The job was not difficult and really enjoyed everything I was learning."
good,"High pressure, lots of travel, poor training, poor compensation"
good,"not much, owner depended on our intake"
good,Got my testing done for my license. The agent never submitted the information correctly for licenses to become active. Agent was having me sell and service policies without an active license.
good,"Assignment is working for independent agents.  Most are seeking high volume call center type sales agents.   A lot of pressure to produce new business.  Not as support role."
good,In the underwriting dept. you will need to be able to multi-task.  The huge workload can be very demanding.  It takes a calm and focused energy to stay afloat!
good,"If you are looking for a place where the emphasis is on work all the time and never have time off, then this is the place for you. You will have a good amount of PTO to use but will never be able to use it because of short staff."
good,"Being a benefits advisor is difficult, especially in an economy that doesn’t support putting money towards speculative things like extra insurance. Hard job"
good,"Arrived on time daily, and never missed a day at work. A typical day at work includes customer service ( taking payments, making changes to policies). Cold calling prospective customers. Arranged meetings with loan officers. Asked customers questions to find out what their insurance needs are, and write policies according to their needs."
good,"When you work at the agency level the pay is poor, rarely are there benefits and it can be a high pressure sales focused job. Allstate puts unrealistic expectations on agency owners. There is especially hard pressure on selling life insurance. Most agents pay terribly. I am at my 4th agency and basically each agent has had some level of not being realistic."
good,"agency owner was never there to train, a lot of drama at that particular agency. Most enjoyable part of the job was i liked the employees. Stressful environment."
good,"It’s not insurance it’s a loan/credit company. It’s the first time I worked as a CSR, and I loved being home with my children and having a set schedule. I am always connected to people immediately I bond well with older and younger folks. I have all kinds of experience and it plays a roll at each job I work."
good,"Unless you are anew grad dont work for allstate."
good,"This is a good agency for someone learning the business, but then afterwards, the low pay is hard to stick with.  I would start here and then find a new agency."
good,"I found that I had a moral issue with the nature of the business.  I was told to sell myself as their personal advocate but in reality if they had an issue (claim) the only thing I/we were allowed to do was turn them over to corporate attorneys.  In reality, the only thing I helped them with was selling them insurance and making changes to their policy and I felt that that was grossly misleading."
good,"Same advantages and benefits, same downsides and risks as working at any large modern conglomerate.  Company seemed more focused on WHO they wanted you to be as a person rather than what they wanted the company to DO in the marketplace."
good,"worked for 1.5 years, was not given enough agencies to work in as sales rep to earn  a living. My manager was a good guy but did not help me get clients."
good,The office I worked was very unfriendly. Management did not provide adequate training. Expectations not expressed by management. Later found that management was untruthful about advancement opportunities and scheduling. Lack of work/life balance.
good,They treat contractors like inferiors. There are not many opportunities to transfer into a perm position. Rumors are swirling that they are relocating a lot of the recruiting functions to another state.
good,"onboarding to give an overview of the job and then cast into the work where there are expected daily production requirements. This is a 40 hour a week job and there is constant pressure to meet production."
good,"Ready for a change. Long hours, few days off, and lots of politics. Only the agency owner is really making the big dollars and unless you have a generous owner who is loyal to you as well, you may notice that you barely are making it from check to check while the owner constantly hits bonus after bonus."
good,"as an FS you are dependent for referrals from agents"
good,It was great working with the customers. I enjoyed saving them money when possible and selling a great brand. My team were an awesome set of individuals.
good,"New Agents don't pay or give any incentives. They are pressured as well. They hire experienced licensed staff to get up and running and then cut back hours or there is a lack of work."
good,"no comment!  he has sold the business.  Many promises to employees,   ""Just be patient"" was told to the employees that made the money for this company.   Empty promises."
good,"If you have no experience in insurance, and are not licensed Allstate is not the place for you to start. Management is too busy to work with new hires. They over exaggerate career advancements in their interview before hiring. They will leave you to write post cards from 8:30 to 5:30 for their insurance agents. They have no intention of training new hires to succeed in obtaining a license."
good,When i started the position was cut and dry and i enjoyed my days; but due to constant reorganizations it became hard to have a constant attitude of what was the correct action to pursue
good,"Insurance call center, take calls from agents every day, say the same scripting 30-70 times a day. Weekly root cause problem solving meeting to over view agent irritants and try to come up with solutions. The coworker community is nice, your own space and desk. I have learned a lot about insurance, DOI, and billing practices. Quality and adherence to work schedule are most important."
good,This Agent was good at what he does. He knows Insurance or should I say how Allstate operates. I managed my own book of business through Allstate. Utilized some of his leads normal 9-5 work environment. High turnover
good,I have missed out on family gatherings and church for a year and a half because I have to work every Sunday. This company does not care about their employee concerns because most of the higher ups are off on every holiday and Sundays.
good,"The overall feeling is that you are lucky to have a job. The culture is pretty cold. There are inconsistencies between departments.  Some are ok with a day a week work from home, others are not.  Some are ok with flex hours (coming in early so you can leave early to avoid traffic), other departments will not let you do this."
good,"	Managed portfolio of over 100 insurance claims"
good,Your coworkers are you family.  You spend more time with them than your actually family.  They make coming into a tough job enjoyable and are so very helpful
good,"It is a good job, but you have no room for advancement. You work for the agent not the actual company so there are no benefits."
good,"Allstate was a good company to work for when I first started. Now their benefits are not good, they do not seem to care about their employees and their management sucks"
good,"We have 3 employees and the owner has his daughter and son working @ this branch office in Inglewood, they both argue about who is in charge and the owner there father can care less. I run all the day to day operations while everyone else just slacks off."
good,"I never know what to expect from one day to the next, and had to prioritize what needed to be done from most important to long term. Work with several different managers to keep them informed on progress of their project."
good,"Unless you own your own agency and get a position in the corporate side of it there is no where to advance. Your hourly pay is continuously threatened and commission can be withheld if you are not getting life insurance leads, even if you are not licensed."
good,very flexible  not stable employment  a lot of outsourcing  management is not there for employees(temp staffing) they should treat everyone with respect even if not full time employee
good,"First part of my day was calling local auto dealers to see what auto leads they can provide. Next, I'd call on leads I've been working that may have not closed. I've learned a lot about time management. My co-workers and myself got along great. The hardest part of the job was selling Allstate. I really loved joking daily with my co-workers."
good,"Co-workers were delightful and knowledgeable of skill set and were easy to talk with and work well together on problem resolutions"
good,"8-10 hour work day"
good,"Ideal situation on paper, but little or no support from Agency Owners.  Concept is a warm introduction to existing clients to help retain P&C clients by offering financial services to them, this doesn't happen."
good,Fun place to work for but I need better benefits and it's hard to follow management when they have relatively no experience and do not know what they are doing most of the time.
good,Allstate provides a great training program to their new hires.
good,I did not enjoy working for the agent. The job required to many uncertainties with pay scale. The office was always filled with tension as the Agent kept deplorable working conditions.
good,Co-workers were nice however management is brisk and lacks management skills.
good,Allstate was very unorganized and my co-workers were very rude.
good,"•Manage a steady volume of new claims daily. "
good,"Learned about insurance, property casualty....I would blame it on the economy....I had to get out of there..."
good,"Answer and make phone calls, provide customers with quotes for auto, life insurance."
good,its a okay job enviornemt the pay isnt really that good. they ask for too much from a person managers are lazy.
good,"The training at Allstate is above average. They have quality tech support and departmental assistance that tries their best to help the agents. "
good,"sale insurance over the phone."
good,"As a casualty liability adjuster, you are assigned claims to evaluate and settle those claims based on the information provided. I learned superb analytical skills and negotiation skills."
good,"My current office is one you look forward to going to because of your co workers, its a very high paced office because of the volume of customers. We don't have enough employees to properly accommodate the amount of customers we have so it becomes stressful when trying to satisfy every customer within just 8 hours. "
good,Staff were very friendly. Really serious atmosphere with a deadline type of feel in the office. Straight to the point lets get to work type of job. It made it kinda boring to carry out your day.
good,This was an Administrative Position with a lot of flexibility. I really enjoyed the flexibility. The pay was not all that great but I learned a lot and I enjoyed the fact I had an opportunity to meet the needs of so many people.
good,"You definitely have to work hard to remain employed, especially in the sales department. Coaching is available and much needed in certain circumstances. Call center environment, management and coworkers were nice."
good,I really liked working for Allstate.My Duties there were to open the office on a daily basis as well as close the office. I learned alot working for allstate and how insurance is really a good thing to have. I did carco reports and endorsement car changes answered customers questions and concerns and also made phone calls throughout the day.Also I took customers payments over the phone or in person. I was also in charge of making daily deposits.
good,"A typical day required me to do more than I was hired for. Although management was understanding, there was more work to do than people to handle it. Very stressful work environment."
good,"Standard call center job where you take roughly 50 calls per day. This ranges from billing questions, adding items to policy and coverage insurance scenarios. The only good thing about this job was the pay. The management was terrible. The people in charge are not qualified and are just chosen on who they know instead of job performance. The top performers are taken advantage of and you only move up if you are buddy-buddy with management. Benefits were good and i learned a lot about insurance. I would only take this job if you like working in a call center and are OK with staying in the same position for years."
good,"This was a start up company and was not a fun place to start working at.  Turnover was high among employees, so I ended up putting in a lot more hours than I was told I would have to and work a lot harder than I would have thought I was going to have."
good,"Started at agency as a customer service Rep and got my license, only to be told I wouldn't have an opportunity to utilize it. I was really disappointed."
good,Other offices maybe better there are no benefits and pay is under 35k and they advertise as 50k. It would be a stepping stone or starting place if you were looking to work In the industry.
good,I was not there long enough to give an opinion on what is needed here. the agency owner hired to many employees and spending to much money on leads to build the business that he let go of half of the staff 2 months after opening.
good,"If you are interested in learning about the insurance culture this is the job for you. But if you dont enjoy sittimg around for hours on end, then dont work here. Overall it was okay."
good,Typical big business where things move slowly. Many silos to navigate. They are trying hard to pivot and be a modern agile company. Cloud Foundry platform was never adopted by all business units.
good,I worked for Allstate while i was pregnant. They are not the company to work for is you have any kinda life outside work they really are not understanding at all.
good,typical corporate lifestyle. they do not promote from within and hardly pay their employee's a livable wage. Very discouraging that management would rather bring in a new hire than reward a current staff member with a raise/promotion
good,"Agency itself, not Allstate- The culture demands for you to not only drink the kool-aid but to SWIM in it... too many things outside of the core sales function that were demanded of staff withOUT compensation and unless you were absolutely killing it you weren't making any money..."
good,Worked in corporate and small office. Both provided their challenges but ultimately a good company. Would rather go with the small office side because of the flexibility.
good,Enjoyed working and developing relationships with the clients.Continuing education allowed me to fully assist in the needs of the clients. Enjoyable work environment
good,I just got into the insurance business & have learned a lot. The commission structure for my site seems unreachable for someone like me who have never done insurance before even those who have done it still have a rough time meeting the goals & making commission.
good,I get a base pay and then additional CAT pay. It use to be automatic but now we can’t get get CAT.   I love meeting our insureds during a Catastrophe and being able to help our insureds is so rewarding. I am on the recognition committee and have won many awards.
good,"-My time at allstate was quite a learning experience in the sense that i was able to learn a multitude of customer service techniques and insurance do's and don'ts within my time. "
good,"You get what you give, and selling insurance is tough. Allstate is a good company to insure with, but it's hard to sell the benefits when people are just looking for the lowest price."
good,It's based off of leads that are provided to you and you follow up with those leads. Some of them are new and some of them are old. Make sure that you are researching the agent that you are going to work for. Because they are technically small business owners they make their own rules and don't necessarily have to go by Allstate's rules and regulations.
good,"This Job was a very slow paced.I would  take payment from customer's,also give Quotes on Home and Car Insurance.We Would Dicuss there Policy and Payments that were due."
good,"As a temp I knew the job would not last forever, but when we were hired we were ""guaranteed"" that position for until a certain date. But as allstate moved the call center jobs over-seas, they cut our contract short."
good,I would say only apply if you are okay with an unorganized high stress environment where you have a scheduled hour every week to get yelled at as a team.
good,A typical day is to come in and log onto your phone for attendance.  Recently there has been many turnovers and new developments are on the horizon.  Job does not too feel secure.  Many occasions for free lunches and spreads.
good,"Overall the job was good. Felt like there were too many org changes. Also they put too high of a premium on their ""continuous improvement"" model. Management in Ohio and Illinois couldn't have cared less about our site. It was obvious that the site would be closing months before they announced it. Upper management made it very obvious that they had no intention of keeping the site open past 2016. They shut the center down in May of 2016."
good,They don't pay well and no training programs. You are given less then a day to train and expected to know the job.  People don't make you feel like part of the team and neither does mgmt
good,"Get up go to work, take calls, go to a 15 min meeting take 2 15 min breaks and one 30 min break then go home. Nice amount of PTO, but you cant ever get the days off."
good,"The Allstate Employees are great, processes are not streamlined, empowerment is nonexistent, tools are inadequate, workload is beyond what can be accomplished in 8 hours and since most employees are salary there is no overtime."
good,"Working there you learn alot how the insurance business work, and how they can rip off people at times. Everyone needs insurance so it was a eye opener to me!"
good,The Allstate Experience for me was not as good as I had hoped. I did not learn much more than I had already learned when I attained my license. I had one office manager and most of the time I ran the office myself without him there. Not sure I was living up to my potential there.
good,"loved the interaction with the customers"
good,"Need I say more?"
good,"I learned how to work in a fast paced office, and learned a little Spanish in the process."
good,"Allstate is a great company to work and sell for because it is a great company with unique benefits on their products."
good,management could be better I feel they could give more incentives and bonuses to the employees not just higher ups the hardest part of the job was trying to meet unrealistic goals
good,"No one in office actually works for Allstate itself--we all work for the Allstate agent through an employment agency with the agent being the only Allstate employee. This is how all the local sales offices are set up.  Most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers several of whom I developed good relationships with over the years. Typical day involved high amount of customer interaction via phone, email and in person; consulting with customers regarding coverage and changes to policies.  Hardest part of job was explaining to upset customers the continuous policy rate increases. Great opportunity to learn different aspects of property/casualty insurance business."
good,The call center is closed now so it doesn't matter.  Working for small agents offices can be nice but the company makes it almost impossible for any new agent to get a head.  Plus small agencies can not offer benefits or a decent pay most times.
good,Selling insurance for Allstate is a great start but chances for advancement beyond an office management position are slim. The company needs to provide agencies a more clear cut way to identify problems with customer accounts so they can fix them on a local scale.
good,i have worked in a few shops in fargo and this is one of the worst ones. The shop is vary clean i will say that. other techs there are not vary friendly. work is not divided up vary fairly. not a place i like to work.
good,I like the workplace environment in the office. Compensation is good but resources are not enough in order to get to the goals.
good,"A typical day of work for me is driving 48 miles to work arriving 2 hours before opening to get a head start on the day.  Focus on meeting company sales goals while training new sales staff as well as holding tenured staff accountable.  "
good,For the most part it was a good job.  They had fair wages but there really was no room for advancement unless you were willing to move to another city or state.
good,"Hours and days plus constantly being away from home is difficult for a person with a family. Some assignments are five days per week but most are seven. All days are ten + hours/day. In all positions, the flow of claims is constant and therefore creates a good opportunity for daily productivity."
good,Tough job with little pay. Would need a thick skin to work sales for this company. Abusive customers with little respect for anyone.
good,"I enjoy the office, however the compensation structure is hard to live on."
good,When I first started to work for Allstate I thought I was going to be starting a career.... I was also working part time with QuikTrip just to get back on my feet. The owner of the office i worked for told me if i quite QuikTrip and started working full time he would give me a raise from $10.00 to $15.50 needless to say I took the deal. He did NOT keep his end of the deal instead he kept me at $10.00/hr and decreased my hours. Then as the new year came about he closed his doors without saying anything to anyone. no warning or anything. i was not happy with this owner at all.
good,"I went through several rounds of interviews. I met with 4 or 5 people. The person I did NOT meet with was my manager. I also asked very specific questions about the project and I was told it was brand new. Specifically told it was in the kickoff phase. The day I started, I met my manager. Had I met him during the interview process, I would NOT have taken the job. (IT is my opinion that we deliberately did not meet during the interview process because candidates who met him refused the job.) Also, the project which I was told specifically had just started actually had been going on for over 3 years. The project was a disaster. The manager barked orders like we were recruits for the military. He was degrading, debasing, dehumanizing and grossly unprofessional towards his team and internal clients.He had no project management background nor technical expertise. Project turnover rate was high and I left after 2 years. In the end, the project was considered a failure. The entire department was shut down and most employees lost their jobs. The only one promoted was the manager who was the reason the project failed. Typical corporate practice; punish the innocent and promote the guilty."
good,Unless you are part of the inner circle advancement is very hard. Experience or Leadership doesn't seem to matter with this organization.
good,"Not all about the numbers but how you work well with others and how you grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and policies, but this is expected of a big company"
good,think very carefully before accepting the job offer. depending on the agent you get hire by your job can be really fun or crucially painful
good,It was great to own my own business.  The company made it tough to make sales quotas by limiting what could be written by THEIR guidelines.
good,"Allstate is in the midst of changing to a global workforce. It is a difficult environment and is quite chaotic at times."
good,"Great office to work, great ours.Enjoyable part of the job is to help customers with their insurance needs."
good,Need to listen to employees more. Manager is NOT always right!!
good,"I enjoy my co workers and this type of work, but am looking for better pay"
good,Great people but the company do not offer benefits. I did not like it because I was working on commission and there are months when people are not interested on buy insurance.
good,"I didn't like the people I worked with, so that was the downer and they gave me less pay then what was offered when I was hired."
good,"I have learned that professionalism should be present at all times, a team player works and help others,  but when it becomes a problem, the solution could indicate that I'm listed in the incorrect environment. Management and Structure is very important in a business to run smoothly, become productive, and have respect. When the strategy is absent or wrongful instructed it becomes a unhealthy environment to work and stress becomes a problem."
good,"Perfect job for a Sales Agent. Job requires a lot of cold calling, leg work and must be able to handle rejection."
good,"Allstate was a great leaning experience, everyday was a busy day! I learned a lot about managing a business, money, business building and being responsible for every ones productivity. Management could have been a lot better as far as not letting a spouse intervene. I worked with a lot of good people who mentored me and helped me grow. The hardest part of the job was dealing with managements personal life inside the office. I have to say the best part was learning everything I learned."
good,"Develop and implement sales plan and manage all phases of the sales cycle-from prospecting to close and follow-up support. Represent a full line of insurance and financial products, serving as trusted adviser to businesses and individual. Train and supervise sales support staff, and create a fun and productive work environment. *Personal and commercial insurance (Auto, Home, Business) *Excelled within service-oriented industry. Cultivated positive relationships with customers and expanded business through word-of-mouth referrals."
good,All employees in the enterprise have been afraid of layoffs (RIF - Reduction In Force) for the last two years.  I was laid off and my job was elimated a few weeks ago.
good,"Allstate has your typical corporate environment atmosphere."
good,Commission sales position with limited success potential for new Personal Financial Representatives.
good,"I didnt like cold calling; "
good,"Fast paced, lots of turnover, handling lots of people with difficult personalities, lovely ofice!"
good,Most aspects of this job have been moved to the Philippines.
good,"Wonderful workplace, friendly and honest workers. Respectful and courteous, easy workload."
good,Company culture complted massive turnaround from when hired; initially upbeat friendly but became trite and micromanaged.
good,Allstate is a good company to work for if you are just looking for work.
good,No comment...lack of team work....empty promises...salary? Meet monthly goal to get paid commissions...if not well then no bonus for u...
good,"I would only recommend this company to someone that isnt looking to grow. This company sets the expectation that you will be recognized for your good work and that we can be ourselves and be transparent. It started off that way but after a while, they slowly started cutting our budget and taking away recognition that we all looked forward to. They are putting a cap on our pay and our paid time off giving no incentive to stay in the position long term. The only way to advance in your career is to be a favorite in the office or to be willing to move to another state without the company's assistance. People there are too sensitive and people are not able to be themselves and there are only 2 managers there that are even worth going to for assistance. The other managers are never available or refuse to help you when you need them. There are never any career opportunities within the office they have in town and when there is an opening, they already have someone they want and only interview others because they have to. The training they provide is worse than ever and we get new people on the floor that do not know what they are doing, making it harder for those that are tenure. They pay us at a rate that a ""data entry"" position is paid and it is not enough for a single person to support themselves. We do way more than what a data entry position is responsible for and there are other positions within the company that get paid more than we do that do the same thing we do but under their own License. The company stresses the managers to talk to the employees about the negative numbers"
good,It's a place to get your experience and learn all there is to know.  You have to start somewhere and it's a good place to do that. Don't stay too long because there is no room for advancement.
good,It's okay. Daily dealing's with customer's. A lot of office work. Cold calling all day everyday. Really hard work with not many benefits for the amount of work done.
good,"4th quarter is stressful in insurance anywhere, I'd guess, but the systems used are so outdated that it creates extra work for everyone and the system of communication is circuitous and unnecessarily complicated, adding more work. The work load varies, so overtime may be expected at any time in some departments. They often try to placate us with food and random prizes/events, but it doesn't do much to make up for stress levels, typically, and in fact is often a frustrating distraction from work requirements."
good,"Typical day you handle claims mainly in one catastrophe area from a pool of clients with different stations doing different assignments. "
good,"Screening calls, creating leads, and trying to sell insurance. The Rates are RIDICULOUSLY HIGH. Sales are bad but the company is still swimming in cash flow. Terrible job security. Home Office is looking for any and every reason to shut down agencys."
good,"no ping pong only work, new clients, sales and very high profit margin"
good,Once an employee then an independent contractor with no benefits or retirement plan. Over populate your territory w other agents then when you achieve your goals blame the agents for over selling?
good,"The last manager I had was terrible!  She was new to our office and had her own ideas on how things should be done.  She would take no advice from anyone in our department (quality control).  Most of the ideas she had didn't work as we all knew they wouldn't.  She did not consider herself a part of our team, she placed herself above and outside of the team.  When I was asked by my previous manager how she was working out, I told him my own opinion, that I didn't care for her and her management style.  Apparently my comments got back to her and her manager and I was demoted.  Now keep in mind, I was asked by another manager, my personal opinion had no bearing on my work performance or my treatment of her.  I always treated her with respect and did my job above and beyond expectations and yet I was demoted for voicing my opinion.  I was told I was not a team player and I couldn't be trusted.  I quit shortly thereafter.  If a company can't support a person's right to their own opinions, if it doesn't interfere with their work, then I have no use for that company."
good,"A tipical day was 9 hours and 2 evenings and weekends  "
good,"Matrix focused, office moral extremely high between coworkers, communication between management and staff lacked or missing at times, unreasonable claims requirements at times"
good,"Agents who did not meet certain sale goals in a month did not get as many opportunities the following month making it harder to achieve said goals, and have the possibility of advancing in the company"
good,"Heavy workload"
good,"there were long hours, and there are no health benefits since its independent owned. there is more work then what you get paid for that is expected of you when a owner puts out no money and wonders why there is no sales"
good,"Great people, short term job.  Training was very good.  Team Connect network they use is user friendly.  I took the job as a temporary worker.  Once work is up to date, then I will be out of a job."
good,Agent is very knowledgeable and experienced. Allstate supports the agents well. You do not work for Allstate however-you work for an independent contractor of Allstate. The hours and pay are low.
good,"Allstate over all is a good company to work for, only down fall is that they need to have better training their is little to no training in this company. They send you to Corporate for a week, but for new people just starting they go for 2 weeks, there is no continue training when you get back to your location, No one has time to train you due to the amount of claims they are receiving daily. Other then that they are a pretty good company to work for."
good,The micromanaged is the worst part of the position. When your looking for help sometimes no one is able to assist.  The pay also could be more than what is for this particular role. Was told you can move up to be an adjuster after 6 months in role. When I actually found out it takes years and that role isn’t always open. Not a bad company but your underpaid and overworked.
good,"It depends entirely on the agency you join. If the owner-operator is caring and fair, this can be a satisfactory job. Forget about making a fortune, or even a generous living--unless you are a rock star. The commission structure is miserly, so base+bonus is all you can expect to earn."
good,it okay the pay is good but moving up is hard but the job cuture is ok it can get really busy on the weekends. I work from home it's okay but no life work
good,"Printing division is now closed because of poor leadership and management. Wasted money, extremely over budgeted. Leadership was poor for too many years and someone was watching."
good,I was left on my own to completely run the office and was expected to also bring in new business and personal policy customers. Allstate requires a certain amount of polices written each month.
good,"Be prepared to work more than you are at home. They are constantly downsizing yet the workload/claims have been steadily increasing. The move to digital has not been smooth for the customers, resulting in many irate callers. The prevalence of older (50+)and entrenched workers and their refusal to use new technology will really tax you if you are tech-savvy. Many still use paper files and old processes because ""that's how we've always done it."" Nepotism is rampant."
good,Its a nice place to work but you can very easily find yourself with too many tasks and working late just to make sure you can keep up with all the claims you are being given.
good,I use to love the opportunity to be able to work from home 2 - 3 days a week.  Sadly when asked to be a remote worker in another state I was turned down after I had already received a verbal approval from an existing manager.
good,"The agency owners was fantastic and easily the best boss I have ever had. Our corporate and tech teams, however, were the worst parts of working for Allstate. "
good,"The Allstate compensation package and the exclusivity of Allstate products do not make them favorable for career advancement. At least in Texas, the rates on P&C are outrageous, the Life insurance underwriting process beyond aggravating, and the quality of the products themselves are...subpar. As I was on my way out, it seemed to me like Corporate was doing everything in their power to get away from the customer and provide as little agent support as possible - basically leaving us in the field hanging when it comes to help with service, risk management resolutions, and customer satisfaction."
good,"Okay first job. Training was adequate but there is a trial by fire first few months. Colleagues work hard and help when they can. Oftentimes they are just as overworked as you. Some managers actually care about your development. Benefits and salary are okay compared to industry average."
good,"A traditional large company. Sometimes the $$$ numbers get in the way and good folks are let go. I survived a few of the layoffs but they eventually got me.  Leadership is all over the place.  Performance management is a popularity contest and who can best sell their employee.  Perception is the norm, good or bad.  You can get pigeon holed into a dead end position with hardly any chance to succeed."
good,"a typical day would include many cold calling and x-dates. "
good,This position is great sales position for somebody who is new to the industry.  Training for sales and insurance is plentiful and producers must have a current state license.
good,"Work day to include, Managerial duties,  Customer service, sales, dealing with and resolving issues  daily.   "
good,I have worked for this company for years and have tried to change positions but it's very had to advance. Although I have all my quality and have made it company quality the only advanced the selective ones. They are asking me for a degree yet people have no degree have been able to advance in other departments.
good,no growth or advancement. Stressful customers and no support from managers. Allstate is an okay place if you are not looking to advance. benefits are not the best due to the high deductibles.
good,I really enjoyed working for this company due to the great agents I was able to work with. A great opportunity to get my feet wet in this industry and grow a successful business from the ground up
good,"I did not do enough research into Allstate before I accepted this position.  Allstate no longer runs an operation in which an agent can ""own"" their book of business.  Once a sale is made the chance of you talking again to that client are very slim.  "
good,"Great place to work if you have help. Tough place to work at when everything falls on your plate because the agency owner hides from clients wanting to speak to him/doesn't take customers calls or gets mad when someone is persistent about wanting to speak to their agent. On the bright side, you have a set schedule and getting time off isn't hard."
good,A typical day in the office can range anywhere from a slow paced day to the quickest paced day you will ever see. While I enjoy what I do and have been doing it for some time there are not many benefits that come with the job. Not much room for advancement and growth. No benefits are offered and your job is sometimes hanging by a string depending on how much business you drive. It is a very cut throat job in the sense that no matter how great your manager skills are or your people skills are that people will come and go in a blink of an eye all over price. If they get the feeling they can find the same coverage cheaper they will leave and not think twice. Which is not fair to the employees that the jobs depends on this. That I think is the hardest part of the job. The easiest and best part of the job is meeting new people and talking with the ones that have been here for years. Sitting down with a customer that has been with you for years and talking about there son's first day of school and you remember when he was an infant coming into the office with his parents. I love working with people and that is why I love what I do.
good,"Worked really hard to never get noticed and always overlooked. Never really had a chance to be taught and Lead correctly. "
good,Typical call center environment where everything is about meeting the numbers for the day. They do not make the customer the priority. Stressful overwhelming environment for the low pay.
good,"During the interview process, the company sold itself on having a high rate of advancement opportunity. This turned out to not be true. There is an atmosphere of cronyism."
good,"Auto adjuster. Evaluate, negotiate auto claims to reach a fair and equitable settlement. Empathize with insured to assure their claim will be handled in a timely and efficient manor. Job requires efficient time management skills, as well as the ability to work in a fast paced environment. Also, maintain a positive relationship with insureds, claimants and agents. Handle a steady volume of new complex claims daily. Achieve cost management objectives through compliance processes."
good,"dog eat dog a little stress,and less benefits. I learned that the market is cutthroat and competitive Management was full of it. The workplace was wild ."
good,Allstate is a good company to work for but make sure you select your department based on long term career goals.  Various teams operate like a completely different company.
good,For the Jacksonville Florida office . its easy to get a job through a temp agency . 4 hours of mandatory overtime a week . high turn over rate . not enough jobs that you can grow from . co workers were friendly . they hire through temp agency's then your gone when they have over worked you and under paid you .
good,"Training is not great but you are held to high expectations.  Managers/Leads are great to work with.  "
good,Get your experience of working for a big company and then leave you have no future there. This all could change in a year when some new big dollar idea man comes in and they want good people.
good,"Allstate is a solid company but this was an independent branch. Pay isn't the highest, nor is the job security. Clients are kind though and management is great. It was a great learning experience."
good,"I have learned to accept change. Allstate is always making changes. Sometimes it's changing managers or moving people to other positions. My morning involves trying to catch up on what I did not get to the previous day. I work my pending. The work load is very heavy. It's very hard to keep up with. "
good,"Pay is under market rate. A lot of offshoring to India. "
good,"I love making copies , making phone calls , faxing I love being an assistant ! Helping people who are having bad days and turning them better by being successful in there request at our service ."
good,"Business model for financial services is a good one; however, management commitment to its implementation is sorely lacking.  As a result, opportunities for meaningful partnerships with more established agencies are slim."
good,"No f/u training . They are a numbers based company. Not sure what life and work balance looks like here. "
good,"Each agency is individually owned and managed so this wouldn't be a valid review for Allstate as a company, It also depends on the region you are in because the rules change from region to region and state to state."
good,"Great place to work with a wonderful culture. Core values are preached but not followed by management. Leadership in Non Sales areas is timid. Needs strong, forward thinking leaders."
good,He was a new owner and needed more experience  before taking on agents. Calling leads all day and selling insurance typical for a small agency.
good,No room for advancement in my field. I learned a lot of great techniques and strategies for problem solving. Co workers were great.
good,A typical day at Allstate can become quite busy. Several calls coming in and going out. You will be responsible for making 70 phone calls day for sales along with soft quotes you are expected to mail out.
good,"The first 5 years of employment I could not wait to go to work.  Then the company was more concerned about the money and less about the people who made the money possible.  We were treated like numbers that did not matter rather than human beings."
good,"I learned that insurance business customers are always complaining that insurance premiums keeps getting higher and higher. It is difficult to explain sometimes because people are going to go where is less expensive.  But once explained, they seem much more happier.  It is a challenge sometimes dealing with certain customers, but it can be mostly done once the get to know you and feel confident your trying to help them."
good,I learned a lot about the agent's side of the insurance industry. As well as many basic guidelines and facts about insurance in general.
good,My manager was very week and had trouble making decisions. The company as a whole is a very good company. Upper management in the area I worked had a different outlook on how to manage.
good,at the time I only worked part time and that is what I was hired to do.  I took payments took information for the agent and got to work on their software.
good,"I've been employed with Allstate for about a year now and it has been a great experience, just not recommended for people who may have a life outside of work.  The demand of time spent outside of business hours is ridiculous."
good,"Small Agency"
good,"Allstate is an emerging industry, but the work given can be redundant, and lifeless."
good,"Packaged out purell to companies on a production line "
good,"Office manager, problem solver, motivator, customer service specialist.  I was there for a short time to motivate and teach staff how to handle clients, etc."
good,"Good for people who like to work a lot."
good,"Although Allstate has pretty good benefits, the way management and their Core Department, DOES NOT Provide.. Confidentially, the job its self was ok. Very ""pushy"" environment. Goal oriented. Company does provide what they call RTO time, that you earn for a job well done or via contest. Trying to get to use the RTO that you won by the expiration date, is very hard....  Company does not usually extend the time that you have.  Human Resource Dept. seemed very nice to deal with in the beginning. If you have to deal with HR after your hire, they do not apply confidentially either.  "
good,I have gathered lots of experience with Allstate its a good place to get a start in the insurance industry.
good,"Responsible for investigating bodily injury and personal-line claims to determine liability within Virginia Contributory Neglects Law.  Present case, with proposed settlement agreement, to Evaluation Consultants (i.e. in-house legal liaison).  Settle damages with insured (defendant), claimant (plaintiff) and/or plaintiff’s attorney"
good,"Working for Allstate was fun, informative, and knowledgeable. I learned a lot about the insurance business that I didn't know before. A typical day at work for me was: processing customers payment, answering questions, filing, distributing mail, making cold calls. There wasn't a hard part of the job, the job was neutral everyday. The office was laid back."
good,Be prepared and know what you would like to accomplish. I've learned to set goals and to be well organized.
good,"A typical day at work is to make phone calls for potential future customers. Providing quotes for auto, home, and life insurance. Filling, processing of payments, answering phone calls, updating customers information and maintaining our monthly sales quota. I've learned how to accommodate customers, provide great customer service and learn to do office works. Management is very hospitable and approachable they give out commissions and motivation. My colleagues are nice and friendly. The hardest part of the job is dealing with bad customers and problems. The most enjoyable part of the job is when i make our customers happy and satisfied."
good,"Selling insurance is a numbers game that you must be dedicated to improving your marketing and referral base. Not only must you be willing to make countless cold calls, you must take every opportunity to cross sell exiting clients while broadening your referral base outside of your friends and family to company contacts like Mortgage Brokers and Real Estate agents. "
good,worked here for five years fresh out of highschool. it was an ok company but i needed to learn more and make more money. there was no room for growth with this company.
good,"The company hires managers who specialize in managing and have no experience in insurance, this leads to a breakdown in the ability of an employee to trust the advice of a manager. Also the company has little use of and agents and tries to marginalize their work at every turn. On the other side the employees are very nice and incredibly professional even with substandard management."
good,"The companies culture was to hire their employee in as miniuim pay rate and work them to as much assignment they could get out of you in an eight hour day, which never was 8 hrs. especially working their drive-in assignment. never got paid for over-time!"
good,"sell and service Property and Casualty insurance."
good,"Good place.  To earn something new. Constant change must be very. Versitile, and  have good communication skills."
good,Shift based enviroment were my shift begin at 7:30 am. My role is to establish home and auto claims. Educate myself on company and office communications that will assist in the company and my individual success. I am placed in a team based setting with one supervisor but I have office wide support. Dealing with customers who personal assets have been damaged can be emotional and challenging based on the items involved. I enjoy the encouragement from my peers when the tasks become difficult. I am also in a family based setting were we all are very close in relationship. 
good,"Understaffed, overworked and underpaid....every minute of your day is micromanaged and unethical people are rewarded while everyone is punished for their unethical behavior. The only people getting promoted are friends of friends."
good,My expirence was very rewarding. I learned so much about secretarial work. On a day to day basis I would take payments make sells calls and file people's records.
good,Not a bad job but has all the setbacks of a call center job. Pay is a little better than some call centers but also requires a lot broader knowledge and problem solving base that doesn't match up to the pay. Senior management is poorly organized and as with most call centers out of touch with the working employees.
good,A typical day entails simply completing the assigned workload.
good,"Like many larger companies, managers outlive leaders, checklists outlive vision and inspiration. Allstate is unfortunately caught in this cycle right now and consequently not growing."
good,"All State is a great company for a student to work at. The benefits were also good with this company. The really good thing is once AllState trains you and starts you on the floor, there is NO micro-managing."
good,"micro managemnet,"
good,Its a total team evnironment.  It a great place to develop your skills and determine what you  may want to do in the insurance envornment.  There are many opportunites for followers.
good,Very low pay but job was needed at the time. Environment was a great place to work just wish the pay was a lot better and the location.  Also the benefits were not structured that well but the position was more of a contracted position.
good,They don't always provide great training so it can lead to more training being needed. They use credit ratings for new customers and limits getting some new clients.
good,There is too much pressure from the management at all time. Benefits are diminishing every year. Management only care for the share holders. Rewards are lesser much lower compared to hard work.
good,"Started out as being the best company I’ve worked for. All was terrific. Great benefits, friendly people, opportunity to learn, and good money. Great team spirit and management was super. But much of what I did was outsourced. If you can’t beat them join em. I Now work with outsourcing."
good,Great employees in all departments.  Everyone was willing to work as a team.  The centralization of most departments was taking it's toll on morale.  New leadership has been refreshing.
good,"Worked at two Allstate offices, one large, one small, and friends at statefarm and Geico... if you can get in at Geico then do it. No cold calls, people call in, its great, really corporate though. Do not go to statefarm... Allstate is all about the agency owner. A good one can make your life great but a bad one will make it bad and you'll make no money. imo"
good,Very boring job where for at least half of the day you had to pretend you had something to do. Only good thing was the hours.  When they did give you something to do it was calling clients reminding of payments which wasn’t bad but didn’t take up enough time.
good,"Pretty good for a contact center, but keep in mind it's still a contact center so all the things that go with it are still there. Management really struggles to balance the overall company culture with the contact center environment."
good,As a long term agent I use to love owning my own agency and working for myself. Over the past few years however the companies direction is one that added nothing but stress and increased overhead. Upper management puts ridiculous sales quotas on you. They never use to be this way. As an agent you are not even an employee but they treat you worse then one.  I got out while I could and was glad I did.
good,You will have to work hard to stay above ground.  You have to do some work at home to be able to stay afloat.  The benefits are not that great but you do have benefits.  It's a tough place to work but it's a job.
good,"Allstate was a great company when I started working there. They progressively went down from there and never recovered."
good,"I've worked at Allstate for 4 years and was unhappy the entire time working there. I would not recommend working at Allstate doing customer service unless you don't  mind working in a high call volume work environment or need health insurance right away. There is no work/life balance because the work schedules are awful and decisions are made around the businesses needs, not employees having a life outside of work. Expect to work every Saturday and good luck being able to schedule PTO on a Saturday because they only allow up to four people to book PTO in the whole service department, or you will receive an occurrence. The attendance policy is strict and the #1 reason why people are fired. Calls are back to back and you are constantly speaking to rude customers all day, repeating the same information about why their bill increased and why their policy is cancelled because they didn't pay their bill on time. Also, you speak with a lot of rude agents explaining to them how they  should do their job,and sales agents from car dealerships. I would only recommend this to people who are desperate to work and looking to quickly get hired somewhere and receive health insurance. I would recommend if you're hired to continue to keep looking for something better and not stay content. This is not a good fit for anyone who is looking to work normal business hrs Mon-Fri. Also, depending on your manager  and how much knowledge they know and their leadership skills can make a big difference as well."
good,"Hostile working environment where managers were allowed to run departments with little regard to qualifications and skills, but instead chose friendships over ability. If you were not a party animal with the clique, you were on the outside"
good,It’s not something you can do if you don’t plan on dedicating your everyday life to it. Everywhere you go you are expected to network if you want to be successful. Long hours and hard work. Good money if you give it your all but it’s not easy.
good,No Review - I don't have anything specifically to input here.  I just want to be able to move on and find something else since I have been with the company so long and am looking for new opportunities.
good,There were 2 people on my team.  This was not enough to handle the type of claims I handled for 3 states. The manager I worked for did not know the job either.
good,"No matter how long or hard you work, The Manager does not care. "
good,"was a good company but pulling out of california will come back to bite them, hit by too many ot lawsuits so relocation to arizona allows them to salary all employees,"
good,"No real room for Advancement with in office except leaving office, but over all not hard place to work. turn over rate a little high due to minimal pay."
good,"There was not enough time to complete everything. Also, the morale was really low. I worked off off the clock many days to try to stay ahead. There was also a hiring freeze during a very critical time."
good,"Learned alot with dealing with insurance policy. Rates on cars, adding other members to their policy. Understanding and explaining to customers about their rates."
good,"Worked there for a number of years, poor management, poor training, poor computer system.  Poor benefits.  Got a lot of PTO.  Great coworkers, they were really nice, made life long friends."
good,"Every agency is different, but Allstate is Allstate. The reason I no longer want to represent Allstate is because their adjusters seem to have been coached to first look at options to deny claims, instead of assisting paying customers with a legitimate, covered loss. I'm not comfortable selling policies which are not worth the paper they're printed on. Allstate customers (generally speaking) have to work to get what they are entitled to."
good,"I feel allstate can be a great place to work, provided management is on track with equal treatment of all employees.  Each office will be different as they are managed by a different manager"
good,"When I initially started I loved this job, then I started to pay attention and realized I had on rose colored glasses. The workload is unmanageable, however, if you meet metrics and deliver exceptional customer service, it’s not enough to advance. Politics are in every culture, but this was a different level. On paper you could perform really well, but if management did not like you, your work product didn’t matter. Unqualified people usually got the opportunities because they were “yes men”. Being good at your job only placed a target on your back and did not help with your growth. Management were lazy and professionalism lacked. I felt like I was literally stuck so I left and best decision I have made. Also, Allstate has the lowest compensation plan in the industry but continues to add more work."
good,Training was during production time every day.  Couldn't get management to help train on the computer.  Learned what I need to know from other employees.  This caused a riff in the office with everyone.
good,"management micro manages every little task , makes it difficult to do a job without questioning everything you are doing-always  and always 2nd guessing your decisions."
good,"Micro managed from Arizona and it's stressful. Learning curve is up to 2 years! You're on your own to figure most things out on your own. When you make a mistake, you're hammered for it, even though no one showed you how to do it in the 1st place."
good,It was good while it lasted. Was not satisfied with lack of opportunity to grow. Really good company with quality people. Just no opportunity for movement.
good,CEO is a risk averse leader.  Talks innovation but only cares about financials.  Encourages internal back fighting.  Real lack of leadership shown by him.
good,It depends on the agent you are working for. Each agent is different and that makes a difference in how the office is managed. Each agent is owner of the agency and they do make all the rules and regulations in each office.
good,call center atmosphere but without all the messiness. great training and opportunities to take on projects to showcase your abilities. Hard to move up to other positions because they wont cross train.
good,"Not Recommended -No job stability,Management is hit or miss, No career development, Compensation is below average. Depending on who you worked for management could be good or bad. It was basically a luck of the draw."
good,"You work hard, you will be compensated for it; just keep record of your sales - IT'S A MUST!!!! Cut Throat business as it is in all Insurance Companies. Just know how to budget your time and if you are an organized personand ""No"" means ""Yes"" later (In your Sales strategies...you will do very well!"
good,"If you work in Technology and you want to advance in your career, there are very few opportunities to advance unless you want to work in the Chicago Loop or relocate to another state."
good,Im not one that likes to talk on the phone non stop. It was hard to even leave your desk to use the restroom because they didn't want you away from your phone.
good,Great need of training and development ops.  Very little growth opportunity.  High staff turnover and distant location and demographically positioned.
good,Company is only interested in numbers. I felt like I was part of a sweat shop having to continually keep numbers up for upper management. Stressful environment.
good,"I worked at Allstate as a Catastrophe Adjuster for almost 4 years.  Hours are long and there is very little work life balance which is part of the nature of catastrophe work.  Pay is quite a bit lower than similar positions at other companies (verified), however vacation time and travel perks are touted as being superior to that of other companies, which in my opinion doesn't quite make up for the wage gap.  Workload is unrealistic and deadlines are unrealistically tight.  I wouldn't go back to working almost 80 hours a week again but for decent pay and some exposure to the industry, I would recommend anyone interested to try it for a couple of years and then move on to something better."
good,"They are a great company to work for and if I had not been in Sales I probably would have stayed around longer with them. Insurance sales are pretty cut throat and while I do enjoy Sales in general, I prefer to help my guests more than I care to undercut someone or make them feel stupid for not purchasing."
good,"The ratio of outbound calls to actual sales or even contacts with customers was extremely low, and the competition in the office was cut-throat to say the least."
good,"The same 4 people get moved around and promoted, but everyone else just stays in the same place or shuffles from one lateral move to another. Lots of rules but very little consistency from one office to another.  Seems like the company is weighed down by its own structure and making fundamental changes (like training/orientation or company-wide standards) would be almost impossible"
good,"Left Allstate because the job started to impact my personally life. Unless you're willing to deal with customer's complaints on a consistent basis in the claims department, this company is for the mentally strong."
good,"Allstate has a lot of rules that make it difficult to do well when it comes to productivity. Leads are not frequent, customers rarely are happy with rates."
good,Please do not ask me for a review that I do not wish to give. I did not agree to this nor will I participate at this time. Allstate does is a separate entity from it's brokers for which I worked with.
good,Good overall. Independent agencies can vary widely so make sure you sign on with a good agent. Can be a cutthroat environment so it's good to have a backup.
good,"My typical day at work was listening to calls and providing feedback to 150 customer service representatives.  I also handled escalated complaints from customers.  "
good,"It's a pyramid scheme. The management has no idea what they are doing. There is a family that owned it before and still has a say in what the business does. The Bailey's pretty much profit off of everything this agency makes, and they aren't even owners anymore. Half of the time they didn't have enough money to buy leads for the sales personal."
good,Its a fast pace work environment sales is very challenging but its no room for advancement you come in as a sale rep on a commission based salary and will forever be that person
good,"Terrible benefits and pay for the amount of work we are required to do."
good,"The only pros to working for Allstate are the salary and PTO. Unless you're a member of the good ole boys' club, or willing to kiss a**, you aren't moving up in this company, regardless of your education and experience."
good,"I discovered quite quickly that the insurance industry was not for me; Allstate offered great training, great starting salary, but there's very little opportunity to grow within the company."
good,"Always felt like I was overworked and underpaid. There was no motivation to take on more work even though it was given to you. No bonus structure and it was all lateral promotions. While the job security was there, the opportunity for advancement was not."
good,"Laidback environment with a relaxed dress code and ability to decorate and customize your work space. Metrics are king: if you're hitting your numbers you'll continuously continue to be coached as if you're not. If you're not meeting expectations, you'll be on your way out the door. Other than the micro-managerial approach to its call center employees, the job is great."
good,"Not a supportive management group. Frequent layoffs followed large hiring periods several months later. This hire/fire cycle caused unease among employees that did not encourage ""extra"" performance effort."
good,was a stressful environment with owner. Constantly yelling and using foul language.I loved  working with the public. Owner would not help out had to schedule appts to meet with him.
good,I will come in the office / make calls to follow up on endorsements then go home. To much drama / management is not up to par. nothing else to be said.
good,"Allstate was a good place to work they had great benefits and good people.  the issues were too many layers of management.  Management did not understand the business enough."
good,"Good Company, poor management. Does not provide proper business leads. Does not provide proper support in daily work load. Administrative support not provided"
good,"A typical day at work for me: taking payments, loan applications, and collections - fairly easy tasks, but extremely fast paced almost all of the time."
good,"Not amazing because the management is very low quality. Unfair hourly raises, and unprofessional sources. The most enjoyable part was time spent with coworkers and days that lunch was provided for us. The hardest part of the job was the fact that there were no new leads which carried into no new income for comission."
good,"The job requires going into public and begging people to get quotes. Or you can cold call all day. There is alot of favoritism within the organization when it comes to honest and dishonest employees. "
good,"A Typical day looks like,getting in the morning checking emails, going threw schedule making sure appropriate coverages is there, going threw any claims that need to be handled, and making sure my speed sheets all line up that we balance and revenues are better then normal. co workers are like family some hate work and some love it you take the good with the bad. It all evens out, the hardest part of my day is when i can not find a solution for a client even with the best of efforts, maybe they don't come within our guide lines and we have to deny claims or deny coverage. the most enjoyable part of my day is when i have finished all my work and I can help my co workers out if they need or jump into bosses office to work on our bigger projects. management in okay seems to me no one is on the same page."
good,Flexible lunch...some early days out.  Absentee agent owners...so many uprates.  Co-workers were very green...I spent much of my time teaching new agents the ropes as well as addressing my own workload.
good,"This company has a big turn over, and management is not professional. It is really hard to get promoted. I was able to make some life long friends"
good,Helped the over all performance of the store.  Drove in sales through cold calling and new account set up as well as provided exceptional customer service. This allow me to be success with in the store location.
good,"I enjoyed the pay, and being able to be in a relaxed office with fun employees, but the management was not great and very disorganized."
good,"Promotions come based on who you know and not what you do or your education level. They have outsourced jobs, the level of customer service is challenged, the complaints department continues to grow."
good,"See above, work load always very heavy, employees stress levels extremely high. 2 people actually walked out after I was laid off. The hardest part of our day was prioritizing as everything was equally important."
good,great job to start at but it may nto be for everyone. Theres pros and cons to it but a ton of pressure when things aren't at a balance all around
good,"In a position I enjoy, being able to help and advise customers of their insuring needs, I come to understand the benefits and the opportunities of working in a small private office."
good,"Allstate is a great place to learn the ins and outs of an organization.  It is very little room for advancement if you are a minority, however they do take pride in developing selecting individuals."
good,management looks to make changes all the time with lack of clear vision. Work like balance is semi non existent and benefits keep getting cut
good,"This company is ok. What I liked about the company was how the agency owner invested in you. The co-workers are great to work with. There was free coffee and snacks. The parking is free. The office is in a nice area."
good,"Hands on experience was great, but business got slow. Mostly payments came through the door. Not much new business. Mainly did upkeep on preior policies"
good,There is a lot of work involved daily in the insurance office.  There is never a slow or boring day.  I learned you can't trust everyone.  I like my coworkers but I need a change with more pay.  I would also like flexible hours.  I am stuck in the office daily from 8-5.
good,Great company to be with if you are the corporate side. Company has great ideas with positions.  Has a number of good personnel.
good,"This particular agency was fun to work for at first, but then alot of red tape and politics got involved. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning about the insurance world. The agency towards the end was  hardly receiving any sales which in turn became obvious that there would be no type of advancement or raise within the agency"
good,"I enjoyed my co-workers we got along great I am going to miss them.  The hardest part of the job, was since they changed what we could write as far as policies, the job became alot more stressful.  The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my clients."
good,"There are many aspects and differing experiences when working for a insurance company.  The hours were good, but the work was very repetitive.  I was able to listen to music while working, so that was nice.  This was allowed because there was not a lot of interaction with customers."
good,"Great company to work for. You learn a lot about necessary insurances. Hardest part of the job is telling people things they do not want to hear. The most enjoyable part of this job would be helping the customers and letting them know they are taken care of."
good,"Great claims employees and they have to be in order to work with the traumatic situations they work with on a daily basis.  Unfortunately, management tends to be one sided when it comes to overall numbers and it cuts thru the morale of the team which often makes them feel deflated."
good,"Worse place I've ever worked. Even the tenure employees regret staying as long and recommend to new employees to find somewhere else to go to work. They are stuck because of their salary. If you last more than a year, you are considered tenure. They are constantly hiring and firing employees. Working for this company also means to be prepared to work all holidays unless you have put in 20+ years."
good,Allstate used to be a great company to work with but through the years the company's loyalty to its employees slipped away to the stock holders. They began outsourcing left and right and eventually lost their soul. They began to layoff some amazing people with amazing talent and experience.
good,Its all who you know not what you do. That phrase has never rang more true than working at Allstate. Work product is not the driver for pay or promotion. If you make people feel comfortable then you are sure to grow.
good,The people I work with are most enjoyable.  the work is not hard but not that rewarding.  The compensation keeps getting less and less.  Benefits are expensive and I have not had a raise in 3 years.  I have been pidgeonholed in a job where there is no opportunity for advancement.
good,"While Allstate is ranked in the top 10% of places to work, these results must have been pulled soley from those working at the Home Office location in Northbrook, IL. In the customer contact center, where the frontline associates are in the trenches day in and and day out, it is a different story. PTO is DRASTICALLY reduced compared to Home Office counterparts and pay is well below the industry standard. Promotions are based primarily on who you know instead of merit and national holidays are worked despite minimal call volume. "
good,"The structure of management was very unstable towards the end of my 2 years with the agency. I learned alot from my experience, managing and training other employess helped me broaden my insurance experience."
good,Received multiple inbound calls regarding new claims and existing claims on car and homowner's insurance.
good,"Create project software plans on how I was to analysis a new piece of coding or testing a piece of software to produce output results. Read a considerable amount of Project Plans, analysis written material and draw up Software Development Plans, Project Test Plans and so forth to obtain either successful or unsuccessful output results which were document and reported to the software development team to analysis and implement patches to fix the issues found."
good,Plenty of opportunity to reinvent the culture and product portfolio if you have the patience to stick with it
good,"This company has decided to put profits over client retention, and is focused on luring new clients in, to raise their rates within the first 6 months of their policy. This company has done poorly in the consumer ratings, has lost almost 1/3 of the clientelle, to other companies, and has agents jumping ship, right and left because the writing is on the wall. "
good,Very good starting pay. Ethical company. Allstate is very involved in charities.
good,Great work life balance. Management for the most part was not compentent.
good,"Allstate has not embraced innovation and ideas the way other companies have. If you are a young person out of college, this may be a place to start your career, but not a place you want to finish your career. The company is not very open to new ways of doing business. They want good results via customer service expectations, but they do not want to adjust thier way of doing business."
good,"nice restaurant"
good,This was a externship of 160hrs for Summit Career College. This job wasn't my favorite. I had strange hours & no one really explained how to do any of the work properly. I was just thrown into it. It was a learning experience.
good,"They pay low, there's very little opportunity to advance. They constantly lay off people. The company is not making a lot of money."
good,"Typical day at work includes: Selling policies to new, and existing clients. Servicing existing policies, and answering the phones. "
good,Contacting other insurance company for claims. I leaned that each claim requires different needs. As always management is management as well as co-workers. The hardest part of my job was the constant changes was never stable. The most enjoyable part of the job was my customers.
good,Ok company new employees work EVERY SATURDAY coming up with new rotation that occurs every 13 weeks for 2 off days back to back but days are Sunday and Monday
good,Be careful you may be replaced by an independent adjuster. I had a good relationship with my manager but everything else was not a good experience.
good,A great environment for a sales producer straight from college to learn what it takes to be in a sales driven environment.
good,"Answering customers questions and concerns over the phone. Sales development tools and tactics. Job was fairly easy, but their system changed almost quarterly. "
good,"Maintained system support for multiple medical billing systems to ensure the prompt and accurate payments of Personal Injury Protection (PIP) and MedPay coverages. Analyzed and corrected billing errors from inbound HCFA and UB hospital bills to maintain customer support. Assisted in special projects to adjust system billing codes for state legislation of CPT medical codes."
good,Great place to work. Learned a lot from this company also was able to obtain property and casulaty license for 50 states by working for this company.
good,loyalty does not exsist. worked there 17 years and downsized. Just a number
good,"Busy work environment. Co-workers were very helpful, friendly and fun."
good,"A typical day at work is busy when you walk in the door until you leave for the day. I have learned the in and outs of the P&C business. The staff are great people. The hardest part of the job is meeting your goals each month. Customer service overrides the sales on a daily basis, some days no sales calls are made due to the calls coming in. Overall I enjoy the job, being able to help people with their insurance."
good,"Allstate was a great place to work and raise a family. I just wished that the job security was better managed. I had many opportunities for overtime, vacation and benifits."
good,I enjoyed the opportunity to obtain a professional license and love the fact that the company paid for the training and exam.
good,The clock went fast here a real hustle non-stop work place!
good,The hardest part of this job is knowing that in a few months you will outsourced. There is little if any career advancement. No cost of living and annually raise is no more than 3%.
good,Typical Insurance job with high claim inventory and low staff.
good,Allstate has some good qualities but also some draw backs. Hours of operation were great and policies and proceedures were also easy to learn. Pay was not great and very little benifits available. My employer was a wonderful person to work for.
good,"Many claims to do with no one to pick up slack if you miss it.  Supportive co workers. If you wish to advance, show up before sunup and leave after sun down.  Avoid office politics if you can, especially in a call center."
good,"Enjoyed it for 11 years. Enjoyed being mobile and was able to relocate several times as well. Was able to meet a  lot of new friends, hardest part of the job was sitting behind a computer for 8 hours on a face time video application."
good,"I currently work for Allstate.  Overall, the job pays well and the benefits are good.  I have learned a great deal about customer service and desk management."
good,a typical day at work consists of making outbound calls and following up on leads. the hardest part of the job is dealing with the ups and downs of the sales work. the most enjoyable part of the job is making commission.
good,"Stagnation is very real here. You may advance to being able to underwrite independently, but then you’re frozen at $16 an hour. It’s difficult to advance past that. "
good,I like the pace of the job but also dislike the fact that you never know how much money you’ll make monthly. I like the hours because it allows me to be with my family more.
good,"I did not work there for a long period of time, but while I was there it was very slow paced and the most basic secretarial duties were being completed by office management."
good,no time to use it.The company may have these distractions.  No time was ever set aside for downtime or to refocus after diffucult situations.Maybe in some departments but not in total loss.
good,"In my one year experience here, I conclude this office is more beneficial for tenured employees of 8+ years. There is an ease and familiarity for them in the work place and work load, and there are way more tenured employees than those under 5 years, which means the work culture favors the tenured. There is a very high turn over rate for new employees that don't seem to last 2 years. This has to do with the stress of the workload requirements. "
good,"Training is mediocre. when you go into transition you better stand on your own pretty much. certain areas of the 7349 IBM drive, 103 building in Charlotte is dirty.  I feel they need to upgrade their seating furniture were people spend most of their days😒"
good,"Super stressful, management is good for the work environment. Claims are assigned about 5 per day when fully ramped up plus weekend claims that can be anywhere from 8-10. STRESSSSSFUL"
good,"I am all for changes and improvements in the workplace. But when changes are made with vague details or lack of clarity, it makes it difficult to successfully move forward. I believe management needs to be willing to answer questions or concerns without getting defensive with the staff."
good,"good company to work for.  Office always had too much drama.  "
good,Great place to work for new grads. It's a great company for people without any experience. the pay is okay but there are some pretty good perks like working from home.
good,"Normal insurance business, selling can be tough with the rates. Lots of people don't qualify. Lots of customer service issues during the day which impede selling."
good,Crazy site leader who was going through a change of life which caused stress in the work place. You weren’t sure at times which personality you were dealing with. Poor upper mgmt who were still stuck in the 80’s and flaunting there 30 plus year tenure vs motivating and cultivating young talent.
good,Allstates focus in on Life Insurance sales. Property and Casualty sales has become obsolete in their vision for growth. Good for a newly licensed person looking for some experience in the field. No growth opportunity for a seasoned agent.
good,"Not very many resources for leads so, it's very hard to reach bonuses and make any extra cash. I am still new to all of this and it's very hard to get help from co workers to better learn and be able to assist customers."
good,"The day is mostly dictated by a task list received at the beginning of the day. They usually involve contacting clients, attorneys, and medical providers to further investigate a medical claim."
good,They offer decent pay but the health insurance premiums are insanely over priced. You pay 450 a month for insurance you can't even use. High deductible no office Co pays at all
good,"I have a few things to say about my experience working there. For one, it's a pity when you have to deal with a supervisor that has ""issues"". She will lie to those under her stating she got in trouble w/ upper management because of being out of workflow adherence. Can't fool me; she and the upper boss are great friends. Just wants to make herself look good not to mention being a total control freak. I could say more but won't. Secondly, their training is very half-tailed.  They train you on a process yet you get little opportunity to learn how to handle certain claims. They tell you to reach out yet complain when you do. All their IT is handled overseas. We just did a recent download of Windows 10, in which we lost valuable production time over. Not to mention the problems that were experienced afterwards. Any other place I've worked at had techs on site and did downloads on the weekends and everything was up and running prior to an employee's return on Monday. You'd think with Allstate being a big company, they'd have those techs available. And lastly, the micromanagement is horrible. Despite surpassing your quota, should you have too many gaps in your report due to whatever the issue may be, you reflect in the ""red"" the next day and have to answer for it in front of others during daily huddles. These huddles as well as RCPS sessions are a total waste of time. Now for the positive. I've met some good people since I've been there and they also provide good benefits including a matching 401K plan and 4 weeks of PTO annually. But I would never recommend working at Allstate; absolute"
good,Management has unrealistic expectations of workload and work/life balance.  I worked 75 hours a week and still had a difficult time.  I would not recommend a claims position unless you can commit to 60 hours/wekk.
good,"Not a bad place to work overall, team work and good customer service are emphasized.  Good benefits package and work/home life flexibility.  Senior management not always well connected with employees or departments.  A definite emphasis on the bottom line at the cost of company loyalty to employees."
good,I work from 8 to 5 - 6. I have learned so many different responsibilities in this fast paced environment with multi-tasking being essential. I learned that everyone must be able to work as a team and individually. The workplace culture is good. Hardest part is the hours when customers don't answer my phone calls to settle the claims. The most enjoyable is working with good reliable co-workers that buy into the program.
good,Working at all state was a good experience job because it helped me with becoming for confident when speaking with face to face clients. Management was very nice. It was hard for me to try to get people to get there insurance with all state. Coworkers were fun to work with and made my day go by very easy.
good,There is a lot of advancement if they like you.  You will have to work more than a 40 hr week to keep up. a lot of employees abuse the system and have poor work ethic while you pickup their slack.
good,"Let me start off by saying this company is a great company to work for as they truly care about their employees. There is potluck after potluck, raffle after raffle, and party after party and they do a really good job selecting their candidates. If you get hired, they put you on a team where the leader of that team compliments your personality!!! So in essence, you are on a team of like minded people which was pretty cool."
good,"Great Company, however employees are over worked, This is not a 40 hr a week job. Very little home/work life balance. The culture is casual, they offer some remote positions."
good,Worked with management on developing their employees and to create a positive work environment.  Worked to fulfill staffing needs. I had the opportunity to grow within the company.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is my co-workers they are wonderful. The hardest part of the job are all the last minute changes."
good,"Company in my 29 years changed from a place that cared about its employee to a greed driven bottom line business , "
good,It was close to home and I knew the employees but when I took the insurance exam I wasn't expecting it to be what it was.  I wanted to be like the office person and it was actually sales
good,"I was responsible for sales and marketing. Answered telephone calls. "
good,"....and there is A LOT of competition in Durango, CO for auto and home insurance.  I did not get much training with Allstate in developing and mastering my sales skills so unless you are a natural sales person or your agent is willing to really train you, you will be living paycheck to paycheck."
good,"I wanted to advance, but I couldn't get beyond a couple interviews to get to the next level - it was all who I (didn't) know, to get to the next step."
good,"There are some very dishonest agents out there. Stealing money, fake claims you name it. I was bullied by other coworkers just because I had experience. Very bad experience"
good,Enjoyed working with customers and cultivating relationships with new customers. I was receptive to customers needs and requirements. Management did little to help bring in new customers.
good,The owner would be in and out. He was very hard on the girls that work there and it was not a professional atmosphere at all. We were over worked and underpaid
good,"I believe that if management was different, the job would be more enjoyable. Claims is a heavy workload industry, but what helps is when you have managers that don't micromanage and try to help you"
good,"Not every insurance agency is the same, but the agency in which I'm currently working at has a boss who is very cheap and pays $450 bi-weekly before taxes. He has a phony way about him and talks negatively about anybody who walks passed the store."
good,I worked at an Allstate agency in WA. Very dull job but also not very difficult. If you are looking for a stable 9-5 type lifestyle it would be a decent start.
good,"My job was very demanding, challenging and changing.  Management was very poor, you need a leader who will work with you not against you.  There were a few good ones."
good,"At the time I was hired, there was 1 other Agent working besides"
good,"13 years of service i dedicated to Allstate,, It was a pure inspiring event / time of my life. .i truly bless from start to finish. . Encounter life friendship. ."
good,"The corporate positions provide a greater opportunity to achieve goals and advancement.  Whereas, most agencies are basically small operations that will burn out their sales people without realistic incentives or benefits."
good,Work environment is very stressful. Allstate is not the same as it used to be. and there is no job security. The company is now being run in an effort to increase the stock price at all cost.
good,"Allstate is a wonderful company to work for; however, in today's time, it is incredibly difficult to sale such a high priced product to your middle income families."
good,Managers have zero management skills and technical skills.  The place feels like a circus.  No teamwork everyone is competing to get to the next level but no one truly understands the industry or cares enough to learn.
good,comfortable environment and fast paced. Opportunity for knowledge growth. Workplace culture was fast paced but comfortable.  Enjoyable job.  Management was not adequate.
good,Contractors don't seem to matter much at Allstate.  Contractors are treated like second class citizens.  Contractors are undervalued and not appreciated. Contractors ae ignored and there is a communication gap.
good,"not bad, not great, regular claims adjuster work. The benefits have gone down over the last 10 years and here is little room for advancement. it's a good starting off point."
good,"It was an alright first job, although not my cup of tea. Desk jobs are not meant for me but hopefully for others. I prefer hands on, interactive working"
good,"I enjoyed working at Allstate, but I wish they offered some benefits and opportunity for growth. Supportive work staff and great customers. Excellent recruiters!"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Allstate, but with it being a new agency, there was a good bit of stress in meeting goal. There was always tension at the end of the month."
good,"Claims is a very fast, paced, think on your feet type of environment, perfect for that person who likes a challenge.  With continuous improvement, ideas are freely exchanged and the offices feel more empowered to enact change."
good,"The company (Allstate) is a good company, Rigid at points, but that is due to its size... You do need to take your time and find a Good Agent  to work for though..."
good,"The people were good to work with but the demand of time outside of regular business hours and the requirement to do more work than time allows or skill levels showed as appropriate often made it feel as though employees were set up to fail at achievement goals or management expectations.The office culture boasted a want to support a good work/life balance but then the general undertone was that if you didn't keep giving more and more hours outside of regular working hours in order to complete whatever work load was being given to you then you were failing at meeting the goals and negative repercussions would be forthcoming. Also, there seems to be a bit of office politics in that difficult employees who are not necessarily good workers are retained for lack of want to hassle with letting them go while good workers are scared off."
good,"Relaxed atmosphere to work, no paid vacation or holiday. A typical work day would consist of 4-7 hours. Great learning experience of accurately generating quotes, payments, and billing. Casual workplace attire. There is really no hard part of the job besides getting customers to be more open to sharing confidential financial information and demographics about themselves. The most enjoyable part of the job is servicing the people."
good,I learned several administrative skills at this company. although management could be more upbeat.i enjoyed working for this company because of positivity.
good,"Allstate is a fine company for P&C business, sky is the limit with hard work. On the Life & Retirement side the company is differently focused. Managers are very nice and try hard but have limited ability to steer effective partners to their new hires. Success comes from ones ability to obtain good P&C location partners who then provide leads. There's no metric for this process and so it gets managed accordingly. Initially this process is beyond the new hires control and luckily, they are not told this during the interview process. Additionally, you may at times compete against seasoned contractors for business for which the company has contracted you to service. This too is not discussed during the interview process. What's very satisfying is helping people protect their families and save for their future. You can make your own hours which is nice, and you have the choice of paying for your own healthcare, or you can get Obamacare if the situation allows."
good,Compared to the industry allstate employees are underpaid and over worked.  the aveage employe is given 20% more work than the average and paid 10% less than the industry average.
good,"Same mgrs promoted over and over, you work every Sat, lots of PTO but u never get to take it due to low staffing, managers have titles with no degrees, people come to work dressed however and mgt doesn't say anything, lots of pointless meetings, you can take 10 or 20 calls per hour you still get paid the same, front line leaders are scared to take reps concerns to division leaders, gift cards are given for performance but taxed at the end of the month, sales department is in competition with license dept, pay is lowest compared to other insurance companies, no work life balance working every weekend and holiday, it's more people that work here than higher positions available, takes about 5 years to move up in company they will deny your interview everytime."
good,Solid place to workSolid place towork.  You stay busy at but doing the same thing every day.  It does get boring at time but that how it is at most work places.
good,If you are a great producer it is very hard to advance because they want to keep that production versus help develop your career.  If you look to grow it can be seen as competition for leadership and many managers have tenure had to grow from within with that type of culture.
good,"Management focuses on the numbers you produce as an adjuster. They are always pushing for better and better numbers and seems that you can't do good enough. Pay is pretty good, but the work as an adjuster is not for everyone."
good,Good pay. Stable work hours. No real opportunity to advance up the ladder. A lot of work. Friendly management. If your a temp you'll be treated like one. Job stability considering its only temporary.
good,As I licensed representative I was able to get paid hourly plus commissions. The only way to really make money though is creating your own agency. Good Luck
good,If you like monotone work and making a million phone calls a day to unwanted people this is the place for you. The job was not fun because the owners are so much of micro managers.
good,"The majority of my day is make sure I assist customer though the claims process by answering questions, providing solutions, and determine liability on an accident by collecting facts and evidence.  "
good,"Good place to work if you enjoy helping/assisting others with issues, concerns, and situations. There were job benefit package. Job could be stressful at times and really didn't have a lot of opportunity for growth once you reach lead/manger status, other than getting insurance license and becoming an insurance agent of claim adjustor"
good,"My time with allstate was a mixed bag, i worked in 3 separate offices and they all did things very different. the core products remained the same and i found their offerings difficult to sell as they were generally not competitive and the incentive programs a little far fetched with available resources."
good,A typical day is busy handling calls and new files.  I learned all aspects of the auto insurance business.  Management is traditional and conservative.  The co-workers were the best part of the job.  The most difficult part of the job were technical issues.  There were many which delayed and frustrated employees and clients alike.  The benefits are still fairly good but diminishing yearly.
good,I felt my potential and room to grow was very limited at Allstate.. There was a huge lack of leadership and little care for employees. The company provides no opportunity for advancement.
good,"Sometimes, depending on how long you've been away from your job, you have to be refreshed on how to log back in the system. Beyond that, it's pretty breezy. You become a lot more independent.The supervisors give you a lot more rope, however, they are very close to answer any questions.The key is up to you to recognize that you have questions to ask. At the end of the shift, the sups will check logs for anything unfinished. The sups are always giving feedback, and I like that."
good,"Terrible Management. I would never recommend going to extra hands."
good,"Intern N/A"
good,Management is not really involved. They really dont know their employees jobs. Overall mediocre company to work for.I wouldnt recommend them for someone trying to advance their career.
good,"A typical day at work is generally the same. I come in, review claims, answer customer inquiries, pay wages and medical bills for my claimants."
good,"I work for an independent Allstate Agent, it is a small office that runs very efficiently with customers being our main focus.  We are a sales office that handles new customers, as well as a service office that answers questions regarding coverage, billing and claims.  The most enjoyable part of my day is meeting new people and helping educate them in understanding insurance.  The hardest part of my day is dealing with upset customers."
good,"it opened my eyes to how important it is to make sure that we cover our homes for insurance. How devestation to a home can tear a life a part, and mother nature doesn't care. I enjoyed giving great customer service"
good,I made the mistake of accepting a non-exempt position to get into Allstate and I am having a very difficult time finding my way into a salaried position.  Allstate has a hiring freeze and it is difficult to tell when things may open up again.
good,Allstate is a fast pace company that is constantly changing to fit individuals needs. There is always something to work on.
good,"A normal day at work would start with a 15 minute meeting with my team and manager. From there, we would all head back to our designated cubicles and proceed with following up on any claims that needed further attention. Once that was completed, inbound our outbound work would start. I would assist customers with filing claims, answering any questions on existing claims, making payments, scheduling rental vehicles for the time they were without a vehicle when applicable or if on outbound work, I would reach out to customers or close the claims completely once making sure everything was completed and in order."
good,The job itself is rewarding.  Training is very limited as you are initially thrown to the wolves.  Benefits are good.  It is difficult to break into the parent company.
good,Lots of bait and switching. Managers use you to get what they need then leave you hanging. The company favors stock holders and not the old way it used to be.
good,"Old company with old school views. During my time there, Allstate was losing insureds left and right to forward-thinking and better-priced companies like Geico and Progressive, and continues to do so. Because of this, many measures were took to reduce costs, mostly surrounding eliminating employee perks and consolidating offices. This is while top management continued to receive increasing salaries."
good,"I enjoyed working for Allstate, and being able to speak with everyone that came in and assist them in anyway possible. Met many wonderful people."
good,lack of training in the way you do your daily job requirements. Not real clear on the job requirements as they would change dairy.
good,Novo 1 was a stepping stone job for me fresh out of HS. It allowed me to gain the customer service experience I needed to succeed.
good,"There is no hardest part to my job as working in the insurance industry some things cant at times be a challenge but nothing you can't find a solution to. Working with clients on a daily basis is something I enjoy especially when I know once I'm done helping them, they are satisfied and I know that I tried my very best to help them with their insurance needs. When i go to work thats my focus work making friends with co-workers is a bonus but my ultimate goal is to due my work as effecient as possible help others where help is needed and focus on what needs to be done to move on to the next thing."
good,"I learnt Critical Patch work on Oracle Directory environment. "
good,"Great clients and well-established agency."
good,"It's constant work, answering phones, and always behind. "
good,"Advancement is slow.  There is great work life balance. The culture is stiff but there are great employee resource groups.  African Americans are consistently held back from being promoted.  They espouse diversity  but do little to foster this diversity."
good,"Job was straight-forward as far as insurance sales and customer service goes - even enjoyable. Saving people money, educating them about insurance, recommending products, and making sure they were properly insured while representing a solid insurer like Allstate was a pleasant experience. However, management at the particular agency I worked at left much to be desired. I worked for 2+ years in what, in my own opinion, I would expect most people to reasonably consider a hostile work environment. I lost all motivation to represent the agency and agency owner, although I continued to do my job and provide excellent customer service to clients to the best of my ability. However, I regret not having left the agency sooner and am very happy to no longer be working there and no longer needing to feel ashamed of who I work for."
good,"Had great fun co-workers, management on the accounting team is very lopsided and unfair, don't judge based on work performance based off of relationships."
good,"Great entry level spot, excellent PTO benefits.  Too many managers and workload can be cumbersome."
good,"I went through the training course and never had the opportunity to begin work. The work is only available if and when there is a catastrophe and they contact you for the assignment.  I was misinformed that even if there is no catastrophe there would be work and or additional training, then told that is not the case."
good,"A typical day at work would be entering payments, interacting with people, training, scanning important documents and entering numbers/letters that specified the document."
good,Working at Allstate is lie a dream project. There is lot of learning involved.
good,A team player that is flexible from project to project.  Able to pull vendors and teams together and deliver on time.  I have finished a major project a head of  schedule and ready to deliver on the next project.  Looking for growth.
good,"Located in south side Chicago."
good,"Tellemarketing all day every day. It was eight hours of cold calls due to our location being so hidden in a mall we had zero foot traffic. "
good,"A typical work day consisted of contacting customers that were recently involved in a automobile accident, review insured files and policies. Also reviewing medical bills and issuing payments to providers accordingly. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you've helped customers who didn't know how the medical bills would be covered. The hardest part of the job was speaking to the loved ones of an insured who lost their life in the auto accident."
good,worked at this company for twenty puls years. can be productive  at times.
good,Management and co-workers are all great. Downside no medical and dental provided.
good,"Its a great way to get professional experience. Not a fast pace job, no future growth. Managers are nice and good people to work with."
good,"This was my very first job and I tried the best I could since I did not have job experience. The hours were ideal since I was a Junior at the time, my bosses were nice. Sometimes the work was stressful, especially being a telemarketer. I just simply wasn't good at that part. Everything else was fine."
good,Input claims as people called to input loss reports and helped them to get their claims handled on a timely basis.
good,"You basically serve at the pleasure of the general agent. Allstate is top notch as a company and products. Software is improving. "
good,It is a fun work environment with great people. A typical day is spent cultivating broker relationships and building my book of business.
good,"typical day- incoming and outgoing mail, run reports, do reports, reception, taking care of phone, computers and copiers when there are minor issues"
good,"Nice location, comfortable physical work enviornment. Good training program."
good,"A typical day is coming in roll phones over and wait for customers to come in and make payments, answer phones and take messages. I have not learned much because I left a position that was very similar to this position. My co-worker is very hard to adapt to. The job is very easy. I don't have much to say on it."
good,"No work-life balance in AB. Very stressful, but that's the nature of this type of job."
good,I watched the focus go from what can we do for our customers to how can we get out of paying this customer over the 7 years of my employment. That puts it's employees under additional pressure in dealing with the customers.
good,"A typical workday could include Cobol coding/design, HLASM coding/design, JCL development and VSAM file environment"
good,"work day hours were great, learned a lot about insurance and how the ins and outs worked. Agents were plesent and made you feel comfortable."
good,"Allstate is a great company...However, independent agents do not always align themselves with the Allstate brand."
good,"I was staff producer,  Quote, write and cross sell clients, answered phones and did customer service for clients.  Staffing difficulties with this agency,  no room for growth or setting goals.  I loved working with the clients there,  I did my job and had to do others also.  Keeping up with the work Que and working all email leads and client endorsements was the important daily goal."
good,"I answer phones and service existing clients. Consult and sell Property and Casualty Insurance."
good,BEST working hours! Nice Supervisor and Managers. Talk to people from all over the work. No room for advancement like they claimed
good,"Work as a Temp was very busy and structured."
good,"Always a meeting to attend, or hear via web ex. Learn to keep asking questions even when no one has the answers.Many of the co-workers have never worked any where else other than this company. The hardest part of the job is watching your job being taken from you to go over seas. The most enjoyable part of the job is to complete my day to the best of my ability with knowing I have done the best that I have to offer."
good,assisting clients with insurance quotes. the position was temporary but i wish it was long term
good,"Culture is changing.  Outplacement of IT seems to be main focus.  However, offers extensive inhouse training opportunities.  Work with multinational teams.  Changing priorities is the hardest part of the job.  Interesting projects and experiences made the job enjoyable."
good,"The individuals I worked with are great people, very caring and capable. The corporate system they work in however greatly hampers  their effectiveness, relying on a rigid 'cookie-cutter' approach to claim handling. Each auto accident is different , and customers needs are different. The current claim system requires the adjusters to follow senseless processes, requiring repetitive documentation within programs that were designed not to allow effective claim handling, but  for ease of management review."
good,"Terrible manager, was never satisfied with the efforts of the employees. Bonus were hard to achieve, work life balance suffered. office was over-staffed. "
good,I really enjoyed working for Allstate just the management was not cohesive and it was hard to get an answer from anyone. 
good,"Investigate unlimited amount of claims. Claims were assigned 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Hardest part of the job is that the claims never stop, so the job never seemed complete. Most enjoyable part of the job is the people I worked with."
good,great people. good pay and benefits - exceptional vacation time. estimating standards are laughable and expectations are unachieveable
good,I was a bodily injury liability adjuster. I handled new claims and made settlements with non represented claimants. I worked from 8-5 m-f and one Sat a month. Then they changed it to working at nights weekly. I had trouble with my supervisor every time I had an issue with my children or daycare. I was the 2nd highest performing adjuster in my section of 15 adjusters. I constantly performed and received a raise every year I was there. I left because the constantly changing schedule did not fit my family. I am a single mom.
good,Enjoyed working with support staff. Upper management disconnected from staff. Sales oriented.
good,"I learned alot about the world of insurance, although there was very little support from management should problems or issues develop. Enjoyed working with the variety of customers and helping them understand how to be properly insured."
good,I will keep this to myself. Allstate is a complicated place to work at.
good,Great idea and great business plan but they cannot execute it. No one at this company can take responsibility for any thing. They change your contract and have no answer as to why or who. In the end your pay goes down your numbers go up.
good,"long hours, learned a lot about insurance policies and adjusting claims, managers are good people, co-workers are good people, operating in an environment where you do not know when you will be fired. the money is the most enjoyable part of the job"
good,"I spent several years at Allstate in many positions, and the underlying theme was poor management accountability. It is really an old boy's club without gender distinction; females are invited to join and aren't accountable either. The company has a great brand and a superior delivery system but they are weighed down by bad decisions on every level with little or no input from the people in the trenches. They pay lip service to inclusion and voicing concerns but when push comes to shove there is no formalized managment accountability, and it is costing shareholders millions."
good,Good people to work with coWorkers
good,"A typical day at work can be dealt with if you have great time management skills; it is a fast pace working environment. Management can be great but sometimes strict just as every other company and the co workers are excellent to work with. The personal time off you receive is more than two weeks plus holidays, however job security can become a factor."
good,Too much stress and targets are too high for the money you make.
good,"Was brand new and ""thrown to the wolves"" after a hurricane. Learned the computer system but then ran out of claims due to amount of adjusters in the area."
good,i helped people who were broken down on the side of the road all over the united states.
good,"Required to sit many hours of the day, phone and computer work. All of which were fine. There are standards set forth by the state and also statutory requirements. The job itself was enjoyable. Working with various personalities in an office environment there will be personality clashes and differences of opinion. There are clicques and politics which is found in every office if not every job. No criteria for promotion into management which results in, inferior management. All co-workers were very good to work with. They pretend to be concerned with morale however is nothing more than a smoke screen. As once said, you can be bleeding and not be aware of it. Most difficult part is trying to meet many deadlines (T-dates). Working with the public is challenging however, you learn so much due to the experiences of many others. Over-all, it was an enjoyable line of work."
good,"My responsibilities included opening the office and checking voice & e-mail, providing car & home insurance quotes & credit checks to prospects, write new business & submit contracts, file claims online, provide client service for claims issues or questions, provide detail accident reports online, hard copy filing for agent, screening calls, faxing contracts, run daily & weekly reports, send weekly mail outs, in office payments, order supplies and daily bank drop,"
good,"Allstate San Antonio is a pretty good job to have. Well paid and good benefits. They usually hire people by waves, provide paid training and licensing for a couple of months, then help you by going through ""transition"" so you can get adjusted to the job. They have vendors that come in almost everyday for lunch so you don't have to go out, and they also have a game room where they have a ping pong table and an xbox."
good,"On the plus side, Allstate trains employees extremely well. They invest in their employees from day one. Pay is very good, the office is bright and has a number of amenities. For the right people, it is an awesome place to work. On the down side, the scheduling is a joke. Despite their claims of flexible schedules and great work-life balance, you work the schedule they pick and you have no options. Only one or two teams are given two consecutive days off each week, and only one team gets Saturday off. If you have kids, plan on never seeing them during waking hours. While the atmosphere is fun and bright and exciting, it is also sophomoric and geeky. Super heroes are all well and good in some settings, but some of us have actually matured beyond the 8th Grade."
good,Working for AllState was great when I was younger. But when I learned my family was growing I felt the need I needed to grow. I found a company willing to work with me where AllState would not.
good,the managers more concerned with meeting numbers and quotas than taking the time needed to ensure things are completed correctly and very hard into different areas of the company
good,"Not a good fit for a contractor, management is horrible, and biased lot of training not relevant to the task at hand. Trainer was less than friendly and un willing to answer questions treated contractor like pre school childern"
good,"It is a great job, offers you a lot of growth and opportunity  it is a very heavy workload as you manage several cases at once; pay bills, make outreaches, follow up, arbitration’s, litigations, and so on so forth  they do let you work from home, they do allow some flexibility in time at work, a lot of benefits, great PTO  most importantly they allow you to learn outside of your job description so your possibilities are endless however the more you know, the more management expects"
good,It's a decent starter job. Maybe not the best career to have for life. There is a high turnaround which creates stress on those who stay. No benefits.
good,"Each office is independently owned and operated. Each office runs differently. Most agents that I have come across do not care about their employees. There are rare few. Watch your pay, check it twice."
good,"If you don't live in Ca.  Typical big company mentality.  They are moving most of their work from Ca and taking it out to AZ.  If you are not at a desk, so far you are safe."
good,"Allstate was good place to work however, their compensation was not what I was used to and the leads provided were not good leads concerning contacting people interested in acquiring insurance products."
good,"There is a team, but most times you are alone and on the phone with customers. You learn independently primarily as you go and through business Skype and email. No further training. Often you do not feel like you have the answers or skills to meet the customers needs."
good,The company in the past 10 years has become very rigid and has started to look more towards financials than in the past instead of employee and customer satisfaction
good,"I hated this job. I cold-called and the product was not competitive in the market place. To be successful in the marketplace you need a good product, and company does not product good packages."
good,A typical day consisted of taking 50 - 60 calls per day from agents who were often upset with our systems. I learned that our employee experience varied greatly from Dept. to Dept. So much depended upon a person's supervisor. Management wanted us to service our agents but often did not provide the appropriate training and follow up to do so.  Allstate did emphasize a culture of mutual respect. The hardest part of the job was trying to get get around our system's limitations so that the agent could keep his customer. The most enjoyable part was the people I worked with.
good,"I'm trying to make this a direct yet neutral review."
good,The claims world is a very fast paced environment where the day goes quickly.  The company was very employee friendly however has changed since the claims president came over from Liberty Mutual.
good,I liked my job at Allstate for 8-10 months very much then I started to see the down sides to the job and the company. This was the only place that I worked that I didn’t get a raise that was based on my performance. Your raises are based on what you do to enhance the center! So if you simple do your job well you are not doing enough. This was a down side for a new person as you learn the ropes and make sure you have all the job duties and requirements down you are not doing enough. I was disappointed in this factor !
good,"Neutral Stance due to if it is an agency you are contracted through every Agent varies from culture, personality, and environment.  Therefore my review will remain neutral."
good,"The internal processes cripple the teams' autonomy to get work done. Very top down, hierarchical culture where it's difficult to operate autonomously."
good,Management will kill your spirit and your drive. It is very challenging work for the pay Allatate pays the lowest of the market for underwriting. ......
good,"the calls were ok but can be very demanding and stress full especially when the caller yells and screams because your insured hit them, or they are not happy with the type of rental. the fatally part can get you crying."
good,In my department the office is warm and welcoming and there is a great sense of comradery among colleagues.  The position allow for  complete autonomy to complete our work without being micromanaged.
good,Actual project work was very fulfilling.   The number of Management changes was unbalancing with constant changes to job priorities and expectations.  Very structured and formal .   Allstate is very generous in providing/encouraging volunteer work-one of the best things about working for this company.
good,Allstate is a very fast pace working environment. You work in a quad with a noisy environment on busy days.  There are always constant changes in responsibilities inclusive of receiving inbound calls while attempting to make outbound calls to assist with your customer volume throughout the day.
good,"This is a good place to start a future in the insurance industry, but not a place to grow and be compensated for your work load."
good,The company decided to centralize. Prior tit was a good work enviornment. They are slowly phasing out all the jobs by edntralizing to other countries. If this had not happened it would have continued to be a great job to be at.
good,Senior management has made some terrible decisions and was the primary reason I left the company.  All of their decision were based on controlling costs.  Moving many jobs overseas and then realizing it was a mistake.
good,"I studied and received my Property and Casual license to become a Certified Insurance Agent.  "
good,"Help the customer,"
good,I enjoyed first working at Allstate but the demands became higher and higher and it became less enjoyable and more stressful. Management was not all that great either so it added to the stressful environment as well.
good,It was my first job in an office and the manager didn't properly train me. I had to learn many things by myself and she expected me to do everything her way. Other than the manager/owner of the Allstate office the work area was enjoyable.
good,"Provided customer service to new and current customers. Took payments. Reported and processed claim. Quoted new and renewal book of business. Cold called for new business. Called customers about their payments. Processed endorsements. Filling, answered telephone. Greeted customers at the door."
good,"If one is seeking a career with the Allstate Insurance Company there are a multitude of opportunities for employees within the core of the company.  However, consider staying away from the Allstate Roadside Services division.  Unfortunately this is a very poorly managed division that consistently underperforms and stretches employees to the limits.  Employees crying at their desks due to stress to noncompetitive pay for new hires is a commonality.  The moral is low.  If one is considering Allstate please consider other areas of the business."
good,"Busy office where you are dealing with American Agents who contact Allstate NI with computer issues."
good,"capturing requirements, understanding business processes, identifying data sources, extracting data, performing data cleansing, validation, transformation,  aggregation, visualization and prediction"
good,"Last manager would not offered PTO or insurance , wok place culture was good , a regular day at work was pleasant , most enjoyable part of the work was helping people reached their goals helping them with life insurance among other benefits ."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Allstate.  The folks I worked with were enjoyable to be with.  I really liked the financial services program, I just wished that they gave the financial reps better products to work with as well as a better compensation plan.  Had I not been laid off, I would not have left."
good,Prefer not to share this information at his time. I shouldn't be required to fill this out if I choose not to. I hope you know how this process is so stupid.
good,"When I came to interview at Allstate, I was impressed and excited to see name badges indicating 20, 30 and even 40 years of service with the company. This is the type of company I wanted to work for. While there are still opportunities with the company, it does not look like there is a future with Allstate within California down the line. If you are mobile then Allstate is a great company, full of growth and opportunity."
good,Benefits are good.  Bad management.  They don't have a mixed culture.  Expect long work hours. They tend to discriminate.
good,"If you are looking for a place to advance your sales and telemarketing skills, then Allstate would be a good choice for you. I was able to gain a wealth of knowledge in my time there, that has carried me throughout my career."
good,"Knowledge of Allstate's products that we sold was a must, as our products often needed to be more simply explained to interested parties.  The ability to probe within communications with interested parties is a skill that very much plays a part in doing the job.  You have to learn to think on your feet, because not every question has a readily available answer.  Business communication skills are put to the test."
good,"This is a small family owned agency, so lack of advancement is an issue, and the way it is run is questionable. The job itself isn't a bad one, I know the duties, but I prefer outside sales to inside, and the ability for higher income."
good,"Allstate has a very competitive and stressful work culture where employees constantly feel like their jobs could be outsourced at any time. The company has begun branching out in the types of services they offer consumers with their recent purchase of Squaretrade. They need to do more of this since the old business model of auto insurance will soon go to the wayside when driver-less cars come online. Allstate is very slow to change, and upper management talks a lot about Allstate being a ""family"" and being ""a force for good"" in the community. Really what they are concerned about is driving their stock price higher for the shareholders, and they are not afraid to lay people off to achieve this goal. Recently about 600 claims adjusters were laid off when Allstate decided to automate their job functions with Quick Photo Claim self-service claims mobile app. This has the policyholder taking a picture of their auto damage through a mobile app instead of having a professional claims adjuster look at the vehicle. The company has also let people go as they continue to outsource jobs to India and the UK. There has been talk that they may close the Northbrook office and utilize remote office hubs instead, but these are just rumors. The lack of transparency on the part of upper management regarding this is causing morale to plummet depending on your role with the company. All of this being said, Allstate is one of the last companies to continue to offer a pension in addition to a 401K. They also provide fantastic amounts of PTO since they base this on your industry experience and not just"
good,"A typical day for me is busy with customer calls and assisting customers as they come in. I love the customers, they are my favorite part of the job! Allstate over all is a good Company with good products and services. The Agency I work in is very competetive. Leads however are poor and often older and reworked by multiple sales persons. Help is minimal in setting up a good pipe line to bring referrals to you. If you are not very fast in obtaining large sales quotas you will not last at this office. Management is primarily run by Office manager. Agent is minimally involved as he is very busy with other things, and with opening a new Agency as well."
good,"Difficult hours and shift "
good,No work life balance. Work EVERY Saturday. Include working on holidays unless its your off day. Great benefits. Hard to move up in the company. Always busy
good,Learned about Allstate's sales and servicing of auto and homeowners insurance in a local agency. The hardest part of the job was cold calling on lists to try to sell their products.
good,"A typical day at work:"
good,Good place to start a career. Hard to advance at this company. They also are not good with allowing you to move to better positions in different depts.
good,"There was times were it was a slow-paced environment, and there was times it was very fast- paced. I learned how to work outlook excell and different systems."
good,"I was thankful that Allstate invested time to train me because I was a new Agent. However, even though I was the top auto and homeowners insurance producer, my salary was not competitive with other agents during similar works."
good,"Low salary and commission package"
good,"I loved the Allstate culture for the most part until the company began to push the whole LGBT on everyone. If people want to be involved cool, but don't shove it down everyones' throat. The people are generally nice and thoughtful. Allstate encourages their employees to get involved in problem solving. The hardest part of the job of Express Processor was getting 8-10 claims per day which is way too much for any one person to handle. It's more like a two-person job. I would not recommend this position, but there may be other positions that are not as overwhelming where you don't have to own any files."
good,log in on all systems. assist customers needs for all state benefits. the hardest part of the job was  giving bad news to policy holders the supervisors were very helpful
good,"A typical day is taking applications, taking and applying payments to accounts, calling past due accounts and sending out collection letters. Soliciting customers for more money."
good,"Internship experience was okay. Requires a lot of devotion as would be expected in any role. Help a lot when there are problems, answer any questions you have."
good,"A great place to work.  The people are great and they offer work from home which is great.  The foCus system is unique and like no other.   It is complex and the billing is even more complex and hare to learn.  What you learn about this system cannot be used anywhere else, as most other Insurance companies are using Guidwire.  "
good,With Allstate you are expected to maintain a higher claim load than with other insurance companies while trying to thrive in a work place that pushes you to work more without allowing for work life balance. We were constantly under staffed which meant everyone who stayed in the office was over worked trying to compensate for low numbers.
good,It's a great company to work for as long as your agent isn't shady and only in it for the money. Agency's can be wishy washy and unstable due to leads and policies written.
good,"I enjoy what i do and really enjoy all of my Co-Workers.  I don't think the rate of pay is enough for the fast paced office it is.  I enjoy the fact that the office is busy all day long, but, i don't feel valued. They do not offer benefits."
good,The owner of the agency is great. He is very flexible. Allstate has a great training program. He does not provide benefits but he does compensate it with bonus.
good,The call center in indianapolis is a joke. They hire people who have a mess up mindset. Those who are actually working and providing services get thrown under the table.
good,Was told on the initial interview that there was plenty of room for growth after coming in at the entry level position. After several years of working in the same department and several interviews later no advancement had happened. Low pay/hard work and production goals to meet.
good,This is a very helpful position to our customers as being stranded is never fun. Roadside assistance is needed in this country and providing fast and friendly service is what I do. But the position is moving to another location.
good,"Confrontation, conflict, emotional/psychological exhaustion, and compromise are par for the course.  We are charged with prostituting principle and ethic under the false pretense that we are delivering on our promise that our Insured's will be In Good Hands when the unexpected happens - at the moment of truth."
good,"Very lucrative but hard work.  The compensation is very good but the long hours can grind on you. If you are an agent, depending on the region there is very little support from middle management."
good,I learned how car insurance works and how to have a lower rate on my monthly payment. Management team needs more professionalism  and learn how to treat their employees and costumers. Starting with the agent.
good,"It an ok company to work for.  "
good,"The atmosphere is great and the people are fantastic. The benefits are nice and the pay is what I am looking for. However, the workload is overwhelming, the turnover is high, and the job in itself is hard to deal with. Nothing against the company but claims is just a difficult job to cope with."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of answering all incoming calls and transferring them to the appropriate party, Taking insurance payments by credit card, check, and money orders. I would also start quotes for the insurance agent and give excellent customer service. Fax, scan, and email on a daily."
good,"Overall, a good place to work. The last couple of years have been fraught with uncertainty. There is a definite push to outsource job functions. For an entry level position good place to start. You receive  pretty training. There are opportunities for advancement if you work hard and use the talent development tools available. The hardest part of this job was having to say goodbye to people that you've worked with for many years due to restructuring and outsourcing. What I learned is that you can accomplish anything you set your mind to if you use tools available such as networking and ensuring your manager knows what you want to achieve."
good,"Management has been a revolving door.  My hiring manager left before I ever started due to problems with Haasz management.  This is a new agency, and a lot of ground work was not done prior to opening, and nothing has changed since.  The idea of putting an insurance agency in a dealership is genius, in my opinion, but it seems the ground level work is not willing to be done by anyone here."
good,Benefits are great but salary is not that competitive in comparison to other companies.  It is a very stressful work environment and they are not very consistent with their policies and procedures which can be very frustrating. They don't hire enough people leaving a huge work load and those that are there.
good,"They pay you well, but work you really hard. Lots of turnover. It's not quite the family feel. Pretty cut throat and all about numbers."
good,"I learned a lot while working here. Not only how to multi-task but also learned a lot with working on computers such as excel, Microsoft word, etc."
good,"All in all, Allstate is a great company to work for, and I work with great people. I do not have tons of room to grow in my current department, which is why I am currently seeking another opportunity."
good,A large company with high turnover.  Company tends to lose track of that each department is doing since it is so large and segmented.  Very process driven that day to day business gets bogged down.
good,"- Provided service to clients' changing insurance needs by selling life, health, auto, and commercial insurance "
good,"My typical day is making collection calls. There are two other employees, a CSR and Office Manager. The hardest part of my job is calling customers about their accounts and having to chase accounts."
good,"At Allstate, my time was spent handling inbound calls the majority of the time. I scheduled appointments for customers, worked with other insurance companies, and mentored fellow employees. Often times the hardest part of my job was knowing that there was no opportunity for advancement unless I moved to another Allstate location out of state. But I very much enjoyed helping customers and knowing that I made a difference."
good,"Facilitating the Sale of Real Estate, through contract preparation and negotiations on behalf of buyers and/or sellers in accordance to GA Real Estate law.  "
good,"Lots of claims! Claims come in by the bundle, especially during the high season. They try to enforce a work life balance but with so much work to be done, claims still become your life at some point."
good,"I enjoyed my job, but this was through a temporary company. They let people go often. High turn over rate. All calls were monitored and they wanted questions answered in a short amount of time."
good,Large corporate environment where protocols and process tends to trump common sense and good customer service.  Advancement is difficult if your position is a field position.  Most days lunch hours are not taken and working past quit time.
good,"Great job opportunity to learn about insurance and sales marketing."
good,"Enjoyed and loved the positions, task and responsibilities I perform. Unfortunally under management that did not care for your career development, for you as a person nor what you brought to the table.  There is major amounts of political issues. There was no transparency as stated in their mission and repeatly announced. But did learn great new processed, technology and how to manage challenges. I appreciate and enjoy the long term relationships built through work experiences with my brokers agents and colleagues. I love that I have educational opportunities. Sadly there was no value for recognition for senority. Production, financial gains and meeting the diversity guidelines for their own gainful purpose is their only focus. I enjoyed resolving issues and creating strategies with profitable results with brokers, agents and insured's. I'm passionate in making a difference in my job performance, what I'm liable for. Devoted to the opportunities, and partnerships that I have developed and gained."
good,"The only reason of mine for leaving Allstate is, I have recently became a mother. I am married and my husband works. However, his insurance benefits are not helpful to our family. I need a job that will provide a larger variety of benefits. The co-workers here, along with the management were absolutely sensational. They were very easy to work along beside. We acted as a team, and became very successful during my time here at Allstate."
good,"-Management is awful-they pick people who have been there longer rather than people who could actually do a great job."
good,The most enhoyable part of this job is the team I work with. The biggest challenge in a day would be to make it through a full day without getting yelled at by the agent.
good,This position involved making sales and servicing current customers who have insurance policy's written at the agency that I worked for. I learned how to cross sell products to the current customers.  I learned how to sell life insurance products.  I also learned how to write homeowners insurance.  The biggest challenge I faced as a producer at Allstate was generating sales by making cold calls and networking.  I was very excited to begin to sell life insurance after I obtained my life insurance producer's license.
good,"Offsite corporate managers are cold and unprofessional. Work environment was good, coworkers were adequate."
good,"I enjoy helping potential customers of Allstate, however the compensation is not enough. I have to work 6 days a week to make 40hrs and that's not helpful, being that I am a single mother of a 9 yr old."
good,"Our day consists of telemarketing to leads, I have learned that you need t be aggressive in order to make sales. the agent owner is really nice and understanding, my co worker was great I actually worked with her at a previous job. The hardest part of the job is convincing leads prospects to buy insurance especially when we couldn't beat their current rates. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I take the calling as a challenge."
good,"Help you receive your property and casualty license in fifty one states."
good,"ANI is a good place to work if you'd like something different from the normal jobs available. It develops your people skills as you speak to U.S insurance agents all day. The shift times are less than ideal if you want a normal work/life balance however, as a 2PM-10PM shift is standard fare here. Friendly work environment and nice colleagues , and good enough training to prepare you for the basics of the job role. The toughest part is your first two weeks, getting used to incident management and potentially stressful situations, but once you get this down then the job gets more comfortable. You need to be adaptable though, as there are always new software issues that need to be dealt with, and finding solutions to these can help the entire call floor deal with call volume. Overall a decent place to work."
good,"nice calm environment, management is screwed up. no health benefits offered at all or direct deposit which is very inconvenient"
good,"production is the number one at Allstate, independence in working on your own, keeping up with the daily production goals and being a dedicated worker, hardest part of the job keeping up with changes that happen during the day, enjoying laughing at daily conversation with co-workers a fun place to work"
good,Excellent opportunity to expand my skill set and progress from customer service to licensed insurance agent and was promoted to acting manager/lead producer. The management at this agency was not very good as the broker was new to the business and inexperienced in the insurance business.
good,no benefits or room for growth when you work for an agent. Only way to make more money is through selling more policies.
good,"Typically I do everything from answer the phone to do quotes for people to handling claims and billing issues.  I came into the insurance business with zero experience and I have learned a ton about auto, home, renter's insurance and claims.  I am the office manager so I take care of all aspects of keeping the office running smoothly.  I get a long great with my other co-workers and believe that no job is too big or too small for EVERYBODY to pitch and do. The hardest part of my job is not ever feeling that what I do is appreciated or that I am respected for the hard work I do.  The best part of my job is all the great people I have met and the knowledge I have obtained."
good,I enjoy working with Allstate and being able to assist customers in their time of need. Unfortunately for a working mother there was no flexibility or understanding when emergencies came up. Also advancement within the office and the company was limited and most times unattainable.
good,Help desk analyst taking calls to aid Agents with the use and understanding of Alstar and Alliance software packages used to calculate policy premiums for their clients.
good,I  loved working in Insurance but unfortunately I worked for an Agent that was new to the business and did not know how to Manage or Market. My co-workers were great and dealing with the Clients is what I enjoyed most.
good,managers not on the same page. they say they care about you and your personal goals but they just look out for themselves.
good,"Constantly getting new files to work on claims, but co-worker and management cared about employee well being and had perks to make up for the workload."
good,Worked in primarily all male department and did not experience the benefits of a company known to value working mothers.
good,"I worked with the Commission Team, advancing the methodologies in which the commissions were paid to the brokerage houses and banks for the sales of Allstate Financial's products."
good,Very fast paced envrionment. Hardest part of the job is keeping up with all the numbers that you are required to hit.
good,"Great job for someone who wants to become an adjust, not much advancement outside of becoming and adjuster"
good,"➢	Sell automotive, boat, motorcycle, homeowners, renters, and commercial insurance"
good,"Learned how to handle claims, abide by policies, interact with distraught customers, time management."
good,I worked with a great team of young professionals in the The Controller Department at Allstate Insurance Co.. The hours were not very flexible. Overtime was expected during forecast seasons.
good,Management does not want you to over excel. They think you will eventually take their place
good,"A typical day at work would entail selling Allstate products and services via inbound phone calls.  As a licensed sales professional with Allstate Insurance Company, I learned time-management and how to increase sales and productivity. My co-workers were self-motivated, self-starters, just as I am, which made for a great sales environment.  The hardest part of my job was when the calls came in through the automated dialer slowly.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working during the busiest part of the work day when calls were at their peak levels."
good,"Worked inbound and outbound calls on a daily basis with customers in assisting them with filing their auto claims. I did some rental back up for other teams. I had also had the enjoyment of mentoring the New Hire training class before transitioning to the floor. I received several recognition from Allstate. I was a top performer on my team as well as the Birmingham Office. Co workers and Management was great to work with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with a fatility. I enjoyed the one on one customer service work with the customers daily. I enjoyed my team, the entire office as a whole."
good,"Busy"
good,"Over looked a book of business of over 2,000 customers and make sure policies renew . Trained staff on underwriting, quoting and closing sales on auto, homeowners and other insurance policies."
good,"No Free Coffee, I almost started looking for a new job right away.  "
good,working for the department of insurance isn't easy but being that said is why I choose to end the employment with the company.
good,"Nice culture and great benefits! A typical day consists of answering calls from potential customers regarding auto, home, renters, boat and motorcycle insurance. I learned to sell insurance nationwide. The management is organized and eager to assist. "
good,Many calls to make... Gotta love listening to people complain
good,"Led by a team of responsible, ethical persons committed to the growth of the company and 5 star customer service."
good,• Provide excellent customer service to both internal and external customers
good,"Coming from a mix of sales/customer service background to strictly dealing with cold-calling new clients, I soon found myself looking to a different field of employment. Commissions are the only way to make significat gains on one's earnings, that is, commissions granted after an astronomical amount of sales have been generated."
good,being an agent for allstate would be a good choice as long as you go into it without the aid of private silent investors.
good,My day consisted of answering inbound calls about claims. I learned the importance of a good work life balance. The best part of the job is feeling like you helped someone.
good,Easy to learn policies and programs. Easy to work with people and arrange schedules.
good,"I liked the fact that it was a big office and agent had more than 35 years of experience, therefore exposure to learn and advance my knowledge was possible."
good,They don't care about the employees. ALL the chairs look like at some point someone peed in them. They stopped the pay raised and then you have to wait a YEAR for a pay raise instead of every six months.
good,I review qualifications for insurance guidelines for 15 states. I've learned basic insurance. The management is all about making sure we all succeed. Most of the co-workers are friendly. The hardest part of the job is learning all that information and trying to apply it when insurance changes everyday. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping the people I can.
good,"Great training classes, very corporate driven. Always consistant and professional."
good,"Even though you are hired based on experience, you are treated as if you know nothing and are starting from scratch."
good,working for this company was good...great pay...no vacation or sick days...not very family oriented
good,"Time is money!  Great job for people who can sacrifice the majority of their time.  If you want to see your families and want to make a lot of money, look elsewhere."
good,A great brand name in a very competitive environment. Get used to change and adapt quickly. Take the opportunity to gain additional skills and develop one social networking skills.
good,Ok.   Not a whole lot to say about the office I worked in.  I feel if we had more good leads we would have been more successful.  But hey it is the insurance business
good,Work and Life balance is really good. You are asked to do more but could be compensated for it! Better to keep to yourself as some people have a high school behavior.
good,"Ok place to work"
good,"Need to work in more fast paced environment. This agency also has a staffing problem. No room for advancement. Would like to have a better position, this is why I'm looking."
good,Allstate was a great company to work for but recent changes are impacting the employee morale and culture. Recognition programs have been cut and long term employees don’t feel valued
good,Worked in this environment for a short period of time. The staff was nice but the boss was misleading. Not good if you have children and not flexible for scheduling!
good,"highly energetic work environment, management wants to see you succeed so they are always giving incentives or try to make fun ways to reach goals, mostly positive work experience"
good,I was new to the insurance business.  I do feel the hours are long and PTO time is almost non existent. We get 5 days a year for the first two years....period.  No sick etc.....and we can have 2 unscheduled days off a year.  So if you are sick you are expected to come in.  I am sure it is not like this at all agencies.  Each agency owner can probably make their own rules.
good,Was not a high-stress job.  Management was willing to teach me what I needed to know and willing to give me time to get my feet under me.  Each day was interesting and it motivated me to do my best work.
good,"I have overall enjoyed working for Allstate, but there are more cons than pros. It is a corporate company with limited focus on the employees. You are treated like a number to them."
good,"The environment was competitive and your success depends completely on you. The job is dependent upon sales. The training was very thorough, but my manager was awful"
good,"People are nice, but if the needs change and you can be replaced by someone who produces more, you will be.  Even if its not your job. Hardest part was never knowing what was going to be an issue next.  Its a family owned business, anything can be the new thing, life insurance, rental insurance, needs change constantly."
good,Allstate offers about 20 days of PTO and benefits. Health insurance is subpar. Compensation could be better. Time keeping  not lenient at all. Workload is intensive and not forgiving.
good,"Typical work day involves generating quotes, cold calling and answering customer questions. I learned a lot about the auto insurance industry as well as home owner insurance."
good,"Very Busy work environment and no other comments. on a typical day at work, what was learned, management, workplace culture, hardest part of the job. ."
good,"Miss paying for some jobs often. Many jobs which I completed did not get payment, I need to check the payment bill every time. if I didn’t make checking, I will lost the payment."
good,"Good company to work for depending on the owner of course! Their goals are unrealistic specially as a team, if everyone is not going to be putting in the work."
good,leads provided are not good leads. software is clunky. the agency's owners and employees are very helpful. this is a busy agency that needs people with several years of experience to handle complex workflows and complex situations.
good,Working here was not a horrible experience.  The manager is the daughter of the Gent. She s god at sales but not  very aware of the other duties og agency.   Guidelines and duties were ever changing.   THis was kind of a last ditch effort to stayin th e business
good,The only constant at Allstate was the huge changes that are routinely made without notice. From pay scale to hours and everything in between. It was hard to feel stable when every month there was a new change or shift in the norm.
good,it started out fun making sales and accomplishing goals but due to poor upper management the culture of the office changed. as well as the compensation so the job started to be more stress for less and less pay.
good,There were several fundraisers to help the community. There was also good team building skills provided through training classes and hands on activities.
good,"I actually like the type of work I do, the work itself isn't stressful. It's the lack of sound structure/some leadership and continued manual mgmt of demand/workload that does. The company offers a pretty decent PTO bank, benefits (for the most part), and opportunities for advancement do come, but aren't plentiful. The pay and/or performance reviews could be higher. I want to stick around & be hopeful that the top execs will see the importance of what our department does & actually invest in the loyal employees who give it their all everyday vs. Having a new hire class every quarter or so, hiring mass amounts of people who don't stick; increase the range for performance increases and show good faith that ypur people are valued."
good,Working in a Local office is different than working for the call center. I loved going into work and speaking to our prospects on the daily. I will miss the freedom that you have while working in the local office.
good,"Loved working with my clients."
good,Only had a 6 month contract term. Not enough time to get a feel of how their employees felt about their positions long term.  The corporate location had many employee perks from what I recalled.  Very good cafeteria available.
good,"I think Allstate has lost the focus of this industry being a customer driven industry. Getting to speak with an underwriter was impossible. However, the agent  I worked for was great."
good,My position was tempory.  I worked from home. I worked in the community going door to door sales. I spoke with my manager on the phone.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people.
good,"average company, average management, good location, culture needs some work, some managers need to go, hours of work at head office are fine, expect to work long hours in the field"
good,Allstate is a great company to work for if you know someone to help your development and growth into different areas of the company. A lot of good training opportunities to stay relevant in the insurance industry.
good,This was a great place to work.  The staff was friendly and the owners were good.  they made sure all staff was knowledgeble and committed to the insurance profession.
good,"Good company to initially gain experience.  The workload may get overwhelming depending on the amount of staff.  "
good,Please confirm that your information is correct.
good,Great entry level job in insurance industry.Pay could be much better and training can be a lot better.Very high priced insurance lots of cold calling.
good,"Had Allstate offered a better job, I would have taken it.  It wasn't the most stable environment, but it was pleasant.  The company is very well established."
good,When you start the day you check the voice messages. You do the call audit. Go through the mail and help customers such as getting them the best quote that they can get.
good,"productive company , learned allot about estimating , culture was good . Most enjoyable when team meetings  and gatherings to meet everyone you worked with"
good,"As a part time employee making appointments for insurance, I learned about insurance and met alot of gret people. I sent quotes and learned about upselling customers."
good,I have no qualms with the company or compensation but I had poor management experience for the last 4 years of working with Allstate. The immediate managers seemed to be promoted for being high performers but not for the leadership skills they possess(or lack). Senior management relied heavily on front line management. I was extremely unhappy with the management and ultimately left the company because of it.
good,Allstate is very much a high pressure sales work place. Although they have a great training program it does gear more towards sales and not a service or relationship with customers. They don’t give you the holidays off especially during Thanksgiving as a long weekend.
good,"The work is intense and can be  overwhelming,  Benefits are good but pension not so much You will never be  on top of this job, The company demands so much as do the customers.  "
good,"The Allstate Corporation is one of the largest insurance providers in the United States and one of the largest that is publicly held. The company also has personal lines insurance operations in Canada. Allstate was founded in 1931 as part of Sears, Roebuck and Co., and was spun off in 1993"
good,"What can I say, this is a full commission position selling life insurance and secondly financial products. With the focus on life insurance, there was a lot of travel to client homes for appointments.  Underwriting seemed strict and process was drawn out so commissions seemed to come slowly."
good,"A typical day at All State would start with a morning strategy meeting. "
good,"New policy quotes, Office Operations, Office Administrations, Payroll, Schedules, Bank Deposits, Policy Payments, Office Errands, Account Review and Overrides"
good,I don't recall it was a contract position from a while back which was through an IT staffing company not necessarily directly through Allstate themselves.
good,"I worked at two different locations and the only benefit was the job advancement to a location I desired to live and that was about it. The events that were put together were great, but they lack employee support unless you're into pleasing people and bowing down to the manager."
good,it was a good job. took calls helped customers out with products. alot of meetings they were in the middle of a continuous improvement movement to help improve areas of the call center but some items took a lot of research and time to see the benefits of all the efforts.
good,Outside help was needed on a regular basis to handle the caseload and conflicts.  There was an extensive amount of travel because of the need to cover several counties.
good,I learned a lot working for Allstate. You get paid differently depending on if you work for corporate office or an independent agent who can potentially pay you what they want..
good,"Good place to work, opportunity to grow you career and develop especially for entry level talent. If you are at mid level management it’s easy to get stuck with minimal room to grow."
good,The agent that I worked for was a great guy.  He would take his time to educate the new hires.  This job is the type of job that fits certain types of people.  I wasn't happy sitting behind a desk.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Allstate.  It was so long ago.  "
good,This company relies solely on a certain type of business making it hard hard to reach your high targets provided by management (whom have never done the job)
good,"This was a very faced pace call center with a very high call volume. Continuous calls, short breaks with 45 minute lunches. High expectations with overall quality."
good,I work for an agent so my opinions about Allstate do not apply l have no experience with Allstate at a corporate I have no opinion regarding Allstate at a corporate level.
good,"office dynamic sucked because coworker was dead weight, yet tenured. onboarding was a pain in the butt, and the salary and benefits didn't make it worthwhile either."
good,"I was not there very long, worked for the agency not Allstate directly. as far as I knew the company was great to work for. Left this position to take position at Kemper"
good,"As a risk assistant, the work flow was never too intense or demanding. Very understanding management.  No real micromanaging.  Overall fun experience."
good,"Allstate is a good place to work if you're prepared for extremely busy days. It can have its moments, but its rewarding to help out customers in their time of need."
good,"Allstate is a ok company, not existing anymore after a while. i would like to challenge myself and find a new opportunity so i can contribute more for the new company"
good,Overall it is a good job but it get's very busy and a lot is expected out of you. There are many responsibilities and follow and with customers form writing new policies to services existing ones.
good,Allstate is a decent company to work for but every agent manages their office independently and differently. Therefore it is difficult to rate and compare experiences.
good,You have to be good at Sales. Can learn alot about insurance and property. A good field if this is what you are interested in. Unfortunately it is not for everyone.
good,"Was left to my own devices all week, when offering up work experience to schools, they clearly hadn't planned out any productive activities for us to do. Was given a sheet of JavaScript and told to code it."
good,administrative asssitant is pretty much a laid back job but the dealings with customers is what itruly  love . im  people person so thats great for me .
good,This company is growing in Charlotte.  It has overall good benefits and job stability.  Main jobs available are for claims and sales and service.  We are starting to see some IT jobs move into our area as well.
good,I was in competition with the auto broker who also had a Series 7 license.  The location of the office was nearby.saving driving time.  The office environment was casual and friendly but still very business   oriented.
good,"The head Agent was a great person with lots of ambition. However, the workload was overbearing and sales was more like a meat factory. I did not like the competitive nature of the office"
good,"I loved working for Allstate very relaxed and not micromanaged job, I truly  enjoyed working for Allstate and would like to work for them again one day"
good,The hardest part of the job would be dealing with some of the staff. Customers were never a problem. I was always very good at cold calling and telemarketing too.
good,The people are helpful and friendly. They provide in house learning and training that will expedite your growth and improve your experience in insurance sales and service.
good,"I enjoyed the flexibility at working at Allstate and the hours.  The only problem I had was, many time I would be left alone in the office, without any assistance,"
good,reviewed policies/ gave customer service to the clients/insured the customers assets were properly insured. I handled the the payment cancellation list as well.
good,"As an agency owner, requires a lot of self-discipline and patience. There is no limit to how much you earn as long as you are willing to work hard for it."
good,"As a roadside assistant it can be very tedious one day and slow another. This job is similar to Uber or Lift because I am an independent contractor, and I can work on my own hours. I am taught how to fix a vehicle on a basic level such as tire changes, jump starts, and gas refills."
good,"Allstate wasn't the worst, but I definitely wasn't the best. The pay was very low and they finally raised it after they realized it was horrible. I went out on maternity leave and they did not like that at all. Was treated very unfairly after I came back. I ended up resigning because of the way things had changed and how I was being treated."
good,Allstate offers for certain positions and departments the opportunity to work remotely from home. For certain positions with the company this is an added benefit if the individual that avails himself of a flexible work schedule is capable of working independently.
good,"Depends solely on your agency environment.  Company willing to adapt to marketplace.  Within agency you are kind off stuck."
good,"I would take insurance payments for clients,Also would give Quote's on Rental and Home Owner's Insurance.Also make Deposit's to the Bank on a Daily basis.Also i would open and closed the Branch."
good,"Meet the needs of internal and external customers. Organize, tab and input medical bills and records. Conduct follow-up calls to legal offices for injury status update. Run national databases for investigation purposes. Answer inquiry calls."
good,a typical day of work would be having morning meetings and discussing new changes which often were not followed through with staff or manager. People close minded with changes.
good,"I liked the office and the people, but it was hard trying to sell a product that you had little training on. I got the Allstate U training, where apps did not work and your expected to do the course in a flash. If I had to do it over again, I would like to be hired as an agent assistant, learn the ropes and then move on to being an agent. Maybe I just look at insurance sales differently?"
good,My time at towers watson I enjoyed. Management was good.Location was at Mt.laurel NJ.I thought the salary could have been better.The telephone process may been a little more condensed.The phone script we used was fairly effective.what more be said.the hardest part of the job was getting used to the people you had to deal with iin terms of having the right patience level required .was helping people secure the coverage they needed.
good,"Poor management, large workload and low salary. Salary was not equal for the amount of work required on the job. Manager was very hostile to employees."
good,There was never a system in place to motivate the sales staff. The compensation wasn't great enough and they as a corporate entity did not invest in us.
good,"Allstate is good at its core competency... insurance. When it engages in other financial products, the company falls short. Not a bad place, just not for me."
good,When I was hired they told me I would get referrals from the agencies.  I did not find it easy to work with the agencies.  There are some really good people that work at Allstate.  I just couldn't get them to make it priority to refer me business.
good,"Call center environment, laid back, friendly coworkers, overtime available during holiday season, paid days off (attendance policy is weird) slim opportunities to advance"
good,"I always had something to do, thankfully it kept me motivated in my own way and not only that but working for allstate helped me build alot more character."
good,The work environment was nice and pleasant.  The work itself was fast paced but you knew exactly what was expected of you.  The managers were awesome.
good,Typical day of work entailed assisting customers with their insurance needs.  Training was available and required by Allstate management.  This was a very small office; the hardest part was cold calling prospects from a list that was out of date and most of the information was incorrect.  The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with our clients and servicing their account.
good,Pay fluctuates. The Agency Owners are heartless and out for only money. They dont acknowledge you u less you are a top seller. The only Pro is you can get your P&C for less than $100 through the company of you are employeed.
good,Good company to learn the insurance side and grow. Training was great. Get just enough information to understand the role and job. Typical Call center environment.
good,"I lost my job for no fault of my own due to ""company Re-structure"" then offered the ability to re-apply but if hired I was start at bas e pay for the position I had been an expert in for years - No Thanks"
good,"High pace work with expectations that didn't seem to match the pay."
good,I am a home based worker...do not mind working from home...but you have no opportunity to advance within Allstate. After 4 years...I want to move up and without moving to another city or state.
good,is a good company to work with but it is not very flexible with days off. the company's culture us outstanding. benefits are great. the call center has multiple hours to work during
good,"Took payments from customers in person and over the phone. I would follow scripts, perform filing duties, and provided data entry. Answer phones and did phone solicitations."
good,constant call taking 
good,"I learned a lot working in the insurance industry, this is a very competitive business, you are constantly fighting to keep your customers. I enjoyed the time I was in insurance and glad to be out of it."
good,Sales and service of agency book of business. Included claim service along with customer counseling of insurance issues. Also had to run the daily administration of the office.
good,"The best part about Allstate would be the work/life balance. However, the management would be the worst part. I feel it's deteriorated over the past 5 years."
good,"I worked in an office during the summer. I managed closing duties, closing statements and made sure customers gets what they need. Also organized documents."
good,"Many office duties,  Walk ins, phones, payments, I enjoy helping people. mailings, cross-sell quotes."
good,There was a lot of down tie. i was able to get a lot of things done because no body was ordering a lot so i had nothing else to do. Management was horrible.
good,An average day in claims for auto is working on settlements with customers to be able to get them paid for their total loss vehicles. I learned that vehicle values differs by how a personal keeps up their vehicle and its based on actual cash value and not a retail value. The people that I work with are great. The hardest part of the job is the confrontation with customers to assist with explaining the actual cash value. The most enjoyable is being able to reach that customer who is really happy of being able to take turn a traumatic experience and assist them getting into another vehicle.
good,Interesting place to work. Lots of options in the financial services area. Lots of options in the commercial insurance area as well. Although wish they had an option for group health insurance for agents staff.
good,"Long hours and have to work weekends to catch up.  Good company, but very stressful when you fall behind with claims.  Not much guidance from upper management."
good,"•	Owned and operated an Allstate insurance and financial services franchise."
good,"Allstate has great benefits and I feel that the company as a whole is good at offering a good work/life balance.  There is SO much favoritism and unfairness as far as promoting the right people.  You only get promoted if you know the ""right"" person.  Not because it's deserved.  I feel they lack direction and unfortunately that impacts the employees negatively.  When issues are brought to Management or HR, there is clearly retaliation.  It is too bad because Allstate employs some pretty good people, but this is not leveraged at Allstate.  Favoritism always trumps merit.  I have seen so much ugliness in my tenure and the benefits are what keeps me there."
good,"Investigate, confirm coverage, determine liability, establish damages, report status and negotiate the settlement of injury claims. Upon completion of the investigation, channel the vehicles to the appropriate options for vehicle damage repairs and determine claim related damage. "
good,It was nice but didn't work there for very long and they decided they didn't need the position anymore. Personally not a huge fan of cold calling and ended up doing a lot of that.
good,Typical day at work was meeting customers or body shops writing very detailed and specialized estimates and having to find parts knowing that the customers and shops hated having to used recycled or aftermarket parts. Most of the job was balancing the customers wishes with the body shops with managements. Making everyone happy was the toughest part while keeping very high performance goals.
good,I converted from contractor to perm--so the interview was through temp agency--worked for them for a little over a year--proved myself and was hired--
good,"""Emotionally draining, lots of long hours, schedule dependent of the need of the school so you could have few or short breaks"" (in 7 reviews)"
good,"stressful work environment that did not build teamwork"
good,"You are dealing with peoples insurance, so the customers are not really friendly because they want better deals. The work environment was good, but the customers are sometimes mean and disrespectful."
good,Great Supervisors and coworkers. I enjoyed my time at Allstate Insurance because everyone felt like family. We ate lunch together most of time. Received many gifts from my bosses and they were very nice.
good,"Answering phones, some filing and running reports.  Following up with paperwork that is needed for home office.  Then sending corrected paperwork to the appropriate office."
good,Everything is great about work and loved it ! You have the opportunity to learn to better yourself. To grow as a inside sales producer great company !
good,Agent-owned insurance business.  Owner and employees were supportive and helpful.  Pay was very low to new in this environment of work.  Great to work with customers who needed help understanding their policies.
good,Allstate was a good training environment. Staff was friendly and always there to help when you had questions. Managers care and want to help you succeed.
good,"Typical sales job, But feels slow for advancement and no benefits "
good,Its Good experience to start a career in insurance sector but remote chances to progress in order to advancement of career. Very strict in rates & rules regulation.
good,"The staff is underpaid, and there are no benefits such as medical or retirement. Difficult to help clients when you can't speak to someone directly to get answers to their questions."
good,It was a job to make ends meet with long training and no room to advance. I did get the opportunity to understand how auto and home insurance is rated by area which determines your price that a customer has to pay which over priced.
good,it wasnt too fast but it was only because my agency was new. overall no complains besides no pay day for sick days which is not what im used to since my previous agency did pay those.
good,I love working at Allstate. My manager and coworkers are awesome and I learned a lot from them. There is a lot to learn at Allstate being they are very strict on their rules and regulations but they give you all the answers at your fingertips.
good,"Processing claims, answering inquiry calls. Working work ques in order to make sure that claims are closed in a timely manner. Helping out with catastrophes whenever possible."
good,"When you start you own Allstate business the help you by giving you a stipend of $5,000 a month. The rest of the money you make is through commission. I is very hard to make ends meet unless you use your own money the first 2 years till people know where your agency is and your type of service."
good,great place if you like a quota every year. The customers are great its nice to service real people. Too much stress come the end of the year.........
good,Working at Allstate is all about the people you work with.  Some teams are awesome and you would willing stay with them for a long time while other teams make you miserable.
good,"job, was very stressful, very routine and some managers, were like robots, not caring about the amount of calls, we had to take everyday, or how rude and indignant, some of the customers, were."
good,"I've been hurt by this company. They lack of effort they put forth into their franchises is shameful- then since it's the franchisee business, they can do what they want."
good,Enjoyed it when I was there but was more of an  Independent spirit. There was a conflict of Interest at the particular time I was there I had P & C Licenses and they wanted me to give them up working in Corporate.
good,the qa dept is in the process of a reorg now that corporate has come in. New changes are anticipated. The changes to be made will be very good for the department
good,"Assist customers with their insurance needs on home, auto and life insurance. Being able to quote customers and give best comparison. Learning to communicate better with different people."
good,I have worked for Allstate up until recently and loved the several different agencies that I worked at.  You have the potential to make as much or as little as you want to put into it.  They take care of their customers and employees.
good,Nice first job. ok pay. Had play too many games to get ahead. Work there in the mid 70's when management jobs started opening up to minorities who were barred in the south from working there in the 50's and 70's. Hopefully that has change by now.
good,The products offered by Allstate are the best in the industry.  They tend to set the standard with regard to new products.  The competition is always playing catch up.
good,"nothing to rave about it was just a job, no real opportunity for advancement and rates were too expensive so it was hard to sell as much as managers would like"
good,"It a good company to work for each agency has a different owner, I had a great office owner who care for her employees however for me I want a change from the insurance business,"
good,"Being in the sales field for many years I found that the particular agency/agent that I worked for was not a happy person, therefore it made working there unhealthy! I was a great sales agent and always met quotas but she was a people person."
good,Working at Allstate call center you are on the phone answering calls from clients requesting information on new insurance quotes.  Working at your desk in a call center environment.
good,"Relaxed business work place. Hard to deal with the corporate aspect of the job often though. There is no grey area with them, it is black or white when it comes to common sense."
good,"Working at Allstate as a whole was great, but new management is horrendous and the lack of management skills was very lacking.  "
good,"Nothing special. Easy job, easy training. The most enjoyable part was the check. Gained more experience in computers and microsoft. Gained experience in business calls and got reasonable break time."
good,"Local office not enough room for advancement. Loved working locally and developing trust with the community.  Personal connections with the clients is important to me,"
good,"Difficult to move off the phones."
good,"Was a great gig but had its hiccups. Promised a lot in the beginning, slowly took away over time, like an open source day where we got to learn whatever we wanted every other friday (promised at beginning) but took it away over time. Management dwindled until it was a free for all they didn't even have the managers in the office. They make judgements based on other people in the office because they are in chicago while you are 5,000 miles away. Besides that the culture is super relaxed at our office (CompoZed Labs in Tempe) even free breakfeast. If you don't care about career advancement, want great benefits, relaxed environment, ability to use new technology its good. They are making a big change to open source tech. The freedom was great."
good,"Great staff. Good customer service. Great clients. Laid back environment. Agent is very nice, and helpful. Made sure we got what was needed to do our job properly."
good,Great management who cared about their employees. Great place to learn how to be an adjuster. I worked there too long ago to give a proper review. We worked in a bullpen and shared a computer.
good,"Everyday was usual, can be competitive with other coworkers when commission based. how you get paid or treated as a valuable employee really depends on the owner of that location."
good,Insurance can be a hard industry.  I think you make w ay more money by being an agency owner.  I really liked their system and customer tracking software.
good,"operate 3 or more computer systems at once uploading paperwork for the insured"
good,"Competitive, Good work place, Education savvy, Professional"
good,Allstate provides excellent training to all their employees. Health benefits are good. Generous Paid time off. Auto dept recently downsized. Disappointed that so many people had to either transfer or take a severance package.
good,Allstate has good PTO hours and benefits they are really good with allowing you to take your time and borrow against it most positions are open Monday through Friday.
good,Customer Service in Both Insurance and Annuity ends of the company. I Loved being Customer Service and the Insurance End was my favorite. But the distance from Wisconsin to Vernon Hills was too much.
good,proactively process member request for roadside .   Build rapport with the member.  Making sure the customer stay in safe location while getting assistance
good,"On a typical day, we always would get new defects coming from ATSC (Allstate Technology Solutions Center) raised by Customer Agents using Alliance, our application, and would analyze what would have caused them from a back-end perspective and then figure out a solution to each one of them. The workplace culture was manageable though, since there were many processes that kept changing, especially with the documentation, sometimes it would be difficult to keep up. The enjoyable part of the job were office events."
good,"Working at Allstate was very stressful. I could not move up in the company. You had to work  a lot of hours just to get a good check ."
good,good starter position . not family friendly . schedule  requires lots of flexibility. salary is not competitive with others in same industry. great for someone with licence.
good,I don't have anything to say in regard to this company besides that it was a part time opportunity until I acquired a full time job in another company.
good,"Same as G & S  they are the same industry."
good,"Check mails and reply."
good,"Office was closing so a lot of people left and it got kinda crazy. "
good,"My typical day at work includes coming in and reviewing how many claims i have for the day. Usually i will see 6-12 claims per day. I learned plenty such as the subrogation process, the in and outs of a home and how to negotiate with insured's."
good,"They pay at the average and they make it known.  Good place to work, flexible work from home, lots of opportunities across the entire company.  Work culture is good, nice ping pong table."
good,this is a family oriented company to work for.  They are truly great and I would recommend anyone to apply with them.  They show they care about their employees
good,There were no issues with work.  The schedule suited on what I was looking for.  The leaders were accommodating and the place of work was fair and relaxing.
good,I recommend really researching the agency to work for. As they all are independent   owned and operated the experience can vary from office to office.
good,"I basically just made cold calls for four hours a night three nights a week. It was fun and nice to unwind after classes getting paid to just sit and call people, but it got lonely and I got bored."
good,Insurance is a cut throat and noting is ever enough. The push to continually make sales was too much pressure.  If a client decided to cancel the staff received a deduction is pay.
good,I am not going to disclose any information in regards to the job information it was a great company to work for other than that I will not disclose any information
good,"I was a 1099 contracted representative so was not eligible for any of the considerations listed"
good,"Again, this has been far too log to remember this job. There should be a time limit on having to review past employers. I obviously cant remember very well from this long ago"
good,Great working environment with a great staff to work with. The agency owner does anything for you and for his clients. Great people to make the days seem less gloomy.
good,"While I was not directly employed by allstate, they were my primary customers while I served in a consulting role for ACS and Xerox.  I was the senior IT staff and worked very hard, but the work was always very rewarding."
good,"Worked on several jobs initially, brought on by marketing for a specific project which worked very well, afterwards just 1 project for years. "
good,"I enjoyed working at Allstate however there is continued worries about if your job will be shipped to India and you will no longer have a job. "
good,"Great place to work at with the community in Racine county. Learned a lot about insurance industry. Answering telephone calls, taking payments and entering data in computer system."
good,"I enjoy physically helping others, this position did not offer much of that satisfaction for me. I felt at times I was in a selling game, competing with other companies."
good,"ASPL is an average pay company."
good,I made phone calls primarily to remind people to renew their insurance or to wish them a happy birthday.  I only received one death threat.  I only worked here one summer in high school.
good,A typical day at work depends on if you work as a customer sales rep or sales rep and who the agency owner is. I learned that the company cares about sales numbers and not really what's important like what ethics and customer care.
good,"If you think it is balance, well think again.  I feel like a minority and I am an American.  Way too many people from India over here and you wonder were the American jobs are going too.  It's an OK place to work for but it is really changing, the cheaper the better for labor.  The American dream is gone and they only care about the stock holders.  Too many layouts, RIF's, what ever you would like to call it.  Morale is low and job security is out the door these days."
good,"Was promised that ""hot"" customer leads would be provided and that they would be interested in in purchasing insurance. Instead, I was provided lists that consisted of 3/4 people who were a wrong number or had no voicemail, 1/4 that went to voicemail, and 1/4 who answered, half of which hung up right away"
good,lot of US influence and it seems sales rules the world.   focus keeps changing but they innovate qquite a bit.  IT runs the place so things are slow.   HR is also very slow - or at least was
good,Great people to work with and flexible work environment. Salary is very low though. I have been promised a lot of things that didn't happen when it comes to pay and opportunities.
good,This company cares about there employees. There are definitely technology improvements needed. There are many positions in this company that would be a good career move.
good,"assisting customers with payments on their insurance accounts. "
good,Great friendly working environment. This is a growing company that provides a family friendly environment.Upward mobility is greatly encouraged. Good work environment.
good,"I did enjoyed to work on the insurance industry, I did learn about auto, home insurance."
good,Big company. Unfortunately they have cut Compliance a great deal over the years and negative results are showing.  The culture of cost cutting in compliance needs to change before they can turn the corner.
good,It's fine for anyone looking for quick work to do to pay bills until something better comes along. It's up to the individual to decide for his/herself.
good,Allstate is a good place to work.  It teaches you a lot about the industry and allows you to learn different areas of insurance all in one place. I would recommend it to others.
good,"great place of business. pay is good. benefits are a plus. job has extensive training that teaches the basics. most things are learned on the floor. However, there is no work life balance."
good,Nothing really to say about my experience working there. I didnt really think it was a good fit for me. Just not a good overall experience for me. I was placed on a terrible team.
good,"Allstate is a good company to work for. They give you opportunities to make a great income, while providing tools to succeed. Allstate has a strong company culture that provides you with a good atmosphere to work in."
good,My time at Allstate has been challenging at times but I've been reward as well. I've gained the experience in dealing with customers and educating clients on their home/auto policies. I'm also leanered a great deal on coverage's for home and automobiles.
good,"The work load was challenging on a daily bases, but it was decent pay with opportunity to learn how to be an agency owner. I was able to hone and sharpen my tools of the trade. I gained insight from a professional that has been in the business for over 20 years. I had an opportunity to learn all sides of insurance, not just sales."
good,"Jail you are not allowed to leave the building for lunch w/o authorization you make you can not bring umbrellas, only see through everything even food containers, vacation and holidays you may not be able to take off. The power would go off and the backup lights would not come on.  Sewage leaks from the ceilings. "
good,"average - this was my first office job and  I was grateful for the opportunity. Management was open and helpful - lots of opportunities to grow, lots to do, big office, no windows, nice location"
good,"An insurance company that has a wonderful and charismatic CEO with a great sense of humor."
good,"Talking to clients over the phone daily, scanning and faxing. Have to double check all documents to make sure all forms are filled out correctly, signed and dated. Calling home office for questions, payments or to get more information about a policy. Confidentiality is a must. Confirming appointments and rescheduling. Data entry for new clients and to keep database updated. Work day goes by very quickly."
good,"I am not working in this company."
good,"Adapting to a new environment within the same company."
good,I had a hard time with the work-life balance at this company.  I don't know if it was just this department and the company at whole.  I wasn't really happy at this company.
good,Opportunity can be awesome with the right tools. Be prepared for advice to be given that may only work if you have unlimited financial resources.
good,The company and its services are good. I belive in the products I sell. The disappointing part for me was the lack of back office support and the careless for customer service.
good,Allstate had the BEST environment and they made going to work absolutely painless. They always had tons of activities going on to keep the spirits high. Call time was stressful but overall it was a great place to work from the beginning. The commission was great at the beginning but toward the end of my time working there they started changing our incentives regularly.
good,It was okay to work for. The agencies are owned by individuals. It depends on the owners how good a place it is to work. Good luck finding a good owner
good,"Selling Insurance, in an office setting, customer service, paper work, Banking, Learning and implemeting new Company guidlines, as well as Michigan InsurNCE lAWS."
good,"Great company to work for! The corporate culture is work hard, play harder. If you are able to make sales, you can increase your earning potential. Some office are individual owned so each office might not reflect the corporate culture."
good,Each day was a unique and enthralling experience. I got to complete different tasks with other individuals. The job required me to have strong problem solving and communication skills. I gathered invaluable knowledge and experience.
good,There are tons of goals and cold calling. You must be on your toes at all times. There are lots of laws that change all the time and you must be up to par with them all.
good,"I was responsible to run the insurance company except payments, greet customers, answer phones, and respond to clients about there claims."
good,"Allstate is a nice place to work with a good environment, but can become exhausting at times and make you feel micromanaged. It's a good atmosphere with a lot of kind people."
good,"Open the office"
good,i enjoyed working at allstate but i was unable to pass my test on the 1st few times for the state licensing and doug told me that i was no longer an emplyee for it.
good,"demading fast paced environment where employees are constantly being asked to improve processes and be adaptable. "
good,A good place to work. The job is easy and well paid. My problem was the people I worked with. The job itself is fine. If you can work a job and not care about what is going on around you then the job is fine.
good,"Great work life balance, good 401k and pension however low salary compared to other firms. Not much room for advancement in my position."
good,This job was vary good for me because I can talk to other and I am vary good at communicating with people of all races and color I quit this job do to moving to charlotte nc
good,I only worked there for 2 years.  The job was great for me at the time in my life.  I had 2 young children.  I decided that I needed to be at home my children.
good,"Normal day at work consist of answering telephones and assisting insured's with payment. Making 30 plus sales calls, accepting quote for customers. My co-workers are a great work family, I enjoy my coworker we all get together. The hardest part of my job is maybe keeping my anxiety down on making sure that my sales are in and the all my referrals are in, and CLAIMS if they are not going to the way to insured is wanting it can definitely be stressful."
good,I came in as a temp so my job position of transferring was easy. The worst thing about the job is that it isn't loyal to employees. At any given moment you could lose your job.
good,"Great work atmosphere and people. The job can be demanding at times. However,  having the ability to help people in their time of need can be very rewarding."
good,"For me it was very boring. IF you love staring at a computer all day, then its the ideal job for you. my day consisted of comparing numbers all day long."
good,The work itself is not difficult. However; the new office management has a micro management philosophy and continually demand more from their employees in an already high pressure environment. Over the last 2 years perfection is expected from imperfect people so it is virtually impossible to succeed.
good,"I worked for AF for nearly 3 years. Since I left, there have been many changes and most of the individuals with whom I worked were part of a downsizing."
good,Building a network of individuals in business in order to find those who are seeking to become an Agency owner. Utilized different job boards as well as current Agency owners to find potential candidates.
good,"The leadership is spotty pending on what department you are in. Once people start working there, is seems like the majority of them never leave. A lot of the employees have only worked for Allstate their entire life, which is a good thing and bad."
good,Making Sales calls as well as helping customers make changes to policy to try and help save money. Great way to learn how to sell and meet new people. I enjoy the flexibility of my job.
good,Overall a good job lead by a good manager. Everyone there is kind and was a nice work experience. If I was licensed in insurance I would have stayed.
good,Good place to intern while in College.  Pay is average.  Staff is very nice.  Able to have a flexible work schedule.  Additional training is made available.
good,"Evaluate and negotiate bodily injury claims"
good,There were no growth opportunities in the department I was working. However for the most part still a great company to work for. They could improve on their upper management.
good,Great company to work for and great training. There was lots of options for growth and even an opportunity to move in to management positions.
good,Great opportunities and introduction to the insurance industry. My experience and all that I learned set the foundation in professional growth that has carried me throughout my 18+ years in the industry.
good,"Answering 80-100 calls a day filing claims or assisting with claims already filed. Set up methods of inspections for vehicles. Authorizing rental set up for customers. I learned patience, how to deal with all types of customers, how to do different areas dealing with insurance."
good,"Great work environment, learned and experienced a lot. I take advantage of what I was taught there and put it to use of my every day daily life."
good,Overall I really like working for this company I feel that I have a secure job and the company is always trying to approve.
good,"sales, sales, sales, insurance, insurance. its commission driven. it could be stressful,but also very rewarding for the right person"
good,I enjoyed my time at Allstate. My only complaint is that management does not always nurture talent. Great work-life balance and good people to work with.
good,"When I get to work I go over my e mails that come to me over night and then I look over my task list that I made that night before to see if I need to move or change anything. and then I start plugging away"
good,"Being the first point of contact in a life changing, stressful situation and turning it around is what makes me love what I do."
good,awesome company to work for. I allow growth opportunities. great co-workers. great environment. good pay. benefits.
good,I really enjoyed working here. It helped mold me into a dynamic Sales agent. I was able to perfect my skill set. We were given the opportunity to focus on sales which is not common. I also enjoyed helping customers.
good,"Small office with high turnover. Small town feel and your clients personally come in, makes for great client repore. Commute stinks."
good,Good Source for finding Employment. all recruiters are trying their best to get hired in a company. I really like the way they work and serve their clients.
good,I was impressed with the job advancement opportunities to all employees. I was able to work on my own schedule and work closely with y clients.
good,"It was a good job to start in the insurance field. Great experience and the environment since it was a small agency, it felt like a family"
good,"Work at the insurance office was basically sitting all day making payments for clients insurance and verifying types of insurance we had. I learned a lot about all the different insurances there is to offer; from house insurance, boat insurance, life insurance, etc... Management was very nice but very strict."
good,"Dictation, filing and mail distribution.  The most enjoyable part of my job was helping people in need.  Management was really organized and compassionate."
good,"Name recognition was helpful with competing for business."
good,"As I worked in a small work environment, it was a simple balance.  There were four people in the office and we worked together with all of the company's policies and procedures"
good,It was a ok job until they wanted to push me it was my first job in the field and I was taking my time on jobs and they wanted to push me when I had no idea on how to do some of the assignments
good,Most people have all been there fir years and hard to advance.  Not a bad place just not going to move up once you get in.Not much alse to say other than that.
good,Excellent managers. Counterproductive corporate culture. A lot of this is made up for by the fact that the job actually pays quite well for something at the entry level.
good,I worked here for 17 years before being laid off in 2010 due to outsourcing of our jobs.  I loved my hours 7am to 3:30pm working at a desk processing insurance policies.  I made many friends over the years and it was a shame when the people began being laid off.
good,The bad part about this job is if you did not know someone in upper management you were not getting any promotions. The job has poor management
good,This company left a lot to be desired from training all the way to your tools to do your job when live on the floor. This job wouldn't have been so difficult to bare if they gave proper training and supported there employees with the tools to do their job.
good,New learning experiences and varied task in performing various jobs. Worked in various departments and supervised 20 or more employees.
good,It was a great team oriented team to work with. Everyone has been very supportive and we are all like a great little family.
good,Allstate was ok as a contract employer. I did not see much of the company with either assignment.  I did what I needed to do.
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. The office started to get crowded as the company grew and it was more difficult to get to know the new people. There was a lot of variety in what I did each day, ranging from the monotonous tasks to new projects that were challenging and exciting."
good,I gave my review of Allstate in my previous page.  Over all I enjoyed working there with great people.  The job was only part-time so I never had the opportunity to advance like I did at State Farm.  There was really not an office manager because there was only three of us.  We just all worked together as a team
good,"A Typical day is the phones are ringing off the hook."
good,wasn't the best atmosphere allstate is big they don't have to pay as much because people already know them no risiduals low commission high hourly
good,"I was a customer service rep for blue cross and blue sheild, i was working there for almost two years. i loved the inviorment."
good,Take incoming calls to assist with member insurance questions and fill refill requests. Also facility medication shipments and replacement orders when necessary.
good,Very competitive but every day is different. Most of the day you prospect and make calls. I had to spend lots of hours calling.
good,"Comfortable workplace, however it is all about the numbers (sales) and the customer service position requires sales which is something surprisingly discussed late at around the 7-8 week of classroom training which there is not specific training for. You can do great in all other metrics but if you are not selling you are not part of the ""IT"" group and a great deal of stress comes along with not knowing if your going to keep your job or not due to sales. The best part of my position was servicing the customers and feeling accomplished in assisting them with their inquiries."
good,A typical day for me is answering every phone call that rings in the office. I am the first person that someone hears on the other side and could assist them with everything. I was also responsible to have all state required documents turned in on a timely matter. Sales was also another area that I was in charge of doing and conquering. I loved the people I worked with.
good,I learned almost all of my insurance background from starting at Allstate. I had an excellent coworker that I got along great with. The training and knowledge I learned here allowed me to move forward with my insurance career.
good,Allstate is okay but it just has so many rules that makes it hard for a person to right for them and some of their companies agents are very conniving at times
good,"I enjoy claims. I would prefer better compensation but, the work life balance is definitely do able. I wish their were more opportunities in the part of the company I work for which is a subsidiary of Allstate"
good,"this was a new company, they just opened whenever I started working there, over all it was a great job, but I prefer to have a job with more experience under their belt."
good,"Too much emphasis on numbers and not enough on the customer. Morning meetings start to sound like a broken record, hearing the same thing over and over. A lot of work and little rewards"
good,"I was able to learn and grow to enhance my career. In addition, I made some lasting relationships with co-workers.  Working for a captive insurance company gave me insight on how different companies can look at the same coverages differently."
good,"I liked it there, it was just too far. My job was easy and the atmosphere was friendly. All projects must end, though and they didn't hire anyone on permanently afterwards."
good,"A typical day at work is helping customers understand their insurance coverage's, billing issues and educating them on how to better protect themselves' and their personal property(s) and the most enjoyable part of my job is being able to accomplish these three aspects of my job each day."
good,Property and casualty with a little bit of life insurance. Mostly prospecting with no residuals. Not a good company to work for unless you are the agent of record.
good,Allstate has good benefits and pays competitively.  There is opportunity to move up in the company.  Allstate provides all the tools needed to do your job well.
good,Long days. High production quotas. The compensation was fair. Good job working with great people for over 5 years. Fun partys.
good,"Worked for an agency - tough to make any more than 40 grand a year. Hours were flexible, agent was great. Decided to become an agent myself."
good,It was a very difficult job that takes a lot of time management and patience to help people.  It's hard because people have expectations were sometimes you cannot meet.  at the end of the day if you cannot handle people being angry with you this is not the right job for you.
good,"Very helpful, happy co-workers, I learned a lot about insurance that I didn't even know like statistics on accidents, claim experiences, and the software. Actually finding people who care about getting new insurance is quite tough."
good,Improved communications skills by obtaining and communicating with new clients.  Learned how to use insurance programs and technology.  Most enjoyable part of the job was talking to a vast array of clients.
good,"The person that i worked with would talk about other externship people behind their  backs, i found this to be a turn off when thinking about applying for a job."
good,Difficult to grow within an agency since they are owned by small business owners.  Great place for new high school or college graduates to work at since it helps build you as a well rounded person.
good,"Good flexible job, 9 to 530.  Not much micromanaging but hitting sales goals and staying on the phones trying to reach to as many people as possible is the key to success."
good,Allstate is a great company with great employees. The work environment is good and its a team atmosphere which made going to work daily easy and enjoyable!
good,"Funplace to work for someone just starting out in the world, No real chance of advancement. It feels more like high School."
good,"This was a fun place to work due to close family-like atmosphere although with a small office the potential was limited.  "
good,I very much enjoy my work environment and coworkers but I believe I'm ready for a more fast paced environment. I like being able to be one on one with my clients and offering my knowledge.
good,"media room, large break area with TV & ping pong; plenty of space to read as well.  very clean and super friendly staff.  overall a good place to work"
good,"In order to do my job you must be self motivating, a team player, discipline and adaptable to change. The hardest part of my job is having to be seated for long hours. Being on h computer for hours long processing insurance can be straining to your body.  I find myself having to move around maybe walk away from the computer for 5 minutes just to get my mind and blood flowing."
good,I like working with the manager shes really hands on. a typical day in the office would consist of.  Working on invoices that had come in the previous day
good,"Overall the environment it positive. Benefits are good, vision, health, and 401K. However depending upon your boss your individual experience can vary greatly."
good,"Great Place to work, culture is fine team environment. Managers always look out for their employers. On a typical day of work we deal with customers from all culture and assist with different needs. "
good,"I enjoyed working here for the most part. It was interesting learning about insurance, preparing for my future at a young age and having a better understanding of how insurance works"
good,"Provided leadership, implementation, coding, troubleshooting, monitoring, and analysis on as project coordinator on internal software and information systems projects related to agent-consumer interface for the 3rd largest personal lines insurer in the country, a $32 billion company with 37,000 employees."
good,"this was a job that was not for me, I did not like working in the insurance industry it is not for everyone. So I decided to go back and work in customer service that is more my type of job."
good,Great work environment. I was there for over 5 years. Great development programs as well.
good,"Call center/"
good,"I believe that the Express operation of Allstate Insurance Companies, is a good place for entry level employees to learn the basics of personal lines automobile and property insurance claims.  There are opportunities for younger employees who are willing to relocate."
good,Allstate is a great company to work for.  I learned a lot from this company and would recommend working there to anyone.  The people are great.  There was a great work/Life balance in my department I was able to work from home 2 days a week or when the weather was bad.  I enjoyed working for them.
good,I worked for a agent that three offices. Started out as the life insurance rep in the offices. Then I moved to selling P and C insurance in all of the offices. I enjoyed working for the group and may have stayed if the agent would have payed for reoccurring business.
good,"I worked very hard at this position and moved up fast in this company,"
good,it was very long hours and constant work I handled claims and answered phones I worked with Microsoft office and Microsoft word as  well
good,"Answer Phones/Customer Service/scanning/uploading documents to computer systems/making changes to policies/E-mail, fax, voice mail/ distribute incoming mail, payments/ billing etc..."
good,I learned a completely different type of work at Allstate.  I enjoyed the co-workers and it was a comfortable place to work.  I was pregnant at the time and they worked great with me during this and letting me come back after giving birth.  I worked here through a temp service.
good,"I enjoyed my two years here and other than the lack of benefits, it was a good place to work."
good,"This place does not have much of an advancement unless you have a degree, they really don't take in to consideration the experience you have. Management still has some developing to do, seems like they are never on the same page, every manager will give a different answer for the same situation. The hardest part of the job would probably be that they set high expectations in providing customer service but want the reps to complete claims in a timely manner and at times disregard the customers need vs what the company wants."
good,always find out if theres room to grow and what are management's expectations.... co-workers are great.... learned thru the insurance school.
good,"To secure a challenging position that will allow me to utilize my educational knowledge in order to motivate, inspire and encourage others while learning a variety of innovative tasks that will ensure my work experience, professional skills and dedication to becoming successful along my career path."
good,"Typical day at work consisted of contacting current policyholders to discuss current policies and try to increase policy coverage/premiums; Contacted policyholders regarding payments, late payments, and cancellation of policies; Met with policyholders and new business to review policies or write new policies."
good,"Working in an agent office for the first time is very demanding on your personal life, overwhelming when it comes to following strict guidelines and laws that are too numerous to learn and absorb all at once and leaves an employee feeling over worked and underpaid. Cold calling with a speed dialer or manually will require that a producer feel very comfortable with the phones and talking to strangers with a wide array of questions/comments and concerns. Cold/warm and hot prospecting will require that a person be able to establish trust very quickly while focusing on selling everyone. The hardest part of the job is being left in the office alone in the first 6 months. The best part of the job is attending Allstate's University Training Program!! Those folks can train and entertain for hours on end and combined with the snacks and laughs, you hardly feel like your learning!"
good,"It was an okay place to work, nothing special. I gained a great deal of experience here."
good,The company was okay to work for but the pay was not the best at the time.
good,"Allstate is a great place to work, but it seems like it's going to ship all the development work overseas to reduce cost."
good,My first foray into the insurance industry was informative and a learning experience.
good,"Allstate provides a fast paced, challenging work enviorment. Everyday is different and offers new ways to stretch your thinking."
good,I came in at 8:30 starting taking 99.9% of all phone calls. When customers would come in I would greet them and assist if possible. My favorite part of the day would be interacting with the people that came in to make payments. I managed mail and also filed paperwork.
good,"Brief Job in which the upside was the ability I had to service others and provide assurance of several sorts. A typical work day was very fast paced with clients in and out. Although my biggest joy in any work place is providing a positive outcome to any problem, I realized that that cannot always occur. That being said it does not stop me from working every angle possible."
good,"The office environment was casual, the people were great and the work/life balance was ideal."
good,A typical day at this office included answering over 80 calls and assisting both walk in and scheduled clients with their insurance needs.
good,Good company to work for small offices mild stress environment
good,"Selling limited products in a heavily regulated state at rates that are non competitive isn't the best business model, but that's what Allstate does."
good,Working in allstate I learned how to speak to people that I have never met before. I also learned how to compose myself in a professional environment and how to be organized.
good,Shortly after I left the company the man I worked for retired. His office is no longer in business
good,Good workplace received good experience in the insurance industry
good,"License service rep, cross sales about 40 calls daily, service policies"
good,"Wish I had more opportunity for growth!"
good,"Allstate Benefits is full of opportunities.  The company is thriving and is very stable, even through the recession."
good,As I am currently working approximately 26 hours a week and feel I have helped agent succeed I look forward to trying a new venture.
good,Taking calls all day to service the customer's policy. I have learned about what products are offered and make changes to policies. Co-workers are very relaxed and laid back but they get the job done. Hardest part is adjusting to the new work schedule. The most enjoyable part is helping others.
good,Working at Allstate has being one of the greatest experience in my life. I had the opportunity to work with nice people as well as interact with the customers. I had the opportunity to develop my communication skill such as speaking by phone as well as in person.
good,Allstate's main focus in claims is outstanding customer service.
good,"Overall, it's a great place to work. The only complaint I have is the constant expectation of handling other employee's workload, with no additional compensation.  It is frowned upon if do not willingly want to constantly handle your workload and someone else's.  Not fair at all."
good,"Typically I get to work log into my dialer system and place calls all day to get customers to want a rate quote. We have no dress code, or certain quota to meet nor a script to read."
good,"Great first job, learned a lot about the insurance guidelines which helped me with my service writer position."
good,"Really not a bad company to work for very large with many corporate offices.  the training was excellent and really helped me develop my skills.  "
good,"Extreme work loads, with little advancement.  The turnover is quite high making it hard to get real momentum going."
good,"The atmosphere was fun, I loved the opportunity I had to help those who called to file claims in need. Although I always received great feed back and all 100% scores week after week, it seemed my team leader was plotting behind my back, and always seemed to smile at me, but then would do things against me, even other employees would speak up on my behalf, especially when it was something putting my health at risk, but there was no support, I was never in a team picture, and could not use my redemption rewards that I earned by my hard work. I take away experience and a respect for others in a time of tragedy and being able to help bring a smile to their faces when they need it most. I would love to work for the company again, just not in an office where everyone grew up on the same street for thirty years and they fear outsiders are a threat."
good,There are many processes in place and they are followed to make things very structured.
good,I worked there for 3 years sold over 10 million and was not treated well at all. I would say that it is a great place to get training and move on.
good,It was great when they let you run your business. Not so much when they started to interfere.
good,Great benefits.  Allstate gives their employees lots of gifts and trinkets.
good,"Good company to work for the only issue is the lack of work, life, balance. Excellent training, compensation is decent with very good benefits."
good,A typical day consists of a lot of telemarketing and service calls. Not very many inbound calls. Everyone works closely together as it's a small office. The hardest part of the job is to keep finding new business each month to meet your goals.
good,"hours 830a - 530p Monday-Friday"
good,"Working with my brother and learning sales, and customer service skills"
good,"Great opportunities"
good,"A rewarding, but stressful job that pushes you to work harder to meet goals and objectives. It is a position that asks a lot from you, but with the right attitude and determination, you can succeed."
good,"The people and the management I work with are fabulous!  A typical day for me is answering customers inquires correcting errors from other customers service reps and LSP/  Extreme Billing issues, PIP questions, Writing and binding my own business. Selling, Gathering paperwork for our welcome package, RMBC follow-up with hidden drivers. good student discounts, ALL endorsments, WSR- web service request, Scanning all paperwork into e-agent . Basic office procedures, end of the day remits and banking."
good,"Responsibilities:"
good,I liked the atmosphere but didn't work their too long so really don't have too much to say about it.
good,Ok place to work - depends on the agent. Hardest part is getting leads and dealing with ridiculous co-workers - usually good clients. Underwriting can be difficult and they have a lot of rules that do not make since.. but that's insurance right?
good,I worked here before there were computers so I am certain that the position I had then has changed dramatically since then.
good,"A typical day includes receiving inbound calls which vary in scope from sales, complex billing and explanation of current coverage for mainly auto and homeowner's policies."
good,Enjoyable experience. Quickly developed from a customer service representative to a confident sales producer.
good,"Answered calls in an inbound call center "
good,"We sat right next to another agent, so calling was hard because I could hear everything the agent next to me was saying."
good,"A typical day at Pilot Catastrophe is early. Starting with a review of my files, and new files I sort the need of each family going by the most damaged or unlivable circumstances. Throughout the day I learn how to apply a new coverage or critique my writing into another files coverage. Management is pretty smothering, constantly making new rules for self satisfaction control issues. The hardest part of my job is the constant battle of not having days off or being able to take time off. No benefits, or employee incentives. The part I enjoy the most if helping people. I have the ability to recover what was lost or place the customer in a new standard of living that best meets the needs of there families."
good,Answered incoming customer calls to service and sell property and casualty insurance and to take care of their existing needs.  Upsold coverages whenever possible.
good,"Relaxed family atmosphere, flexability, customer relationships were enjoyable."
good,Pushed empowerment which helps you grow a lot personally.  You take about 75 to 100+ calls per day.  The challenge is that the industry is forever changing which means you have to stay on top of things and do things like review state laws and what's allowed and what it not allowed.  Very challenging but keeps you on toes and you don't have time to become complacent. A good thing about this job were the motivation techniques and incentives for doing your job.
good,I learned a lot of administrative skills and appreciated the opportunity.
good,Enjoyed my time there but no benefits. I did have a lot of free time to market and sell
good,Staying in front of new people on an everyday/week basis. Prospecting to find new leads and or prospects never seems to get easier.
good,Very nice place to work. I've learned a lot about insurance service.
good,"Overall perspective is that benefits and vacation (PTO) are above average standards. I learned how to work in a diverse culture and was able to meet a lot of good people. "
good,"Great Place to work."
good,"I learned better time management "
good,"The job is split up into either day or night shift. The employers allow you flexibility in your schedule, since it is a commission-based payroll. I get to leave at least an hour early, so I can get home before dark, which is great, and it's only on weekdays. The only thing is, it's not easy to get a sale over the phone, but it's easier when we have good deal closers at our side!"
good,"The current position held for Allstate is more project based than career based.  Although Allstate seeks to provide a work/life balance, they are aggressively moving toward an automated/globally staffed workforce."
good,"Ok company to work with, they value older agents and don't offer much support for new agents. /."
good,Great experience. I learned a lot about insurance claims. This has helped me with my own insurance policies
good,"-Greeted customers, performed general office duties, resolved inquiries and directed to appropriate associate.  I conducted communications via telephone and face to face. Inputted data and processed information into the different computer systems, forms, etc. Took payments, filed, printed, faxed, scanned, and transmitted various documents. I communicated with vendors and service representatives. Promoted and sold various Allstate products when needed. I produced Certificates of Insurance for Commercial Companies and serviced Auto and Homeowners policies. I offered an all around office help and completed any tasks assigned to me."
good,"Allstate was a great place to work for most of the 18 years I was there. They had really good benefits, pay and a good balance of work/life. Over the last 7 or so years, they began outsourcing much of the work. This began a reduction in force that finally trickled down to my area where 58 of us were let go in July of this year. But for the first 11 years, working there was like working with family. Management cared about the employees and people enjoyed coming to work. We were rewarded with time off, team outings, snacks brought to our desks and fun meetings. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the outsourcing and watching your co-workers lose their job. The most enjoyable part of the job was always being busy and never being bored. I learned how to work with many different types of people and personalities and to accept people for who they were and what they brought to the job."
good,I work hard at everything I do and I provide excellent customer service at all times.
good,"I enjoyed work. I learned how to be professional, coworkers respected my experience and each other. The hardest part is trying to satisfy all the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is satisfying the customers."
good,"I only worked for Allstate and few months in college for extra money.  I was just an office assistant so I wasn't very hands on in the company.  The people I worked with were great, however."
good,"The company is great overall the benefits are very good, the pay is competitive, the people are nice, love dealing with clients. Do not like their is no room for advancement"
good,"Unless you want to become an agent someday, there is ZERO advancement and/or health benefits that I am aware of.  There are some agents who you don't want to work for, and there are some who are generous and wonderful bosses."
good,Good company with good family morals i worked in claims processor not able to grow within the company is the reason i decided to leave
good,"On a typical day at Allstate, I answer incoming calls from 35 states in the United States inquiring about property and casualty insurance. I help build policies to fit their need and set up the policies for them. I have learned a lot about insurance and what is covered. I also was getting assistances from my managers on developing my leadership skills to advance in the company. My co workers and managers are all great people and everyone gets along with each other. The best part of the job was all the incentives that were made for selling. The overall atmosphere was positive. Unfortunately the direction that this corporation has decided to go in does not fit this current center in their future plan. All sales and service professionals, managers and any employee working at the Woodridge contact center is being laid off in August."
good,Responsible for cross selling Auto/home clients with Life Insurance/Financial products.
good,Manages 13 Project Managers. Part of the PMO and involved in various PMO processes.
good,Data entry and proof reading. My department does not have a good manager. I learned about insurance.
good,all around good company
good,typical day at work I pre-screen
good,"Took claims over the phone through a custom software, with the insureds and explain the process. I learned about how insurance really works and some laws. The hardest part was not being able to help past my limited ability. The most enjoyable part was that I helped people all over the states."
good,"I love the customers and the people I work with. A typical day is spent mostly on the phone; taking payments, explaining coverages, selling policies, cross selling, doing reviews, solving customer problems and complaints, and helping customers with claims. I get my health insurance through my husbands work and he is now eligible for Medicare so I need a job with health insurance."
good,Long hours sitting reading documents off screen checking off records etc. very tedious
good,"I can't stand my work schedule, 11:30a-8p is horrible and we work EVERY Saturday. It would be nice to have at least one Saturday off a month. Team leaders are ok, it appears that they don't do much at times. Lots of overtime opportunities, but its never mandatory. Attendance is really strict, no sick days. Calls can get hectic at times and can be back to back all day. Little opportunity for promotions. My co-workers are nice and willing to help. The manager over the whole claims dept. is really nice. I think we could be paid more."
good,Overall Rating ***
good,"Learned alot about insurance and how it works as far as getting claims paid and working with actual agents. Nice coworkers, great lunch cafeteria."
good,being able to build trust of the customers to assist them with their everyday needs
good,"learned a lot of different parts of the job, loved interacted with clients, wished I had more support with the office being a team player"
good,Hel[ing people is great! The staff needed more manners but otherwise the job was alot of fun. It is easy to get attached to the patients though. It keeps you busy.
good,After 11 years working at Allstate I learned a lot. I worked my way up from opening mail to working the hardest policies and saving customers.
good,"When I first started working there the pay, benefits and job duties were ideal. Three years later and my pay had been reduced by 40% and my job duties had increased significantly. Job advancement opportunities are slim"
good,"Typical day was fast paced and interesting and the day went fast. I learned to deal with all types of individuals and management was very flexible with each employees needs. My co-workers were kind and accomodating and helpful in all aspects of the work environment we all worked together.The most difficult part of the job was to stop working at quiting time, you wanted to stay and make sure everything was completed, that's what I was used to doing. The most enjoyable part of the job was when it came time to take time off as I had a months vacation every year and I always looked forward to my time off. Another enjoyable part of the job was various contests which affored you to win prizes."
good,not able to get promoted unless you know somebody that know somebody
good,"Allstate is not a bad company to work for. Only problem is low pay, and you have to deal with many headaches. Biggest problem is the managers Mico managing everything you do. There is about 100 list you have to do every week and your manager will be over your shoulder all day long."
good,It's a fun and fast-paced office. It has grown in size in the last 3 years.
good,enjoyable - advancement potential. stable employment. diverse work group.
good,A typical day with this company involved inbound and outbound calls. The job requires a quota of call for a day. What you will learn from the job is patience. Management does the job required to maintain the business. The hardest part of the job and meeting and maintain service quota. The enjoy part of the job are the company outting and celebration provided my the company.
good,"I great place to work, lower pay for a lot of work. talk inbound the majority of the day"
good,The enjoyable part of my job was being the top producer and being an asset to the team and creating the utimate client experience.
good,"Ok company, not for sales. They need to change the rates because a sales producer will starve!"
good,I work Monday through Friday 9am-1pm. We make cold calls to homeowners selling security systems.
good,"short staff, company gives all additional more work instead of hireing the full staff needed. Companys Next Gen computer system has driven 1/2 of older staff to look elseware for employment."
good,"Online appication then phone interview which is just ""why you want to work here questions"". I declined to go further when she discussed pay. 29k a year"
good,I enjoy the people I work with. I enjoy my customers and working in insurance.
good,Customer service
good,Good people but can consume your life. Everything changes and never is the same. Rules and schedules vary for corp. and agencies themselves.
good,"When I applied I was excited to work for a company with a big name as Allstate. Paid training with benefits starting right away is great! They pay for your licensing and have a very good welcoming and spirited team. The training is way too long...and by the time your on the phones you forget half of it. You then must sell a certain amount of items per day to graduate which is fine, but you get about 1 call per hour and half of them are transfers and the other half of the people you're quoting dont qualify. So your sales ability and charisma are somewhat hindered by the process. It's more of a game of luck than anything. A typical day at work is again about a call an hour...you're sitting in a cubicle all day and just waiting. You'll get a bit of a rush but since I've been on the phones...it's been EXTREMELY slow. I have though learned a lot during this down time because they do provide tons of material to educate yourself, I will give them that! Management is good...no complaints. The people I work with are nice, and the enviroment is relaxed and fun. I'ts a great job for someone just getting started, needs a job, or someone who is maybe getting close to retiring. You're not going to make a lot of money, even if your a top producer. Then again a lot to me is $60,000 and above but maybe 2% of people including management make that. The commission structure is really weak. You have to literally sell more than half your calls and get multiple items to make decent money. I recommend this place for single people with no family or kids, and people looking to break in to the Insurance"
good,"Solid P&C company with excellent marketing strategy, great claims and customer service"
good,I am currently a Senior Claims Representative
good,"Strong company,making an astronomical amount of profits every year, however they accomplish this by cutting agency owners commisssions & benefits. They also are creating ridiculous underwrtiting criteria for auto that are forcing people to look elsewhere for better rates in these harsh economical times! Very difficult to maintain 100% retention. Also, outsourcing the 800# for any company in the USA is virtually the ""kiss of death"" reagardless of cost savings."
good,"Small business and rather new while my employment, manager helped"
good,Friendly place to work. Sold insurance products. 2 person office.
good,"Reward people (trips or monetary gifts) for going beyond their duties 😊."
good,"Pay is low, but is commiserate with customer service type jobs. Back to back calls and you are expected to stay until all calls are taken, true customer service call center environment."
good,"Allstate subcontracts their office to small business owners who then have to meet sales, retention, come back goal each quarter. If certain agents don't meet goals then they will be let go at a moment's notice. It's a great environment to work in if you are a born salesman but for your day to day worker I would not recommend it."
good,"I worked in Subrogation."
good,"Good Medical and Dental benefits"
good,ever changing environment and rules; hard to keep up with all the changes; management isn't the greatest about coaching and the training isn't up to par
good,"If you want to work 12+ mandatory hours a day, including weekends this job is perfect for you. Absolutely no work life balance. Unattainable metrics causing high stress and low morale in the office. High-turnover because industry competitors are paying thousands more.  Direct management is cool, but upper management/corporate do not care about their employees' well being.  They only care for shareholder and they make it very obvious. You can easily make good money here but expect to be overworked. It is a good place to start your career within the insurance industry without a degree, gained a lot of experience, good training, just don't stay here for too long."
good,Great benefits but long work hours. My job was a salary position and worked from home. Work assignment thru computer system and I scheduled my daily appointments with customers and commuted from home to various locations.
good,"The pay here is minimal but the work life/personal life balance is great. Job security is great and PTO is great. If they paid more, I would have stayed; however I'm making over 15k a year more  doing the same position at another insurance company. That was just to give you an idea of how much less they are paying."
good,Exciting but casual work environment. My favorite part of the job was the flexibility of being able to do outside marketing. I am a people person and mostly enjoyed meeting customers outside of the office since we did not have a high walk-in ratio. Hardest part was meeting my personal goal each month. I always set my standards high and strive to meet them.
good,Top producer at the agency will max at 65k annually if you produce 40k a month in new revenue like I did.  Capped.  The agency owner I worked for gave a $13 per hour salary plus commission.
good,The company became so successful that I felt that management become extremely numbers driven. I understand the need to stay on top but at some point in time there will be a break in the growth cycle. Plus hiring employees and not monitoring their work initially led to a situation of spending half of my day fixing problems created by other employees.
good,"I enjoy working for Allstate. I like my manager."
good,Allstate is an okay place to work. The pay wasn't that great. I met and worked with a lot of good people. Good professional work environment but can be stressful at times
good,This is a good company to build a business in Insurance.  Had opportunities to grow in the business.  Getting people to buy insurance products and keep there business.
good,"·	Responsibilities: Processed Premium Payments, Reconciled Deposit Log, Endorsements, Policy Reviews, Answered Phones, Filing, Scanning, Follow Up, Building Relationships For Leads"
good,"Makes changes on a regular to rules an regulations.  Unlicensed Agents are provided with sufficient pay, but not the hours if hire for part time.  Extra hours are available when there is a need.  Over all not a horrible company if you need only part time hours."
good,"Allstate is a great company, with great products to offer. The products sold themselves, so it was exciting to educate new clients on everything as opposed to trying to sell it to them."
good,"This job is stressful with a lot expected of you. However, they pay well and have great benefits. If you have any serious health conditions, this job is not for you."
good,"Promise all kinds of field support - some territories have some good managers and can really add value and help you grow. Otherwise, they just don't care - regional office staff that has been around since the turn of the century are actually pretty good - new style is awful - they don't want to work."
good,Company needs to put more marketing effort in the area of financial solutions - too concentrated in P&C for a financial specialist in most cases to perform well.
good,Limiting opportunity. I work alone half of the time.  Operational details are strict.  Not a collaborative environment.  There is no growth.  No investment in greater customer base.  Retention over growth.
good,"Decent company to work for.  Would avoid the claims department in Roanoke, VA, the leader there is a moron and the environment is toxic.  All other areas of the company were great - great people, great support system, decent benefits - extra high health insurance deductibles though."
good,"•	Managed daily retail branch activities; review and prepare monthly budgets, sales and operation reports."
good,"Standard office environment. Slow paced and relaxed. Room for growth in sales, and opportunity to make more depending on your dedication to sales. Only a couple people in the agency, so very quiet work place. Each agent is different, just have to find one who's management works with your work style. Some are great some aren't."
good,I enjoyed my time at Allstate in Auto Total Loss. It was fast paced and constantly changing. I enjoyed the managers and training I received was helpful.
good,When I started at Allstate it was a great place to work.Unfortunately the company started outsourcing. This led to added stress because no one had job security.
good,"Love the very supportive, caring, and kind people that I worked for and with, but there wasn't enough work being put in by a lot of the staff. Pretty unorganized and inefficient. I also know I was promised health insurance and other benefits (such as a work laptop, etc) and didn't receive any. I kind of felt like I was hired on false pretenses."
good,"Relative normal day working for an Insurance Company. I did enjoy helping people in time of need."
good,Worked with Allstate agents to solicit sales. Assisted in training and marketing Allstate products. Cold calls to customers with agents. assisted agents with installing Allstate processes.
good,"Currently Allstate Insurance is outsourcing all policy processing jobs. I had been with the company 7 years when my first position was sent to India.  Since then, 2 other positions I held have also been outsourced.  They also know when and what jobs are going, but never tell the employee's til it's time to dismiss them."
good,Revised management every couple of years made working at Allstate unpredictable.  Allstate has good people working there often running uphill.  After 12 years I needed a change.
good,Call Center work environment that is no longer in place. Not a bad place to work if you don’t mind sitting in cubicles all day long answering the phone.
good,"When you work for an agent your advancement and salary increases are very limited. Also, you have to worry what will happen to your job if your agent goes out of business, retires, or dies."
good,"As an exclusive captive agent for Allstate the perks were OK, you don't really own a business in this industry, the business owns you.  You are responsible for everything and have to have deep pocket and unlimited resources to be successful as well as competent support staff and agents."
good,A difficult position to hold (LSP) if you don't have thick skin. Not much structure for advancement and no benefits provided. More involvement should be had with corporate in terms of offering benefits to it's employees
good,"I started my career at Allstate, and am grateful for the experience I've gained in the company. That said, like other corporations of its size, Allstate is slow to change and difficult to influence.  The leadership team means well, but execution of change initiatives is poorly managed at the mid-management level."
good,"No room for advancement. Great place to work if you want to stay in the same place. Family environment, good for people starting off their career. If you want to advance your career then you will not fair well here. Only so far you can go without flat lining."
good,"The general consensus within the claims center is always that Allstate used to be a great place to work.  I was there for three years, and people before me and after me said the same thing.  They implement questionable improvement strategies that focus on all the wrong things for actual improvement.  They claim to be transparent, but it's not always true.  They did offer a lot of fun activities and moral-boosting events.  I did love my job, and if it was the same as it was when I first started, I would go back in a heartbeat, but due to the many changes they've made, I don't think I'll ever want to return to the claim center."
good,"I was in a salaried position. With that being said, there were times were we had to work additional hours without pay to complete tasks, but the salary was higher than my last position. The schedule was much more relaxed, as well."
good,"great management, diverse culture, the hard part of the job is no insurance at all and the pay sucks, it is a fun environment and professional, meeting people and educating customers was satisfying"
good,"Great benefits, overall great job training.  Allstate is an established company however the work atmosphere is stringent, inflexible and does not allow for a healthy work life balance."
good,"Allstate has all of the tools necessary to help you learn the business.  The base salary while getting started is pretty low and the amount of time it takes to ""fill your pipeline"" with clients can be hard on your pocketbook.  There are a lot of agencies in a small demographic so this adds to the challenge."
good,The agency is not as busy as I expected. I learned new insurance products like commercial line and life leads. This agency does not provide health benefit and very minimal commision.
good,"Company consists of independent exclusive agents so management styles differ. "
good,"Great work environment, must be able to handle sitting at a cubicle for 8 hours per day and answering phone call after phone call. Difficult to get used to sitting, but rewarding to help customers."
good,I have worked in the insurance industry for over 15 years and the most enjoyable part of my job has always been the people; customers and coworkers.  It's difficult to enjoy your job if you do not like the people you work with.
good,I enjoyed working at both of these companies. I learned a great amount of information and gain extensive knowledge in insurance. I am appreciative of the opportunity.
good,"No training. "
good,"Much movement in the company, some good, some not as forward thinking. Direct management is important, as is the VP level.  Senior management is often in flux."
good,"It was a fast-paced environment where it was beneficial to work quickly and efficiently in order to complete all tasks and help the clients. I took phone calls and went over coverages, billing, changes etc with the client while also trying to build their portfolio such as trying to obtain more business. The management was fair but they set the goals high in order for the agency to thrive in the very competitive insurance market. The culture of our agency was good as we all did work hard to meet our objectives. The job was enjoyable when a client was thankful for the advice or service provided to them. On the other hand when you work really hard for a client and they still give you a bad review or do not heed your advice even if it is in their best interest added to the frustration at time."
good,"Allstate is a fast pace work environment and you have to be willing to learn and accept change. The hardest part working for Allstate is listening to the sad stories about customers property being damages due to storms, fires, car accidents etc. The most enjoyable part is being able to resolve a customers problem."
good,"Overall, Allstate is a good place to work. Some business areas give you the option to work from home full-time or part-time. However, I noticed a shift to make it mandatory for employees to be physically in the office."
good,"Daily cold and warm lead calls for sales; customer service daily, regarding policy review, renewals, claims, increases in premiums, etc; over looking of 3 support staff and daily review of follow-ups and retention progress; absentee agent... daily office update; attempting to meet monthly sales goals for the agent and separate goals for the Company"
good,"You will love working here if your already a knowledgeable experienced P&C agent otherwise it will be h3ll to figure it ALL the guidelines you have to submit and memorize and follow. It's a pretty good company under the right ""Agency owner"" otherwise it's not."
good,I have enjoyed working for Allstate for the 2 years that I have been here. The experience and education received will carry through with me to all of my future endeavors. I mostly enjoy the volunteer work that we are able to do through Allstate.
good,This company was very friendly and fun to work for. The work itself was difficult and could sometimes be mentally draining but this was very successfully counter balanced by the great !management and friendly coworkers which functioned on a very high spirited moral. Managers at this company worked closely with their teams to help keep moral at its highest which then relayed into the work creating a great customer service environment.
good,It is an okay place to work when the product is competitive within the market. Little to no advancement opportunities for agency staff no matter how long you have been the organization.
good,It is a typical office environment.You come into the office and the work is there.The Staff is present and there.There some elevators and vending machines.
good,"Worked individually to close insurance policies (home and auto). Would prospect, cold call, talk to referrals, etc. to generate business. Little workplace culture, simple job direction and instruction."
good,"When I was there, I enjoyed the employee appreciation days where they held little activities and also the performance bonuses yearly. The benefits were good the flexibility with sick time and time off were okay as well, I did not though agree with their ever changing metrics, and updates to the employee money. Such as the sales or cross selling opportunities they were capped when before they were not and motivated the employees to definitely strive to become better then themselves."
good,My job is kind of a hit or miss.  When I get calls it is good because I am making money.  When I do not get calls it is bad because I am not making money.  It is to up and down for me and I would like a job with consistency.
good,"They empower workers to make decisions that will affect policyholders.   Schedule based on your preference, flexible hours.  Very good training and mentoring."
good,Working for Allstate was rewarding for what I needed at the time.  The work was repetitive so there was nothing too difficult about it. There were unreachable quota's that were expected with no resolution as to how your were going to reach the quota.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was communicating with the customers and serving them, making sure that each and every one  of their needs were met, using problem solving skills and re assuring that their furniture was in excellent conditions."
good,"Overall, the owner is a good person but he is never around. There is no real assistance. You always work alone,no matter what. There are no benefits of ANY kind."
good,Enjoyed helping clients with their financial planning and family protection. Typical day was spent prospecting and running appointments and communicating with underwriters
good,It was a good job pretty easy work and really good pay but management was not good and work/life balance was horrible. The people around you are great like your coworkers but management was not good they would push for transparency but they didn't have to be transparent with you.  The calls were good every once in a while you would get a rude customer but for the most part they were nice and it was easy.
good,"technically good environment environment.                                            "
good,Allstate is a great place to work for because of the atmosphere. The leadership is passionate and employees are motivated to put there best foot forward. The only downside is that compensation is based on tenure and there are many newer employees that work harder and more efficiently only to be told that there is no room for salary advancement.
good,"With working at insurance agencies, it all depends on who your manager is, my experience with this agency wasn't too good but others could be great."
good,"I have no complaints, but its certainly not for everybody. You have to be able to take the rejection of making cold calls, and be able to brush it off your shoulders when customers and prospects lose their cool. But if you can make it past that, it can certainly be a rewarding job financially."
good,Although the job is demanding if you are able to put in the time and work into it the job will be very beneficial. It takes good sales skills.
good,The company is searching for what it's identity will be in the future.  Competition is fierce in a commodity business like insurance.
good,"Allstate is a great company, will much opportunity for advancement. Co-workers are very helpful and management is extremely supportive."
good,Worked 3rd Shift. Employees were polite and Supervisors were very helpful. The department I worked in was quiet and stable.
good,The hours were good until they made full time Saturday. They also want you to made doctors appointments on weekends or any appointments period. Co workers some where nice but others weren't. The management doesnt really help you when you do something wrong. They will just fire you.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Agency, Had a large book of business. I didn't have a lot to do with the company except representing the company and its products."
good,upper management is shifted recently. Management is not technical oriented. But very good job security.upper management is shifted recently. Management is not technical oriented.

Management is not technical oriented. But very good job security.
good,"A call center.  Managers were great.  Co-workers were good people."
good,"Educate clients of their insurance needs"
good,"Not much of a life-work balance, but a great company to work for, They are really great trainers, and staff, benefits 1st Day also a plus"
good,The Insurance industry in general went through alot of changes and it was hard for them to keep up.  New systems and new ideas were implemented without testing them or thinking them all the way through.
good,"Job duties include answering inbound calls in a low volume call center. Answering phones from clients and providing assistance with a tow, lock-out, tire change, and on field service."
good,"To obtain a position as a sales associate in an organization that will provide me with the opportunity to offer exceptional results across sales fields. Extremely focused on elevating company standards, sales goals, and client expectations."
good,"Quoted Commercial, Auto and Business Policies"
good,Always productive - Always learn some thing new every day. I worked special tasks with all management and team leaders. Team work is key- Customer service is primary key. Working with a team especially after almost 20 years make the day enjoyable as we can communicate bette as a team.
good,"Allstate used to be a great company to work for. I have been there for 20 years, and enjoyed great success working for them. Unfortunately, they have made changes to their company objectives that have made it very difficult to help the average client in this area. Their sales initiatives are extremely aggressive but only in a very small area of the market. The agents are amazing, hard-working individuals who I've worked with for the last 20 years. I enjoy working with them and have always enjoyed helping the clients."
good,"This is a paid by the minute of talk time job, therefore not much stability but great flexibility. I love being able to make peoples day better by giving them a positive Allstate experience. I take live auto claims, documenting loss type/damages, current contact information, injuries, police reports/citations, inspection scheduling, all while maintaining great customer service"
good,I worked for a friend of mine that owned this business. It was fun but the personal stuff is not good for the office environment and can hurt your work performance or your chance for advancement.
good,Came to work Mon-Fri 9-5 and went over my To-Do list for the day. I made the necessary calls to follow up on leads ect. I loved the fast paced environment because that's what I'm used to. I enjoyed the people I worked with. I didn't see the opportunity to really advance and that was a big deal for me.
good,"business development"
good,"This was a great place to work, job was very flexible with family and work. I was laid off due to job going oversees. The co-workers were excellent, everybody worked together as a team environment and helped each other out when needed. I learned a lot about reconciling bank statements and the insurance side of the financial world. There was no hard part of the job until the end as you were watching very dedicated individuals getting laid off due to jobs being outsourced."
good,"I love working for Allstate, it is one of the best companies to work for, but the managment is not very proffesional. We learn new things all day, and apply them to every call we take, it is a friendly enviroment. Sitting all day though for eight hours can get annoying."
good,"As an Agency owner of a small business, I was required to wear many hats as to day to day operations of my business from sales and service of a customer base exceeding 1100 households, meeting sales goals and  maintain administrative duties, staff management, accounting, advertising, and sales strategies."
good,Enjoyed my experience at Allstate. Productive envirnoment
good,"Typical 9 to 5 office job when not the agent of the office. Asked to provide customer assistance to policy holders of auto, home, renters, and life policies. Constant phone use whether answering calls or cold calling. Was a great experience to learn the ins and outs of insurance sales."
good,"A typical day in the office is very busy.  Lots of claims and contacts must be made.  Management is very good, but the workload can be unbearable at times.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the coworkers."
good,"Management has taken a different course over the last 10 years and they no longer feel like a customer focused company.  Further, they don't make loyal empoyees feel as if they are valuable."
good,"An inclusion culture"
good,A typical day at work very calm. The job in general is every enjoyable and peaceful.
good,"A typical day at work consists of me reviewing medical bills for patients' claims that i handle. I look to ensure that the billing that is received is consistent with injuries that may have occurred in a motor vehicle accident. I am on the phone with providers, negotiate services with attorney's, and handle files in litigation."
good,Logged in toook inbound claim calls all day or part of the day worked some outbound claim calls. Learned a lot about helping people. Had great co-workers and we halped each other out with questions about work. The hardest thing was handling people who were rude on the phone or I could not give them a good answer to their claim problem. Most enjoyable part good co-workers and friens made also helping customers with their claims.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of making a large amount of sales calls via. telephone. provided personal lines insurance quotes to customers, I learned to navigate through the Allstate software systems in effort to provide excellent service and information to customers. Management and co-workers were very good, easy to work with and helpful. The hardest part of the job was making COLD! calls, the most enjoyable aspect of the job was helping people make good decisions regarding their insurance protection, and learning new business principle's and systems."
good,"Must be able to multitask and be able to work in a fast paced environment.  Customer service is number one and is practiced daily.  The workload is tremendous, so organization and dedication is required."
good,"The office I worked for, was understaffed, and the employees hardly showed up for work ( including the agent). I was given the task of sales but had to take care of customer service, because no one else was in the office. The schedule was perfect for my schedule and allowed me time off with my kids."
good,Worked as a telemarketer. Most difficult is cold calling customers.
good,"I sold and serviced personal accounts. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. Like other insurance companies, when rates are competitive its great and challenging when there are rate increases."
good,"- Long work weeks expected"
good,Very nice people and interesting business. Too hierarchal.
good,"Graded on a metric system.  Allthough you can do your job very professional, if the customer didn't like what you do for them they would give you a bad score and thus management would put you on the review list."
good,The work and personal life balance is excellent. The salary is poor but if benefits are more important this is the place for you. My benefits are obtained through my spouse so no personal pay off at this position. The teamwork is fun and the management is terrific. The position is very easy to manage and maintain and you can stay here forever as the pressure is very low. 
good,Agency was filled with young and fun employees who worked extremely efficient as a team.
good,"We have a fairly relaxed schedule, but the payment/commission schedule changes and makes personal budgetting difficult. Additional requirements from a office and corporate level are also unreasonable at times."
good,"There are many different levels of management at Allstate. Like most companies the further away from the customer the less the managers care. My immediate supervisors were excellent, as you begin to go up the ladder the greater the disconnect. They become more profit driven than customer friendly. They waste money on useless training tools rather than updating outdated systems and creating schedules for there employees that are bearable. I wish every manager Regional or above was able to do Undercover Boss so that they realized how there actions effect the customers and employees."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is talking with the customers and knowing that you helped someone.
good,nothing to say but they are starting to downsize....blah blah.....blah
good,Good Company and nice people. Offers advancement opportunities.
good,Good job if you like all commission sales with no benefits and no vacation.
good,"I would prefer not to talk about this company, the pay is not where it needs to be for the work you do"
good,"Once you begin getting your claims daily you will realize how quickly times flies from the moment you start at your desk to the moment you look up and realize the day is over.  It can definitely be a bit of a challenge to keep on top of you work with more incoming every day, and one bad day can have a trickling effect, some customers are more difficult than others, but your team definitely makes or brakes your experience in the beginning."
good,"A great place to express your creativity and customer communications skills. The hardest part of the job is the paper work and trail, but the best part is meeting new people and building a a professional relationship with a well known company."
good,Be cautious which division you hire into since some come across as not much more than a cost center that pulls from the companies core business.  If the division you are working for does not have a great reputation an individual can become stuck and unable to advance.  Based on what I heard from employees working for the core business that the culture is much more different.  My experience was working for Allstate Roadside Services.
good,Great job for people new in sales. Not so good for experienced salespeople. Pay is very low. Allstate is very conservative so don't expect to pumping out lots of policies a week. They will deny a customer quick if they don't fit the Allstate profile.
good,The typical day began with checking emails followed by Standup meeting in the morning.  The workplace was fairly relaxed and casual.  The most enjoyable part of the job was opportunity to grow.
good,"Used to be an okay place to work, but recently there is a lack of job security regarding business areas as the company continues to decentralize and relocate business units to various areas throughout the US or outsource processes.  "
good,"Great management, but very little benefits. Small office with no room for advancement. Would stay here much more long term if there were better benefits and higher pay"
good,"The location I am in, there are only 3 positions I would have the possibility to move up into.  Those positions rarely come available.  I believe that the Allstate Insurance company is a great company to work for, unfortunately I am not mobile and have not place to go upward in the company."
good,"The agency I worked for who sold for Allstate, was a good agency. I learned everything I know about Insurance and got both of my Insurance License while employed there. I believe Allstate to be a extremely good Insurance company with good customer service and great claims."
good,"9 to 5 job 5 days a week the American dream , office work , can be slow at times , not very cultural employees and management , build relationship with customers."
good,"Fun job, room for movement if you wanted to be licensed.very fast past or can be relaxed depending upon the time of year and time of day. Can be inflexible at times if no pto is available"
good,"The compensation does not necessarily match the demands of the job in terms of the volume of material that you need to be knowledgeable of on a regular basis, but there is a good and inclusive workplace culture and managers are friendly and understanding."
good,The company is a great place to work for if you have the availability to relocate. They do offer great incentives for working in the company. Down fall is they run by numbers.
good,As a Agency owner you are your own boss which is a plus.  Great way to retire after you grow your book of business because you own it.  You create the atmosphere by hiring employees and develop the culture you want.
good,"Outsourced to save money. Forced to interview for different jobs at company thanks for nothing. 10 plus years excellent yearly reviews, only offer is to return to the call dungeon."
good,I really LOVED my boss. He is the best boss I've ever had. The work isnt for me though. Super boring all i did was fill out forms all day. I can see how some people would like this line of work.
good,"Allstate Denies 60 percent of all claims in regards to home insurance.  As a Property Adjuster, it is your job to determine if the loss will be covered by Allstate.  As the policy limits many losses in regards to the home, the insureds that you contact every day are constantly yelling at you and berating you for doing your job.  Allstate is short staffed when it comes to property adjusters, so the Adjusters receive a high volume of claims daily and often times fall behind.  In order to maintain your work, you will frequently stay overtime.  Allstate does not pay well enough to maintain the cost of living in California.  The overtime hours are barely reflected on your paycheck.  Overall, the stress that you go through as a Property Adjuster is not worth the amount of money you are paid at the company."
good,"worked there 36 years, working with other was great but management was okay. I learned how to handle customers and give them good customer service. the benefits was good and the work place was enjoyable"
good,"Allstate has a great work life balance, and options to work from home. Management fluctuates, there are great managers and very poor managers. The company is moving towards many work from home and satellite locations."
good,I learned alot about p&c insurance.  I learned about the lexus nexus data base and expanded my knowledge of how a small business works.  A little capital goes a long way when investing in an agency.
good,"Allstate Insurance has an excellent work life balance however at times this gets lost by department demands. Training within the company is sink or swim methodology, massive improvement required. Salary scales are those in the below scale and individuals have to wear alot of hats and not been rewarded in their salary.  Little or no transparency regarding pay scales ."
good,"I currently work in a small business atmosphere where I oversee staff to maintain and execute daily task to company standards. Also, I market for sales, meet or exceed sales goals set by agency, and maintain office. I enjoy engaging with different customers daily and helping to educate them on different products."
good,I enjoyed working here. I a great place to start out if your in college and also if you would like to own your insurance agency. Work hard and it will pay off
good,Paid is not on par with other companies. Lack of advancement. Management is not the best in the world. Work really hard for less pay. Overall work day is not bad.
good,Each office is like a family owned business so they understand kids and family responsibility. I would recommend any office for a working mom. But because they are generally small not a lot of money or career movement unless you own a branch
good,"Good steady job - but can be slow for advancement. I liked my time there. It was good. I had a great manager - but it can be hard to move up past a certain point. They are VERY eager to encourage the more junior / entry level employees with rewards and promotions, but it grinds to a halt once you get to the manager levels. getting past manager to officer is so much harder than it should be and there is such a lack of help or direction. So many good people get discouraged and stop trying so hard. If only Allstate figured out how to motivate those individuals more (or even to convince some of those who have left to come back), Allstate would be so much stronger. The other issue is once you start interacting with the officers at the executive level, you realize everyone is in a silo doing their own thing, it also makes it less encouraging to want to be part of that crowd...."
good,"The job overall was very stressful.  The pay was good.  However, the customers were always frustrated and overwhelmed due to their accidents.  I didn't agree with their claim evaluation process."
good,"The claim department is stressful, challenging and steady."
good,"My hours at Allstate are 10:30 - 7pm with an hour for lunch if desired and two 15 minute breaks. Though the workday is typically longer due to the workload.  Management is well trained and respectful.  The workplace culture is customer centered and constantly changing to keep pace with society.  The hardest part of the job is the workload, hours and the nature of the work.  The most enjoyable part of the job is wonderful co-workers and managers.  I have learned excellent customer service skills at Allstate."
good,"This company is not a bad company to work for, but the pay is one of the lowest in the industry for how big the company is. Also at this time Allstate is on a hiring freeze. Too much work for especially the express team and not enough compensation."
good,Started in sales and worked my way up to assistant manager. Great place for those straight out of college but would not recommend making it a career unless you're planning to open you own agency.
good,I really do not want to make any comments at this time due to personal reasons... I think this was very unfair and not necessary to ask for this information.
good,"Negotiate claim settlements w/angry customers majority of the day. Heavy claims load most of the year & have to meet daily metrics on everything. Physically impossible to get to them all on time AND keep customers happy. Short-staffed, high turn-over, exhausted at the end of the day. Not paid enough for what I do. Supportive managers. Diverse workplace."
good,"Allstate provides advancement and continued education opportunities for associates who want to take advantage of it.  The company believes in investing in their employees.  The work day would consist of assisting customers during the difficult life event of a motor vehicle accident.  For some customers the event is very tragic.  Being able to assist and navigate them through the claim process was one of the best parts of my job.  The toughest part was having to deal with customers who didn't receive the service they thought that they should and would in turn take their frustration out on you.  However, I loved being able to assist the customers.  We were encouraged to have fun but not to forget the purpose we were there, which was to assist the customer."
good,I worked for an agent so not a lot opportunity for advancement but good agent to work for. Good hours and team members. Continuous learning. Face to face interaction with clients.
good,Cant really advance. The only way is to get your licences to sale insurance pretty much. Make extra money from commissions but if you don't have good leads or a lot of leads you cant really sale
good,I am a Customer Service Agent at Allstate. I service all policies after they are written and also write old customers into our new programs as Allstate rolls them out to save money for insured's. I enjoy my job I am just getting older and I truly need benefits.
good,my typical day at allstate is great I like what I do now learning how to underwrite policy's for Allstate but the thing is learning all the information and training  but the income does not meet standards I also had great experience in subrogation working on auto claims I really don't have a hard part just wanted to learn all the positions all I can. To better my career not just a job.
good,"Great place to work because of the people and lots of team envolvement... they really do show appreciation for employees , pay is pretty bad, benifits suck"
good,"It is fast paced. You have to multi-task, catch on quick, take a lot of calls. Your benefits and vacation time start the day you start and that's a big plus.  I think you get 4 weeks to start.  I've been there nearly 13yrs and I buy 5 additional days. You can also donate to charities of your choice,  these things come right out of your check.  It is very convenient.  They promote a lot from within.  My only complaint with that is sometimes it is not always the best candidates.  Theven pay isn't terrible  but it also could be better. There is a lot of micromanagemental, so if you aren't a person that stays on task, don't apply.  I love my coworkers just like family!!! Best part of my job."
good,"Working in claims is hard work. Be  prepared to learn alot and be challenged. "
good,"This is where I started my QA career, work was sometimes hectic but I got to learn a lot. The co-workers were nice and friendly and the project manger was good. Work load was more but still had fun."
good,"A typical day at work would be checking emails, getting back to customers with questions they had and problems to solve. Lots of selling and paperwork.  I learned that I enjoy understanding a product or position in order to serve the customer/client the best possible way.  I also learned that patients and kindness go a long way when handling tough situations.  I worked in a few different offices  and most of my co-workers were pleasant and enjoyed their work.  The hardest part of the job for me was sitting in an office for 8 hours a day with little time to stretch or walk around.The most enjoyable part of my day was whenI was able to help a client and make a frustrating situation easier for them."
good,Answering phone calls for agents. Using multiple screens and systems  answering agents questions about polices and company procedures. Performance based on calls per minute and quality.
good,"Difficult work/life balance due to schedule changing. Great positive atmosphere, great employees. Love my current manager, very helpful and knowledgeable"
good,not very stable work as a contractor. some days you have a lot of work and others nothing. great of someone who needs a very flexible part time job
good,"It's a great company to start a career at but advancement to move up isn't available to due company size in Charlotte. "
good,"Positive attitudes, friendly people, great people to with. great customer appreciation. Reliable, and very job oriented."
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job was the almost family like atmosphere that existed among the 1000+ employees of the Support Center."
good,"customer service, marketing and selling, management is good, I am the only agent besides my manager and the only bilingual so I do most of the job. the hardest part of my jobs is that I am the only bilingual person in the office and we have a lot of Spanish speaking customers. What I enjoy the most is the customer service part because I get to know a lot of people and I love when I feel that I did what is best for them and they thank me for it."
good,Allstate is a great place to work. Plenty of work life balance but you have to have a passion for the insurance industry or you will burn out quickly.
good,"Allstate allows you to work in other areas of the company while in your current position; which allows you to elevate your skills, experience and  knowledge and maybe consider moving into other positions when available."
good,"- Exceptional c-workers, but understaffed facility"
good,At Allstate I learned to sell and how to communicate with clients about their needs with insurance. I learned to ask the right questions to find out the right information from clients in order to find holes in coverage. I made outbound calls and learned time management. The most enjoyable part of my job was to save people money without sacrificing coverage and making people smile.
good,Working at Allstate for these past few months have been an awesome experience. The work environment is full of individuals that are willing and eager to teach and help one another to excel. I have gained much experience and insight in working with a law firm and the specific cases that they take on here. The attorneys are very dedicated to their clients and have been successful in the courtrooms. I enjoy most about my work days are interacting with my co-workers or supervisors about everyday topics in the world.
good,Upper management doesn't take the lower people into consideration. Agencies are ran independently and it can make or break your success.
good,"Allstate Insurance Company is wonderful company to work for an be insured by. "
good,"A typical day at work includes getting leads to call potential customers, and also helping with current policy holders.  The hardest part of the job is selling the insurance and dealing with angry customers when rates are increased.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping a customer through a claim and seeing them get their deserved money."
good,"Call Center environment with opportunities for advancement.  However, this department no longer exists."
good,"One major component of any successful business is a well-trained, competent work force. I believe that the quality and preparedness of an organization’s employees is a critical factor that ultimately leads to the success or failure of that organization. To excel in the modern business world, one must be equipped with the tools and knowledge to not only embrace this, but successfully manage the constant change and challenging environments inherent in the world economy. "
good,"Great work/ life balance and benefits"
good,"I worked here, started off as an office assistant, and was promoted to marketing manager once the agency owner saw my ideas for marketing. The agency was at a 72% retention rate with poor reviews, and within 6 months using my strategies, it went up to an 89% retention rate. At that point because the agency owner was burnt out in the insurance field, he decided to sell his book of business and close the agency."
good,Great company if you are looking into entering the P&C business
good,"There is always room to grow and advance"
good,"Keep to yourself and thats all you do while slaving away"
good,"This is a very fast-paced, high volume environment. Customer service was our primary focus in addition to having extensive product knowledge, excellent communications skills in telephones and any written correspondence. My experience was mostly involving automobile accidents and injury claims. Over the 25 years I worked there; I learned a great deal about auto insurance, accident investigations, evaluating, negotiating and settlement of claims. I worked with the insurance industry for OR, WA, ID, HI and AK concerning the different laws and statutes that applied to each state. Building rapport with our customers could be challenging at times however, I was very good at this as I enjoyed helping our customers. As you could imagine, with that length of time with one employer that I would see management changes regularly. That included my immediate supervisor especially. I dealt with many personality styles but managed to work well with them all because of my respect for their position. I believe I have had more supervisors than most due to changes with the company, the industry as well as the economy. We did have a ping pong table and Foosball but not everyone had the time to make use of these toys because of the workload and the time management required to be successful at the job."
good,"A typical day at work is handling vehicles that have been deemed a total loss and working with either the insured or claimant to determine the fair market value of their vehicle. The work enviorment and people I work with make it a manageable job since everyone is upbeat and supportive of eachother."
good,Allstate Insurance appreciates their employees and treats them very well.
good,"Spoke with mainly Spanish speaking clients, enjoyed explaining insurance, took pride in making sure they thoroughly understood, coverages and the benefits of insurance. Hardest part was finding pictures to explain insurance. Management was good, provided continuing education which was very much needed."
good,Call center environment but only a 38.75 hour work week...Good company to work for with decent chances for promotions.
good,Learned alot about the business which inspired me to take further interest in the industry.
good,Each day is always different.  I love the part of my job that is to help people by any means possible.  I don't like the part of the job that is all about the numbers.  I understand the numbers to a point but changing the rules to reduce our income is not right.
good,A typical day at work was to ensure that all customers were tended with as much care as possible making their experience an unforgettable one. I learned to work with a diverse clientele. The hardest part of the job was not being able to attend customers after business hours. The most enjoyable part of my job was to see the customers leave with their insurance policies and with smiles on their faces. Knowing that the customer left with all questions answered and were content enough to refer me more customers. I loved my coworkers because we were like a family. We worked as a team.
good,"Weight watchers & exercise class, (Walk Away the Pounds and Tae Bo after work)"
good,I enjoyed my job very much high volume calls work could be very stressful at times but I like being under pressure sorry to see the business close
good,They begin to lay agents off that had been loyal to their company for 20+ years!
good,Good company overall but in need of some changes. Allstate is going through cost reductions and many long-time employees were let go. Allstate uses old technology and is a bit behind the times. Frequent leadership/organizational changes take place - need to stick with one and give it time to work before moving onto the next.
good,"I was impressed with Allstate's product line and the stability of the company. However, I did not recieve the ocmpensation I was promised. I got licensed as a Property & Casualty Agent at Allstate. The office was to cramped and I did not appreciate the management's personality. The hardest part of the job was delaing with the management. The most enjoyble part of the job was learning to be an agent."
good,"Longevity at the company is there. Lot of changes in the focus for growing the company. I like the company, but not the fact that there is limited growth opportunties."
good,Received training on how to investigate casualty losses. Also learned how handle homeowers structural losses.
good,"A Good Company, open door policies, managers who were approachable, which I found to be nice."
good,Very few decision making out of India. Relaxed culture of work. Focus needs to be creating global roles and value add roles out of India rather than just Delivery
good,"Began as a temp then became perm after 1 year. I loved my new manager and the position itself was great! Everyday use of Excel, love the macros, & some ppl were great, some gossipers.  Awesome lil events during work like Walking for Lupus, buying raffle tickets n funds go to domestic violence victims, support gay rights, etc"
good,good place to work but management is all over the place. i love being able to use my skills here and learn more about the industry.   be prepared to be pushed to all limits of your skills and time.
good,Typical big business where things move slowly. Many silos to navigate. They are trying hard to pivot and be a modern agile company. Cloud Foundry platform was never adopted by all business units.
good,Not secure. Need to sell certain amount of items even in a bad market or your job is threatened. No benefits. Great team of people in agency but there is no room for advancement. No raises.
good,"Archaic system, lots of red tape, they promote the ""total compensation package"" as a way to underpay employees. "
good,"I was only there 2 weeks as a contractor and don't feel qualified to provide an impartial review"
good,"The culture is great, good work life balance but little room for advancement. There are however lateral development opportunities and a good education fund."
good,Great benefits really friendly staff excessive hours grwa grwat great awesome very intelligent compay whould recommends to everyone thanks will re turn back for a insyrance quite
good,"Good work life balance. "
good,"Company wise it was a great place to work but management wise it was not, I was terminated for something that I should not have been terminated for. Other than that it was a great company."
good,Overall it's a good company to be at. Just like any company the management has their favorites. Once your favorite it's best to stay that way for good raises.
good,"With agency's being privately owned, it's a mixed bag of what you get when working for an agent, though the basis of the job is always the same: open shop, handle calls and walk ins for quotes and customer service. Allstate is a very driven company that puts on many events and conferences, in order to help staff learn, and progress further in their careers."
good,"Project methodology transition from Waterfall to Agile was slow and painful. New roles and expectations were not clearly defined. Employees are extremely busy, however, always willing to stop their work, listen, and attempt to be helpful. Management promotes advancement of skills and personal branding. Senior management is not trustworthy during a time in which financial goals are off target."
good,It can be fast paced or super slow. Their rates are so high and they have strict underwriting so its tough to sell anything. People are very cool. Expect very low salary and okay commission.
good,"When you first start, there isn't much to do because you are training. After you are done with the training and show what skills you have to contribute to the company, they tend to give you more work. Which is typical at any office. You do what you can handle."
good,Very competitive atmosphere with good training and support. Most enjoyable part was the employee activities. Hardest part of job was the competition sometimes forged a little stress within the team.
good,"Places a big focus on work/life balance. PTO is good, you start with 20 days, you can roll over 5 and you get 5 more after being there 5 years. Most departments let you work from home. Most departments are underpaid compared to the market, some people are massively underpaid."
good,Allstate was a great place to work with many wonderful colleagues working alongside.  I simply left their employ to start a retail photography business of my own.
good,"I liked and respected the company as a whole.  However, I did not enjoy the agency in which I worked.  They said they were very family oriented and friendly.  Yes, for themselves, but I felt very isolated as an employee, like I really didn't fit in to their agenda.  I felt I was being very critiqued with everything I said and did by a close relative of the owner and who would at some point take over the agency.  I didn't feel that I really mattered just so the work was completed and sales goals were met."
good,My last manager was awesome but the other managers don't know what they are doing. I would like to have a team of managers who are in the same page. Management has to be more open to their employees and they have to be more open a new ideas.
good,"Walk in and handle tasks ranging from first contact to file reviews and bill pay. Easy work, however, not the most fulfilling. Some are satisfied with the work they are doing, others strive for more. Good working environment in this office."
good,Great place to work.  Learn more about the types of people that file claim.  Learn about fraudulent claims. Working Cat claims when storms hit.  Investing auto claims to see who or whom maybe at fault
good,"In my opionion was worked incorrectly."
good,"I love everything about working in the agency. I started off unlicensed, taking payment and now I am managing. What I have come to realize is the diversity with the agents/agencies. There are agents that generally love insurance and being an active agent and then there are agents that just see the business as an investment. There are agents who have been in the industry and are knowledgeable and than there are agents that are clueless and have no real desire to learn more than what is required to become an agent."
good,This started off as the best place ever to work until l changed management. The management makes all decisions based off of the employees they favor best and how long the employee has worked for the company. Ultimately l was lied to by my manager and let go for foolish reasons. I was denied unemployment and l wish l NEVER excepted the position to work for a lying dishonest company. My advice stay away and keep looking for something better.
good,Job Security & Office Culture are great. Pay is so so and benefits that used to be best in class continue to deteriorate quickly. There is opportunity to advance quickly especially if you are mobile.
good,Corporate works well with agents and allow for flexibility with daily tasks and promotional concepts. Your success is yours to make and Allstate is there to help along the way.
good,"Coming in to work 10 minutes early to set up to be ready for my client is one of the most typical day at work."
good,I felt like the tasks at my job were too easy. I felt underutilized and mistreated. The focus of the agency was not clear. Too focused on cost rather than efficiency and sales growth.
good,"Allstate allows each employee to manage their day based on the personal needs and the needs of the organization. As a result of the training, I am much more organized, detailed, and focused. One of the most impressive points about the company is the the focus they place on service. The hiring practices ensure all all workers share the same goal, which is to serve the customer. My co-worker came from all walks of life, but shared the common goal of service to humanity."
good,with the right agent behind the wheel it can be a great place to work. It is a great company with a good core set of values. I have worked for this company twice.
good,"I was only employed for one month due to not being able to obtain my license in the allotted time, (2 weeks) so my position was filled one weekend. Company provides a great work/life balance if you become employed with an agency."
good,"Its a cool job to work at. Doesn't have much room for advancement. Its all sales based plus commission, so its ""what you make it"" type of job."
good,Great place to work with the right team. Relationship building is key. Great place to work on outside sales ability. Must be self-motivated.
good,"Casual/professional work environment, team building, long hours, free, hot and delicious coffee. Things that I have learned is working well with multiple personalities. Quality and not quantity is important"
good,"Not enough oportunities due to the enviroment, call center"
good,"•	Provide accurate, timely reports with financial insight to allow business partners to improve performance"
good,the job doesn't really offer the salary to sustain a family however you can advance to a higher position with time and you learn skills applicable in banking
good,"A typical day i would answer calls, make calls fax documents etc."
good,"Manage day to day operations including sales, some underwriting, service changes and clients inquiries, claims and policy reviews."
good,I learned quite  a few different selling techniques while working at Alllstate. It was different then all of my other jobs in the industry as the main focus was on selling.
good,"This application is to get the online Quotes & Purchase for Auto & Property in different states in United States It enables the customer to get the Quick / Full Quotes / New Business for Auto, Home (Home owners, Renters, Condominiums), Health, Annuity, Mutual Funds, Business & Property Insurance. It involves with both Commercial and Personal insurance. The auto Insurance deals with all details of the Drivers history and Vehicle history. It also deals with the customer care claims. The application also deals with Mortgage, Investment and Financial (Fixed Income, Bonds, and Banking Products). "
good,"Constant work load that doesn't end when you finish the day. There is a constant supply of new claims coming in. If you are willing to work hard and push through you can eventually get to a point where you have full control of your desk work with no concern. However, some people drown in the work and never recover. There is a fairly high overturn. As a job, claims investigating is very fun. There is a lot of confrontation though."
good,"A typical day at work can be like hanging out with friends. Work gets done, but its not a stressful environment."
good,Working at Allstate i learned important skills that will assist in obtaining and keeping gainful employment.
good,"Typical day at work was answering about 40-50 calls from customers regarding their insurance coverage or billing info. I learned a lot about property casualty insurance. Management was always friendly and professional. My co-workers were as well. Everyone was always willing to help. The hardest part of the job was sitting at the desk answering calls. Also, insurance coverage varied from state to state and I was licensed in 40 states so I assisted customers from all over the country. Had to learn different guidelines for different policies depending on the state. Most enjoyable part helping people understand their insurance coverage and some of the people I met while working there."
good,"Professional call centre environment, great management and company events such as BBQ's, Hockey games that employees can take part in. Great mentors and it was a very fast paced work enviornment."
good,"Allstate was fun the first year, then layoffs happened for the course of 2+ years. Company priorities changed, outsourcing occurred."
good,"Your job is secure, they hire great people, and there is plenty of opportunity to grow as the older generation of Allstaters gets to retirement age. Constantly innovating in an attempt to stay ahead of the curve and appeal to younger demographics appeal"
good,"A  very professional place to work. No room for anyone over 50, They want young vibrant oriented people. Benefits  are great.  Pay is good. The company is all over the United States.  Allstate.com can tell more about what positions are available."
good,Our agency has been open since 1965.  I  am a second generation agency owner and have learned and continue to learn the nuisances of the market and the business.  Our agency has created a family friendly workplace that understands the challenges life can throw at you.  Putting our employees in a position of success is paramount to achieving agency and company goals.
good,If you are ok working 45-50 hours per week this is the job for you! Just expect to work hard and smart and keep a positive attitude.  Always be a good role model.  You will learn a lot and be life smart in the insurance business
good,A typical day was to be as productive as possible. The medical benefits offered has declined significantly.  You might as well purchase your benefits outside of the company.  The most enjoyable part were the people.
good,"telemarketed  about fixed rates insurance quotes, home auto or business loans available, fixed rating lower ability to people who qualify, so on son about the loans as well also the auto insurance."
good,Great place to work. Plenty of training from owner and managers. Learned the skills to be a successful sales agent. Sales goals can be stressful at times but overall very good company to work for.
good,"The work culture was great. Good employee peer relationship. Management was supportive. Good work/life balance . There was a lot of work, fast pace, goal driven."
good,"i like working on the road and working with customers, and dealing with shops that could bully me around and could not when i did the work they could not fool me,"
good,"It was definitely a great learning experience for first time insurance sales. The office was new, everyone working there was new. It was difficult at times as no one new certain things."
good,"Allstate greatly enhanced my phone and time management skills. Punctuality was critically important, second only to prompt, effective customer service."
good,"Typical work day: Meetings and job review. What you learned: the Stock exchange market, Management is accessible, Workplace culture: Accountability and transparency,  Hardest Part: Punctuality"
good,Working for Allstate is decent. You can make as much money as you want commission wise but even then it is not much. The office is great to work in for the most part and I enjoy my co workers.
good,"The company is results driven. The workload is more than you can handle. The pressure is constant and persist throughout the year. Allstate hires good people and its the people and the camaraderie"
good,Allstate is a great place to begin a career in the insurance industry.  There is plenty of help with getting licensed and learning the quote and sell process.
good,"Allstate is a secure company to work for but Adjusters in the unrepresented casualty segment are overworked and under paid. New duties are given to these individuals as changes are made within the company and departments are laid off, but there are no changes to the compensation. Individuals in this department are also held responsible for the duties of other adjusters (auto specifically) within the company. There needs to be a reallocation of work to balance with the pay, or better compensation to equal the work."
good,"I been an Insurance Agent for over 17 years in Savannah, GA, and I hold a South Carolina License also. I very well known in Savannah with all the car dealerships"
good,"A typical day at work is to go in at 4:30 to make sure that the mail has arrived and to make sure that it is sorted and opened before everyone arrives. Get the work distributed to each person. Some management are not on the same page as you as they ask you to be over a group of people. The hardest part of the job is being a team lead/ workflow coordinator and you are not appreciated. You believe and making the customer happy, but it seems like everyone is not pulling their weight, you talk to the supervisor on several occasions and nothing is done about it. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I have met quite a few great people along the way and they are more like family than friends."
good,An subsidiary of American company Allstate insurance. Insurance agents were required to to become independent agents of the company. Agents were left to decide whether or not to provide medical/dental plans for any sales staff they  employed. The agent I worked for cold not provide either. Worked 45 hrs a week. THIS AGENT HAS RETIRED.
good,"I basically set my own schedule with my agent. I came into work after class and stayed until close. the work environment was good  and no to much pressure making and transferring clients, and making now sales with policies."
good,"Good company to work for, but environment is not for me. Looking to work with younger coworkers and in a more creative place. Not the creative place I'm looking for."
good,Typical day you make about 50 calls to leads that are either bought or provided by allstate. Take payments from walk in customers. Interact with prospects in the attempt to sell on insurance.
good,A typical day at work involve dealing with individuals that had something unexpected happen to them and they needed help from us. Empathy was expected
good,"Learned a lot of great things like how to develop a marketing plan to bring in more customers, generate quotes for auto, home and life insurance."
good,Allstate was a great culture with some good coworkers that helped learn the systems and answered questions if I had any. Being successful Cold-Calling is a must to make any desired salary.
good,"good place to grow, great customers, great team, you will need to be licensed in order to sell insurance, flexible schedule. fast paced"
good,"great job if you know a lot of people that need your services. Depends how you are getting paid, but if you don't know enough people and can't build a decent pipeline. prepare to be bored."
good,It's an okay place.  You Have to be fully committed to being your own boss. Having prior experience is a big help! The workplace is pretty quiet.
good,I believe Allstate still has some growing to do in commercial insurance including there broker. I believe working direct and having a larger variety of companies available would make Allstate dominate the commercial industry.
good,"A typical day at work consists of touching base with referral sources and COI's, completing some prospecting for new business, servicing and managing existing policies for clients and preparing quotes for new business."
good,If they would give Federal holidays it would be a great place to work for . It would also be a great place to work if that would have better hours for each state division the . Plus give more incentive to their employees.
good,"A typical day involves receiving new concerns through the day, contacting the customers, researching their concern, and finding a resolution. I learned there is a lot more to insurance than I realized. Management is very involved with the employees, caring, and compassionate.  Coworkers are also very supportive and willing to get things done as a team.  The hardest part of the job is delivering a negative answer to a customer."
good,Allstate gave me the opportunity to jump feet first into the world of Insurance. Great staff and management!
good,"Each day is filled with new claims.  No claim is the same.  A day does not pass when I'm not extremely busy juggling new claims while determining liability on another and analyzing a police report for another.  I work with a diverse group of 75 individuals.  "
good,Management is great!! Great communication!!! My co-worker are a wonderful bunch!! We have a good relationship as a team!! The bad side is its not much advancement as you wish and its a lot of work for the pay. Other than that it good!! Its been a great learning experience!
good,"Review newly assigned claims and begin to contact parties involved in order to obtain the loss facts and make the proper liability decision.  Next I review old pending to see if there are any that can be brought to resolution.  In addition, follow up on police reports as well as scene investigations.  The hardest part of the job is balancing the multiple claims and the most enjoyable part is conversing with my co workers.  We motivate one another to give it all and do our best."
good,Working at a large corporation has excellent networking opportunities. There are many options for testing out a variety of areas you may want be interested in learning more about.  In my current role I have been fortunate to work with great individuals and have gain knowledge that I will take with me in future roles.
good,The company has a good culture - very friendly and focuses on making it a good place to work. The benefits are good.
good,Good place to work temporarily; Need to know and learn about insurance and keep up with the changing atmosphere; Can be slow paced at times but can keep self busy
good,Very nice environment but you have to sell sell sell or you would get fired after a month. It was so hard because people don’t like anyone calling their house. We were encouraged to try to sell when at home to friends and family and to go to different stores to leave business cards which is soliciting and I was removed from a property lol
good,"Large fast paced, well known insurance company with many offices around the country offering financial services in regard to life, home and auto. Culture is collaborative."
good,Telemarketing is not for everyone. You have to be able to accept being being unhappy with your call but continue to make the calls to fulfill your quota.
good,"nice place to work.  great working environment. flexibility with school schedules and shifts, opportunity to grow and gain. competitive yet rewarding workplace"
good,"I loved working for Allstate until I got laid off. I had worked there for almost 20 years. Managers were very fair and understanding. Great benefits,  diverse working culture,  good pay."
good,"Allstate is a good place to work, with great benefit and a good work environment. The supervisors always work with you to better your abilities to work with customers and agents."
good,"As a claims adjuster for Allstate you will work typical Monday thru Friday hours and rotating on the weekends and possibly evenings. The corporate culture is constantly evolving trying to keep up with the times which is fairly a good thing. The managers are nice and supportive with an open door policy. The most difficult part of the job was the job itself; handling claims and speaking to customers and claimants, and negotiating decisions with them. Also, often times the work load was unmanageable. The most enjoyable part was communicating with coworkers. There wasn't much upward mobility in this company and when you decide to leave on good terms Allstate will be very difficult if not impossible to reach as references."
good,"This job was basically problem solving. We would get messages from agents or the call center. to find out what has happened to a customers policy( payments, cancel,or person left the job etc) It could be challenging. You need to be detailed orientated to this job.Overall a great job. it was just too far to commute."
good,I loved my job but with the merging of corporate management required me to travel which I was unwilling to do because I needed to take care of my infant at the time and this was not negotiable.
good,"Working with auto liability will allow you to advance in your customer device and time management skills. Your work day will fly by. "
good,It was very well but it could have been better. I would have liked to stay longer but I was let go because of there lack of communication and work ethic.
good,Learned how to speak to people on a sales level. The best way to sell insurance and get leads. Everyone seems to mind their own business in the office and lead each other on. The hardest part is not getting any leads when no one answers their phones (from the auto-dialer) or when people are very rude to me over the phone. Most enjoyable is when I get to talk to some really nice people.
good,"Regular work hour's "
good,Work days were always dynamic. My co-workers and myself constantly fed off of each other on ways to best handle claims and management was always available for input and suggestions. The hardest part of the job was informing insured of items that were not covered by policy and the most enjoyable part of the job was being there to help a policy holder after a loss.
good,"I worked for Allstate for 15 years and once the company went ""public"" the atmosphere changed.  There were more demands placed on employees by top management to make it almost impossible to ""exceed"" in your job.  Overall though, I was given opportunities there which helped me later in the job market and I will always be grateful for to Allstate for that."
good,Great place to work at. you get to enjoy both working by yourself and also as group. only negative feed back would be that it sucked that i have to leave this job in order to meet my economical goals
good,"Great call Call Center position, able to work three shifts."
good,If you can deal with the Competition that is often in insurance companies you will do fine. A lot of agents do  Unethical things in order to get bonuses
good,Great place to work. Much room for advancement and growth. On a daily basis you will interact with customers by taking payments and offering and making quote presentations.
good,"Job security is lacking in the Allstate world. It's so easy for the agency to overstaff and if they don't make enough money the last person hired ends up jobless. They do not give fair warning and it makes paying bills very difficult. I learned how to navigate the systems provided quickly though training was lacking. The hardest part of the job was selling policies, the most enjoyable part was being able to help customers get exactly what they needed."
good,"it was learning time lot of things"
good,"The job is pretty easy: just show up for 8 hours, answer calls and try to sell policies to make the extra commission. Of course getting people to stay on the phone or follow through with quotes is the hardest part. It also depends on your agency’s location. The agency atmosphere is also so much better than the call center environment. At my location there are only 4 of us."
good,Excellent company. Work life balance. Family friendly. Excellent vacation package.  Management is very understanding and knowledgeable. Flexible schedule and understanding regarding family.
good,"Working in my position as a life claims examiner was stressful and fast paced.  We were slightly understaffed which caused us to have to work a lot of overtime.   Management was ok, it is not always easy to say what was truly happening behind the scenes.   We had a very nice, clean work area in which to do our jobs.    Hardest part of the job was actually my co-worker.  She and I did not have the best relationship due to personality conflicts.  I enjoyed working with all my other co-workers and I had many friends there.    The company benefits were great.  We had several yearly company get togethers and on site parties that were very enjoyable."
good,I enjoy working at Allstate but it seems they are trying to make it hard to get your yearly raise. They have quality reviews which can be wrong but yet they can not change it once its done. But if your call is re reviewed it can change to a lower score.
good,Allstate is a great company to work for if you like a call center environment. They believe strongly in the work/life balance philosophy and that is a great company asset to an employees life.
good,"Salary to low for me, The Manager was great, great benefits, Great environment"
good,Its a good place to start get your foot into the job world. My first job.
good,"Claims are constant, so it is fast paced. You are not micro-managed. Your goal is set and you just make sure to get your work done. You have to have self disciplne"
good,I worked for Allstate for eight years.  I learned so much and was so loyal and so grateful to be there.  I moved up and up and just kept learning.  Customer Service is so important to them..and to me.  I wanted to be professional and have all of the right answers.  And if I didn't I would  find out the answer and get back to that customer promptly   I learned so much and I was always SO proud to work for Allstate.
good,"fast pace call center, sales goals targeted to motivate high quality producers."
good,"I would start my set agency goals, work the claims from the following day manage the staff."
good,"My father, sister, and I started our own branch in 2005-2006 (I joined the team at the end. I was mainly responsible for marketing our branch, servicing client accounts, and acquiring new business."
good,"The company itself, is pretty awesome, however, management is the worst, in the RMBC. We are expected to do our job, plus the inspector's, for no increase in wages."
good,Each agency is different.  My owner was very unnecessarily strict.  I was 10 mins late one day after i had worked there for a couple of months and he made me feel really bad about it.  I was doing sales and would get on to me for petty things i would say on the phone.
good,"Don't listen to the recruiters.  The company has the best training program I've experienced out of many.  However, the leads you to believe it will be different with their brand.  Just say NO!"
good,The agent I work for expects a lot for very little pay and have very high expectations for sales before commissions are payed to us.  He takes at least three months a year off leaving us here to run his business and doesn't give us much time off.
good,"Not a bad job for someone just starting out in finance. Pay is extremely low."
good,"Working at Jimmy Smith Allstate office was very busy and many time stressful.  Good customer service opportunities and sales."
good,"The customer interaction is great; however, my co-worker and I both have gotten in trouble for being nice to people and for trying to sell insurance policies.  It's ridiculous."
good,Helping customer's with their billing and other inquiries.  Working for agencies are good but it depends on the people you work with that really make the difference or break it.
good,She would yell at both her employees and clients in front of everyone. Time management was not a thing for her. And overall unfair to staff and clients.
good,"I enjoyed the learning resources available to me.  It was a temporary experience, which after learning a good  part of the job - was very interested in becoming a Licensed Insured Specialist."
good,"I had to answer multi- phone syster lines, cold calling, greetig customers, general office duties"
good,Micromanaged and no time to do anything. He makes you work your tail off and you dont get anything out of it.
good,Have to be organized and learn to manage your desk. Job is fast pace constant in coming calls and have to be able to make decisions and trust your instincts
good,"Working for an agency is most challenging, as we are required to do a lot of leg work with a system that is not much up to date on technology.  There is little organization in a small office, not much structure.  Management is at time most aggressive, which in my opinion is unprofessional.  I feel very unappreciated.  We have to purchase our own necessities and office supplies, having to study things at home to not take up company time."
good,"Great co-workers"
good,"I made courtesy calls for payment, calls about claims, handled incoming calls from clients, made adjustments on policies ie: adding/removal vehicles,  answered questions, faxed requested info to banks."
good,"Answering questions about supplementary health policies such as accidental death, cancer, and disability."
good,Decent Short-term company to work for but continue to search for stable employment in the process
good,Was fun while it lasted.  Could pick my hours weekly to work.  Participated in lots of fun Customer appreciation events and special drawings for prizes at the County Fair booths.
good,Great place to work.. I was a data processor in claims for roadside assistance. Friendly co-workers and great management. Things were not as transparent as they should have been. I would recommend the company though.
good,"Use Allstate’s state-of-the-art NextGen claims system to file new claims and bring existing claims to resolution"
good,"It was a great place to get my feet wet, starting to work again after having my kids and going to college.  Learned about doing deposits for a company and receivables on the computer for the customers."
good,"Brand new agency very stressful and needing to make a sale"
good,"Great culture, base salary plus commission (low salary and low commission compensation), Great management, a lot of autonomy, open to new ideas and methods"
good,The job was simple but there was a lot of issues with other workers that did not include me but did impede with some work that I did.Nothing too negative but many of the others did not seem to happy with how things were taken care of. Since my work was temporary I did not have a full understanding of what was going on but it did affect my coworkers.
good,"Management was fun and able to do work at your own at your own speed. I learned a lot as it was my first ""real"" job. The people really made the job enjoyable."
good,this was my first insurance job and outside of management i really enjoyed this place.  Basically this was the foundation that laid and placed me on the insurance track
good,very document driven environment and management micro managing your work. old working style of employees who's been there for a life time.
good,"i enjoyed the face paced environment and constantly learning new things, and better ways to suit the client. The company was overall great, just kind of difficult to promote up through the company."
good,Place is now crowded with offshore consultants and they contribute very little. Culture is totally changed and management doesn't care for career goals of the employees.
good,"The job is great but it has it's ups and downs depending on sales,this is a requirement per month to meet goals but also it the company's all over rates. taking rate increases as a company can have tremendous affect on office sells."
good,"A fast pace environment servicing the requests of hundreds of clients and potential clients. A typical day includes prospecting new clients and marketing several insurance products. I also process new applications for auto and home policies, and create accounts with client information. It is a very friendly environment where associates helps each other to achieve company quota goals."
good,It was an  OK job I don't think that I am good with sales. But I did learn a lot about the Insurance Buisness. My Boss was Great.
good,"Overall a good place to work with good products"
good,"My job consisted of answering phones, giving quotes for new or existing customers. Was learning all about insurance and was on my way to being licensed. Problem was this business was just starting and it was just him and his wife. They couldn't afford a employee at the time so they had to let me go. I was very upset."
good,I worked as an agent. I enjoyed the products that they had to offer. I started right when they came out with gap insurance and accident forgiveness. I worked for one of the premiere offices so it was fun and laid back. we worked hard and made lots of money in a short period of time
good,My most enjoyable part of my job is the customer service....and also providing a policy or two a day is a great day.  Go marketing and trying to bring business to us . Calling out and following up is every day. Its a challenge.
good,Reconsider when you apply to this office. Extremely Hostile! Husband and wife fighting every weekend. Any opinion will be discarded by Mrs. Brummer. Couples shouldn't be working together.
good,"It seems just when you start hitting new levels of production, the carpet gets tugged. It's a never ending cycle, unless agency owners starting properly compensating their employees. "
good,There was training from corporate office that differs from other insurance companies. More hands on training in and out of the office. Streamlined processes and organized.
good,it's owned by a couple who has a couple of offices and the mother and father who are realtors also run the insurance office. Over all office ran fine due to the employees.
good,"The company was great to work but advancement is difficult due to nepotism. Roles are not rewarded by merit but by individual network settlement.  "
good,Most of my 33 yr career was challenging but manageable.  Recent leadership changes and philosophy at Home Office trickling down to local level made work and environment almost unbearable.  Massive defections in claims departments across country was desired and achieved.  I retired due mainly to bad environment and unattainable measures.  When dust settles it may be a better place to work in the future.
good,"Working for the ILFOP was new. Mostly all we did was cold calls. finding new customers. Once on the line with a person who was interested in supporting, we would tell them what their pledge was going toward as far as donation wise."
good,a challenging industry with the internet sales channel now comprising alot of the industry.  auto & home insurance is now commoditized as a price only product and the lowest price wins.  takes a good agent and business savvy to make an agency work.
good,"Worked there for Tuition Reimbursement and it was appreciated, completed my bachelors degree and then left the company. I was there for 5 years......."
good,Allstate was a learning opportunity for me. I was working with Esurance and was given a opportunity to learn many more areas of the insurance business with Allstate.
good,"Overall very good place to work, co-workers were like family.  "
good,"a typical day at work consists of fun, but it also includes much favoritism which i don't appreciate. the most enjoyable part of my day is the team that i work with, but the hardest part is dealing with management."
good,"Communication is essential and conveying to employees it is even more important"
good,"I quote home and auto over the phone, every day  "
good,Working for this company I have learned a lot of interesting things. Learning from how insurance really works and what is needed to calculate the quotes is interesting. I have learned how this company cares for their customer. I have learned from that to become a better customer service representative and to know better at taking care of a customer when in need. The hardest part about the job is dealing with an angry customer complaining about an increase on their premium. With patients and knowledge I learned how to be able to help out the customer. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing i was able to help a customer and to be able to give them a peace of mind.
good,A typical day at work would consist of selling home and auto insurance and servicing the existing customers needs. I learned that the opportunity to make a decent living was not available. Management was sub par and the atmosphere was always fairly tense. The job was not hard and doing a good job for the customer was the most satisfying part of the job.
good,Not very professional company. Not easy to work with. Supervisors are not knowledgeable and always depends on second hand information.  Management does not know what the management means.
good,Grogan Agency not a good place to work. It's a new agency and opportunities are limited.
good,I never had a set schedule it was just come in when they had something for me to do.
good,"I was the manager of the office,open and close office took on all duties to run a Insurance Office"
good,"Great staff, great work environment."
good,Never know when I am getting paid it is supposed to be the 1st and 15th but that really happens. The owner of the Agency has to wait to be paid by Allstate before his staff can get paid.
good,insurance is a good industry to get into if you like helping people. there's no room for advancement though unless you're looking to run your own agency
good,The work day could be stressful at times.  Some managers treated  you people unfairly and discussed confidential information with other employees.  Overall good place to work
good,Great place to build relationships. This is a place where you are really responsible for your success. The key is building relationships. It is a wholesale and retail opportunity for financial professionals.
good,Allstate is a good company. Insurance is a service business and this is how Agencies differentiate themselves from internet based sales organizations.
good,"It's a good job if your mechanically inclined. "
good,"Allstate it self is a great company "
good,"#1 Priority Customer Satisfaction in   auto, home, life , renters, umbrella policies , retirement 401K  financial experts you needed it and we would make it happen!"
good,I loved working for Allstate because of the people that surrounded me. I made life long friends. The work environment can required 50+ hours a week to meet the demands that are required. The insureds were wonderful to speak with and help. After a while the job gets the better of you unless you are able to get out of the claims department.
good,It was a great work environment but there's little room for advancement and there is little documentation of workplace activities. This makes learning new processes annoying.  Always take notes.
good,Working as technical support of the website was very stressful and highly scrutinized.  Pay did not match the position requirements and supervisors were very invasive
good,Ok place to work. The hourly pay is nice and vacation is PHENOMENAL! They do allow a work life balance which is great. Only thing that I feel could be better is the structure in which the company operates. There are shift bids that sort of rock your world upside down if you are not on top of numbers 100%. Forget it if you have a medical situation. You could be working a shift that is ideal and then get put in something that is not and you’re left to scramble between losing a job you have tenure with or getting termed due to childcare. I don’t think that’s fair. Shift bids should be optional. People do have lives..
good,I really don’t have nothing to say about the job except the coworkers are lovely. I just wish they had better trainers and managers. That they are consistent
good,"Good job while working through college. Spent time learning about insurance, and seeing the value in building long term relationships with clients who could build a good residual income from.  I worked for agent."
good,"Allstate is a great place to start your career in isurance, as you have the opportunity to work in a sales office as well as the large claims office. I don't think the pay structure is very competitive on the claims side of things...this is in relation to the industry standard."
good,"Great company. Low base salary so, get your money up front, it will make the bounces easier to wait for. Corporate pays more and covers more benefits."
good,"I'll probably not go back. I'm not much for working for captive insurance agents since it is very hard to keep customer retention. You only have the one company you are working for, and that makes it difficult to find solutions to specific problems that a customer may face."
good,"Claims, insurance, in general it can involve a lot of stress.  As a field claims representative, you are the gatekeeper for funds.  Insureds, vendors, and experts want access to those funds and you have to protect your employer's interests as well as the policyholders.  It can be a juggling act and keeping everyone happy can be difficult.  Flexible hours, working in the field, and having some downtime are some of the benefits.  Good luck."
good,I enjoyed working with the people I worked with at the time. Other staff members were wonderful and willing collaborate new work strategies. The management was a little hard to work with at times.
good,"I absolutely LOVE working for Allstate as a company whole.  It is one of the absolute best companies in the world. Great benefits, pay grades, culture, vision, and customer oriented."
good,Great owner and amazing clients. The day is never the same which is nice... makes each day go fast. Opportunity for continuing education with in house training.
good,Working with only a few other employees can make it difficult if you become shorthanded. I enjoy working with customers and helping them get the proper coverage needed.
good,"Good job if you intend to continue on going in the same position for years on end. No healthcare/benefits is a huge turn off, & the expensive nature of the product makes sales goals impossible."
good,The company is good. Work Life balance and compensation needs a little work. I did not like certain ways of promotion. I felt like the compensation for my work wasn't enough.
good,"Allstate gave us great benefits, but the work was stressful and the goals and bonus system made it more so.  The managers for the most part were great, but some refused to mentor or promote."
good,"Allstate is a great company to work for, but the agents need to offer some kind of health insurance if it is not offer then they need to compensate for it."
good,"Helping People get their Insurance"
good,"started the day at 8am, reviewed files for renewal and quotes, management was great and willing to teach, learnes all about insurance, hardest part of job was driving 1/12 hours to and from work, to far away. Best part of my job wsas I had a great boss who was willing to explain and teach me new things, I met quite a few interesting clients."
good,This is a company who definitely cares about its employees. From the moment you walk in you feel valued. There is always something going on to keep moral going and the training is awesome!
good,"Allstate is great, but not sufficient pay it benefits are being provided. Management from the head agent is lacking, there is lack of training and development."
good,"If you have a family or are a caegiver, this company is not for you. Schedule is rigid and you do must work holidays.Good for a collage graduate. 1st job"
good,The office hours were great. The industry as a whole slowed down and it's become hard to live off of one hundred percent commission. I still intend to sell insurance in the future.
good,"Nice work life. Needs to have more training on the Agents Manager/Owner part."
good,"I was  a temp. so its really hard to rate fairly. I would just say, I would recommend it. The pay is decent. its a typical work schedule. monday - friday."
good,"Great place to work ,excellent compensation and benefit package. Managers need more over site of employees. Managers more interested in bonuses than if employees doing right thing."
good,This is a relatively new insurance agency.  The owner is a great person that was one of the best bosses I ever had.  I enjoyed my time with the company.
good,"Very busy day. I learned auto and home policy quotes on computer. Reinstatement of policies or adjustments, auto inspections, hurricane /storms home damages and repair with the county and/or private contractors. Telemarketing of Life insurance, Cancer, Hospital, etc. My manager worked conveniently with all these policies for personal profit and bias to customers. It was a family business company and did not have other employees except me outside the family members. The hardest part of the job was to be asked to lie to the customers in order to increase sales which I did not agree at all. The most enjoyable part of the work was when I had to talk to the customers and assist with respectful communication and concern for their real policy issues with no lies and without losing my dignity as a human being and as a professional. I have spiritual beliefs and convictions that I respect greatly."
good,"Allstate is a really great place to work but no real opportunity for advancement and compensation was minimal. However, there is strong job security and the management is good."
good,"It's a great place to work if you enjoy insurance and customers. My managers and superiors are amazing people, with a passion for insurance. They are thee most supportive people I have ever met in my life and I plan on being friends with them after I move on from here. However, if you do not love insurance and customers being upset constantly drains you, this is not for you. When you work for a smaller agency, theres no benefits either."
good,"From 2007 on a typical day was a hectic blend of complaints, missed promises from the company end and copious/unnecessary meetings."
good,"Manage daily operations of the office including all administration duties for the management of finances, human resources, promotions and marketing."
good,"This was a part time job that worked well for me at that time."
good,"Liked the company, just to far to travel to work daily went I moved to Florida."
good,My day at work would go by extremely quick. Very busy with things to do and take care of. I learned all the values of being an insurance agent and what type of work it takes to make the customer pleased. The people that I worked with were always smiling and laughing. It was a great place to be. My part of the job that was the hardest would have to be leaving. This I did not want to do. Everything made this business fun to work for.
good,This is my first job when I got back here in America. Being a receptionist and assistant agent is fun too. Learned how to deal with different kind of insure person. Difficult sometimes but being so patient helps alot.
good,"Allstate is a great company. You are allowed a nice lunch break and regular breaks. I appreciated the hours, I worked 40 hours per week with weekends off. Unfortunately I was working through a temporary service so my time there wasn't permanent."
good,The pay is very low regardless of your experience. If you have no experience & just got out of college I would say the pay is decent but if you have a lot of experience the pay is still the same. They only give a raise if it is an annual raise. They do not give a raise for any promotion unless the promotion is to a management position. They say one thing & then do another.
good,"Management is like the mean girls in high school.  They are young, they gossip, they lie, they play favorites.  If you are not 22 years old and one of their buddies, you have no place there and you will be pushed out."
good,If you like to make cold call to sell insurance this is the job for you. There is a daily requirement for calls made to prospects and a sales requirement. The monthly sales requirement has to be met before a paycheck is generated.
good,Make sure you are happy with the agent your interviewing with. Some agents are involved with the actually productivity and others are out leaving you on your own expecting you to know there works strategy.
good,My position overall educated people on the importance of having insurance with the proper coverage to protect their family and assets. It is an overall great experience.
good,"Allstate is a stock owned company and employees are squeezed dry every day, Staffing is always an issue. The company pulled out of California because they did not want to pay employees or deal with the regulations in California. They dont care as much about the claim handling as they do about how they look in the media."
good,The best part about the job is the generous PTO and you can buy up to 5 days.  Management isn’t the best some cracks  in the system. Life department closes at 8pm verses the car and home department which is 24 hours. Pay could be better as well.
good,"Fair company with good environment ..7 day weeks and 12 hour shifts it's great. But job security not a plus, work load decrease so does your job. Reasonable pay.."
good,"I worked through a Staff Agency. I really enjoyed my time there, unfortunately my assignment came to an end after almost 2 years. Management SUCKS, they're prejudice!"
good,I'll say it's a wonderful family within the family there should always be structure opportunity for growth and advancement constantly providing tools to keep all LSP up-to-date with new services and products as well as moral uplifting
good,Allstate was a good company to work for.  There are many pros however they seem to be less caring for their employees than they were in the past.  Many people felt very threatened by potentialy losing their jobs.
good,"Working with my agency, I learned many things and met awesome friends. The work environment was relaxed although there was an abundance of online work to do. Since we were all assigned to do different tasks, there was more to make up after having days off. All in all, it was a great opportunity but I didn't feel like I could grow any more from this place."
good,The company overall acts very ethically.  I appreciated that there were formal reviews each year.  Pay was not on par with the industry.  Benefits and work-life-balance was very nice
good,"Allstate does not office a bonus plan and there average raise is minimal and will not keep up with the cost of living. Advancement is very political vs. proven and achieved results. Overall, great people, culture with the staff. Old school/ very conservative leadership is opportunistic. There are no excuses for not meeting or exceeding your goals and they are quick to performance manage."
good,"While the commercials do seem like a success, working at the company can be stressful as the management is not streamlined.  The upper management is often removed from the unwashed masses and the line management has no leadership."
good,"Fast paced, sales driven insurance office. Easy working environment. Hands on customer service. Great place to learn and utilize knowledge to help customers obtain coverage to best suit their needs."
good,I was trained very well.  There was not room for advancement at all in the claims department when i was there.  I left only because of this reason and it was a very hard decision at the time.
good,"average comp package and average work culture"
good,"At this time I do not have a review for this company."
good,"Every day is a full work load"
good,The work environment was good however the management I did not like. I liked working with the employees. I liked having a hour lunch. I did not like getting paid once a month.
good,Must be ready to hate life. No Saturdays off ever! Tenured employees get first dibs to schedule PTO for Saturdays. Also not easy to advance no matter how much they tout development.
good,"Not to trust management. A lot of time has passed, I got over it."
good,To on time to open up the office for the start of business.  To make sure that you preform to the best of your ability.  Be willing to always learn and to take advice. To always work hard and make the work place fun also.  Always be willing to help out if extra help is needed.
good,Overall excellent opportunity for agency ownership. Good training  and financial support. Good help to start an agency including signage allowance and office location
good,"good company to work with but no professional culture "
good,"Working as a contractor was great, however better communication from my bosses would have totally changed the outcome and relationship, productivity and collaboration would have made us both happy."
good,"This job can be slow paced, so self initiative is necessary to make sales and grow book of business. Not much room for advancement within local offices, but decent starting job."
good,It was productive and competitive yet a challenge in keeping up with the company’s growth as far as customers or clients. It was very much interaction with a diversified clientele .
good,"Drivers do not recieve any benefits, yet are expected to work night and day and be on call during the 3 to 5 hours your off trying to sleep. The money cam be great but you will have no life and little to no sleep."
good,The office that I worked at was very stressful. The owner/head agent would place quotas on everyone. That made it had to work when everyone needs the sale.
good,"Answering incoming calls and also calling out to customers.  Setting up auto & property claims. Setting inspections for vehicles and home.  Making payments, updating information on claim.  Having to keep calm and show and show empathy with customer.  Listen to what they have to say, wait until they have finished, make sure to get all the information that we need to make the customer feels comfortable.  Ask customer if there are any questions or concerns regarding their claim.  Assisting with their needs and requirements;  Good Customer Service, hardest part sometimes is when you have a difficult customer, main object is to get them to a comfortable level and let them know that you are here to support them and to do whatever is necessary to make sure that they have a good claim experience and that everything has been explained;  Enjoyable part is when you are told that you did a fantastic job and would certainly recommend using Allstate;"
good,"Relaxed environment, work with the public to create professional bonds with customers to keep business. Teamwork oriented, task oriented, great group of people in my office."
good,The office is a nice place to work. The boss is very accommodating for time off when needed. The office staff is very small so employee benefits are not really an option.
good,"This company is not the career utopia that people would equate to Google (whether reality or not), but it was a generally relaxed working environment, to a reasonable degree.  The company has a fairly cohesive culture, which means that everyone is usually marching in the same direction."
good,Allstate is a very good place to work for someone who desires to be in corporate America.  The leaders of the company truly seek to make the working environment inclusive and family oriented.
good,Free lunches were nice but no sense of organization among-st the coworkers I feel overloaded at times while my coworkers spend time on their cell phones
good,Every agency is different.  Make sure that the owner is willing to work with you if you have a problem with the manager they left in charge.  Everything was good until the manager thought they didn't have to live by the rules of the office.
good,Enjoyed working for all state. They are a nice company with good workers. They have a relaxed environment. with a work at your own pace. I would go back to work here
good,"The people were easy to get along with, and the work/life was flexible. My biggest issue was that the security was commission based where we relied on cold calling and minimal advertisement to engage with potential clients."
good,"Too many double standards and variation of ""rules"". Compensation is not as much as one would think being such a big company, they do have decent benefits."
good,"Overall, good place to work. Can have a long career there.  The upper management is not employee focused as they should be.  They are more focused on shareholders."
good,Lots of work not a lot of pay for the amount of work to be done. Not a lot of work life balance.  Lack of communication between multiple departments throughout the US.
good,I am concerned that my application is pending on my review of my current employer. I will always love Allstate I worked here for 16 years. I am looking for a career change.
good,"Outside sales - sales calls for auto, home, life and outside prospecting, process payments, quotes. Answering phone, review policies and answer policy questions."
good,"You'll learn something new about customers and claims, helping with the joy of a new home or auto purchase and consoling during the times that require life insurance. Although a small office and staff everyone is very personable and our agencies has received consistently the highest customer service satisfaction rating in the territory and state. While advancing from support staff to licensed staff the obligations and requirements increased to a much more hands-on approach that really allowed me to be in charge of marketing, sales, and training of staff to help guide an agency that going in from failing to moving to the top sales territory. Insurance is a job for those with a hard-stomach and compassionate demeanor. Not everyone can handle discussing the final arrangements for someone and their policies to the beneficiaries on a regular basis."
good,A typical office job where you have a bunch of paperwork due by the end of the day. Important to stay focused and manage your time wisely in order to get everything done. Love the people that work there.
good,"Handled clients and phones, ran quotes, did extensive cold calling.  Handled all banking deposits.  Ran office occasionally alone ."
good,"Worked with a wonderful group of people.  We all had each other's backs, and jumped in to help when we could.  Our supervisor then was a great guy to work for."
good,A day at Allstate is very busy and never a quiet moment.  Always interacted with customers in office and on the phone taking care of their services.  I learned how to better my customer service skills.
good,"I am insurance agent, orientation for the client and help in yours finance and other areas. Help reclamation and visit the state, and municipal goverment areas."
good,allstate is full of it. They like who they like and don't like who they don't. Certain people are able to get things done for them and not others. The people on your team are sometime cool but the upper management is also full of it and you WILL HAVE to work EVERY Saturday unless you are in training
good,"A typical day was like any normal insurance agency except you focused on insurance last.  you had to get the customer info back to Finance so they can make extra sales first. then they would bring the customer back to Allstate if they needed insurance.  But the Dealership is the one making money off the customer in the auto sales fist.  Very stressful, long hours, and lots of rules for the dealership first before Insurance could even make a sale.  You never got any breaks through out the day and was not allowed to leave the dealership on Saturday.  on Salary when you put in your 2 week notice, when you receive your check you had the $2500 per month divided in to 30 days and only receive $83. per day on a 14 hour day. and you only get 3 days a week at 14 hours.  so in 3 days at $83 a day is $240 instead of $600.  Very Poor. Plus two of the Dealership owners are very vocal with using the F word throughout the day. doesn't care if their are ladies around."
good,Customer service is Allstate's number one priority.  The hardest part of the job is meeting people who have suffered a major loss in their lives with a fire or water claim.  I enjoy working with customers to put their lives back together.
good,"The workers are great, well most of them.  It could be the ideal job for someone if a staff member loosened up or was removed from the staff.  For the most part the office is full of team players..."
good,"The hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers. Doing reviews 90% of the people you are dealing with are upset because their rates have went up, they lost a discount, their policy is being company cancelled for failed home inspection or driving record. "
good,Local owned agency. Fast paced office/administrative work. Great owner and co-workers. Long hours but rewarding outcome and compensation for hard work given.
good,"This company specializes in catastrophe claims in the continental US. They are very flexible and supportive. "
good,"Great place to work, and they offer great training for continued growth. A company that invest in it's employees, along with teaching insurance knowledge."
good,"It does not matter how much education you have or how good of  job you do. If you are not on the ""My Favorite List"" forget advancing."
good,"Good company to work for especially if you live close to the Northbrook offices. Otherwise, the commute can be terrible and there  are no real mass transit options."
good,Making sure the client understands there coverage's driving on our California roads.
good,"loved the people and the company."
good,The culture of this company did not provide the mentoring necessary for the success of new agents. The primary emphasis was totally geared to production and very little was offered in career development.
good,Would rather not say. I writing this as filler to get past screen.
good,Management could be better and Compensation could be better.
good,Allstate is a great company that offers their customers great policies and coverage.
good,"I mainly worked from home selling insurance for Allstate.  However, they did have excellent training/motivational classes, which I got  a lot out of.  I enjoyed selling and teaching others my sales techniques."
good,Great 40 hours a week with good pay. I learned to be a good sales representative. Management was very friendly with no pressure for sales. My co-workers were nice and friendly competitive. The hardest part of my job was dealing with rowdy clients. The most enjoyable part of my job were flexible hours.
good,"I am an insurance agent/sales producer.  I sell auto, home, off the road vehicles, commercial polices and life insurance; I also did marketing, telemarketing, retain cancelations and filing I opened and closed the office and also do bank drops and cleaning"
good,I like what I do but there is no stable security when its no weather issues there is no work then there is lay offs. Looking for a stable position with benefits long term goals.
good,Working for Allstate Insurance has been a very fulfilling experience. Allstate Insurance has a great training program and leads system. They have many tools to help you succeed. The downfall is they do not have a very good benefits package or retirement plan. You will be sure to have 10-14 hour work days. The opportunity for advancement is not there as well. The management was wonderful and attentive. My co-workers were easy to work with. We functioned as a great team. Everyone was always there to help you with any questions or needs. The most enjoyable part of my job was my customers. I loved every one of my customers and had lasting relationships with all of them.
good,"Typical day is calling customers and going over their policies and answering questions and concerns they have about insurance. There is a lot of paperwork and documentation handling. I learn new stuff everyday as insurance always changes, also I learn on what is best for each individual person. Management is good and have weekly meetings to go over what is being done, we use teamwork as some coworkers are stronger in areas that others arent. Hardest part of my job is just dealing with insurance as rates and codes always change. Many people dont understand insurance, so that is a stressful part of my job but it can also be the most enjoyable to explain and help them understand."
good,Very supportive company when rates were competitive. When they were not aggressively would remove lower performers.
good,"The company has become more focused on the bottom line and less focused on the customer. Employees are provided benefits including health insurance, gym membership discounts, and recognition. On the other hand employees are expected to give up their family life to work late when for some this is not an option. The most enjoyable part of the the job was helping customers retrieve their deductables, the hardest was telling uninsured customers they had to find a way to pay for damages that we thought were their fault many of who didn't have the funds to pay for food let alone a $100,000 claim against them."
good,"During my 15 years with this employer I went from front office receptionist to office manager, and licensed producer. I built relationships that I still maintain to this day. I eventually began training all of our newly hired employees, was successful with state audits, performed daily banking and accounting for the business, The most satisfaction I received from this employer was feeling the pride I was indeed his right hand and I could do anything my boss could do, because he trained me well and I am very persistant to understand. My strength with this employer was my loyalty and my genuine affection for our clients. I truly cared for them and went above and beyond at times to please them. It was fulfilling."
good,"My work at a local Allstate agency for the past 6 years has been a great learning experience that has left me with a great wealth of knowledge to move forward. I handled incoming calls and occasional business to business with clients to review current policies and bind new business. I have an abundance of network professionals (mortgage brokers, processors, & realtors) that I work with on a daily basis quoting & writing new business. I have a close ration of 80% once contact is made with the prospective client. I'm very through and communcate to make sure all clients have a clear understanding of their policies & have a retention rate over 90%. I enjoy communicating with my clients and find the work rewarding assisting current and new clients."
good,"The benefits has to be the best part about working for this company. However, the compensation does not equal the amount of work. The job security can be low along with employee moral, and the two have a direct correlation. There are constant changes, that often directly affect the employee. One must be highly adaptable to change.The people are awesome and are what truly make the days go by quickly. If one is looking for advancements, the manager route would be most likely. Otherwise, one may find themself entry level for quite a while."
good,"I've learned how to manage multiple platforms to successfully meet hiring goals."
good,The people I worked with were awesome and willing to teach me new things. I learned a lot in the field of insurance while working here. I didn’t make much money but I was only interning. This job was a stepping stone for me but I wish I did better I could’ve made a lot of money.
good,Good people to work with.  They are flexible with working hours for appointments and so forth.  Good benefits that start day one so hard to complain about that.
good,I enjoyed my time at Allstate. Learned a lot about the insurance industry. Had the opportunity to experience working in a supportive environment. Made some lasting relationships with co-workers.
good,Great co workers nice and friendly environment. Easy to step goals. Great team lead managers. Love helping out our customers in the time needed. Great benefits.
good,the owner is where IThe owner was not very helpful made promises they did not keep however I'm sure working at another Allstate would be different and better
good,Great Position. Meeting standards is what allows the company to function. Allstate is a great company and I would be willing to work there again. Great services and agency management.
good,"I work for an agency with high flexibility for time"
good,Pto is good with this company. Work life balance is good. Remote work is a plus. Management is horrible but that can always change. Unless you are planning to move there is not much room for improvement.
good,"I helped a new agency owner start her Allstate agency in October 2018.  The education was a little disjointed.  Communication about life insurance commission structure is horrible.  I still do not know, nor does the agency owner know, what the commission compensation is for selling life insurance and we are more than a year in!  Prices seem to be stable and the extra programs provided to customers is really competitive."
good,Allstate is a good place to start a career the pay is okay. You deal with some cranky customers but you meet some awesome people along the way. Not a bad job.
good,"Working hand in hand with clients, insuring that there property casualty and life insurance need were met was a fun and challenging experience. It's nice to be helpful to your client."
good,Allstate has great benefits including PTO. Advancement is lacking and compensation is in lower quartile. It is a good place to learn and there are a lot of Employee reference groups
good,Allstate is a great company if you are looking for longevity and stability. Very welcoming culture but there is constant change so you would benefit in being a chameleon.
good,They give you the tools if you want to grow in the Insurance business. Very safe and comfortable place to work. Flexible hours and an engaging work place
good,"A typical day consisted of getting to work before 8am, answering any phone calls and directing them to the right sales person. Filing any and all paperwork in the correct files. I learned how to use multi-line phone to answer calls. I enjoyed working with amazing coworkers and helping the customers needs."
good,"It is Agile, you have to deliver within a week. It is a great company and people are helpful. If you are a team player, you can enjoy your work. I recommend."

good,Great place to work. Everyone is very friendly Not very good pay when I was there. Very good work and family balance. Always involved with the community.

good,Allstate was a great working environment. The people ad energy was great. I enjoyed everyone I worked with and the fact that we were able to be creative with our jobs
good,"Business opportunities are numerous. The concern is the charge back of commissions is what became a concern. Selling in a very competitive market requires immense efforts. Traveling long distance to see potential clients only to find out they were only ""checking"" but insisted I travel to their location was stressful. Having made the sale then finding out a few months later that the client had cancelled the policy made it difficult to manage personal finances as the initial commission for the sale would have to be charged back by the company. Inquiring with the customer that cancelled would determine they cancelled because they received a better rate from a discount insurance company. They did not understand nor cared that the coverage was not just cheaper but nowhere nears the level I was providing."
good,"Retired when my position went out of state. "
good,"Good company, no different than other insurance companies..good and bad. Work life balance is not good but you have to decide that you're going to have work life balance."

good,Had to be ready and logged on to all required software by 9 am because the phones would start ringing and we had to be ready to answer and screen call if it was a sales opportunity I would take the call to quote the prospect. If it was a service related call then I would transfer to our customer representative in office or get a message. Follow up on any unsold quotes to convert them into a new sale. Keep inventory of gift cards we would give out. Follow up on any pending emails. Keep track and make sure all documents were submitted in a timely manner. Take company laptop home in case I were to get a call from one of my many referral sources (mainly auto dealerships) and provide quotes on the spot.

good,"I love the agency I work in and am happy here. I am not a direct employee of Allstate. I am responsible to provide insurance quotes to potential clients, provide an explanation of how insurance coverage works for home, auto, umbrella, and other property and casualty lines. I also service current clients policies on a daily basis."
good,The Reneau agency was a good opportunity for me to learn all about the different types of insurances. The employees there are very knowledgeable and great people to work with.
good,Spent most days doing cold calling for more experienced agents.  would contact older leads in order to find people interested in getting a quote and pass them along.

good,My work schedule is flexible to allow for me to still enjoy life outside of work.  The culture is very team driven and allows for a lot of collaboration with others from own department and other areas of expertise.
good,"Same as most corporate environments - opportunity for more comprehensive leadership training for new leaders.  Pretty even mix of millenial workers and baby boomers, can make it difficult for project management."
good,Really loved the training and process when hired.  Learned a ton of introductory sales tactics. Once on the phones I loved the extra bonuses and little challenges/rewards that were offered on a weekly basis.
good,"The questions were a bit confusing.  The manager of my areas was very poor. That should not be a reflection of the company over all. they eventually discovered and corrected the issue.  "
good,I took this job on a half-day schedule while in my senior year in high school. The manager and his wife at this location were great people and taught me many things.
good,"You can do your job to the best of your ability, but if you're a temp or not ""different"" they won't keep you. They'll force you out by trying to make you work what you can't. Management is great."
good,I was a licensed sales agent.  I spent most of my day making cold calls.  I learned that I prefer to build relationships and meet with people face to face.  I enjoyed working with all my co workers and the owner of the agency.

good,"Really will depend on your experience at the individual agency. At my location, we had serious issues with agency management failing to adapt to changing market conditions, or just flat out not showing up. Personal insurance is struggling hard and most agency owners leave you to ""sink or swim""."
good,"-	Answered incoming calls "
good,Fabulous place to work. Small business office. Nice Clientele. Location was good. Management worked with you on any time off needs. Was a great part time job.

good,"I really enjoyed working at all state. My day started by calling different companies and discussed the benefits of switching over to All State. I loved the opportunity to be able to speak to different people everyday and develop a higher lever of listening skills."
good,"This is a call center environment. Understand what that means before you accept a position as you will be working odd hours in most cases while sitting at a cubicle surrounded by your colleagues. It's not a bad position, but it's not for everyone..."
good,Overall good culture and easy going place to work.  Good communication through the office and always had someone to go to if help was required.

good,"1. Provides you with multiple culture work environment."
good,"Inbound and outbound calls, open and complete tags,  the in and outs of insurance process, management was good not much interaction with upper managers. Direct supervisors were polite.  co-workers complained to much. Hardest part was telling a customer they did not have coverage.  Processing checks to customers"
good,"Working fornallstaye has been a mixed bag. This is due to the constant pressure from management to get sales numbers on the board.  If you sell well, then management loves you.  You will learn how to talk to people however."

good,Typically at work I would be tasked with data entry for the company. It allowed me to familiarize myself with digital technology on a regular basis. This job also allowed me to build a rapport with customers. The management and my co-workers was very encouraging and supportive of my ambitions both inside and out of work.
good,Working for Allstate NI was a good experience and I learned a lot of new IT skills there. On a typical day I would have to answer 30+ calls from Allstate insurance agents requiring technical support for their systems. There was a very friendly atmosphere on the call floor and the management were very helpful. Although I will say that the working hours are very unsociable and the opportunity to change them is very unlikely.
good,Allstate was a place a vast learning opportunity.  I learned that helping others can be very exciting and fullfilling. Management is very into their employees and care about the health and growth of each and everyone.
good,I filed stacks of papers and sorted the stock. Relatively simple/standard internship. Went once a week on Wednesday for 4 hrs.

I had awesome co-workers, we worked well together and included each other in all issues as well as making it a fun environment. The hardest part of the job was when you couldn't get an answer from upper management in a timely manner to satisfy the customer. All and all the job was very enjoyable as well as knowledgeable and I would still be there if my job had not been out sourced."

good,"If you're not going to make yourself work hard to make phone calls and sales, you won't be successful. In a typical day, a sales person makes 100-200 outgoing phone calls and talks to about 30 clients/prospects. Sales skills are valuable, but the training program can quickly get you up to speed"
good,Overall a good company to work for. Competitive salary and benefits. Very large company and a vast number of opportunities
good,"Working at Allstate requires a focus on customer impact, and customer service at all times.  Allstate is a very stable company to work for, and provides excellent PTO to its employees.  People who work at Allstate tend to stay for a very long time.  The work is at times  too focused on numbers as a result of being beholden to shareholders and having accountability that is only traced through numbers.  It is a large company, and therein it is hard to generate ideas and be noticed except through years and years of service.  As a newcomer to the insurance industry, it is a good place to gain experience."

I enjoy the office environment as it requires very little supervision. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the economy with rate changes and explaining them to customers who do not understand the industry and why rates might change.

good,Although I work through a temp agency. Allstate employers nor management  present the vibe of not being friendly towards you. As little as walking through the hallways; you will be faced with a smile or a greeting.
good,"Nice place to work, had a lot of employee perks, supportive staff"
good,I enjoyed working for a large direct writer company because it was a tiny bit easier than working commercial.  However they have at least 4-5 different companies they write and then all the restrictions keep you on your toes.  Mostly worked by my self and the agent but enjoyed servicing the customer just the same.

good,Working at Allstate was sometimes good but it also had some bad aspects. The management was good at times but sometimes they would get power hungry and there were too many people trying to be in charge at the same time. The staff was usually fine but there was alot of drama that some people liked to start.
good,"It was ok to work there only lasted a couple of months, I re-located to the East Coast. I already had experience thru my previous job. Management was ok and co-workers.

good,"The office in general had a lot of financial issues for the agency, but over all working for Allstate was a very productive experience helping and educating customers with their policy needs."
good,"Working at Allstate was a great opportunity to specialize in my field. I was really proud working for the the company, and had many opportunities to learn and grow while there"
good,"If you do what you are told in the process described, you'll do fine. The specifics of the position really depends on who you are working for as offices vary."
good,Working out of an agency is probably a lot different than working out of corporate office. The structures of the agency depended highly on the agent that ran it.
good,The agent I worked for was a full time CPA. He didn't really get involved on the Allstate side. It made it very tough because there was no leadership and little phone or walk in activity. If you have a good referral network this place is ideal.
good,"Compensation needs to be adjusted.  Almost impossible to make a living wage. Spend most of days dealing with customer service issues,  not enough time selling."
good,At entry level you are giving more responsibility than the actual adjuster . You may have pto but will get assurances because they dont have time available so if you dont plan days months a head you'll get points and will be fired
good,"I enjoyed the environment, I loved my coworkers, the boss was great and very personable, never had issues, very demanding and drawback commission was not beneficial alongside being a 1099 employee, it make work very stressful."

good,Allstate as a company is a great place to work. There are many benefits offered; if given an opportunity to utilize skillsets within your field of study.
good,It's a great place to work if you are single. The workload is hard if you have a family with active kids.  Personnel needs to be increased to lower the workload and help with the the life balance.
good,"I learned a lot about operating a business, hiring practices, training & sales. I feel that I could work in any organization, in management, education or HR, based on my relevant experience owning my own Allstate agency."
good,"As of late, Allstate has become stressful as they implemented new metrics to measure productivity without knowing the actual workflow.  management was poor as they just implement new tools without really understanding it.  Management seems to have favoritism towards onsite employees as I was a remote worker."
good,Offers good benefits and work life balance was great.My past experience working with the company was rewarding and enjoyable. Great place to work for.
good,Welcome clients and prospective clients to our office.Learning was constant during my time in this position as new programing and processes being put in place.  A wonderful group of people to work with.
good,It was ok i helped empty the trash been for the people who worked there. And that was about all i did there and go through papers for them and shred them.
good,Ok job.. Very peaceful  environment... Co worker  are graet to be around. They gave other opportunities  if you wanted  to learn.  Overall  it was a great place
good,"Allstate is a great place to work if you are looking for a stable work environment. Work/life balance is exceptional, especially if you have kids. Due to geogrpahic expansion of employee footprint, advancement opportunities are a bit limited"
good,Great learning experience which lead me to make a new career change. Used my time at Allstate to learn as much as I could and I am grateful for the experience.
good,"Allstate is a good and reputable company to work for. You have to be able to manage your time, and work well on your own-as their is not much micromanagement when you are a producer under a general agent."
good,"Allstate has plenty of opportunities for someone who works hard. You will definitely have to put in your time to grow in the company though. Also, relationship building is an important part of doing well at the company.  If you are not good at this, then this may not be the best place for you."
good,It would be a good place to work if the salary was better. The environment was relaxed. The work is steady and consistent to the job.  I would stay if payed more.
good,The company itself is not a horrible place. It is actually a great place to work as far as benefits go. Management in some departments are very unprofessional and everyone is passive when it comes to issues and concerns employees have.
good,"I love working for Allstate. I am very passionate about what I do. My biggest concern was that I wasn't able to see my family as much as I wanted, that's why I have to move forward."
good,"Allstate is a fun place to work. Work life balance is integrated in the work enviroment. Workforce is on the older side, with lots of years at Allstate."
good,"Each day was a challenge to meet our sales goals, but yet fun and enjoyable.  Although there were sales goals, we did our best to encourage and support one another to do what was best for our team and our customers."
good,Working for Allstate was great.  Management was good.  Willing to work around school schedules. It was a part - time position.  I was seeking full -time employment.
good,"I have learned a great deal in claims at Allstate, however the career advancements are slim as the majority of employees at Allstate are not yet retirement eligible."
good,"Good stable company. Good benefits. They do great things for the community. Nice atmosphere. Good work / life balance. "
good,The PTO is the highlight of this job. There are full benefits which are a little expensive but functional. The schedule is always changing and sometimes you have no say about your schedule changes. In addition to this it's hard to advance off the phones here. Once you do though you are good to go.
good,"Working at Allstate is great for the benefits, but you do need to be able to handle stress for this job. "
good,"Allstate is a good place to work, friendly atmosphere.  Managers are flexable should you need a day off of work.  Everyone gets along and they encourage family to work together."
good,I worked here for years. The culture has changed and not for the better. The job is extremely stressful. The managers now micro manage their employees.
good,"Allstate Canada is a pretty good place to work.  Most of the managers care about their employees and there are lots of hidden perks like a subsidized cafeteria, summer hours and onsite yoga classes."
good,"Each agency is independently owned, so your experience and pay will vary wildly depending on who you work for. Job security is also dependent on this, and unless you intend to one day buy the business from your current employer there is only so high it will take you. That being said the experience is good and can certainly lead to other positions either within the corporate sphere of Allstate, or other insurance companies that will have more upwards mobility."
good,"The office job was great overall. I did not have a great experience with the agent who hired me because I was initially promised advancement that never came. Maybe others have better experiences working for Allstate. Unfortunately, I did not."
good,"It’s a nice place to work and I would recommend someone applying to the position. Most of the positions are contract positions when it comes to recruiting, but I would not let that deter me if I am serious about adding experience to my resume. Overall it is a new type of talent acquisition as well as a break from the norm as far as office culture."
good,"Allstate was the first real job I had outside of being a cashier. I loved my boss, loved what i did, enjoyed helping people in need. Loved learning knew things on a daily basis."
good,Rather not say. New management leaves something to be desired.If I did not have to put more. I rather put nothing. But trying to post my resume and it is required.
good,"I have worked with this particular agency for almost 6 years.  I answer most of the phone calls, servicing all policies.  I also, service any walk-ins with payments or any policy changes.  I also make contact with customer for insurance reviews of their policy renewals. Daily bank deposits.  "
good,The company has great people with a lot of experience however management can be disorganized and they are constantly going through changes in processes.
good,You come in and sell insurance with leads from a third party vendor like TP USA. You try to convert those leads into sales and then close on that sale.
good,"A typical day at Allstate is assisting customers and potential customers. I have learned a lot about how  insurance works. The Allstate Corporate office is great and very helpful, and customer friendly. The hardest part of this job is closing the sale, and most enjoyable is when you do close the sale."
good,"Review various types of insurance policies for issues."
good,I worked for a sub contractor for Allstate. It was a very fast pace and competitive. You never knew when you would be cut. I loved helping and working with the people affected by the hurricane.
good,"Sales and Service agent licensed in 50 states, worked with multiple systems to quote and service customer policies. Management was the greatest challenge it was a new call center in San Antonio and there were changes to the way we were managed from week to week."
good,"A lot of on the phone, at the desk work."
good,"I work 18 hrs/week which was fine starting out, but I would prefer full time with a higher hourly pay or higher pay per items(commission). And lack of direction is a big problem because there is a transfer of ownership happening, but no ""boss"" on the premises currently.  Also there's no leads being purchased, no community outreach, or networking program instituted with local social clubs."
good,"I answered phones, made changes to customer's policies, applied payments to policies, gathered information for agent to produce a policy quote, and assisted in filing claims."
good,"Calling customers, wrinting policies, discussing and helping customers understand policies."
good,"Allstate is a good company, but unless located in Chicago area, becoming a VP or higher is not a possibility.  The company limits itself with good talent as a result."
good,With Allstate for almost 10 years. Medical is good as far and company benefits go. just not any room for growth. People are very nice and friendly. It was a good company to start with.
good,"Fast paces and competitive, no room for advancement poor pay schedule,no benefits, no paid time off. commission was very low percentage. not likely to return to insurance have worked for over 3 years"
good,"Company was sold during my tenure.  Internet usage began during my tenure, changing the workplace dynamic.  Company began to cut staff and HR departments followed suit, scaling the model down.  During my tenure, I handled staffing, training, and community outreach."
good,"I enjoyed my job at Allstate. My only complaint was that they were generous with PTO, however it was difficult to schedule time off and you were relegated to take your vacation at times the didn't fit with your family's time off.  You could never take time off at holidays, spring break or summers."
good,"The insurance business is very competitive and time consuming "
good,"Allstate is a solid company and a good place to start a career. "
good,"Decent place to work. A lot of work to actually do. Wages not as competitive as other companies the same industry. If you are very very hard working, driven, focused, time oriented you will do well."
good,"Conducive Environment, productive and fun. Nice employees, people are willing to help.  It's a good workplace, about 10 calls a day. Nothing is really hard."
good,"Allstate in general is an awesome company to work for. However depending on YOUR AGENCY OWNER will be what influence's how competitive you aim to be. If you have an owner who is there and encourages you, which I was blessed to have with my last agency, then you'll advance!"
good,"I really like my position at Allstate, I love what I do, however, it's way too political to advance in many departments.  It's really about who you know and not what you have achieved in the exempt roles.  I don't feel like upper management listens to their leaders.  The culture is very diverse and it's what you would expect for a call center environment. The hardest part of my job is the inconsistency in work/life balance when it comes to work schedule, the most enjoyable part is being able to have a direct impact on the employees performance"
good,"Good company, strong ethics, supportive culture, solid work/life balance.  Medical office, pharmacy, store, cleaners and car service on property. Nursery school also on premises."
good,"You will get the opportunity to see the country on Allstate's dime, but you will be living in a hotel 20 out of 28 days a month. Great job if you don't have, or want, a family life."
good,"Overall its good money, but at what cost? Oftentimes, you have to do your work as well as others. If you want to move into management you have to take on extra work in addition to yours work with no additional pay. Also, there is a lack in organization and no proper training. The turnover is high for these reasons among others. This just may be the office and not the company."
good,Management will stand over you and nag about procedures that they are even unclear about. Micromanagement is the worst but job security was a plus. Co workers were neither here nor there. Its work.
good,Work load has increased and benefits have decreased.  I would continue working if they were willing to address changes that corporate has made.   Unfortunately in the corporate world change is slow.
good,"This is a good place to work, but salary is a little low overall.  Every job is stressful but the compensation should be higher here to make up for the enormous stress put on everyone."
good,Wonderful experience. Lots of room for growth.  Lots of work.  Fast-paced.  Great place to network.  Managers are very collaborative.  Awesome culture.
good,"I'm able to work on my schedule with minimum or without supervision, just keep in mind our daily, weekly and monthly goals if we working in a new project always receive training or we can proposal the best way to drive the new activity."
good,"IT IS ALL ABOUT THE PEOPLE I SERVICE."
good,They care about their employees and show it with almost weekly appreciation related things. They do lots of teambuilding and teamwork competitions to keep things alive in the office. It was both a fun and fulfilling company to work for and would have loved to stick around.
good,Fast paced and busy. A competitive work environment. Sometimes busy to the point that it is hard to get to take a break or a lunch. Other than that I enjoyed talking with people on the phone and helping them to select benefits for themselves and their family.
good,"Opportunity to grow, self determined commission. Needs better benefits and higher pay for experienced agents. "
good,"Working Tech Support for Allstate can be difficult. Tensions can be high as the requirements on the callers are demanding. This is often passed on to Tech's shoulder. "
good,I had a job that kept me busy which was good. I did not have to sit at a desk all day. I got to move around the office for different job performances I did. Good job training program but managers gave raises based on favorites and not performance.  Big manager turnover.
good,"Purchased a book of business for an Allstate insurance agency.  Supervised two employees and managed all office duties."
good,"Working at the Allstate Insurance Agency I work in is pleasant and not high pressure, but there is also no room for advancement, and no job benefits other than a 2 week vacation."
good,"Good schedules "
good,It's a good place to get experience but its not somewhere you can make a career out of. There aren't really any opportunities for promotions or a raise.
good,"My day starts at 10AM, as i am a part-time employee. The great thing is that my weekends are to myself."
good,"It is a challenging job as most people who are coming in have either been in an accident, home problems or trying to pay their bills.  This is similar to being a medical office because most customers aren't happy when they are calling in.  Co workers are very nice and workable.  I enjoy seeing a claim or inspection go through for my customers."
good,"•	Responsible for the administrative support to the Agent. Management of interns including, task delegation and scheduling. Oversee daily operations of high volume insurance agency."
good,"Being given great flexibility I arrive early and have a plan for my day. Claims being what they are the plan must be adjusted based on individual needs during the day but having a plan has enabled me to excel in my work. "
good,the co-workers here at veritas are so friendly and cool. We used to work as a good team in a friendly atmosphere and used to help each other at work
good,"Independent agency with a good working environment.  No benefits, health insurance, nor stability in this marketplace was available."
good,"There is a great culture at Allstate where training is intense but the result is knowledgeable employees. There is a environment there that I have not seen anywhere else. The attendance policies, the flexibility, the incentives and financial options are all the things that can make an working at Allstate a unique and valuable experience."
good,"Same company, the only thing that changes is your job function and management. I have learned a lot working at Allstate and the numerous positions I have held."
good,Allstate is a great place to start your career because of the flexibility of working in a smaller capacity agent. Much more room for you to go at your own pace. Good products but limited lines of business. Management can be fickle depending on the office you're in. Overall it's a good employer with a strong brand.
good,"Training is rudimentary and management was not well versed in claims practices. However, pay was fairly competitive and the working hours allowed for work/life balance."
good,"A typical work day is not just 8 hours, which is not a Con at all. I have learned how to handle clients according to the client's behavior. Each coworker is different depending on their personalities. I have experienced some very wonderful coworkers as well as some not so pleasant coworkers but, that does not determine my work ethic. Work ethic is a very important attribute to me. The hardest part of my job is being so far from home. Currently I am over an hour away from home and I would prefer to be within 45 minutes of home to reduce travel time. What I enjoy most about my job is the opportunity to create strong and trusting relationships with clients."
good,"The way this company and their offices operates the workplace is great.  The positions here allow employees to keep work in the office and not take it with us when off the clock.  It is very flexible there as far as requesting days off, days switches, vacations, etc.  The position I work in, though, is very intense--it is not an easy job; however, the compensation is what makes me continue to work as hard I have been, and strive for even better.  The job and company overall is definitely customer service driven and focused.  Having to investigate liability from a car accident, and delivering the not so good news when someone is found responsible for a loss is one of the most challenging part of this job.  Also, if you are not organized and fail to properly time manage, you will have a very hard time succeeding in this position."
good,Great place to work; Flexible work schedule & great co-workers; Great atmosphere and close to home. We work four ten hour days with three days off.
good,"A typical day in the work at the Olson agency is to be a full servicing adviser to our clients in the current book of business. In addition to servicing the current book, working with new clients and adding to the existing book is what is where you get to grow your own business within this industry. "
good,I liked the level of excitement to the sale. The pace of the work was quick and made my time go by very quickly. I both made and received calls at a high volume.
good,"Not what I expected.  Retail hours and not a 9-5 Monday through Friday job.  Pay is less than acceptable.  Red tape and lots of politics.  "
good,Developed Technical skills by taking enrollment tools and resources to clients (producers and agents). Did this by simplifying complex technology so clients could easily use it for greater production and profitability.
good,I have been working different Allstate Agents for 20 years- The best part about my job is protecting families - helping people when they have a claim.
good,"My job consist of answering emails, faxes regarding balancing out accounts to ensure the different service providers have been paid appropriately. If we owe them additional funds and issue new checks or virtual credit card payments. Then I also receive the invoice to document what the payments went to. The hardest part is sometimes making the providers send me the invoices."
good,Great place to work but no benefits only Vacation. alot of calling customer 100 calls a day. A lot of pressure to sale. Hours is great and co-worker great.
good,"Overall experience was good.  Great opportunity to learn insurance at an entry level.  Very little room for advancement in the Atlanta area however, plenty of room to advance in Northbrook IL"
good,Love the atmosphere.  Just not enough volume for me to make the kind of commission i need to be making.  make cold calls and internet leads to try and close on business.  Always try to multi line to make the most money.  Just wish it was busier
good,"Our office is a 2-CSR office and 1 agency owner.  Since being with Allstate I have advanced in sales and production.  The hardest part of the job are the leads we have to work with.  Most lead information is 5+ years old which presents a problem with phone numbers, email addresses, addresses, etc."
good,"fun place to work if you enjoy insurance, they are good about letting you have in-work activities"
good,"-managed a team of sales agents"
good,Should look into employee aspirations.Should provide different and new learning opportunities to resources for their growth as well as organization's growth
good,very enjoyable speaking with different customers all around the world
good,"Excellent co-workers and a very strong term, very productive and busy office"
good,"Good place to work but a little bit of an ""old school"" culture."
good,"I've learned many things working with Allstate, such as but not limited to customer service, efficiency, team work and time management. "
good,Great atmosphere. Hard to advance here in Yuma. Enjoyed my work days there.
good,"Working at Allstate gave me an array of business tools and skills. As an Underwriting Assistant, I performed many different office duties such as planning fundraisers, ordering supplies, organizing office events and assisting management in their day-to-day needs. I also acquired a basic knowledge of the insurance industry and was responsible for organizing and processing endorsements, inputting applications, and writing and authorizing letters of experience."
good,Loved working with the team. Allstate is great at rewarding members for a job well done.  Fun place to work.
good,"Assist on collecting payments from other insurance companies and customers. "
good,"Taking care of client problems and helping to get them the right coverage for their particular needs is paramount.  Co-workers are excellent team players.  The hardest part of the job is following a script, it seems too impersonal.  Developed my communication skills to the next level."
good,"Really like Allstate as a whole but the customers are can be difficult., I enjoy the challenge of turning people frown upside down."
good,"	Excellent Team Management Skills with good business acumen, effective communicator, good team mentoring, training skills. "
good,"A typical day is talking to numerous clients about the their policies.  The hardest part is listening to everyone complain about their rates,  The best part is when you can tell clients that Allstate will be there for them at time of loss and they are happy with claim service."
good,"If you can handle being on the phones for 8 hours a day then this is a really good company to work for. The customers you speak with are caring and nice, you do not get overworked and the people are great to be around."
good,"Ive worked with allstate for 4 years, "
good,"Marketing and customer Service- Promoting services generating new customers. Call new and existing clients. Answering phone calls."
good,"Gained a lot of transferrable experience in customer service, insurance, and sales."
good,My job was eliminated.  It is a good company to work for in general.  I made a career change that ended up costing me a position.
good,Worked in a small office enviroment with very nice co-workers.  I learned how to review life insurance policies.
good,"•	Prepare all letters and manage all correspondence with all existing and prospective clients."
good,"enjoyed my time and the people I worked with here, great company, no complaints"
good,This position was my entry into the insurance world. I learned the basics of working in an office and my introduction to insurance here.
good,Sales driven company it is an excellent place for someone who enjoys competing with co-workers and being pressed to make aggressive sales.
good,Working at Allstate I had the opportunity to use there online education to expand my knowledge in Insurance.  Typical work day was coming in and greeting new clients. Also introducing our services to new clients. This was a two person business me and the owner. Very pleasant man to work with. I really don't have anything bad to say about working at Allstate Ins. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning more about the insurance business. 
good,"A good company with a lot of great people. Good salary and benefits.  Long hours.  But the experiences and hard work gave you great life experience, and taught you to handle whatever came at you in life!  Thank you, Allstate.    "
good,"Customer Service back office support is key to the interaction with both the Allstate agent and customer. Balancing servicing the customer with a high level of requests in a performance based environment can be challenging with a diverse staff and limited system support. Front line management balances needs of both customer and staff, along with numerous project meetings to improve processes and compliance issues, while also being available for staff. Advancement opportunities are limited, and skills of staff are not utilized fully."
good,My co-workers are friendly and I enjoy my work. The hard part is getting there and getting home as my commute is an hour each way.
good,"worked there for a number of years. alot of changes, mostly for the better but not all the time. typical work day consisted of inbound/outbound calls, everyday tasks that needed to be done to complete with assisting other co-workers."
good,"Maintaining a team of employees, providing great customer service, making sure all employees are on task and staying productive, cash register, handling deposit slips for the bank, and doing the daily essentials for management position."
good,"It's an insurance agency with a large book of business, lots of walking traffic and customer service required. It has helped me develope in a broader clientel base and cater to every type of customer, from blue collard to white collard. A very detailed oriented work enviroment with a professional staff. It has its challenges when mediating between customer and company representatives but it pays off when you have made both parties content."
good,I enjoyed my time at Allstate. I learned a lot and it was one of the most professional places I have ever worked at. The management stood for something and although they did not always make the best decisions I enjoyed my time there. A typical day was definitely one that contributed to the bottom line of the company. The consistently found ways to motivate their employees which always benefits the bottom line. I learned a lot about doing things you can to become a better person professionally and personally. I felt without having my bachelor's degree I had reached my potential at Allstate at the time I left but I do not have regrets and I still have them for insurance.
good,"I enjoyed my job at Allstate. The hardest part was the cold calling but everything else was peachy! I took calls, made them, took payments, ran insurance quotes... I did everything not requiring a license."
good,Allstate Insurance as Coop program:
good,Beyond the forementioned a great place to work. Great place for family lif.
good,I think it was a great place to work. I was very sad when the job ended.
good,"Depends on what your position is wihin the company it can be at times stressful, trying to meet quota's, handling time, etc. The job provides an abundance or training and most can be carried over outside of the job. The mangement was diverse, so knowledgeable about the profession, others no so much. The co-workers were easy to get along with and since the call center had just been established everyone came in on the same level and were able to grow together."
good,"Great co workers! Always dependable and good to get along with, but company is starting to change and take cut backs which has affected everyone."
good,"This was a fun first job, learned alot about telemarketing and people in general. The management/owner was very flexible with my schedule since I was in school and more than fair with my compenstation."
good,"I served customers over the phone and I person, taking payment, arranging and maintaining files in order to promote sale for local agent, and perform a variety of clerial duties to maintain the office day to day operations."
good,"My boss was like a grandpa, very nice and understanding. School always came first. Didn’t mind if you left a little early every once in awhile as long as your work was done. Wants sales up but also understands it can be hard some months."
good,Allstate has a great training program for new adjusters. They truly take the time to make sure you know how to handle insurance before having you handle them. The pay could be much better as it is currently under the average salary of an insurance adjuster.
good,Allstate Insurance has been a great company to work for and be involved with for the past seven years.  I have learned a wealth of knowledge about insurance and also the variety of ways you can interact with customers.  I currently travel frequently in my current role and I am looking for more work/life balance.
good,Allstate is a great company to work for. Their rates aren't the best and it poses some problems some months but overall everything is great. Corporate helps you really well with irate customers.
good,Good company but satisfaction differs depending on the agent. Sales and service skills are essential and corporate provides training and incentives.  Base salary plus commission.
good,Mgt is good from the standpoint of being relaxed and flexible. Job morphed from half purchased hot leads and half cold calling to 100% cold calling within 8 months of starting.
good,Professional work environment. Provides ability to develop ones skills to align with employees professional goals.  Daily strong work ethic with self management abilities.
good,"3yrs in total."
good,Great pay for Yuma area with pension and 401k benefits. Excellent job security worked there for 5 years. Would recommend to other prospect applicants.
good,"Great Organization, but you need to be proactive about who you work for. The culture of each business unit is very different. Some are very open and laid-back, others still think they're grinding like a 90s insurance organization. There is a resistance to change in some parts of the company which causes them to lag behind the enterprise as a whole. Plenty of opportunity for someone who wants to be in a change-management situation."
good,High volume sales and customer service job. Very laid back environment as long as sales goals were met. The hardest part of the job for me was trying to balance work and home life with a family. I have a home office and frequently brought work home with me. The job for me was very enjoyable i was very good at it and made a lot of money.
good,A great company to work for with competitive pay and benefits. Balanced work and home enviornment but understand the typical work day requires more than 8 hours.
good,"I left to finish college and because of military deployments. However, I learned the most and made the most money in my civilian career underneath the Allstate family umbrella."
good,"Allstate is a large company that has every type of technology that you can imagine. This includes mainframe Cobol to Artificial Intelligence for data analysis.  "
good,Incredible group of people to work with. However it is an entry level sales position so compensation is not the greatest. I enjoy working here and would recommend it for anybody looking for a flexible schedule.
good,"Benefits & pay raises could be better."
good,"Service commercial insurance policies. "
good,Pretty routine work environment on a day to day basis.  There could be more variety within the position along with a faster track for advancement. Work culture is good.
good,"Keep your eye on the ball, don't miss a day, care about protecting your clients and be there for them, sell them yourself, not the product, you can't sell price when it's higher then some others."
good,"Worked for Allstate seasonally. Was very professional work place and employees. Learned how to up sale. Staff was very supportive and patient with new hires on the team."
good,"The atmosphere at work is average, co-workers are professional. I assume to say I am learning more from this company. I do not tend "
good,"The overall work place was pleasant and convenient. The were plenty of amenities as far as cafeterias, nursing facilities and a gym on campus to accommodate employees. The was also several contest and festivities throughout the year to keep employees engaged and help with moral."
good,"I could have gone far, they were going to train me to be an insurance agent, and even pay for my education, but I was in a really rough time in my life, and screwed that all up."
good,"good compensation, good people to work with, mostly all your needs to be successful are provided for you. always people to help you and yea thats about it"
good,"I learned alot during my time with Allstate Benefits and enjoyed meeting alot of other employees who were helpful to me."
good,working at all state feels very good with good management and culture and security with all the benefits it has food environment and good working environment
good,"Pleasant working environment. Pay starts kind of low, but there are quarterly reviews for raises anywhere from 0.01-1.00. Good place to work with good people."
good,Working for a captive Agent is unique because the Agent's perks were offered by the agent based off earnings achieved by Captive contract.  Allstate offered plenty of support for an Agent to strive for success.
good,I thought that Allstate did a great job with all aspects of management and pay however sales were focused on to extremely. Also current clients were almost put on the back burner as compared to new or potential clients.
good,I find that is very restrictive in the customers that you can sale policies to. Very little range of approval. Past customers complaint that their rates were increased after years of being insured with them.  Commissions are small.
good,"learned extensively about insurance, both day-to-day activity management as well as sales and promotions.  focused on time management, prioritization and working well with insureds, risk management and supervisors/managers."
good,For the most part the agency managers and owners are nice to work for with the exception of a few.  They focus on training and helping you to become proficient in the areas and offer training via work shops and webinars.
good,"Allstate Appraisal, L.P. has very knowledgeable managers and staff, and the experience with them has made me a better appraiser. I would recommend working at Allstate to anyone who has a strong work ethic and can be efficient in their appraisal review process."
good,The environment is contingent upon the Agent/Owner.  Therefore most offices are independently owned.  If you have the right owner it could be a great culture to work in.
good,This is a very competitive and busy company. They are growing and offering an incentive for home/auto bundle discounts that are very adjustable and helpful to saving money.
good,The company's overall strategy is geared towards innovation and changing the face of insurance industry. It's always at the cutting edge in improving customer experience.
good,"I wish the job had been permanate. I really liked the hours, staff and type of work."
good,"Just a great environment to work in. Had fun with everyone and made good money while using my skills. Gained a lot of experience to carry on with me throughout, the good and bad. Overall awesome experience and a great place."
good,It's cool to work here. I believe allstate has a lot of job and learning opportunities but there is a lot to learn before joining. The hardest part of the job was that i didnt know anything and didnt even bother to tell me i had to take a state exam til like 10 days before the exam.
good,"Learned a lot of claims experiences, great workplace culture and co-workers.  Hardest part of the job is they keep putting additional responsibilities. Management made a decision to relocate to Chandler AZ not a convenient location for all.  Reason was a better talent pool."
good,"It is a great place to be at for a long time. However, it is easy to get lost in the shuffle and there is a ton of busy work that goes on. You can work your heart out on an initiative, and then find out that it was not really on anyone's radar, so it gets dropped, turns everyone into a bit of a zombie after a while. Its sad since the company is full of amazing smart people in middle management that has just gotten tired of trying, but not getting notices, so they stopped trying,"
good,I enjoyed working with Allstate and if the timing was better I would of loved to have passed the exam and became a licensed agent myself. But I lost my dad in a traggic motorcycle accident May 7th 2017
good,"Allstate is a good company, but has also turned to micromanagement.  Management should also give top performers opportunity for advancement, and not their friends!"
good,"Depending on which company you work for Allstate is a fun and great place. It can occasionally be disorganized and their aren't many benefits, but great all around. You have to be very organized and able to multi-task for this job."
good,"Very positive place to work, with decent hours and a lot of other co workers to connect with. many advancement opportunities as well.  you felt very valued and listened to"
good,The agent I worked for was very caring about his clients and me as an employee. He had no problem taking time to teach me something new or help if I had a problem.
good,"There is a lot happening here and it is a great place to work in a large company environment. A mix of technologies, talent, initiatives and a sense for growth profitably"
good,Allstate loves to grow great insurance leaders. Most locations are Monday - Friday which leaves time for a personal life. The biggest flaw is in the benefits system. Allstate does not offer benefits but this is common among insurance agencies.
good,"My experience at Allstate has been great!  The owner is excellent to work with and is very flexible with working hours.  "
good,"Nice agency office, good location. Working with a great team of people."
good,I worked as a temporary employee starting with 3 hour daily and had a good manager who was very supportive . Hours were flexible and the commute was not far from home.
good,"Allstate's culture promotes transparency, helping each other, growing, caring, challenging and winning. It's rich in traditional culture while shifting to compete in the technology industry. Allstate isn't just an insurance company!"
good,Enjoyed my co workers but very long hours and weekends. Management was very involved in the development of employees emphasis on customer service-good benefits
good,It was a part time position (evening) in a call center that eventually closed. The purpose was to assist customers with billing and policy information after hours.
good,They are out sourcing from Nebraska. The are not hiring from Illinois. They have been laying off due to budget cuts. Eventually they everyone will be working from home.
good,"Heavy workload, fast paced.  Good management, though occasional micro management.  Good training and technology, though low staff support.  Quality and quantity expectations seemed to vary by manager."
good,I owned my insurance agency and it became very competitive that in the end it was no longer an ideal place for me to work and continue on with my career.
good,"quick paced industry"
good,"Worked from 8:30-5:30 M-F."
good,"Worked in the De Zavala call center in San antonio, TX before they closed the center. Started off with a lot of high energy, Calls were promising and bonuses were attractive. A few months in, calls start to decline, 30-45 min between calls. Bonuses were affected, leading to a lot of turn over. They moved teams to outbound campaigns involuntarily. And eventually dissolved most of the teams and let go of all the trainers. I left before getting layed off."
good,Good company but was limited to insurance offerings because of underwriting guidelines. Had to forward any commercial business to corporate that we were not compensated for.
good,"Great company, great management, opportunity to advance and hold different job positions if you perform well.  Compensation was average. Benefits were average, but a bonus pension."
good,"A good company to work for if you are content with being in one place. Additionally, the pay is somewhat limited. The agency, I worked for, was very friendly and a great atmosphere."
good,not applicable - i do not with to leave a review of my company. i am typng this to take up one hundred and fift character so i can move on from this review.
good,Independent agencies owned by Individual people. Very nice.  All agents have rules of their agency to follow and Allstate general guidelines to follow.
good,"Great company, competitive pay, Immature management, cut throat. I think that the company is in the position to allow more weekends for the employeees"
good,So far I really like it. I am learning a lot. There is great training programs during your first 3 weeks. It really helps you learn about the company. My agency manager is very nice. Everyone in the office is all about sales but they are more concerned with making sure our customers are taken care of in the event of a loss.
good,"You are required to be a quick learner. Although help is available when needed, it is asked that you make your own search before asking. This can be a stressful job, but can also be rewarding."
good,"I worked for Allstate for 11 years.  During that time I was paid very well for the work that I performed.  I would go back to Allstate in a heartbeat for the pay. I worked for Encompass, the old CNA Insurance the entire time that I was an employee.  I started out in Book Transfers which consisted of preparing quotes for agents to compare Encompass premiums against their own agency premiums.  I was then forced to move to Encompass Manual along with ten other members of my Book Transfer team member because they needed to lessen the head count of our team.  Manual is a team that handles the changes that the endorsement team makes to a policy.  Our team was responsible for accurately debiting and crediting premium changes for those endorsements to the policies after the endorsements had been made.  I am one of the few book transfer team members that was able to keep my job and move on to another team within Encompass.  Most of our other team members lost positions because we weren't adequately trained to perform the Manual job function.  I moved from Encompass Manual to an Encompass Terminated Agent team and after a falling out with one of the trainers on that team, I was placed back on Encompass Manual.  Thankfully, something ""clicked"" and my quality increased drastically.  I worked successfully on the Encompass Manual team until I moved to the Encompass Project Support Team in 2011.  I was on that team until my position was eliminated in 2016."
good,"Great place to work. Very supportive and caring co-workers. Very nice set pay schedule. Unfortunately, schedule does not allow for flexibility needed for regular appointments."
good,Poor Management from top to bottom. People were in place that had no experience with the issues at hand. No future thinking just immediate gratification.
good,A typical day I am busy from the moment I walk in until the moment I leave.  In order to make a good salary I need to stay bus.  I also need to be able to multi task.  Sometimes the hardest part is to do all you would like to do in one day.  I have been in sales for many years and I have been realized that you must send out a lot call out a lot and quote a in order to make good money.
good,"Everything about this company was great, EXCEPT management. Managers did not support their staff and caused friction amoungst staff due to their gossiping."
good,"Was a call center position worked a early day shift. Good place to work nice benefit package with a 401K, Pension and medical. Good chance to advance. Did also provide 3 weeks vacation first year."
good,Assisted bilingual customers with insurance needs.  By being an active listener I was able to learn about specific insurance needs for each customer.  Team leaders were reliable and and motivating.  The company went from professional casual to casual and then relaxed  which took away from the seriousness of the job.  Schedule was fixed and set for 1 year.  Bonuses made this job exciting and kept yo focused.
good,Good work life balance with opportunity to work on new technologies. Opportunity to meet onsite counterparts. Transportation is provided free of cost.
good,"When you talk about insurance, customers have several opinions. As a competitive business you have to call all day in order to get your goals. It is hard but what sales job is not hard?"
good,"na"
good,"Just understand that you are never caught up on your work.  The faster you learn to do your job, the more they will give you to do.  If you are ambitious, you can work your way into better pay and more responsibility.  This job is not for everyone.  It can be very stressful because you are dealing with customers that are generally stressed out.  It was not for me because I could not sit at a desk all day, but for those who can, its a great job."
good,"I love the people I work with and even though this job has its ups and down, I appreciate the support that I receive from my team. This job is really stressful and it requires a strong individual"
good,I enjoyed the training program. It was lengthy and information and the trainer was amazing. It is a call center for which I feel just isn't the best fit for me.
good,Awesome experience and different work inviroment  thanks for giving me a chance looking forward to many more adventures if provided with opportunity great wroke
good,A lot of opportunity to work as a team. Production floor layout supports a team environment. Met daily as a team to review prior day performance metrics.
good,Good place to gain experience but no training is given . Management does not care to train employees. A lot of false promises given no intention to follow through.
good,"Working in an Allstate call center is a fast-paced but rewarding experience.  Since they use the most current technology it is a good place to gain call center management experience.  The pay is fair, the benefits are good,and the environment is competitive but positive."
good,Great benefits.  Lots of paid time off.   Relaxed working environment.  Close to everything.  Flexible working arrangements.  Work from home options.   Lot of Job opportunities but its hard to move from one unit to the other
good,Like anything else you take out as much as you put in. If you want to stay at entry level just do whats asked of you and fulfill your job description. But if you want to see promotions lead by action.
good,Being a Certified Insurance Agent requires a lot of patience and focus. Definitely a demanding job with the number of clients you have to handle and also issues you have to job in one day. Requires a lot of communication with your peers to ensure that the customer is taken care of if you are ever absent. But it prepared me with proper work etiquette.
good,"Good place safe and secure but not innovative.  Job opportunities are available but you have to seek them out and Prokopeak proactive you are definitely the CEO of your own career multi city locations so travel is available."
good,"Great culture and decent benefits, but compensation is not as good as other companies. I would recommend working for Allstate if you don't mind getting paid a little less for a good work life balance and environment."
good,Everyday is a learning experience. Management is always willing to help.  Everyone work together to keep the morale of each team. The environment is great.
good,I liked working here - especially because my family owned the Allstate Agency I worked at. I learned a lot about the Insurance Business and I would recommend the job to anyone.
good,Great company with decent perks and pay. Culture changes depending on the department you work for and that could be a good thing or a bad thing based on your personality.
good,"Was a great company to work for until the company went public and they got a new CEO,who came from SEARS with his own ideas of saving money by taking away contract/agreement Agents were hired under and took away benefits. Introduced quota system while taking away ability to sell Homeowner insurance and putting stringent underwriting conditions for new business making it harder to sell other forms of insurance.    Enjoyed educating public on their insurance needs while saving them money where I could.  Working in my own office and controlling my own staff was an advantage."
good,"Primary responsibility of selling and brokering Allstate products and determining cross sell opportunities with customers who already have policies in force. New customers are generated through personal relationships, walk-ins, or purchased lead lists. Next steps include relationship and rapport building and excellent customer service; eventually becoming the “trusted advisor” to the client, while finding ways to round out complete coverage by selling life insurance, umbrella coverage, and/or commercial coverage."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Allstate and will miss the people.  With all of the changes happening, I hope management remembers to keep their employees informed."
good,"Work day to day was regular, my position required a lot of the same work. Main responsibilities included secretarial work, administrative support, filing, and organization. This position was unique to my Allstate location, as it was family-owned and lacked an organization system. There were less than 10 employees at my location, and it was very intimate atmosphere. Hardest part about the job was keeping energy up, and keeping engaged - then again the position wasn't exactly exciting. The easiest part of the job was the management, my supervisors were clear and friendly, and had direct objectives."
good,Allstate product is competitive and offers some very enticing coverage options.  Make sure you work in an established office opposed to a new agency.  The only issue I have come across is lack of focus and direction with many new owners.
good,"I've worked with Allstate for over 16 years.  It is a great place for work/life balance.  However, advancement at this company can be very difficult if you work in Scheduling/Production Control area."
good,The owners are good people and do the best they can to accomodate their employees. Some days are stress free and then other days can be stressful and very busy which can be a learning process and fun
good,We sold property and casuality insurance with a focus on homeowners products. Life and Health business was referred to an outside agent.
good,"Gives good benefits, relaxed work place."
good,"Whether starting from scratch, buying into an existing agency, or working underneath an agent. Allstate as a company gives you all the tools you need to be successful. Individual experience can vary with each Agent/Agency, but overall the company takes their Good Hands promise seriously."
good,"My typical day work is about a great workplace that you can build  on a day-to-day relationships that employees and clients can experience and enjoy. "
good,Allstate is fair with their products and transparent with their employees.  Their focus on Continuous Improvement and its process is impressive.
good,"Great work life balance, job security is great but advancement can be difficult.  Location is ideal for suburbans who live close - reverse commutes can be overwhelming.  Management is great, but can be difficult to advance."
good,a typical day at work is taking over 60 calls assisting customers with policy changes and billing questions. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to provide and effortless experience to all customers and hearing them say how much we`re appreciated. the hardest part of the job is not having any work life balance.
good,This position requires someone who is completely sales oriented and does not mind putting in a lot of hours to build someone else's business. You would have to actually become an agent to move up.
good,"I have been with Allstate for a little under 1 year. It is a fantastic company to work for as far as training, development and transparency. It is also very ""open door"" like as I have conversations daily with various managers and higher-ups and it is always welcome. Very much lead by example. "
good,"I loved my job, wanted to keep it, but systematic restructuring eliminated thousands of positions company-wide over a number of years.  My number was up."
good,"Allstate is a great company, offers a good work environment and provides an enriching career in the industry, especially for recent college graduates"
good,"On a typical work day, I am able to get out and socialize with prospects from different backgrounds & professions. There are no 2 days the same, I schedule at least 2-3 appointments daily to talk about insurance and financial services. As a Financial Representative, it's a one man show, I partner with Agents in the area along with their team members to help assist potential clients with their insurance & financial needs. The hardest part about my job is not being able to help everybody, due to different reasons. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to make my own schedule and the flexibility that comes with it."
good,The company is a very good one and puts you in position to be successful and sell. The traffic is slow from where my location was and not a lot of call in so was a grind. Have to be able to really sell.
good,Owning and opening your own business is a goal and the american dream. I did well until the slowdown during the recession and the financial support was running out. I sold my agency and took care of my dad who had parkinsons for 28 months until he died of cancer.
good,"Have learned a whole lot working with the R&D and Drivewise teams."
good,Allstate is laid back and friendly but slow to promote high performers.  There are still too many silos which can make it frustrating for areas that have similar goals.  You can learn a lot of valuable skills on the job if you are willing to raise your hand for stretch assignments.  There are many programs that promote health and well-being.  Philanthropy and/or volunteerism is highly valued.
good,"My immediate manager and several managers I have worked with and for are excellent. Senior leadership is generally very good and the work is enjoyable. On the negative side, Allstate cut their best selling type of coverage, which just so happened to be the cheapest. Allstate only targets people who have had no accidents, no tickets, etc.. If you don't have one of these, then your rate is going to be pretty high. This makes it hard for me because it becomes a lot harder to compete with the other companies."
good,"At Allstate I learned to establish a very organized system of scheduling appointments and making sure I called back each of my potential customers exactly when I said I would-- I learned the importance of trust between customer and insurance agent. I also created a system of following up on all leads, and sending out prepared quotes for customer review. I handled customer service tasks and endorsements for existing policy holders. My co workers were very friendly and always willing to help or pass on tips on what they have learned. Overall I really enjoyed my short time with Allstate."
good,"good work place, was a good experience , client interaction is very on point , we work as a team and that's make every body happy at the end of the day"
good,"I learned a lot from my job at Allstate. I learned new procedures, used different defect tracking tools and also enjoyed working in an Agile environment"
good,My coworkers were fun and personable. We did a lot of office events and competitions. The individuals I worked with were like famliy. I worked in a nice environment.
good,A typical day in the office is sitting at my desk and working hard with the occasional breaks to chat with co-workers and take a quick break.  I've learned a lot in the 3 years I've been there with learning a couple of new processes while I earned my degree.
good,I worked with two of the most beautiful hearted women that I have ever met. We all worked well together as well as always had wonderful communication. Even when Office owner Mr. Mel Clemmons came into the office he constantly would make us feel comfortable and appreciated.
good,"I was in charge of servicing the current book of business. This included cross selling, policy changes and all renewal contacts."
good,great work atmosphere with a great team. Learned the insurance industry and expanded my knowledge of systems. Reviewed insurance policies for approval to write.
good,Typical days can vary and Allstate has a number of ways to learn about what is going on internally and externally in the industry. Learned many valuable lessons through the employee resource groups and other initiatives outside my department. Most enjoyable part would be working from home once a week and toughest part is driving into Northbrook.
good,"Allstate is place where you can grow if you have desire for growth.  Lot of learning opportunities. Management is unstable, things change rapidly.  Do not give enough time to experience the effect of changes .  Changes move around in circle.  Eventually it comes back to same business or management strategy at one point.  It feel like management do not really know which way is the right way to lead the company. Going back and forth with same concept different way.  After becoming public company, job security is at it's worst level.  There is no loyalty towards employee."
good,"Excellent place to work for, engaging environment as well as opportunity for advancement and commissions. Building up the book of business is challenging yet rewarding and is the reason I love writing insurance."
good,I work inside a Car Dealership a typical day is that  start very early with Assisting Management and Customers and work 6days a week; There is never a dull moment and I love that because I meet so many people and I am a People Person and I love assisting in any wayI can.
good,the training is wonderful. they pay for your insurance license. too much pressure to sell though. work hours at the call center are horrible 4pm-12am
good,"At Allstate I had the opportunity to build relationships with my customers by understand what his or her needs were, as well as finding coverage's that would better protect them large and sudden loses."
good,"A typical day at Allstate Roadside Services involved answering calls and dispatching contracted, roadside assistance providers for General Motors customers. Troubleshooting and problem solving skills were key to ensuring that the correct services were dispatched. "
good,Allstate is a great place to work. There are many areas of opportunity and you can meet some amazing people along the way.
good,A decent place to work to learn about handling auto claims. Learning rules and regulations. There were lots of changes in how we did the same job. Sometimes it seemed like we were going between the same two options back and forth.
good,Part time job. Opportunity to meet great people. Great place to work. Knowledge management staff. Always willing to train new employees.
good,"Not going to break any barriers, but definitely a solid work environment with good people.  A good work life balance, but not a ton of upward movement until the baby boomers get out of the way."
good,"Data entry of new claims from customers."
good,Work life balance is not the best but there is a lot of good done to outweigh some of the unfortunate standards
good,"Working at Allstate was fun and productive, but at times it became boring sitting behind a desk at hours. I would rather be up moving around and brainstorming ideas. The hardest part was to reach people all over Anderson and persuading them that Allstate was a better insurance company than theirs."
good,"Obtained skills as a customer service representative and learned how to perform in a clerical setting. Coworkers were amazing, management could need some work. Most enjoyable part of the job was assisting people in need! Hardest part of the job was the hours worked."
good,"There is a great work/home life balance because you work directly with the agency owner. I work as a member of a team but, also I work as an independent individual."
good,"My day consist of : 1. taking inbound/making outbound calls from customers, vendors and agents, 2. writing estimate for repairs and pricing contents, 3. explaning/reviewing polices to customers and agents, 4. on the phone 90% of my day and 5. attending meetings for my team and the entire office. With this position I have learned to go with the flow and not take things to heart when customers/agents/vendors are upset with the the information we are reviewing regarding decisions being made for the claims and policy. My co-workers are great! They understand what I go through on a daily bases and we are very supportive of each other. We work as a team to help each other out throughout the day. The hardest part of this job is  balancing the work load and personal life. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help the customers get their home and life back to normal."
good,"I enjoyed interacting with customers on the phone every day and also loved the atmosphere and the professionalism displayed by management and my coworkers. The hardest part of the job was adapting to the ever changing environment of a call center, After a few years I began to welcome and expect change everyday and was open to new things. The most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers, working with them to brainstorm new ideas and strategies to enhance overall customer experience and cross sell opportunities. There were several mentors that contributed to my success and there were several people that I continue professional relationships with today. Working for Allstate has made me into the professional that I am today and provided the tools needed to contribute great things to the insurance industry as I continue to grow as an insurance professional."
good,Love helping people on the side of the road. Being able to help with assistant.
good,"I currently work within a TDY Temporary Duty  assignment as a Training Assistant to the new hire employees for Allstate Insurance Auto Claims department. My typical day consist of me assisting  the Lead Trainer with the agenda of the day ,providing assistance with lesson plans, computer system training, and customer service skills"
good,Allstate exposed me to great customer services and had the pleasure to meet a lot of nice people.
good,It was very laid back. Not very organized. But it was new and im sure that had a lot to do with it.
good,": A web based, direct to consumer application developed for Allstate Insurance where in a customer can quote and purchase Auto Insurance online. The application is later expanded adding various other products (Motorcycle, Renters, House & Home) to its portfolio. The project focuses in expanding Client's business across direct channels essentially through the internet.."
good,"Never a dull moment with the co workers, workflow is moderate in my position, management is there for you at all times, most enjoyable is that we are able to enjoy each other and treat each other as family, its not like a prison where you can't talk or get up and there is nothing hard about the job as long as you keep learning and doing."
good,"The culture at Allstate is quite positive, even for a call center environment. One good perk is that after a few months of enduring the phones, you generally get to have other non-phone tasks to do."
good,"Hard sells on phone for 8 hours.Many products unable to sale in some states , at times made it hard on customer calling in for Quote for that product."
good,"Received payments/receipts/collections in office, over phone and via mail"
good,"I currently work at Allstate as part of the company's leadership development program."
good,IF you can afford to own your own agency this is an awesome place to work.  Allstate is top notch but offers little pay to the CSR and staff.
good,This has been a great company to work for. The work atmosphere is fantastic and employees are give the chance to gain new skills to help move them to the next level
good,"Allstate is a good company overall. I used to work for a new agency. My job mainly focused on sale. My average sale is about 30-50 items a month. "
good,"Excellent co-workers as they treat you like family,"
good,"Did Not like the way they treated their clients.Was great to interact with clients-they all trusted me. I got upset after Katrina when  company took wind and hail away from long time customers.  "
good,Great place to work to gather new exprience in the industry. Will treasure the memories that I have working with all of the staff.
good,Overall it was a great job. Sometimes the customers where very hard to deal with. But for the most part the company treated you well and tried to accommodate you if something came up
good,"I assist internal Customer service to the adjusters and processors and management of the office. I would assist as getting mail, claim files, supplies. Back up a few people in my unit if the were on vacation or help complete their tasks for the day."
good,"I wrote contracts for allstate insurance agencies, I also spoke with agents about the applications and logged information."
good,Good if your are looking for Work/Life Balance & Job Security. Not good in terms of compensation.
good,"It's always interesting how small a project can start out with requirements but when it goes ""live"" those small requirements can make such a big difference to the end user."
good,Great work life balance. Great People's company.  Rewards employees for their efforts.
good,Allowed my experience in banking investment contributed towards a more efficient and compliance organized office. Personally developed financial services revenue tracking for multiple satellite offices.
good,"Filing, billing, telemarketing, and answering phones. It is a great start in a career for any who would like to become a licensed agent. This job is definitely for someone who can multitask. What I enjoyed the most was the communication with employers and employees. We were always updated on any upcoming changes within the companies and the do's and don'ts of it all. Team work is big at Allstate!"
good,"Long work days that are very long. I learned how to work under pressure, and solve problems much better. Trained three new staff members. co workers are very friendly. The hardest part is sales. The best part is the interaction with the clients. To make them know how inmportant it is to insure your belongs properly."
good,This job was fun and a learning experience. I did a little bit of everything.
good,Great company to work
good,I loved talking to people on a day to day basis from different states. It was also nice getting overtime
good,"I loved the people I worked with. They made going to work everyday easy. My boss helped me find my inner salesperson. Without his guidance, I never would have been able to make those high volume outgoing calls with such ease."
good,"It was a good working environment loved the mangement there, because they were some really nice ppl, I didnt have much of a work and life balance because it was 7 days a week 12 hour shift type of job with no days off. But overall i liked it, but only wish there was job security"
good,"I have a great working relationship with the management and my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is turning down prospects for insurance, due to not meeting Allstate guidelines."
good,The agent I worked for is great at managing customer relationships and building report with clients. He taught me effective ways of communicating with clients as well as learning how to deal with difficult customers.
good,Great experience overall. Plenty of opportunity to learn and be an active part of the growth of the company.
good,"Loved the call center environment. Great benefits for full time employees, competitive pay. Flexible schedule available for part time help that qualifies. Management would play favorites. Awards often given to those who did not do high standard work but did work quickly. Have to log out of shift when using the restroom. Hardest part of job was dealing with people who have accents and irrate customers. Most enjoyable part was talking to customers and giving them peace of mind that the process of their claim had started."
good,"Processing automobile as well as property insurance claims. Excel in analyzing damages/causes, interpreting policies and processing payment solutions. Effectively manage multiple, high-priority projects and take pride in providing exemplary customer service."
good,"My job titles held as Inside Claim Adjuster, followed by Field Property Adjuster have given me a broad expanse of reviewing and applying policy coverages to homes and people who have been affected by theft, fire, flood, etc. Coworkers were wonderful to work with and helpful when needed; the hardest part of the job was to finish large property losses in a short amount of time. However, the most enjoyable part of the job was to meet people face-to-face and express the empathy and sympathy about the loss they have incurred. That interaction gave them a better peace of mind, knowing who is helping them in person and putting a face to the name."
good,Loved working on my own and handling day to day business practices's.
good,"Taking inbound calls assisting customers with first notice of loss, faxing estimates, providing information on claims, inquiries and making outbound follow ups. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that the customers are completely satisfied with the overall assistance I have provided."
good,"Allstate Corporation is a good company to work for. It is very sales oriented and can be stressful as sales quotas need to be met every month. However, it is also a company that offers a lot flexibility and my manager did not micro manage, which I thing is a good thing as it keeps everyone happy, end result being an increase in productivity"
good,Productive and fun place to work. Very relaxed enviroment and great management staff to work with.
good,"I was in charge in helping customers with their accounts and coverage on their auto,home policies. great environment."
good,"My day usually started with review of all information on established claims. Returning customers, attorneys, other insurance companies calls. New claims were reviewed, the goal was to contact the insured or the claimant with 24hours and settling the claims with a specific period of time. Detailed documenting all claims and conversations. Learning is a daily occurrance with research and investigation of claims, good faith handling, knowledge of legal aspects of the claim handling. I was priviledge to work with outstanding co-workers. We created a outstanding network of working together to complete all claims through teamwork."
good,"Each day I assist brokers, attorneys and annuitants with questions regarding contracts, payment status, and reviewing legal documents. I have learned that the interpretation of a legal document between multiple individuals can result in documents needing to be amended to ensure the company is protected. Advising an attorney documents need corrections is a challenge but as relationships are built the resistance decrease. It is a great experience being able to offer the annuitant an option of having a set payment stream versus receiving a lump sum. Periodic payments assist in providing financial stability."
good,This opportunity allowed for a terrific formula for life and work balance. The most rewarding aspect of this career is the daily interactions with my customers and utilizing my problem solving and people skills.
good,"Allstate is a decent place to work and its technology area is not too encumbered by a high number of tenured staff. Its struggles today are rooted in its inability to gain focus on its lagging transformation to a 21st century insurer. Prioritization of work is inconsistent, leaving good ideas dangling, rushed ideas into risky operational status, and workload difficult to bear at times. As a result, company performance continues to lag, resulting in limitations with career growth opportunities. If the company is shrinking, so must its staff and, unfortunately, its morale."
good,Good work environment.  Rewarding in many ways.  It was nice to have a big name recognizable name and brand like Allstate to bring to the customers.  Quite easy to sell and service as customers really related to the name brand.
good,Good but a lot of employees are kinda weird and that’s promoted. I’m happy so far and would recommend to anyone looking for physically easy work place
good,Good company to work for. Learn something new every day. Not to many benefits though. Salary plus commission. Flexible on hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help people.
good,Great company culture. People are genuinely nice and helpful. Management is willing to support your aspirations so long as you show your initiative and drive.
good,"used to be a great place to work, employee appreciation has declined in recent years.  Customer service is outstanding.  Company is shareholder dependent."
good,"The agency I worked at was a big agency that was in the process of growing. We had a lot of fun but the workload was getting to be too much and they were asking us to do too much outside of work, leaving little to know at home life."
good,"Management treat contractors very differently. Apart from that everything is OK. Not updated technology, may be because it is a product based company. Facilities are very good."
good,Amazing place to work but have to fix the products and compensation to retain employees. Management in corporate doesn't care about the independent agents and LSP.
good,"A typical day at work is working on the leads provided by the office to get new clients and sale policies. Outbound calling to prospects looking for insurance, sometimes cold calling commercial prospect to provide insurance for commercial policies."
good,Good place to work. Friendly people . Very fast paced work style . Working there you always learn something new everyday . It is also an environment of constant change. There isn't a lot of opportunity to move up here in my area due to lack of other positions.
good,"The environment is very comfortable to work in, day to day it is busy but people in the office make it great. Although, if you are looking to advance in your career, it is difficult here."
good,"A good place to work, reasonable health benefits and excellent development opportunities. Good activities within the workplace and support for work/home live balance."
good,"Most of the Allstate agencies are independent owned. Some of them are good, others are not. Fortunately I work at a well established agency. The colleagues are wonderful. They will train and help you to get better at the job. The owner is great too. However, if you want to get advanced to your career,  you have to be agency owner or find a job in another company. This is a good job to get into the insurance industry."
good,"The company itself was great. There is a lot of opportunity for advancement. I enjoyed my time working there. The benefits were not terrible, but they weren't great either."
good,A typical day at an Allstate office consists of many phone calls and building relationships with customers. I enjoy helping people out during hard times but also working with great people and a great company.
good,"Fair company to work for able to transfer to various locations nationwide. Employee salaries are low compared to competitors. Flexible work schedule,  health coverage benefits arent great, 401k available with matching heavy work flow that leads to required OT hours to maintain the assigned workload. Promotions are usually geared toward male peers."
good,"Its been a very fun career path, so far worth every drop of my energy. I really like the work culture, and have a lot of pride places in my work. Its fun and I like it."
good,Iff you work hard you will be recognized and rewared for the hard work.. They did not have a lot of training going on except for a rater analyist. I wasn't sure if I had what it takes but I took the 6 weeks training and to my surprrise I enjoyed the class and learned a lot. One thing I do know about Allstate is once you learned the insurance standards you can move up in the company. I had quite  few jobs. I ended up as a QA tester. After working there for 38 Years the work was outsourced. I would still be there if it wasn't for the outsourcing.
good,"Allstate offers many opportunities to advance in your career. Plan on this being a long term place of employment, and not a fly by night. With effort, the world is your oyster. Take the chance !!!"
good,"Allstate is an outstanding company to work for.  The company strives to deliver the best customer experience for each and every customer. A typical day as a leader would normally involve resolving call escalations, assisting frontline employees with questions and meetings. The most enjoyable part of the job is resolving issues for customers and developing team members."
good,This is a good second income job but you could not afford to live on your own. The environment is nice. The agent is very understanding. Allstate as a whole offers a lot of training. My only complaint is the salary.
good,Overall Allstate is a excellent Company. However I don’t feel as though the money paid is enough for what we do. As claims representatives we do a lot and over and beyond for the difficult & upset customers
good,A typical day consists of contacting insurers with outstanding payments. Most inbound calls require me to service policies or to calm an upset customer.
good,"No 2 days are the same. And, I like that a lot. We have to opportunity to communicate with individuals from all walks of life. And, to help these individuals protect themselves and their families presently and for the future."
good,"A typical day consisted of answer a high call volume of quote requests for auto and home insurance.  In addition, provided customer service to existing clients and also receive insurance payments to walk in clients."
good,"On a daily basis, the team members performed above character while maintaining the company's mission at heart. Team members were also supportive when clients were negative which aided in a productive environment."
good,The guidelines have tightened so much that it us harder to write new business. The agency I was with had great benefits but little advancement opportunities.
good,"The best part about Allstate is the culture and the people.  Best I've ever worked with.  The total compensation at Allstate is truly great: paid time off, competitive salary, benefits, stock options, 401K, etc."
good,"Took phone calls regarding insurance claims such as injuries and life insurance claims"
good,Working as an adjuster with Allstate has given me an excellent insight into the world of insurance and given me a greater interest in pursuing a career in this field. The company has a very clear vision that is centered on providing excellent customer service to both inside and outside customers. The personnel I have worked with have all been extremely pleasant and professional. It is a great company.
good,"A good company to work for, not much for advancement unless your willing to relocate. The workplace is laid back and the coworkers are usually a pleasure to be around."
good,"If you enjoy sales, you will enjoy Insurance., Its very fast pace and competitive. If you work hard and quote, you will succeed and the pay will reflect your work. Its a good job,"
good,When I originally started company was very lax and allowed adjusters to work as they saw fit. Company is making a lot of changes that are adding to the adjusters role and creating a complicated and more stressful environment.
good,The Insurance environment is forever changing so it made the various roles I worked exciting and interesting. I also loved dealing directly with customers and having the freedom to make my own hours in the sales role.
good,"Relaxed, rewarding and management is understanding. Flexible schedule. Learned a lot about insurance and organization. Days could get a it hectic but over all good experience."
good,"Enjoy the area, co workers are nice, professional. Bathrooms are trash, but facility overall is nice. Company has pension, 401k match, HSA Seed, medical is not the best, dental is good. Company has a good reputation, conservative, could pay more. Charlotte north location. Would reccommend"
good,I really enjoyed working at Allstate but the job is filled with conflict.  It is either conflict with the customer or conflict with a body shop.  It wears on you quickly if you don't manage stress well.
good,"Good atmosphere, well managed. A lot of the job required getting my own leads which took away from the time able to sell. Good products and good training."
good,"Phones ringing off the hook, customers always wanting extra with customer service and getting their situations solved. Good company with professional practices."
good,"Overall this is a great place to work. Leads are given to you. Some may be bad, but there are a few good ones in there. You just have to do the work. The agency owners are fantastic. I love them! Work seems to just fly by. Bonuses are pretty good. They are always trying to find ways to make the job better and to make you more money."
good,This agency is run by one of the best agents I've ever met. I could truly be proud of the way we took care of our customers. I felt like our clients were like family.
good,There is a pressure filled sale environment but the team dynamic is definitely a positive aspect of employment at Allstate. It is imperative to meet metric in order to advance.
good,"I had a very busy job but thoroughly enjoyed what I did.  Had many managers over the years and most of them were capable.  The company is fair in the way it handled employees.  Vacation days increased with tenure and benefits were good.  Salary was commensurate with position and tenure.  "
good,I loved being an Agency Owner with Allstate. It allowed me the freedom of being my own boss but at the same time having the support under Allstate's corporate umbrella.
good,Great group of people to work with. Lots of professional training and support. Really listened to employees. The office I worked in was very responsive to day to day needs of employees. They promoted from within. However they often used TDY to get employees seeking promotions to work for less than the position should have been poaid for long periods of time before actually promoting them.
good,"I would say that overall, Allstate is a good place to work.  They have been flexible with me as a working parent.  They are good about providing feedback."
good,"Every franchise is owned and operated by individual owners.  Therefore, you can end up with a great owner or a terrible one.  Do your homework on the owner before obtaining employment.  Also, most do not have benefits other than vacation."
good,I built skills within Allstate to help with future advancements.  There was not a lot of opportunities within Allstate which is why I moved to ACE Private Risk Services.
good,"This job was almost 20 years ago, the things that are required now was not required back then. My duties included typing correspondence, speaking with customers and just day to day office work. "
good,"Not in a negative way, of course. But in a busy, back to back call claim environment, you almost never have access to manager who can assist you with questions.This job will teach great independance, and with the proper use of the Allstate intranet databases, almost all questions can be answered. If not available, ALWAYS, take notes, because chances are you will encounter the same situation somewhere down the road in your claims life. But overall, a lot of great people work here."
good,"Allstate overall is a good company to work for. It provides many growth opportunities and good benefits. It provides flexibility to work from home when needed, which is what most of the moms prefer."
good,Much better than a call center at any other insurance company.. you will be able to breath.. you can make as much money as you want as long as you are willing to make the calls. it aint bad.
good,Great company. Advancement depends on how smart you are and/or how well you perform.  9-5 job. Only work weekends if you want extra money. Nice office with a/c. Great name recognition.
good,"This was a good place to work and enjoyed it.  Some days were more stressful then others, but it balanced out. Sometimes management was not the greatest, but from time to time you got a good one."
good,Allstate seems to go through the establishment of a new five year plan every six months. They are reducing their coverage with service and storefronts as are other P&C companies.
good,"The company was a good place to work, but they require you work on Saturdays and that was an inconvience. ALso they had a  11-8 sift that you were required to work."
good,"Allstate was an okay employer. I felt and observed very clear bias among management against women over a certain age. There was very clear preference shown to 20-30 YO, men, or the occasional sports-minded young woman. This was not a position where knowledge of sports should have been an asset, but it seemed to help. Overall, I enjoyed the work, but it appeared my manager & his boss would not promote an over 50 woman, & in fact, every single over 50 woman fled the department in the 3 years I was there. I attempted to improve my situation by moving on to a more design oriented job elsewhere."
good,"We start our day in a meeting room to discuss what we had to do that day. We work as a 4 team crew or sometimes all group work as one. The good benefit "
good,"Good company with great work life balance. There is room for growth and can be a fun place to work depending on the office.  The atmosphere is great, but the salary could be better for the work that you do."
good,"The work load keeps you busy on a daily basis.  You contact lien holders, Insurers, claimants and attorneys to close the claim on total loss vehicles.  Allstate gives back to a lot of organizations and have committees for people to join and help out."
good,Productive and fast pace. Learned nuances of P&C business and relationship networking and recruiting. good workplace culture. hardest part of job was extensive travel and commuting. enjoyed job satisfaction of successful delivery of corporate and personal objectives. loved the challenge!.
good,"Nice place to work for. Main boss was awesome. Downside is you do not get paid for OT and no benefits. But overall, fair place to work for............"
good,There is a significant amount of time spent on developing the front line and getting their feedback to improve the work.  Less time spent on leader workload assistance and development.
good,"Meeting numbers is a top priority. Also, playing well in the ""sand-box"". Some are promoted based on their likeability instead of their job performance."
good,Allstate has an enormous amounts of information that has to be learned.  The workplace is fun only when you pass all of company's requirements.  The workplace culture is fast pace most of time.  The people are very helpful.
good,Huge call center with plenty of co workers. Food was always availble and endless potlucks in each department. Schedules are not consistant and changes quarterly or as needed.
good,"Answer all incoming calls about supplemental insurance, would also help policy holder to file claims for our varies products. Submit research request to change any problems regarding their policies. I learn a new system that aid me in resourcing policies. Management was always a great source of information. There was not a holiday that was not celebrated and management made sure all birthday were celebrated as well. The hardest part of the job would be when it got busy it got busy. For me the most rewarding part of my job was being able to help those policy holder that had cancer for the first time explaining all of the benefits they have available. This gave a lot of comfort to someone facing cancer."
good,"at our office we always help and support each other . we work hard to accomplish the office goals and we make sure everyone gets along. here we are like a family, we have respect for each other"
good,"Allstate is a wonderful place to work.  Very fulfilling.You need a good work ethic to succeed with Allstate.  Over the years, Allstate has been very good to me and my family."
good,"Thoroughly enjoyed working with everybody there. Unfortunately, the end client decided to shut down the project that I was managing and having it run internally."
good,There is always a new thing on the table to pick every week. CHallenging work all the contract. Building blocks of my ETL career. I'm Thankful for the experience I have gained there.
good,Allstate is a nice work environment but requires you to be over worked and they just do not pay enough.  They want you to think outside the box when dealing with claims but when you do you are penalized when it comes time for reviews.
good,I liked this opportunity because I was automatically referred to existing customers that were prospective life insurance clients. There was a bond of trust established with the customer as they were already happy and satisfied customers as they had automobile and/or homeowners insurance through Allstate.
good,"People are great, workload is fair, they challenge you, and give opportunities to learn.  "
good,"Allstate is a fast paced environment. It can be stressful, but in my experience management offered a lot of support. Call centers can be monotonous and stressful but a perk was the amount of vacation days Allstate offered to manage work and life balance."
good,It is a call center which simply is not for everyone. The people who work there for many years go one of two ways. They are either happy with answering phones and helping customers and others will utilize the advancement available and will become managers or adjusters. However at times it can be difficult working in an office that is primarily all women.
good,Allstate is good place to work with great intentions however the pay for what you do if your a dedicated employee is not what it should be. as an adjuster I work 12 hours a day at least.
good,"It is a good place to work and learn alot of things. I wnjoyed my time working there. The work and personal life is balanced, I enjoyed the company of my coworkers."
good,"This was my first foray into corporate america.  While it proved to be an interesting experience, the 90 minute commute both ways was more than I was willing to endure at the time."
good,"Phone calls, process applications and policy changes. Since insurance is an ever changing industry there is always something new to learn. I personally enjoy the change of pace."
good,Working for Allstate was a pleasure. The management staff and coworkers were positive and we had daily group pep talks which helped keep moral up. The training was very thorough but pay wasn't that great.
good,An awesome company to work with which I enjoyed working with for the past 20 years on various projects. Very professional individuals that respect consultants.
good,Fast paced job with constent stability. Enjoy helping people on a daily basis. Something different everyday. Consistency in salary pay. Good benefits.
good,Most Managers / Agents are great people with diverse backgrounds to capitalize with.  the managers within corporate had little experience for their roles in the company.
good,I have learned to be patient and understanding when it came to customers and their needs. There was always change which i thought was a good thing. Overall it was a great experience.
good,"Typical day began by logging onto the computer system, checking emails so i could outline a timetable for that day before going to open and sort the morning mail.  Basically worked on my feet all day, moving equipment in and out of meeting rooms in between meetings and responding to employee requests solving their issues in between room setups.  I was often pulled in multiple directions by different managers to the point that completing daily tasks was an impossibility.  Outgoing mail had to be finished at the same time everyday, then take care of any issues I didn't have time for, finally lock the doors after everyone else was gone."
good,I learner a lot about insurance being apart of the Allstate team and their training materials set you up for success. I would definitely recommend Allstate to friends and family.
good,Great place to work great benefits hours are great and location is also great. The job isn't hard you just have to know how to deal people and understand there stressful situations.
good,Good small business to work for. The manager was very patient and friendly and was good to teach me new things about quoting insurance policies. I enjoyed meeting customers face to face and the ladies I worked with were also very friendly.
good,Overall good company to work for. Each agency is independently owned. The owner of this agency doesn't have management skills. Doesn't treat employees like they are people.
good,Allstate Insurance is a very good environment to work for the employees there are all friendly they treat you like family. Work is very easy and everyone there works in a fast pace very good costumer service.
good,"Allstate as a corporation sells a great product, but at a grossly high price. It is probably one of the hardest companies to sell for. My office was great, but it would of been better if my agent showed up more than once a week."
good,A comfortable atmosphere with many good people working alongside you. The management has difficulty putting together a message regarding the goal of the operation.
good,Allstate is a company that is striving to meet the customers needs while maintaining cost management. This is a good company to work but it is very fast paced.
good,"Great company to work for. Relaxed environment. No Bonuses :( However management, well most are very helpful and a great asset to the company. Recent changes made the job security questionable."
good,"Typical insurance sales job. The agent was good to work for, and made a comfortable work environment."
good,"This agency has a wonderful principle agent, and an amazing team to match. Can be a busy office, and team is competitive to meet sales quotas, as well as assist wonderful and long-standing clientele."
good,"Allstate takes being the 'Good Hands' to heart. It focuses on customers, employees and community. "
good,"Working for an agency can be very rewarding. You may have more flexibility in your scheduling and an overall less stressful, less corporate environment. To be successful in sales, you have to be knowledgeable, be a good communicator, adapt well, and be able to think on your feet. Your job is to offer a solution to your customer's problem."
good,"The workplace culture at Allstate is phenomenal. They go above and beyond to recognize their employees for the work that they do and give great incentives such as bonuses for those who provide Allstate quality service. Management is competent and does not micromanage. They're there to assist if you need help with a difficult situation and to provide insight as to what the best solution would be. They also really want to develop people within the company, they're very helpful when it comes to development and give you the tools you need to succeed. However, the development process is lengthy and frustrating at times. I have known several people who have been trying to develop for years but have not gotten to where they would like to be. Sometimes it can be personal choices and work attitude that hold people back but I have seen great employees that do not receive the opportunities that they should. The most difficult part of this job would be the mental stress that comes with dealing with huge personal losses for the customer and it can be draining after a long day. The most enjoyable part of this job would be getting to interact with many different people from all walks of life and being able to help people get back to normal after a loss occurs."
good,"As an inside (work at a desk) adjuster the work was manageable but very fast paced and non-stop. As a large loss outside (in the field) property adjuster I was expected to inspect 3-12 new claims per week, at an average of 8-10 hours each, in addition to maintaining contact and working on 30 - 60 older claims. This resulted in a minimum of 50 hours per week with an average of 60 hours per week."
good,"Allstate's people are the kindest and most genuine human beings with whom you will ever work. Allstate hires people who are fundamentally good to their very core. This place has an incredible culture that gets even better every day."
good,No possibility of growth with small business. Hard to put yourself in a position to own your own with such small earning potential. Kind of a dead end.
good,"It's flexible to be able to work remotely to balance life and work. As a Production Support for entire environment,  learn new stuff every day definitely won't be bored.  Management keeps on changing in DBA sector and focus more on cost efficiency by bring in new products other than mainstream IBM, Oracle, SAP.  The hardest part of the job is to schedule a vacation ahead of time to have a backup while away, the most enjoyable part of the job is never boring, always have new stuff to learn eveyday."
good,Was a great company to work for prior to staff reduction. Excellent benefits. Direct manager is a great guy to work for. Concerned about direction company is headed when considering customer service.
good,High level workload but interesting and challenging place to work. Ever changing policies and practice must be eager  to learn and develop. Management actively involved.
good,"9:00 to 5:00 days, heavy customer service demand. broad knowledge of personal insurance lines. Co-workers are very fun great envoirment but sometimes lacking direction from management"
good,"I've worked roughly 6 years as a temporary employee and had steady work at the postal service in Springfield, MA. I was hired as a temp or casual mail handler and clerk,"
good,"Working in a call center is never fun, but Allstate did a good job in trying to create and foster a team environment. Next to no chance of advancing, limited opportunities available."
good,"Lots to do, lots of stress, but big payoffs in successes and recognition of successes"
good,"This job was mentally challenging.  The management provided ample amounts of training and encouraged building knowledge of the company and product.  The hardest part of this job was the selling aspect of it, and the pressure that came with it."
good,"I've never seen anyone get laid off in the many years of working for Allstate. They are never over staffed, which means no layoffs, but you can also expect a fairly steady and significant workload that might require you to work more than a standard 40 hour work week. There are numerous opportunities for advancement in the company if you are mobile. If you are restricted to one geographic area, you might it a bit difficult to advance or take on different roles in the company. The pay is competitive on the top ends of the salary bands, however not as competitive if you are a new employee. It can take awhile to make a decent salary, however, Allstate seems to take care of the people who stay for the long haul."
good,"The members of Allstate's Law Department are excellent lawyers.  We all have an open door policy, often stopping at each other's desks to bounce an idea off a colleague.  Being that we have all had different experiences throughout our respective careers, it is a great benefit to get another attorney's perspective.  Our business clients are also very willing to work in a collaborative manner, with both Legal and other business units, in order to identify the best solutions to the issues presented."
good,"Stored and filed data."
good,Great entry level sales position. Strong training program to help guide the sales process. Better than industry average compensation structure with base salary and commission.
good,I love working at Allstate. They encourage long term careers and provide flexible work arrangements. There are many opportunties to move around the company and explore different areas of interest. They encourage growth and development through educational assistance.
good,I learned a lot working for All State insurance company. The hours were long but I still liked the job. I think I could have stayed there but I was only temporary.
good,Great work atmosphere and culture. Everyday is structured with the same schedule but many fun activities and team bonding experience are incorporated as much as possible. Management is very understanding and resourceful with assisting in daily work.
good,"I see a lot of reviews on here saying ""The leads weren't as good as I thought they would be"" or ""I probably only closed 2 out of every 10 leads I got"". REALLY? You are getting leads from people who already have a relationship with the company! When I started, I was given a week of training and a phone book! I found clients and built a practice. If you get this job expecting to be spoon fed hot leads where all you have to do is fill out an app, you will be disappointed because that job doesn't exist! You have to work. I had more success and made more money here than I ever had before. I kept doing all the things that made me successful on my own and added 3 agents with 5,000+ clients that I could call and work with. If you can't be successful with that setup, you will fail anywhere in the industry. I wish they offered benefits."
good,Worked here a few years back. Small Agency in Ossining. Taylor Agency I believe was the name of this Authorize Allstate Agency. Great Staff. Very Knowledgeable and Professional.
good,The calls could sometimes get a bit complicated considering that this is a job where sometimes there is just nothing more that you can do for the customer. The hardest part is telling a customer that there policy is not up for renewal or it has cancelled especially when they are loyal customers. The most enjoyable is being able to cross sell and get customer coverage to protect their belongings.
good,Employees are well compensated and work environment is very outgoing and enthusiastic. A bit hectic and stressful at times but the employees are always working as a  team to get the job done.
good,Overall Allstate is a good company and the people who work their are really great.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working with such a great group of talented individuals.
good,"Allstate was a good place to work."
good,"Taking calls from clients for updates to their policies - such as changes requiring new Liability cards, issuing claims experience letters or Confirmation of Insurance letters. Doing Renewal calls and reviewing their coverage's with them to ensure they have the correct coverage available. I have learned a lot about Property policies - most of my career dealt with Auto but now I know what is involved in property and how the Sales Office is handled. My manager and co-workers are always there to help, it is a great team and I enjoy going in to work. I usually get in early and always leave later than I should - this is mostly due to the hours. I like to make sure the days works is complete and if not, than I will go in early to complete before the phones start ringing. The hardest part about the job is not having the time to make the renewal calls I want to get done this is because it is an extremely busy office and the phones don't stop but I enjoy dealing with the customers and we are opened on Saturdays which tends to be very quiet so I can get Renewal calls done then."
good,Company experiencing growing pains. More employees need to be accountable. Compensation and benefits are above the norm. I personally traveled every week spending 3-4 nights in hotels. I would have  liked to have more contact and visits with home office.
good,I've worked for Allstate in two seperately departments over the last 8 years.  It is a great company but mobility is the key to advancement.  If you are looking at Allstate just know that they measure everything regarding your performance.
good,Allstate provides the tools to become successful.  They reward hard work and determination with appropriate benefits and compensation.  Overall Allstate was a very rewarding place of employment.
good,I have been extremely fortunate to have been placed on two teams that are outstanding and supportive.
good,"When I was first hired to work for Allstate I was assured I'd be able to get out of the terrible 2:30-11:00 pm schedule, that never happened! Although I left 7 months after being employed, people who were in my hiring class are still working that terrible shift a year and a half later. Other than that, they are great with employee appreciation and moderately lenient with occurrences. They have a very nice cafeteria but it closes at 3 pm, which was another blow to the face for second shifter's. All in all, I'd probably work there again if there were better hours and it was closer to Cleveland, OH. I was hired at the Hudson Express office as a claims processor for home insurance."
good,"When you start most jobs you see everyone is fairly new, but it was very frequent to see co-workers at Allstate who have been with the company for 20 plus years which led me to believe it was a good company to work for."
good,"This was a position for Allstate Insurance Company at Longmont Ford Dealership. Worked in a fast paced environment. Sales experience has to be strong, with only a short amount of time to speak to customers."
good,This company is under great leadership. You learn how to self manage yourself and workload. There is room for advancement if desired.
good,"I worked for the claims office in Nashville, TN.  The atmosphere is very team oriented and everyone is ready to help.  At the end of the day the work just wan't a good fit for me or my personality, it can be rather repetitive but management knows how to make it fun."
good,"I like the company as a whole. There are a wide range of opportunities for growth and advancement within the company. The team leads are great for the most part (some of them I am not too keen of). As far as my current role being a claims service specialist, my day consists of being on the phones all day filing claims, handling inquiries regarding existing claims etc...most days the call volume is very high and that is what makes my job stressful. I honestly don't see myself being in this role for too much longer, and actively seeking employment elsewhere within the company. Some people in my office have been a CSS for  10+ years! I don't see how they've done it being that I haven't even been in the role for a whole year and I already want out! **We Are Transparent*-"
good,"Getting my work done professionally, as well as being on top of my duties are always my top priorities. Interacting with customers either in person or on the phone I can qualify myself as very outgoing and not afraid to take any criticism."
good,"I enjoyed being part of the team, we all had numbers to hit but we were able to have fun while doing it. There was no micromanagement, if you needed any assistance they were there to aid.  I developed thicker skin here, every client was not as pleasant to deal with. I was able to sharpen my skills here"
good,It is a very business casual work environment where the workers are friendly to other staff workers and customers as well.
good,Allstate provided me an education in my field and allowed me to rate my superiors. My former teammates were my extended family. We still communicate. The hardest part of my job was leaving work on the table due to supplies or parts. The deal breaker was when the entire job class was outsourced nationwide. Allstate was the 3rd job I lost to outsourcing. I loved what I did. My creed was always looking for the opportunity to a make a 1st impression each and every client engagement.
good,Allstate was a great place to work while I was employed there.  The people that I worked with made the experience great.  Great exposure to many areas of the organization and a fair amount of on the job training of a high caliber.
good,Allstate is a great place to work if you have to correct type of Management. The Agent is great! The manager here is not so much; shes very demanding for various tasks that she will not even complete herself. But other than that this has been the best job i have worked for. Great Co-workers. The hardest part of the job is just handling with the manager of this office. I enjoy talking to the customers that call in and i enjoy helping them because i know that insurance is the most important part. you dont want to be so overpriced for something and thats why i like to help.
good,"Worked as a telemarketing sells rep, generated new business for office. Made cold calls. I also ran sale booths for the agent, working out of car washes, getting information from potential customers so that co workers in office could call them back to explain our services."
good,Allstate insurance has a quite knowledgeable team working for them.I had a great experience working with them and got to learn alot .
good,Having a good experience working for Allstate is completely dependent on the agency. I have had positive and negative experiences.
good,"I love working at Allstate. My leaders are always available to give me great feed back on my performance. Allstate is very big on self advocacy and try's its best to be transparent. My team works hard and knows how to be a team. They are very understanding and try to help my grow. The thing I love most about Allstate is that they ring true to the logo ""Helping Hands"". Allstate is very active in doing good for others, and helps their employees to be the best they can be for our communities."
good,"Its a great company to work for.  Management is good, and my co-workers are great. I bond well with my co- workers."
good,Good entry level experience. Good overall management. Will be helpful in future opportunities. Will provide good references for the future.
good,There is no such thing as a typical day in insurance. Every day you tell yourself that you've heard it all & then someone calls or comes in & you realize you haven't heard it all.
good,"Allstate is a great workplace with good people. Their culture is one that promotes hard work while honoring work/life balance. Part of what makes Allstate great is the people that work there. People are really friendly, inclusive, and collaborative. The company also offers a great benefits package that includes multiple PTO days and solid health/dental/vision. One challenge with Allstate is that they do not pay as competitively as other companies and it can sometimes be challenging to progress at the corporation due to the number of more tenured employees that are causing a bottleneck."
good,"When wanting to learn the business, this was a great way to start. I have been able to learn so much in a year, it amazes me everyday. The rest of the office staff is very pleasant and enjoyable, and we all treat each other as family. The hardest part of the job is learning, once you can get through that, you can get through anything."
good,"nice good hard days work, learned my way around basic hand tools, such as measuring tape, hammer drill, impact drills, threading machine, and pipe wrenches etc. Management was good enough for me, they let me work on my own and that worked to my benefit so I wouldn't have to babysit any new guys. I got along with most of my co-workers was basically around one guy that we got things done. one thing tough about the job was unloading and sorting through pipes also most materials we needed weren't always there and it was the main office's job to get that done before we got to the job site. other than that I really liked the fact that we got to travel out of state for other bigger jobs."
good,A great work environment with incredible  management and co-workers.  Daily learning of new and exciting ways to sell insurance.
good,"While working as a Licensed Sales Producer for an Exclusive Agent, I learned a great deal about sales, property and casualty insurance, and life insurance needs for our customer base and prospects. "
good,"During my work week I interacted with the customer, provided information about services and processed returns. My work ethnic was outstanding due to the management and my co workers."
good,"Good boss, but lack of training by Allstate Corp, some lack of feedback. Set areas of work not defined.  I found a lack of passion on my part to sell insurance to be the most problematic issue."
good,"The insurance buisness is not for me, I left a staffing position I held for almost three years, due to no room for advancement. Went into the insurance world and realized this is not where I am meant to be. A typical day is answering phone calls, entering endorsments, assisting customers with their billing questions. Pretty busy considering most of the traffic is over the phone. The hardest part of the job is obtaining your P&C license! The most enjoyable part is interacting with some of the customers, most of them were very sweet!!  This position was not for me, but it did not have anything to do with the ladies I had the pleasure of working with."
good,"I was involved in all phases of Project life cycle, starting from Gathering Requirements to Test closure. Team are very friendly with each other starting from project manager, Team Manager, Developers and Testers. Every one has focus on project, positive attitude."
good,"Allstate is a great place to work. My coworkers are wonderful people and I've made many great friends. The job itself is very demanding and I am on the phone with customers, attorneys and medical providers nearly all day long. I enjoy the fast paced environment as it keeps me busy and helps me learn more every day about the industry. Management is very flexible and always looks out for my best interests. Although I do enjoy my employment with Allstate I would like to seek a career in my field of study."
good,"Field position that provides employer supplemental benefits to its employees through on-site enrollment. This position requires prospecting of employers, providing presentations, and on-site enrollments. Also requires partnering with Allstate agents to introduce Workplace Benefits."
good,"A typical day at Allstate is very unpredictable. I was required to multitask while performing my duties as a Customer Service Representative. Although some days seemed to be challenging I still managed to get the job done. I really enjoyed interacting with customers via phone, email, and in-person. I appreciate having the opportunity to assist customers with any situation that I can be of help to."
good,"Work starts at 8 AM in morning."
good,"On the phones"
good,I have built great working relationships with my coworkers and have learned a lot in the insurance industry. There is limited opportunity for advancement in our office (only 1 claims office in South Carolina).
good,"Typical work week: 9-5pm, learned many marketing skills and strategies I use in my current position; Love this job."
good,"Good environment. Good co-workers. "
good,"A typical day at work would be to arrive 15 minutes early to upload all necessary programs. For every call I would authenticate, for privacy protection then verify and explain complex questions regarding policy and billing. During the call I would follow a stand call flow to conduct the calls. I would always be sure to set the expectation and recap what has been discussed. At the end of every call I would accurately document notes for the next review. At the end of every shift I would completely and successfully log out of the system to assure any money transactions."
good,loved helping customers with solutions. lots of problem solving.
good,Learned a lot about sales and business reports. Being able to understand and provide insurance for those in need. Explaining different situations and circumstances to customers and making them happy. Being able to help in a time of need and making their situation better than it could have been.
good,"A place where I can be versatile and can use my interpersonal skills. It has also taught me how to excel under pressure, and continually aim to exceed goals. It has also provided me with extensive experience in working successfully with teams and as an individual. A professional, fast paced, structured and team oriented environment is what this place has to offer."
good,"9-5 job"
good,Job was good working with agents on their book of business. Had a good manager at first and then they put in Idiots. Good company
good,"Easy working days, fun and competitive atmosphere full of energetic associates who aspire for the best."
good,"When I was at allstate it paid very well and provided incentitives like tuition reimbursement, however it was a pilot program so it was temp only, co-workers and management were good"
good,very busy with alot of multitasking. independent worker. networking with all types of people
good,"- Always busy"
good,Great company to work for but as a staff member there is not much room for advancement unless someday you would like to become an agent. The company itself gives you tons of support and tools for success.
good,"nice place to work, great work life balance- sometimes hours can be long. But overall great place to work."
good,"My feeling are mixed. Operationally, it is highly segmented with many small departments doing repetitive work. It seems to be a big disconnect with planning and execution from the highest of levels as no one is designated to oversee how projects intersect and overlap. Due to this, change is very slow and most of the work centers around meetings which for a highly productive person can be very annoying."
good,"Enjoyed going to work everyday, not one day was a bad day to me. Family like coworkers, we all helped each other get the job done."
good,"Overall a good working place."
good,"Pros - Decent Salary with Bonus "
good,Great place to work. The owner and manager are flexible and kind.
good,"The job itself can be great and rewarding, however the management of the department has led to a high turnover rate. This leads to periods where the staff is overworked to carry the extra workload of the ones who have left. In addition, for this position, Allstate does not pay competitively against other companies for the exact same position. There are about 6 jobs crammed into one title. The environment can be fun and there are a lot of people to network within Allstate."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of making outbound calls to generate sales production. Scanning customers information in to the computer,answering calls and recieving payments.I learned different things about insurance policies that i was unaware of before working at Allstate. My co-workers were a pleasure to work,never had a problem with any staff. My job was simple, but the hardest part were the hours. I enjoyed my overal experience working for Allstate."
good,Allstate provides an amazing platform of insurance products to help the entrepreneur develop a strong business. The ongoing support from the company is unmatched in the industry. A commitment to long hours in the first 3 years building this business is an absolute must. Having capital on hand to sustain initial cash-flow challenges is also critical.
good,"worked for a new Agent in Carlsbad CA, great person and very hard working, typical day reaching out to customers to provide solutions based products to reach their financial goals."
good,the job was a typical call center. inbound call with busy times during bad weather.
good,"management is ok, the hardest part of work is getting in touch with the customers."
good,"Allstate was more than generous when getting the employees licensed and ready to work.   The training was fun and efficient.  The managers were helpful when needed.  The only thing I did not like was when they listened to my calls and basically tore it apart telling me what I should have done rather than what I did right.  I am all for criticism that will help me but it felt as more of a put down. The pay was pretty good, and there was opportunity to make extra by cross selling."
good,Customers begin calling as soon as the work day starts. Each call is different as customers have different issues. Management works together to help out each team. There are a lot of benefits and weekly incentives going on. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help customers.
good,"Great job, busy and fast paced. The office is busy and there is plenty of customer interactions."
good,"A typical day at work for me is answering phones, taking payments and dealing with each customers' policy questions. Perhaps figuring out how to decrease the cost of their policy by introducing them to discounts that have newly become available. Depositing the bank for the day. Tracking trailing documents (important documents that needto be signed to enforce policy) and makingsure they are turned into our main office. My co-workers are great to deal with as Iam very easy goin myself. The hardest part of my job is dealing with unhappy customers because I strive to make them happy no matter what it takes. The most enjoyable part is when I hear is when they tell me that our agency is the best, they appreciate our hard work, and that they will never leave us as long as we're around. I'm just looking for a new ventue and I have heard nothing bu great things about this company and would love a chance to work at your company."
good,I worked at Allstate taking insurance payments and also Home and Life insurance payments . I would answer phones and file paper work and fax paper work . I liked my job and got along will with my co workers and my boss
good,company stable. lot of policies and procedures didn't make sense.
good,Very large organization with opportunities for learning and growth within varied areas of responsabilty.
good,Overall the experience was good. I enjoyed helping customers get what they came in to get done. I enjoy talking on the phone and working with people so that was never and issue.
good,Owner was knowledgable marketer. Corporate support was ample.
good,"Allstate is a great place to start your career. The benefits, salary, and time they invest into their employees is great for anyone starting out. The only downside is that the overall strategy is not communicated effectively and changes almost every year."
good,"Overall good company to work for, a lot of room for advancement. The benefits are expensive and the starting salary for the position is not enough."
good,"Strong focus on the customer and good working environment. The company has a good culture and nice onsite amenities (Starbucks, Red Mango, Wellness Center, etc). Work/Life balance can sometimes be a struggle due to the amount of work."
good,Good working environment. Had great learning experience. good pay to start with less benefits though.
good,"Good Work Environment.  Decent Salary, poor health benifits"
good,"I've always known the value of customer service, however I was really able to fine tune my skills while working at Allstate. Communication is key, listening to a clients needs and conveying it back to them is critical. I do this with both my words and my actions."
good,Great Company to work for with multiple resources to succeed.
good,"The job is a great entry level job.  The job provides you with a lot of experience in insurance, but advancement is terrible.  Once in a particular position its hard to expand out into other areas."
good,Worked with an agency. Allstate is competing directly with their captive agents

good,Allstate has tuition reimbursement
good,"If you like doing sales, Allstate is a good company to work for. Typically one has responsibilities that include opening the office, answering phones, assisting customers with thier needs and complaints, quoting and trying to close the sale. It is a very competitive industry and every agency owner has different marketing techniques. I personally feel like I'm better suited in a position of management or supervision."

good,Negotiations are extremely difficult when explaining to attorneys why their client's injury claim is not worth what they expected.  I learned that if you have factual explanations it is easier to negotiate successfully.
good,"The workplace culture and management was great.  Ultimately the job was not for me.  Liability claims adjusting is a very emotion-based job for the customers.  They are in car accidents, they vehicles are damaged and their bodies hurt.  I was never to fully overcome the emotional taxing aspect of the job.  Otherwise I enjoyed the environment and I felt the company treated its employees well, although at times the volume of work could become overwhelming and we were expected to work above 40 hours a week to manage it if needed, we were also required to work at least one weekend a month.  Overall I would recommend the company if you can handle the emotional stress of the job."

good,"Lots of interaction with customers and other clients"

The team leads were awesome, and they were very supportive. I think and feel that one needs to be able understand when something bad happens, and NEEDS to show empathetic. Also, should have the stomach for it when one answers that call."

good,"Closely knit team environment."
good,Enjoyed Allstate as a company and am looking at going back to work for an agency and potentially own one someday. Regional managers were amazing and the company had processes set up for agent success. Would recommend working for an Allstate agency and/or owning one.
good,There is no perfect company as the processes and procedures need to be consistent across the board. The training aspect is lacking for new employees and creates a major learning curve.
good,Allstate is a good company that promotes diversity. There was little room to grow but overall it is a good company if you are new to insurance. Allstate will you give the necessities to be successful within the insurance industry in general.
good,"A typical day was on the phones, with regular breaks and meetings through the day. Here I learned valuable sales strategies, learned about large scale marketing strategies and was able to see the implementation of those strategies on a front line position. I definitely felt as though management was there to make sure I had every resource to complete my job efficiently, and the workplace culture was an extremely competitive, yet friendly, one. The hardest part of the job was being seen as the villain to many customers, selling something that they were legally required to carry whether or not they wanted it. But the feeling of success when closing those more difficult sales was more than fulfilling enough to compensate."
good,"I cannot slam on Allstate too much as they've allowed me to relocate back home and to save money. My gripes are with the pay. They offer a lot of paid time off, however with a low pay scale which is seemingly inferior to our competitors, there is little room for vactioning out side of the house. "
good,I enjoyed my job at Allstate but I am wishing to become a teacher and I’m trying to figure out what level. I love children and would like to have more experience with working with different children. Allstate was a very well ran company but it’s not what I would like to continue to do.

good,"The environment is amazing. Benefits are great. People are a little overly nice at first but that dies down after awhile. PTO time right off the bat is really good, best I've had in fact. The only real con actually is the stress level... Monday-Wednesday the job is constantly go go go in my department. I literally have nightmares about the Agents I deal with on a daily basis. This job has a high turn  rate and I believe it's solely on the disrespect we deal with from the agents and LSP's."
good,"On the phone with customers most of the day.. Incoming and Out going calls. Lots of customer service. Management was out on the field most of the time. Culture is very low key and nice.

good,I was advanced to management in the first year and given opportunities for professional development and continues advancement.  I had a great experience and would recommend them to any one who is willing to work hard.
good,"Never a typical day. FPA duties as well as ad hoc reporting. Change is always occurring, which creates unclear direction from management as they shift gears daily. Work life balance is very good, but can change by department."

good,Great workplace. Great Leadership. They value their employees and care about their advancement. Compensation needs work as we do not get paid enough for the work that is done.
good,"During my working experiences with Allstate both as a contractor and a FTE I experienced a very strong sense of company culture.  The employees there are both cooperative and professional, management is constantly looking for ways to improve both the bottom line and the work experience for employees. "
good,Allstate is pulling back in Colorado.  Very stringent with Underwriting and not competitive in rates.  Sales are difficult so we're compelled to scrape the bottom of the barrel to get business written.  Mostly renters insurance is all we can write.  Rarely getting auto insurance closed; and most prospects won't switch just the home to us.

good,"Allstate is a good place to work. However, leadership doesn't have the skills to do the job they expect their employees to handle. My opinion is that leaders should be trained to do the job of their employers so that they can be knowledgeable enough when they meet with their employers. Unfortunately that is not always the case. However, for the most part Allstate is a good company."
good,This position was ok but the pay and efforts you put into the work will not compensate you for what you actually. i would recommend further school for advancement.
good,"Working at Allstate Financial was a mostly positive experience. I really liked my coworkers. The job was not particularly stressful outside of end-of-year report preparation. However, most people had a negative view of management and company direction, so there was little optimism about the company. I really liked all of my direct managers though."

good,"Good management, lots of nice co-workers, fairly easy work. Hardest part was trying to find someone to help another person in rural areas. I learned better phone etiquette and also to be more precise with information, more to the point. I enjoyed the easy going customer and turning a angry customers situation into a positive one by getting them the help they needed. Sometimes I had to clean up another reps mistakes or service providers, but as long as the customer received their service I did my job correctly."

good,"Worked as Office Manger"
good,"There are three crucial words to live by in business; honesty, truth and respect. With that in mind, my review will follow the same set of principles. Working for Allstate has been one of the best choices I have made in regards to my employment and I strongly encourage others to join our team. Now, that's not to say it won't be difficult at times or there won't be any ""work place drama"", because there will be. It's an unavoidable human condition to seek conflict, whether that be conflict with another individual or with yourself. Here in Indianapolis Express, people are very caring and helpful. The managers are even more so. Your personal needs are taken into account and the management staff assists in any way they can to assure your work/life balance is kept at both a professional and desired level. While the work environment is ideal for anyone looking to establish a career or even just work at a job were you can make ends meet while obtaining great benefits, the work load is not for everybody. On an average day, Claim Service Specialists are expected to manage a steady influx of new claims as well as assisting customers with inquiries about existing claims. AND SPOILER ALERT- not all customers are a pleasure to talk with!! In fact, there will be times a customer will become extremely upset with you for something you may or may not have done. But honestly, if that's the only major setback to working here, then it's a drop in the bucket. The benefits are amazing, people are so kind, the starting entry level pay is amazing and there is room for advancement/promotions!! I would"
good,"Work Atmosphere (both people and place)"
good,we maintain a  close network with Allstate vendor to make sure that he customer get what they need in a time of crisis when they have to file a claim for their home of vehicle. The management staff work very hard to provide a inviting atmosphere to work in under such a stressful environment. Each call in individual base and should be treated with such  compassion helpful team member that can and will assure they will take care of the customers needs.

good,"Very competitive atmosphere. Learned several different things such as sales, work ethic, marketing. Managed account and billing information."
good,"Allstate is a huge company, and very diverse. Compared to other company cultures, this culture is all about networking and knowing the employees who have been working there years. Contractors and low level service jobs get treated like 2nd citizens, good cafeteria food. The best part about working here is all the stuff you get access to, while the worst part would be dealing with entitled people in upper management. If someone in upper management doesn't like you, you might as well find a new job to work at, because there will be no upward mobility for you."
good,"Although the Leaders tend to micromanage, it's a great company to work for. There are a few things they do differently then previous companies I worked for. But all companies are different, I guess. You learn a lot, spend most of your time one the phones, it is a call center environment, you get oppurtunity to work outbound completing back office work task but your still speaking with customers. Co-workers and leaders are very helpful.The most difficult about the job is creating a balance with your personal life and working, you tend to feel you are always there. Overall, I think it's a good company to work for, great opportunities if you plan to work in Insurance as a career. If you're not trying to make a career out of it, you will not enjoy it and be miserable and complaining. I just wish they pay more, I feel the pay isn't enough for all the work you have to do."
good,"a typical day at work would consist of taking care of the customer needs. "
good,"Excellent benefits, time off, health insurance. work life balance, most of the management are great people. The training is extensive and very well taught."
good,"A typical day would be you on the phones all day long with a script in front of you persuading people to buy the motor club. Management was terrific, had one of the best managers here, co-workers were very nice and civil. The hardest part of the job though was not meeting quota so you don't get paid for any of the sales you made that week. The most enjoyable part though was being able to talk with so many different people from around the country and get to know them a little bit."

good,"Allstate Insurance Company is not an easy job. Most everyday I worked 12 to 14 hours to provide my customers with the very best customer service possible. My customers had my phone number for 24/7 contact, if needed. I learned how important it is to be honest and truthful in the sales process,and to really care about customer needs, not just my greed. I only sold them products that were based on their needs. I enjoyed being a mentor to new Agents and helping them find there way to a successful career. My co-workers had great respect for me and I for them. I always treat people with kindness and respect. Additionally, I helped them to learn and progress through the training processes. I also learned many things from my Co-workers and have used these skill to develop a successful business plan, and a successful business. Becoming great friends with almost all of my customers, some for more than 28 years. I was sad to leave."
good,"Hard to work with family. "
good,"Explaining coverages, rate increases, rate decreases, providing customer satisfaction, claims liaison.  In the state of Florida there are always people complaining about the rates going up.  Fraud and attorney involvement are very high."
good,"First of all, let me say that there is no typical day in the insurance business. Each day brings on new customer stories, unusual claims involving weather events or unusual circumstances, customer excitement, sadness, and even an occasional angry outburst. Each employee in our small office shares and exemplifies great respect for each other. It is often hard to anticipate if a certain day will be 'busy or slow"" other than those days at the beginning of the month or middle of the month when the office usually becomes quite busy.  On the busiest days it is often difficult to take a short run to the restroom or to even have a small snack for lunch - on these days, you often feel as if you have been ""thrown out of dryer"" when leaving work. On less hectic days, you may actually have time to carry on a conversation with one of your co-workers, slip away from the office to do a few errands, or even have your hour off for a lunch break. Unpredictable."
good,"Answering inbound calls regarding insurance policy questions,  offering additional options to enhance coverage including discussing other policies such as Renters and Auto. Resolving service and billing concerns and accurately processing policy endorsements.Providing quotes for possible purchases of assets."
good,"Somewhat difficult, fast paced environement. Boss/ owner was strict.Came in at 9am and left at 5. Tried to sell all day and it was hard. Mgmt wanted me selling every second and I wish there was better training."
good,This is a fast paced environment and you are on the phone 90 percent of the time. So if answering phones is not your thing this is not the job for you. Managers are very encouraging but could pressure you at time depending on the number that need to be met. Benefits are good there is paid time off bonuses. But there is no room for advancement very limited.
good,I thought Allstate was a great place to work and would work there again. I think that they provide a stable work environment with clear and concise expectations for most of their positions. I think the only con is that it can take some time to get promoted or to more internally.
good,"Working for Allstate has taught me how balance the sale of a product with caring for your customer and fulfilling their needs. Each day I focus to keep a detailed record of my interactions with each client, with specific follow-ups to ensure the most success at selling Allstate products. By quickly analyzing a customer's profile, I'm always on the lookout for products that will benefit this client, which boost agency sales, retention, and help further protect our customers with products they actually need. I ensure that existing clients are properly taken care of if they need adjustments on their policy, need to review their coverages, or billing inquiries. The hardest part of the job is persevering through the slow selling months. But a persistent positive attitude coupled with the desire to do better from one month to the next will see you through even the slowest of months. In the end, seeing people walk out of the office with a smile, knowing they made a worthwhile investment to work with you is the most rewarding part of this job. We are insurance people. Everyday we strive to keep people safe and comfortable so they can sleep a bit easier at night knowing that you got their back."
good,"A typical day at work consist of answering 100-150 calls a day and giving the best customer service possible in handling families that are faced with catastrophic situations and their livelihood and our responsibility was to accommodate and make them feel at ease as much as possible despite circumstances. I learned while working this job, that we can never take life for granted because in can change in an instance of a second and knowing what it is to value life and family. Then management at that time when I was there was okay given working in the Catastrophe Claims department. My co-workers were there in great times of need when dealing with work or personal matters with giving support and encouragement. The hardest part of the job was hearing the disastrous life changes that took place in families lives due to what we call ""Nature"" with horrible and bad storms or earthly things that happened that no one could control and the most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you've made a difference in the lives of families that can walk away with tears of joy because you've made something happen for them that can give them some relief of the circumstances at hand."

good,"Great industry, insurance instruments as well as financial instruments involved in the process of selling and facilitating the product to clients."
good,"I managed the entire office, would get to work in the morning to forward phones in time or else we'd get a notice of non-compliance as the opening and closing of the business & hrs were monitored by the corporate office via remote access. Answered calls, gave quotes, serviced client accounts, processed payments, change requests, remit reports, took payments to bank at end of day or by following day. My coworkers were excellent, my boss would come in about 2 x's per month for payroll & he'd take me to lunch & buy me a drink. Hardest part of the job was tryin to get new business on my own w/out being able to get out of the office and do any networking, also my boss invested alot of money in mailers to drum up business, but I didn't think it would help and it didn't. I thought he should've invested more in the different lead providers (as I've had a lot of success this way w/my previous job at another Allstate office where I started as an agent, always met my quotas, & was tied for 5th place out of about 25 agents for top sales of the year in 2009), but he would spend the money & tell me later that we had a mailing project to do. I would have loved to close the office every once in a while to go try to network & get some leads from outside the office. I learned that no matter how hard I tried I could not make the company more money w/out another agent and a receptionist to work with. I knew - and my boss agreed when he told me he was closing the business - that I just couldn't make our required #'s on my own w/out more help. I saw the end coming but remained loyal to the end so"
good,Working at the agency you do a little of everything from service to sales.

good,"If you produce results, you'll be rewarded.  Agents will seek you out to partner with.  If you rely completey on 1 or 2 agents, you will fail.  Make sure the agents you partner with share similar goals that you do.  I have been an EFS since late 2017 and have achieved reward trips based on year 2 production.  It is a great job if you actually show up to agency offices to work.  ""Work from home"" folks will mostly fail spectacularly."

good,Allstate is always evolving & changing as the market does.  Great place to work.  The hardest part of the job would be the ever changing guidelines for each line of insurance.
good,It was a great work culture with people willing to assist others as a team in completing tasks. A meeting with everyone in the morning helped keep everyone focused throughout the work day.
good,My job is boring and I desire to advance. I just need to be in a position I can see people and interact. a computer screen doesn't do it for me. I have too much skill to sit behind a screen.
good,"I LOVED my job at Allstate, but the production requirements were a bit beyond what I felt was reasonable. I think it would have been perfect if they'd lowered our production expectations just a little bit so that we could actually enjoy our job and not have our faces in the computer for 8 hours straight. It wears the employees down, making us too worn out to provide the excellent customer service we were all capable of giving. I miss Allstate!"

good,"Hard work and busy. Days go quick but a lot of accountability. Culture in the office is great, the entire team works together and wants to be successful. Management from home office is out of touch."
good,"AllState is a good company however to advance from the customer service role you have to move to another state. If you  can’t move you are stuck in the same position. Unfortunately they don’t always compensate you to move either . Unless they are opening a new location they will not pay for it . It’s a good company though . Just very little room for advancement. "

good,"I enjoyed working here and would recommend others to work here as well. Unfortunately, the business decision led positions to another state which did not align with my ambitions."
good,"In an effort to modernize the way claims are handled, Allstate is moving away from retaining top talent that learned all aspects of the job and could handle anything thrown at them to placing people into a specific role with only instruction on how to do your step.  The benefits are worsening, employee retention is at an all time low, and even something as simple as coffee is no longer available - while other departments (such as IT) receive catered lunch and breakfast in the same building."

good,"I worked at Allstate while going to school. It was a very good first to job have. It allowed me to work and go to school. "

good,"Allstate truly is a great place to work. The culture truly defines the company, from leadership on down. People are friendly, happy, and tend to stay a long time."

good,"Provided customer service and sales for customers and potential customers"
good,"-Working at Allstate is great for the benefits."
good,"A typical day at work would be dealing with customers some good others not so good.  You are constantly on the phone servicing, selling and getting information.  You are handling money, dealing with walk-in customers and at time working alone. I learned to prioritize my work load, and to have patience.  The hardest part of the job is not always having the resources to help client.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that we all got along, which help when you need it assist."
good,"Liked working with the customers and learning something new on a regular basis. Very rewarding to help people, and at the same time, work for a solid company."

good,"I loved working at Allstate both times I have, I have never had a problem with management. MY only concern was paid time off after being there a while and fair pay raises as promised."
good,Allstate is an enjoyable place to work. Benefits are good and the staff tries to keep things upbeat on any typical day. I'd recommend working for Allstate.
good,"I was disappointed to realize that Allstate is relocating all their claims offices to Arizona, I loved working there and planned to retire there but I am not able to relocate to Arizona at this time."
good,"I enjoyed working at AllState Insurance corporate office. I felt that if I stayed, I might have furthered my career. Management was very fair with raises and in general."
good,"I love the field of insurance.  This was not the first time I worked for an Allstate office so I was very familiar with their operations.  At this office, I specialized in Property and Casualty insurance.  My responsibility was to carefully assess rick and quote insurance coverage for individuals.  I enjoy interacting with people  and worked diligently to maintain good customer service after the sale."
good,Typical day was to review renewing policies.
good,"The only reason I left was agencies I serviced were struggling due to the economy and premium increases, and i could not get enough prospects due to agency closings and changing hands."
good,"taking customers calls data entry work"
good,Team Leads were always looking for fun things to do with their teams. Everyone was energetic and fun to work with. Training's were  fun and informative.
good,"was a great place to build your business and to grow, learn and enhance your skills and experience. Work place culture was lacking in support and motivation"
good,Low moral in the agent force. Company changes goals often and changes bonus structure for the agents and when they are made it is only on the company terms
good,"The culture is fun and upcoming in technology, my area allowed you to learn anything you want to be more efficient at your job.This company is like any other but employees are paid very well."
good,"Allstate is proud of being the ""middle of the road"" company in terms of work-life balance.  You won't be worked to the bone, but you won't be striking it rich either.  I enjoy/ed my time there, and got to work on some interesting projects, even when I was a more junior employee.  Managers and directors (in my experience) take an active interest in developing their employees, and the overall atmosphere is positive and encouraging."
good,I was hired on a temporary basis to assist in setting up the company's office processes and equipment. I was required to become licensed for P&C Insurance in order to speak to clients. I did not enjoy sales.
good,"Good work environment, The only part of this job I didn't like is that they push sales volume on the employees. Management seemed like it didn't care about its policy holders and more focused on the branches monthly goals"
good,"I really did enjoy the job, however after a year have been unable to make enough money to support my family, wish I had gotten into insurance sales when I was younger."
good,Family friendly work place. Very good benefits and training. Excellent location and facility. Professional development opportunities. Supports insurance exams.
good,"Good company to work for and the people there is great.  Everyone gets along and the hours are long, because it's around storm season, but you'll enjoy, because you are learning new things."

good,"Fast pace department that allowed you to grow individually through continued education, seminars and self study courses that also promoted team work and practices"
good,"The workplace culture improved during the 28 years I was with the company. Most departments allow flexible work schedules and business casual attire, sometimes even allowing jeans. There is always training available and should be used when time permits. There are usually incentives for certifications and school reimbursement. It is still a good company for women and minorities. There is room for advancement and transfers to other departments; however, if you are a subject matter expert it is more difficult to move. Great cafeterias and they promote healthy lifestyle. Benefits are very good."
good,"okay placed to work. never had any problems. just remember it is all about sales , but if your truly into sales then working insurance would be a good fit."
good,"I answered phones and helped customers a lot. I learned quite a bit from my manager and she was always helpful and encouraging. Selling policies was difficult at first, but rewarding to help someone."
good,"company listened to what i had to say and tried to help my family. strong support for community and nonprofit causes, commute was too much, lots of office drama"
good,"learned more customer service and problem solving skills, learned how to take online payments, how to fax and file documents, learned how to create insurance binders and make in and outbound phone calls to prospects, renewals, and at risk policies. Also bulk mailing as part of prospecting, renewals, and at risk policies."
good,I was the office receptionist and quoted insurance for customers and provided customer service to customers that called or came in.  If you have a good owner of the business I imagine the job would better.
good,I like working there.  By working there my typing skills improved greatly.  It was my full time job and I really liked it. I was laid off. I miss working there.
good,Don't become an agent unless you have a book to buy and have run an agency before. I was mislead by the manager ahead of me about a lot. In California they are not competitive.
good,"Wally was a great boss, however the manager I had did not run the other office well and it ended up shutting down. Leaving me without a job. All of the agents quit while  I was there due to management."
good,Learned about the inner workings of BMW and Mini Cooper vehicles to help assist customers with questions or get them road side assistance. Helped customers set up appointments to have their vehicles picked up and dropped off at dealer ships.
good,Allstate is trying to build an environment where everyone feels comfortable with engaging and provides ideas to improve the business. The company continues to ma!e positive movement within the insurance industry.
good,The work environment was fun and felt like family.  The Health insurance was not great but the other benefits were very nice.  Work load can be heavy at times but team work helped in getting job tasks done daily.
good,"great days can be long they just had a rate increase so no alot of people are getting policies with them right now, which means no commission bonuses."
good,only worked at allstate as a summer job. the people i worked with where great but didnt work there a long time. management was pretty cool too. would recommend them
good,Fast paced organization that offered many various paths. Company expectations on the associate were high and incoming work was at a high level with the expectation of a quick turnaround.
good,Staff is helpful. very fast paced environment. Must have very good multitasking skills as well as organization. Must be able to answer multiple questions at one time and provide great customer service
good,"Quick paced, competitive and opportunities are unlimited. Slow starting and lots of products to learn, but with perseverance success is imminent. Only other thing I'd recommend is better training with other successful advisors"
good,Hours are flexible and management is fun and understanding. I only work as a customer service rep. and apart of the mailing department. Relaxed environment and welcoming.
good,"The environment was peaceful employees were easy to get along with and it was a great leaning experience. There were many things I leaned in the work place such as scanning, faxing and learning to communicate with others."
good,"I enjoyed working at Allstate.  The company bought the Signature/GE portion of the Roadside Assistance so that basically is where i started.  But I went back as a Supervisor because of the previous experience with roadside and my years of experience in management at PSI.  The atmosphere was excellent, the center was fast paced and I enjoyed working with all of my coworkers in management and the CSRs.  There was on going training for everyone and great perks.  The only thing that Allstate did not acquire from Signature/GE was the Star Program.  The incentives for the reps was not as good. I enjoyed working at Allstate especially overnight because the coworkers were fun and we kept each other entertained."
good,I worked here right out of college for over a year and I will say cautiously that overall it was a positive experience. They don't have a high or even decent wage for somebody with decent bills but at least they have a small salary where some firms don't at all.
good,"If you were able to reach your monthly sales goal and make commissions, then it was a good month. Allstate did try and always help you reach your sales goal."
good,"Great company, the people who I worked with were very helpful and cheerful all of the time. The supervisor was a great person and helped out when I was lost."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Allstate.  The facility is very comfortable.  The training for my role was a great experience  that taught me alot.  I performed my duties well.  The only complaint is that I was in such a financial jam,  and ultimately the salary just did not meet my needs."
good,Professional business setting where can enjoy being at the comfort at your own desk.stress free environment. And the company culture is very entertaining .
good,"A typical work place would  be answering calls, going to training meetings, having fun days with games to win prizes and always having teams to compete against for holiday decorations. I learned from working at Allstate the different policies on insurances in many different states. The work place was diverse, the hardest part of the job was managing the time limit between calls so that the team will suffer for lack of getting to the next call in time. The most enjoyable part of my job was the co workers and the conversations that took place with some of the customers during the calls some were happy calls and some were sad calls, but being that I can ease the call for the customers made me happy."
good,Allstate was my first job out of college. It was 7 meaningful years learning about taking care of the customer first. I know that because of Allstate that I am a successful sales rep. today.
good,It was great opportunity to work at Allstate. The agents were very friendly and helpful. The environment was very relaxed yet competitive. Great boss and flexible hours.
good,Allstate is a great job that has room for growth. You will be working in a fast-paced environment that provides great service to each client. The work environment is positive and the most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you are making sure your clients have great coverage!
good,Great job with great people. Very fast paced but the training team was great and gets you onboarded very quickly. Management is awesome. Downside is starting out it is lower pay and benefits aren't great.
good,"Same as above. Workplace is almost excellent, professional and fair. They have good technology tools and good resources. The work is stressful, but tools are available to make your work better. People are helpful, but could be very political in their views and selection of people they want to deal with. The pay is good, it is commensurate to the work you do. Full time employees do not have good work ethics, they are always out of the office or having conversations with other employees."
good,Great place to work and learn the business. Low key but success driven. Ubundant opportunities to explore opportunities and proceed along ones own path OR to tow the line.  Compensation commiserate with production with bonus rewards from Allstate.
good,When I worked here the company seemed to put a lot of effort on keeping the employees happy. They had a great culture and everyone seemed to be very welcoming.
good,"No growth opportunities because its a small agency. Seek corporate for advancement. No benefits either like corporate. No 401k or health insurance. Pay tends to be lower also. These things may vary agency to agency. Great for someone content with staying in one position over a long period of time, someone with a second job, or financial help. Not good for a single person with no financial assistance."
good,"Great Place to Work! Very caring, and truly employee focused. Of late, the company has really focused on being innovative, and has made great strides in advancing technology related to Insurance."
good,At times it is quite busy.  There is a lot to learn within the insurance department. The job is not hard at all. Everyone is friendly everyone is willing to help out when needed.
good,Allstate was a hard place to work with a small child at home. I probably jumped back into work too quickly. Other than that anyone driven enough to get through training can kill it there.
good,Allstate office was owned and operated by agent. Relaxed environment. Great boss! Pay was hourly plus commission based. Sales came pretty easy because it was an established office.
good,"Did not work there that long, the Owner/Manager, decided to get out of the business and sell it. He negotiated the positions for one of the girls to stay on with the new owner. The other two of us he took out to lunch to break the news to us. Note: Fortunately, while I was working in Insurance, I was married and my husband's job supported the household."
good,I learned to work as a Team.  The reason I had left after 15 years was to stay home with my newborn son who is now 13 years.  Started out as a typists for the injury unit and ended up with the title of Senior Claim Processing Specialist.
good,"I have been very happy in my time with Allstate.  Hours are flexible, pay is based on hourly plus commission with no cap."
good,Great place to work. Good benefits. Good Pay. Easy job if you don't mind sitting down for 8hrs. Able to advance or transfer to other departments. Would
good,The most rewarding aspect of the job is when a customer's claim is handled and they can begin to put their life back together again. The friends that I have made there are like family.
good,Helpful staff and management. Claims and customer service reps are helpful as well. The ethics and honesty Allstate strives for is awesome. Great pay with bonuses and incentives.
good,"I am retiring in 3 months. Do not want to work past the age of 65 in the current work environment. The current workload makes it almost impossible to maintain a manageable pending and above average customer service, which are the two primary focus areas of the company right now."
good,All employees are great people. Outstanding Manager and just a great vibe around the place. I'm not really sure why I have to keep writing about this but the place is great
good,being an insurance agent is not for everyone. you must invest everything into an unsure outcome. there are no guarantees. it takes incredible perseverance to succeed.
good,Allstate Life is a great company to work for.  Great corporate culture.  Good work life balance.  Appropriate training provided to complete the job required.
good,"Management waswonderful."
good,This was a great job to introduce me to the insurance field. It was challenging and most rewarding. Great Office Manager and P&C Agent experience. Great environment & made me grow!

good,"Allstate has a nice working environment."

good,Great Place to Work. The leadership team made every effort to ensure they maximized your skillset. additional training and education was always available.
good,Love working there! This is a great company to work for with many areas for adavancemet and they will train you to become and pro in your field. You have opportunity to become licensed in insurance health and life
good,"My work day was really relaxed, very little management."
good,"Call center work, answering phones and making outbound calls. Flexible schedules anywhere from 645am to mignight. Pay started at $15.00/hr when I left, paid training (approx. 2 months training). Raises depend on performance. There was not very much opportunity for advancement at the call center I was at but just because there are not many people in upper level positions leaving. There are plenty of opportunities if you transfer to a different state though. Coworkers there are pretty relaxed and are willing to help others. Hardest part of the job is the mental stress of taking call after call. Overall, a great place to work for the pay."
good,Allstate was a great place to work.  The only thing about the job that I was doing you must be independent in how you do your work.  Learned a great deal on information.  Worked very long hours.  No time for personal life at all.
good,"Phone calls, customer service, handle customer request regarding policy changes i.e. add car, replace car, delete cars, coverage questions, policy increase, billing questions, payment handling, RCPS meeting and management"
good,There was very good support from the management and company has very clear and honest process. Pay was not that great however work environment/culture suited me very well and I learned a lot about dealing with different customers and build the business relationship.
good,"great company to work for "
good,I enjoyed my jop because i enjoy travel and it was a good work environment.   Good work ethic a and enough work to do.  Management was good also. Good
good,"I work here for a couple of mouths during high school. They were soccer  coaches at my school. It was my senior year. The only bad thing is when I graduated I never heard from the again. it was not with the big main company, just a small branch."
good,"A typical work day would be going out to look at 4 or 5 vehicles varying from small hits to total losses and everything in between. It is a place where you will learn something new everyday and management is very helpful in times of need. The work culture was good, you normally will only see your coworkers a handful of times per year, but with weekly meetings you never feel disconnected from anyone. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with difficult customers, oddball claims situations, and stubborn body shops. The best part of the job is the opportunity to travel and meet new people on a daily basis. Allstate's PTO time is very generous and offer all the benefits you could think of. Job security rated low due to the fact that numerous adjusters were laid off due to a new process that was implemented"
good,Everyday you learn something new. Talking to new client all the time. Work in a fast place. Smile in person or phone.  The management is great and they are easy and fast to learn.
good,"Great place to work if you are a working mother! The people are super nice. A great workplace culture. The benefits aren't all that great, but there is so much flexibility for work that includes work from home option"
good,Allstate is a terrific company for young people.  There are lots of opportunities and benefits are solid.  They do not hang on to workers that are 50+.
good,Allstate has a good balance of work and life with a very generous paid time off package as well as other incentives making the company one of the better corporations to work.
good,this company taught me how to be able to interact with people better and be able to open my mind to customer facing some issues and am glad they loved me.
good,"Overall great company to work for, great culture. Plenty of departments within the organization. Would recommend to others who are seeking a fast paced environment."
good,"Great benefits like medical, dental, vision, 401k, personal time off, training, bonus plan, employee discounts, diverse culture, with job advancement within the company."
good,"I enjoyed working at Allstate, though at times the day can be hectic. management was fairly incompetent though the lower level employees always where very loyal to each other and worked to help each other."
good,"Allstate was a good company to work for especially if you were good with selling and overcoming objections. My job was to offer customers a customized quote for car insurance, and before the conversation was over to let them know we can bundle their home insurance which will allow a much better rate. We would also advise our customers that we had great  life insurance and offer money management which we would refer to our financial planners. I learned that it is so important to know what you are covered for in detail before you file a claim, and also to have proper coverage for families needs. The most difficult part of the job for me was having to read scripts to upsell a customer who is totally not interested,  but you knew you had to do it because you always wanted to meat your quota. But our company was fun because we always had a lot of fun during our Kick Offs to generate moral and of course more sales."
good,All State was a good experience for me it was even though it was only an internship it really help me get a better understanding of the business world the people and the everyday life of that society

good,Working at the agency was a lot fun.  Always a great team to be around. Great opportunity for entry level sales.  Always enjoyed helping out our great customers!
good,"I found the environment ok, but not dynamic."
good,"A typical date at work would be the numerous phone calls."
good,Working in an agent's office can be very different from one agency to the next.  Some are great agents who are flexible and provide a great working environment.  Others are there to use their employees until they have no more to give.  Fortunately most agents are caring small business owners who want their people to succeed and will provide the necessary tools and training to be successful as long as you are willing to put forth the effort.
good,This company is very family oriented. They strive to be the best insurance provider in the market by providing competitive prices and excellent service.
good,"its a great place to work, great benefits and work life balance. everyone that works here is super friendly. We have great community relationships and volunteer work."
good,"Opened office, prepared filed, answered phones, helped customers with their car related questions help to give them answers that helped their needs.  Forward to covering agents."

good,"Friendly customer service, Learned more about taking care of customers needs. Management helpful and caring of your needs. Good work hours. Customers are nice to work with."
good,"good company, its sales so it is what you make of it and matters if you have good leads or if your office has a good system for leads. nothing bad to say about the product."

good,"Customer Service Representative					Plymouth,MN"
good,"Working in a office was a difference experience, with the fact of filing paper work, making claims for clients, answer calls while typing policies, co-workes made it fun while working with them."
good,You must be very customer service oriented and willing to go above and beyond for the client. Everyone is very willing to work together to get the best quote for the client and is determined to make it a great experience for the client.
good,"Cold Call leads, develop an interest for a quote. Quote the appropriate line of insurance. Recontact the prospect, give them the quote and await call back or continue to try to reconnect with prospect. Answer incoming phone calls and handle customer inquiries."
good,"Drive sales of P&C via current agencies growth and Recruiting new agencies in new markets."
good,While the pay was good and there were opportunities for advancement extenuating circumstances required me to quit. If i continued there were also talk of benefits i would gain that were very appealing.

good,"Loved Allstate for breif time there.  Management outstanding and caring.  Great to see people there for 30 years or more spoke volumes about the company,"
good,"Answering phone calls, assisting customers with electronic payments, sales and queries about their insurance. I learned a lot about insurance and sales. Management was very demanding, specially on the sales calls. Great offices. It was hard trying to explain to the owner why the client was not interested in paying more for his product. I met interesting people, and my co-workers were very pleasant to work with."
good,A nice work environment. Very helpful co-workers. Good work hours. It would be great to implement a 401 k plan for the employees.
good,"Very good company  to work for."
good,"Busy high pace job"

good,"The Allstate culture is focused on developing confident, innovative employees that are focused on enhancing our products and customer experience in order to build lasting relationships.  Working in Northbrook offers significant opportunity to work with diverse groups and areas of responsibility to broaden one's knowledge of the insurance industry."
good,I worked there 20 years.  Even though I was laid off they did right by me.  I loved my last position with Allstate.  No hard feelings I am glad I was given a great opportunity to work for a great company.

good,"Great work environment, Team orientation and lots of team efforts. Great work culture to work for and a balance work and life style. Team motivation. Team Focus"
good,Typical day at work would be log in to your system check your emails and company job board for any major updates or process changes. Once settled you start your work processes and engage with teammates as needed.  Hardest part of the job was all the meetings that took away from your primary work and production time but some were necessary for quality assurance. Most enjoyable part of the job was the people and teammates which made for a great work environment.
good,Overall great company however subcontracting connection needs reevaluation. Allstate delivers on career advancement  and opportunities  Mentoring for all positions could be more accessible by all employees if identification were more readily available
good,completed loss assignments for our customers to help them recover there loss....great customer service skills....did claims for company 29 years....had several awards for claim handling and customer service
good,I enjoyed working at Starbucks.  I wish the  management would not have been new at the location I was at during the time I was there.  I would like to continue to work there in Missouri.
good,Worked in development and maintenance of the application that makes payment for the users/customers for any claims issued by Adusters. Worked on support as well.
good,Good company and the pay and raises are good. I would work for Allstate again. There are alot of claims and you work long hours.
good,It allowed me to be able to help people who were in need and to think outside of the box if you will. I also learned how important insurance is in your everyday life.
good,Learned new sales techniques daily to enhance personal and company goals. Worked with enthusiastic management. Learning Gateway systems proved challenging yet rewarding.
good,I highly enjoy working here! The office is small and friendly with more than enough walk-in traffic to keep you busy. I enjoyed meeting long time customers and learning new skills to make sales when needed. I enjoy feeling like an integral part of the team!

good,I have been in the Insurance Industry for a long period of time. Client are the number one in my book. They build on the book of business and keep the company growing. I hear to help grow the book and maintain all lines of insurance.

good,"•	Answered calls and assisted customers "
good,"It is a call center, I was on the phone all day taking and making an average 70 calls per day. Heavy data entry and listening skills. Over time available."
good,"Working 40 hours a week. I have gained extensive knowledge in the insurance field. My day usually consists in handling large volume of calls daily, contact all renewals to discuss rate changes, coverage, and discount opportunities and answer client’s questions and follows up on unresolved issues. My co-workers are great people to work with. They're very supportive and wiling to help if a situation was to come up. I believe the hardest part of the job is having to explain to clients why their policy has had an increase. Most of these customers are upset, but I believe that with patience and showing them that you understand their position and are wiling to help them for as long as they need to get this issue resolved is how to best handle the situation. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the satisfaction in clients' faces because it makes one realize that they're job is truly important and people are dependent of you."

My boss was always fantastic at being as supportive as possible while I learned the ins and outs of what it's like to work in a sales environment.

The hardest part of the job is the stress that comes with working in a sales environment, but seeing the company succeed was worth the hard work put in."

I have seen to many Agents come and go and it hurts that they lost so much because of what they were promised when opening an agency.  "
good,"allstate is a great company, that pays well, but when you have an emergency they don't put that in consideration in your job. you have to receive a point against you while you have a medical emergency, which isn't fair to you as an employee, but that is the only downside to this job."

People who have been involved in an accident are already upset and scared. Having to go through medical treatments and bills they may or may not be able to afford was a lot of stress on them. The Claim Representatives that I worked with were very caring and empathetic towards all involved. If it was our insured our the other persons involved, they were treated with respect and care. The hardest part of the job was witnessing damage and loss by innocent people.Accidents are never easy, but the claim reps do their best to make it right & to do it quickly.

good,Allstate is a great company to work for with balancing your work and home schedule. A few things that I have learned working across boundaries and training via WebEx with Allstate Business Partners.  Our management team is always there for me and willing to listen and help me reach my desired  career goals. The hardest thing for me is being unable to assist internal or external customers due to not having access to specific systems.

good,Typically it was busy taking inbound calls.  Got opportunities to learn about different types of insurance.  The staff and managers were really good people and good to work for.  The culture was friendly and inviting.  The management seemed ti listen to input.  When they can they put it into play.
good,"Working for an agency in New Jersey truly has been a wonderful experience. I have sharpened my skills in customer service, utilizing phone and email etiquette to relay information to members of the company, as well as customers. I have been forced into difficult situations because of a customer's distaste for company procedures, but the staff of my agency, as well as those employed by the company, have been incredibly supportive to me."
good,"*Work environment is too good."
good,The office I was at was really good until we got a new manager that didn't have management experience. Everyone in the office ended up quitting.

good,Great balance between work and family life. Flexible schedules and great work atmosphere. the ability to learn new functions and jobs and where your opinion means something
good,I have found in my five years with Allstate that such a large company has both pros and cons. While I have had the opportunity to hold several different roles within the same organization - providing an enjoyable level of variety and challenge - the same large organization can move slower than I would prefer in making decisions due to the number of individuals who are required to weigh in on even relatively small decisions.
good,"Each day started and ended with a positive work environment. I've learned better way on how to work as a team and how to push myself more individually. Great manger and great co-workers,"
good,Allstate is a great place to work with a fun and casual environment. This is a very transparent company and thrives on team work and customer service.

Taking quote information for automobile, boat, motorcycle, and home insurance. The hardest part of this job is dealing with upset customers, when their insurance rates have gone up, which I have no control over. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping the agents not get behind with work and making customers happy when I can solve their insurance problems."
good,"I learned the insurance business from an agent role and loved it, I can get outside the office to create more business and take care of personal matters."

good,"Fast pace call center environment, processing qualified plan distributions and account issues"
good,"I worked in a close-knit environment where everyone shared a common goal in growing and maintaining existing business.  Management was very hands-off in most cases, and it was understood that each individual had their own way of growing business. I loved the satisfaction of educating a customer on the importance of having different types of insurance. It was important to advise them on why they need a specific type of coverage.  It was most satisfying to provide important coverages to customers they didn't know existed.  While this was the most rewarding part of the job, it was often the most difficult. The ability to explain to the customer in a 10 minute phone call why something I learned over several years is important, could often be very challenging.  Working with Allstate taught me the ability to cater my sales approach based on the customers level of insurance education."
good,"The office opens at 9 a.m. I get there @ 8:50 to get the office ready for the day. I check the voicemail, get deposits ready, and go over appointments for the day. I service existing customers that call or stop in. I help potential clients with insurances quotes. While quoting, I explain what the coverage they requested protects and identify any potential risks there may be which exposes their assets. I cross-sell insurance products that fit the clients insurance needs and the client leaves my office knowing what they have purchased and feeling safe. I deal with lending officers with home insurance for closing. I prepare and conduct weekly team meetings to go over product updates, what needs to be focused on selling, and other office dealings. I run numbers to ensure agents are on track and being compliant. "

good,"Management was tough, but fair. You knew what you had to do and when it was due by. No micromanaging, and plenty of space given. Compensation was fair for the work you're doing, and some room for growth if you decided to get licensed to sell insurance"
good,"Work was great.  The hours were not.  This was full time 45 + hours per week, I have a 3 year old son.  I was missing too much of his life. I am looking for part time work 30 hours per week."

good,"When you start one of the Allstate Customer Information Centers, everything is great, throughout training and transition into your regular position, scheduling, pay, time off, managers, and the company as a whole are just great. That lasts for about 3-4 months. After that, things are a bit more rigid, but you're at the mercy of your manager. If you've got a good one, you're golden, if not, then unless you're naturally a salesperson, you're screwed. I had the fortune of having both throughout my time at Allstate, so I can speak to both experiences."
good,"A typical day at work injoyable, but stressful at times."
good,Come as needed do whatever is asked of me as far as playing host welcoming customers in taking customers payments being the janitor and getting lunch and dropping off bank payments. I enjoyed coming in to wrok everyday beause there was never a dull moment you always have to be on your A game in a office enviroment. I learned that no matter who youre working for (ex. family or friend) there will be no slack cutt becaause who u you have to come in and give a 100% no matter how your day went before u got to work still be productive and smile.

I learned a bunch of information about car insurance that I never knew before and thought I really didn't care to know about either. I loved my co-workers because they made work fun and didn't mind taking the time to explain something that I didn't understand. They helped me gain extreme knowledge about my job to better help them and the company. The hardest part of my job was starting out and not knowing anything about it. I have always been a fast learner, but I was nervous about working with something with zero previous knowledge of. The most enjoyable part of the job was to learn all the different information that you could learn about insurance. I was able to learn quickly and help the agents at their job to take some of their load off of their shoulders. It was great knowing that I was helping them and gaining knowledge."
good,I think its a good place to work. I enjoy the atomosphere and helping the agents write profitable business

good,I worked for allstate for nine years. It was a great place to work.
good,"Of the agency owners and staff I have met so far, they are courteous and nice and they know what they are talking about.  Many of the people that I have spoken with in the home office are there to support those people in the field that are making the money for the organization.  However, there are people that you will come across sometimes on a daily basis when you're looking for help - they don't provided the help.  I have worked for several large organizations and the ratio is still 75% very good support and 25% sub par support."

good,Would review estimates and photos to determine if vehicle is repairable or a total loss.  I also completed reviews of damage to determine if loss related or not covered under the customers policy.  This would include acting as a mediator between the repair shop and policy holder in the previous scenarios. My immediate managers were very supportive and I got along well with them.  The most enjoyable part of the my job was working with a great group of people.  The hardest part of the job was working with ongoing customer repair complaints.

The workplace environment was small, friendly and healthy compared to lots of other work environments in which I had been in but also competitive. The hardest part of the job was learning the system and learning how to take basic quote sheets. The most enjoyable part of this job was that everyone was willing to help you learn."
good,Professional work environment. I found Allstate to be very supportive in developing career paths and provided numerous opportunities to learn and develop their employees. They were advocates for allowing employees to add value and listened to them. All my managers over the years were great!

good,"If you are ok with taking calls all day, this is an amazing job. Sometimes it can get a little repetitive. If you give it your best then there is plenty of room for advancement."
good,"Allstate Fire & Security is an authorized dealer of ADT security systems, not the insurance company. The owner is a laid back gentleman but firm on his company being production based. This is an enviornment that I thrived in."
good,Allstate has both good pay and benefits. The work load depends on the time of year and can either be rather stressful or relaxed. Overall it is good place to work that offers a great amount of work life balance.
good,"I enjoy working at Allstate. The Leadership teams are willing to listen to our concerns. The CEO has coffee meetings with all levels of employees on a regular basis.  All Managers have check-up meeting with the individual team members on a quarterly basis, and also meeting with the Director at least once a year."

good,Working for an Allstate agency was a learning experience that I'm thankful for. It provided me an insight of how insurance works and helped me develop useful costumer service skills as well as sales. The most enjoyable part of the job was the feeling of being accomplished when I sold a product and interacting with all types people. The hardest part of the job was trying servicing multiple clients in a timely manner and selling insurance simultaneously.
good,"Allstate was the best place I have worked. I learned a lot about insurance, people and myself. The people there are great to work with. Allstate does value work/home balance."
good,"as a field adjuster, my work was never the same from day to day. Most of the people I worked with were pleasant and had positive attitudes. The benefits package is by far one of the best out there. I had health coverage from day one, and the cost was very reasonable. the 401k program is excellent. Paid vacation is the best of any company I have worked for. Upper management is excellent."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Allstate. A typical day consisted of handling homeowner claims. Work is sedentary, and it recommended that you remain at your desk available as much as you can to receive customer and inquiry calls. "
good,"I started as a casualty adjuster and transitioned to a field auto adjuster. The field is head and shoulders better than casualty. Expect to be worked to death on the desk, but the field isn't as bad. However, Allstate just had a bunch of layoffs in the field, so job security isn't as good as it once was. "
good,Work at this very well established insurance company was very educational.  The property and casualty insurance business is competitive and constantly changing.  I enjoyed having state of the art technology and working with professional yet fun co-workers.
good,"The workload is pretty strenuous, but the benefits are amazing. You do have to put up with a lot, in terms of the amount of claims that you have to take on a daily basis. You also need the patience to deal with different types of people in a very fast paced environment. If you are not a people person, I don't recommend taking this job. But again, the benefits are amazing. I'd make use of the benefits provided."
good,"Even though I worked as a contractual employee, the department people treated me very well. They did not want to let me go but they can't hire me as a permanent employee for some reasons. They just kept on extending my contract and they respected me. They liked the way I worked, and I was told that I was the best contractual employee that they ever had in the department."

I, also, acted as a professional/personal assistant to the Owners and assisted with other tasks, like scheduling appointment, providing child care, and completing out of the office errands."
good,"Allstate was the best i have experienced in terms of a company actually caring about their employees. Although they couldn't satisfy everyone, they tried! I give them an applause for their efforts in trying to focus on work and life balance for their employees. Still it is a job or career path, and they have to do some things in the eyes of corporate as a business,which can at times feel a little too scripted and repetitive. Overall if you are looking for a reliable and respectable good paying job and for a company who treats their employees well, then this may be a good fit for some of you out there. Most of all, i will miss the awesome potlucks and free prize giveaways there."
good,Structured program focused on developing skills for interns as they decide their careers. Interns are given work that matters and that is used in business decisions.
good,"I've been here 3 years, the only thing I feel like they need to work more on is work-life balance. Everything else is pretty solid."

good,"I started out as the office secretary to learn the business. I then proceeded to get my Insurance licenses. I obtained my P & C and also my Health , Life & Disability licenses to become and agent for Allstate.  I loved meeting new people and bringing their insurance needs to me to service and be their agent."
good,"As a telemarketer for the Extreme Marketing Team employed by various Allstate branches, the typical day was simple: make calls and interest possible clients in an insurance quote. From the experience overall I learned a lot and had some fun doing it. The only critique being that the company was very new and just starting out, so understandably there were some kinks to be worked out. Being that the company was new there wasn't much past precedent data to compare to, and calling on Friday nights or weekends caused slightly lower quotes. Overall it was a positive work environment, I enjoyed my co-workers, and I learned a lot from my time at Allstate and the Extreme Marketing Team."
good,This was my first job that wasn't a daycare/teacher position and I got los of experience from sykes.  I learned so much on handling customers

good,"Like any company, there are poor managers and fabulous managers that have a large impact on work environment.  The job is what you make it.  Co-workers at this company work hard to do the right thing and make the work environment an enjoyable place to be.  Company works hard to put the customer first and support customer during difficult times.  Shift occurred in past several years emphasizing work-life balance and overall employee health."
good,decided to leave to relocate and pursue other opportunities.  wished to pursue opportunities more closely related to my MBA
good,"Work at Allstate had it challenges as most jobs, due to being a part of the sales & service origination always kept me interfacing with our customers which was a key part of my role.  I learned so much from this company and still apply a lot of what I learned in my day to day role now. "
good,This company provided training and education that enabled me to enhance my management skills and pursue my college education goals.
good,"I was awarded the Chairman's, Technology and Trailblazer awards. I had five promotions in 10 years, mostly due to the training and help from my colleagues.  Overall it was a great experiewnce"

My role at Allstate is QCAA, Quality Control Automation Analyst.  I am part of SOA team, in which we test functional aspect of services.  We work with many other teams from beginning to end to understand the deliverable/requirement and build test plans based on discussions.  Its very fun interacting with different team with new projects every release, the only hard part of job is communicating with offshore because of the time difference.  But we all work together and deliver our tasks before the deadlines in which we develop greater feel of achievement."

good,"Worked with numerous offices.  Very good, genuine owners at each location.  Found all to be very concerned with the best interest of the customer and directed them to protect themselves"
good,"A typical day a work involved gathering information about an insured person's lost or damaged property. It was my responsibility to find a suitable replacement item for the client so that they would be satisfied with it. This meant I would call and talk to them personally, especially if I needed more information about their claim."
good,Enjoyed working with Management and customers.  Allstate as a company is awful they do not practice what they preach but the independent office I worked at was rewarding and I loved it.
good,"It was a great experience working with Allstate, but after the hurricane Katrina so many things changed and I lost my Job, all the homeowner Insurance policies were transferred to the State of Florida (Citizens)"

good,"	Responsible for maintaining Receptionist desk."
good,Great company to work for! It is kind if tough to advance to other positions but overall great company and experience I'd recommend Allstate to anyone. Salary is average with other companies. Lots of freedom as long as you do your work no micro management 
good,"Working closely with the Underwriters. How to be a good listener with not only the Underwriters but with the field agents as well. Co-workers were good people. Making sure all policies were handled correctly and on time, especially when some items would be missing that determined a policy to be issued or held back. I enjoyed meeting new people."
good,Great place to work. Allstate has a lot to offer and is a great place to work. Its always a changing environment and you have to learn to adapt to new regulations on a regular basis.
good,"Working at Allstate as a Claims Specialist was a truly interesting job. You get to work and speak with people from all different walks of life and help them through a really rough point in their life. I learned very quickly how to gauge someones mood and how to adapt to it accordingly. It was always tough to deal with someone who was in a bad mood, but it was a great feeling to turn the yelling into laughing by the end of the call. Management was great - always very understanding and always had an open door."
good,I enjoyed working for Allstate for 24 years. It provided a good income along with challenging work. It was ideal place to work for a person with a family.
good,"I worked for a married couple with one other agent in the building. My day consisted of constant phone conversations with clients wanted to change policy coverages, add or delete vehicles, buying or selling a home. I learned every aspect of the insurance field. I was able to perform every duty involved with auto and homeowners insurance except to sign and bind a contract. I was not a certified sales agent. The hardest part of my job was to help clients understand the rules of vehicle insurance vs. teenage drivers. I loved every part of my job. I enjoyed going to work every day to learn something new."
good,I spent my days educating customers and maintaining office functionality.
good,"Worked at desk taking incoming calls from customers inquiring about insurance. Quoted and wrote policies for auto, Homeowners, Boat, Motorcycle, and Rental Insurance. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with great co-workers who encouraged and shared their knowledge of the insurance duties. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the high demand for sales performance during the recession that we are facing. Managers were always available to assist in any way."
good,"I was lucky to have a wonderful Manager who was strict and sweet at the same time. Fortunately for myself, I did not to see her strict side because I did my job and performed well."
good,The company was a high volume environment. I handled light office duties to simple coverage changes. I was provided all the necessary base trainning that was required (as I had no previous insurance knowledge). I was mentored by several managers who assissted in my growth.The managers that I dealt with had manerism and were very approachable.
good,"Allstate was a great workplace. My branch was really friendly, and they were more than happy to help me when I had questions, which was frequently. The training was extremely helpful, and they are always working to improve it. When my training class gave feedback on how they can improve training, we felt heard and we were told that some of our suggestions had been implemented for the following class."
good,I grew so much as a developer while working for Allstate Insurance. I was provided decent work benefits. The only downside was the 2 weeks of PTO I got. I would definitely recommend working there.
good,"Has it ups and downs like every job, but overall if you put the effort in you will make money. You will have to sacrifice some time at home, and be able to stand your team of co workers, which can be the hardest part of any office enviorment."
good,"I loved working for an exclusive Allstate Agent. He was superior in his field. I loved building a rapport with our clients! Yes, there was a sales quota, as with any sales career. I was paid hourly plus commissions and bonuses. I made excellent money. If you can find the right agent to work for, you’ll enjoy your career!"
good,Being a license insurance producer at Allstate is very enjoyable. I am able to work with my staff and utilize them to help grow the company. The environment is at its best when we all establish our goals and execute them. The culture we have created in our agency is very friendly and family-like. We understand each other on a personal level and I believe that is the reason we succeed in our agency. The most challenging part of the job is explaining concerns accordingly to our clients/customers. The most enjoyable portion is being able to compete and push each other forward when making sales.
good,"Allstate was a great place to work, from the time I started, until the time I had to leave due to health reasons. The agent I worked under was knowledgeable in all aspects of the career field, as well as a great leader. Allstate did not offer health insurance, but had similar options."
good,Johnathon Hutchins Allstate has the best employees in the business when it comes to insurance. Extremely knowledgeable and able to overcome any obstacle to make sure that you are properly insured.
good,Management is easy going and open mind. No micro management. Normally the managers and director are with business knowledge and technical background so there is no blocker to have a in-depth discussion on project details.
good,"This branch on Allstate will set you up for success in every way you need them to. Extremely supportive, encourage you to balance your work life and your home life. Some benefits are beyond what could be expected, some benefits are a little less than what you would expect from an insurance company. All in all, great company to work for."
good,Everyone in training class made sure you understood everything before going to the floor to take phone calls on claims.   We have daily goal meeting before we started on the phones and we also had goals to meet weekly with bonuses if we were the top 3 of our team. Very friendly environment and also was very enjoyable to come in to work and making a difference in someone life who had been in a accident or lose their home.
good,"Insurance is just one of the ways we serve our customers. Whether it's helping someone find their father's old Allstate ad or offering people on-demand roadside assistance, we believe in providing more than insurance."
good,"A difficult and demanding job, with many opportunities to learn. Fun environment, though very serious and focused. The office was dull, poorly lit, and filled with cubicles.  However, the staff was amazing to work with. They paid all interns."
good,Allstate does care about their people. They try to provide an good environment with competitive pay and benefits. The training is really good and there are opportunities for advancement. The management is amazing.
good,"I loved the investigative part of the job, working with people to help them in their time of need.  When it came to settling their claims, skilled negotiation was helpful."
good,"The company is a good company, but I wish the pay and benefits were better. You bring home more $$ because benefits are NOT offered (yet). If you have the funds to pay out of pocket healthcare expenses then I salute you. If you're going to work in insurance please do your research and make sure the timing is right. i hate to leave my agent because he really is an awesome guy. Like a brother I never had, but because I have a family and insurance is a requirement when you have a 1 month old baby I have to find an employer that offers benefits. If Allstate implements healthcare and some sort of retirement plan then I'm quite sure that their retention rates would sky rocket."
good,"The work environment is very good, and the employees are helpful when u have some troubles. I think that each work is challenging ."
good,"Positive coworkers and management willing to assist in employee development. Fluid training timed with course work in class room and on computer models. "
good,"Drive business through cold calls, referrals, and people in my inner circle. Help team improve on Producing new business. The team would seek new business opportunities within and outside business hours."
good,"The Corporate name recognition resulting from TV commercials made lead generation easy. The Company also provided great agent training and product knowledge."
good,"Allstate loves to make you feel wanted and constantly promote the laid back company culture."
good,"Great place to work. Unfortunately, I had to relocate and there were no positions available in the city that I was going to. There was great job advancement, benefits and leadership."
good,Working for Allstate at fast pace with positive morale. Easy to move up and promotions sporadically. Fair work life balance and they are very understanding.
good,"I worked in the Pocatello Idaho call center, it was my first call center job. I loved it. I quit because I moved to ohio or I would still be working for Allstate. The management is top quality and very helpful in everyday things but also great at getting you to whatever position or department you want to work in. The company as a whole believes in happy workers and gives you an hour each week to do nothing but discuss any issues you may be having...I have never in my 35 plus years working had a company do that. It really made me feel like the company really cared about its workers. Another thing I really liked was the way you could request days off. They have a calander on the computer where all the available time off is and you sign up for and take off what days you need and are available. No middle man...just me getting that done on my own. The only downfall to Allstate, ironically....the insurance benefits to its employees SUCKS!! Since they increased the deductibles to outrageous amounts and decreased the coverage's, it saves you money to get your health care with someone else..another company. Ironic huh?!"
good,allstate was an excellent place to work. I was able to make a high income in an agency by selling insurance policies. I enjoyed my time with the company.
good,"I work at a good office. My hours are flexible. I will say the pay is not  the best but I do have a great Boss. He is very fare,open minded and assist all his employees when needed."
good,"Allstate is a great place to be and is a company where people genuinely care about you. The work life balance is great, but comes at the price of growth/compensation"
good,The training and compensation with the agency is great. New agent to the agency taking over for a smaller book of business. The new agent sought me out based on my prior experience and high recommendation from existing clients and former employers.
good,Allstate is the best company I have ever worked for.  The management appreciate your work effort and provide necessary training and guideline to help me developing my role.  Flexible work from home policy and friendly environment.
good,"A typical day at work would start with me reviewing my metric from the previous day. Then clocking into the phone system to start taking both first notice of loss and inquiry calls. After I come back from lunch I would start working outbound task contacting customer about their claims process and contacting insurance companies to gather updates on subrogation. I have learned the complete claims process from beginning to end at Allstate. Along with gaining knowledge about different aspects of the claims process including subrogation, total loss, and determining liability. Management at my company have a good relationship with their employees and try to provide feedback of ways we can grow and develop. My coworkers enjoy their jobs and enjoy helping our customers. The hardest part of my job is having to explain to customers why their deductible is still owned even when they are not at fault for an accident. The most enjoyable part of my day is getting the customer feedback saying how easy I made this process for them."
good,"Insurance Claims are, in general, a very difficult position. It requires that you maintain a constant level of organization and prioritizing daily tasks. Allstate understands the demands of the job and responds well with realistic goals and expectations. Dealing with an ever changing demographic of customers requires that you wear several different hats that may need to shift at every phone call. If you desire to go the route of claims adjusting, I would recommend that you begin your career at Allstate. Superior training and understanding management."
good,"A typical day at Allstate includes providing 5-star customer service to each individual that reports an auto claim or have inquiries concerning their current claim. While working at Allstate, I have learned the value of team work, business productivity, and leadership principles.  The result of what I have learned is celebrated with the leadership of Allstate's management team. They ensure that employee's performances are excelling above average as well as developing employees to become career aspired. My co-workers are the best to work with because of their positive attitude and team work cohesion. However, the most hardest part of the job is maintaining consistent metrics required on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that I have aided in restoring the lives of individuals experiencing a difficult moment in their lives by showing care and concern."
good,"My typical day of work starts with a 15 minute briefing of the day before productivity. After the meeting I start to take inbound phone calls on customers who will like to file a new claim for their home/auto/boat/rv etc or reviewing claims and answering any questions on inquiry calls. The handling of a claim is different as there are never two claims that will be handled the same. I learn different things by taking claims from all regions that also helps me with my personal development. My leadership team is always there to assist if needed to myself and peers. The hardest part of my job is my schedule. The organization does a shift bid that changes not only work life but personal life as well. Sometimes this affects my family's schedule, my children sports etc. The most enjoyable part of  job is that I get to speak with people and help them restore their lives after experiencing a tragedy."
good,Great opportunity for development and advancement. Long hours can impact the work/life balance but all in all the management and overall culture of the company make it a great place to work.
good,"Always serve the customer, make them feel welcomed. I like the office setting and working closely with others.Not being micro managed was always a plus"
good,"Busy days with many things to do"

good,"A typical day in the office would be servicing customers, be it a quote, payment, insurance review or change or a claim."
good,"Handled all payments, translated, customer service, problem solved and kept everything organized"
good,"I worked evenings, and during the day when I didn't have classes. I was responsible for all the files and keeping the filing cabinets in order as folders were added and taken out. I was on the phone most of the time make out going calls to local residents to offer our insurance services. I also used their programming to create quotes and mail them out to those that requested. I had worked in a call center the previous year for the alumni foundation, and this secretary/telemarket position enhanced my phone skills."
good,"A typical work day consists of follow up tasks with our claimaints to see how they are recovering. We also answer incoming calls from providers and our insureds who are seeking medical treatment. The most enjoyable part of my job is watching people recover from their injuries each day. The hardest part of my job is dealing with death of our insured. My co-workers and management are very focused, fun and goal oriented. The most enjoyable part of the job is that time flies when you're busy!"
good,"verygood work place , "
good,I was a licensed sales producer.  It was a good job.  I enjoyed helping people save money.
good,A culture of hard work and team play.  I learned good work habits and standard claims handling practices.  Many opportunities for advancement and rewards for hard work.
good,"*	Extensively trained in Worker’s Compensation, HIPPA, ADA & medical terminology."
good,I would start by reviewing any questions that had not been answered from the day prior and returning any phone calls left on voice mail before I started taking more calls. Average call volume would be 40-60/daily. Answering complicated and sometimes lengthy questions was gratifying considering we had an abundance of information to go through.
good,"Agent is well informed and customer oriented, attentive to details"
good,"The pay could be better for the amount of work we have to do for the position I hold. Every manager I've had has been real cool and laid bck, no macro-managing. They work well with you in regards to your time."
good,"a typical day at work consist of a lot of calls and a lot of individual deadlines to meet. However, my coworkers are honestly the best in the planet. They always teach me new things, help me when im stuck on something (I'm still a little fresh), and overall they are very good at helping me go through the day. My boss is the greatest most understanding out there. When it comes to family and health problems there are absolutely no questions asked. I have never found myself holding off on going to the hospital because of fear of losing my job. They are very lenient and understanding here when it comes to those cases. They are also very fair about pay and will always make sure they recognize you for something good you did in the weekly review and encourage you to do better. I absolutely love it here."
good,When I was hired I had absolutely no experience the owner paid me as an assistant until I got licensed and he allowed me to study a few hours a day at work
good,"Allstate has a very demanding environment. However , the people are caring and willing to go the extra mile for the customer. Allstate pushes a very driving culture"
good,Allstate Agencies are a great place to work. You really learn the industry. The only downside is that you are not provided any options for any type of benefits as each agency is individually owned.
good,I really enjoyed working for the Allstate owner. He knew what he was doing and worked hard to make sure we gave our clients the best. There was also an initiative to support the local community.
good,"Very nice and good environment to work, all employees always willing to help and assist. Really enjoyed every bit of the period spent wit them. I recommended this company for anyone who wish to learn."
good,"this is the right place to work for here work culture is fun filled, management is very friendly and more cooperative, work culture here is flexible accordingly."

good,Work life balance is good and it is a great place for working.
good,Allstate is a great company however this was not a good fit for me.The lack of actual sales need and selling was frustrating.I prefer more relationship based account development.
good,The best part about Allstate is the culture and the people you work with. The people make the company great. The downfall is the speed of growth to move up.
good,"Despite the short time being there, I didn’t have a horrible experience. I would certainly consider working there again. However, I’m not sure if that position is in the cards for me personally."
good,My day at Allstate Insurance would include filling people's policies and greeting people when they walk through the door. I learned to organize and be precise with my work. Mangement was good and friendly. The hardest part would have to be how organized I had to be with people's policies.
good,"This place is amazing, you can have alot of advancement if you really try, even if it is something small they will make it seem like you are the best at everything!"
good,Marketing for Allstate is an upbeat and a self starting position. Your basically responsible to cold call leads and creating a positive culture so the agent can close a sale a quickly. Allstate is fine place to work until they get into excess payouts then the premiums rise and they become non-competive.
good,"We handled the entire State.  It was very fast paced and busy.  The management, in Albuquerque, NM was amazing.  The working conditions were wonderful.  They are my lifelong friends.  It was an atmosphere to grow and become the best you could be."
good,"Excellent business to work for advancement to management.  Great job security for leadership skills and training. In addition, will pay for school if you want to became an adjustor or sell agent."
good,Agency Owner is an awesome person and the staff us very friendly and they are very helpful. A lot of room for growth and a lot of potential to make a lot of money. Definitely a company worth working at.
good,"gathering the information  needed to check on that day, listen to the phone massages , get my coffee, check on the other co workers and problems, try to help to solve and keep on with my work"
good,"I wear lots of hats here, as you can see from my resume! They are a company that stands behind giving their employees a work/life balance and for that I am grateful!"
good,A quiet office with heavy client visit and constant phone calls . Phone calls had to be administered promptly to have retention of policies . I had assistant to help in clerical duties . The hardest part was to satisfy people who were from low income families and still give them insurance for good.
good,"Though I only worked at Allstate as an intern for only three and a half weeks, I gained a lot of experience by observing the employees as well as the office manager himself. The employees were pretty nice to me and I got along with them very well. The hardest part of the job was Alphabetizing all of the insurance files in the back room. But the most enjoyable part of the job was to learn about the different types of insurance and the coverages that are offered."
good,Our department partners with Lender Relations. Lender Relations receives mass mailings of endorsements which come in the form of lists. These lists consist of all the Allstate policies we have with various banks. My job is extremely important because we verify all the information scanned to match with information in the system. The process is imperative to the electronic jobs ran by Lenders and for their offshore vendors to receive their work. If information Imaging verifies is incomplete or in error: when Lenders prepares to run the job to update the policies on the list the job will fail and the endorsements are delayed in being processed. If the policy is not endorsed properly their premium will not be paid. My co-workers are great at communicating with me and the entire group. I would say the hardest part of the job would be if you cant read the document scanned in. I really enjoy being at work and being able to meet  new people  and visit other departments and learn something new.
good,"Engaged with customers in a sincere and friendly manner. Contacted other store locations to determine merchandise availability."
good,Compensation was minimal without access to the benefits of becoming a licensed insurance agent. Efficient work environment. Very organized company with much advancement in technology.
good,There are a great group of people that work there.  Some of the best technical people out there.
good,Company car with great benefits and great benefits. Great job with great management.
good,Horrible owner runs company under intimidation. Not a pleasant work environment. No room for advancement. Fires people for no reason. Run run run run run
good,"I learned a lot about insurance including cars, homes, and life insurance. The office/agent that i worked for had very poor management. The pay was very low with no any benefits and discount"
good,"Products are great, but management depends on the agency you work in.  All benefits depend on the benefits that your agent wants to provide.  Allstate computer system and quoting system is fantastic."
good,"The owner was not always there, but for the most part I enjoyed talking to the customers and the job was pretty easy. I loved being able to work by myself and it was only two of us there on some days."
good,Worked for an independent agency that did not offer any benefits and no room for advancement. The compensation for new policies kept changing and was unreliable.
good,"I would say that the flexible schedule is the best part of the job.  The salary and commissions aren't always what they seem to be, and are disappointing at times.  Overall, I would recommend this job for someone who needs that work/family life balance, but also who works hard and efficiently at the same time, and needs a job."
good,"Co workers are wonderful as is the employer, setting is relaxed and customer are great to deal with. Several incentive plans in place for increased sales goals and retention goals. The most difficult part of my job is when I have exhausted all my resources and am still unable to please a client."
good,"•	Secures business relationships with mortgage lenders, and realtors, to maintain and establish referral programs"
good,The office is very busy but everyone works well together and is supportive of each other.  I have learned to work with many different types of customers and learned from every interaction.
good,Its a great job to have would suggest job to anyone looking for work
good,I felt like the management i was directly under wasnt prepared to run his own agency or had the professionalism  to deal with the stress that may come with the position. So this is just based off that one agency not allstate in a whole
good,"Allstate is a great company to work for I learned a lot working there, however the agent I worked for was a nightmare, he was sexist he yelled and cursed constantly he allowed unethical practices to be done just to secure policies several people left while was there I only stayed for the pay."
good,"This was an interesting experience, the company is good but the management is lazy and horrible at people management. If you need a job to pay bills go, but don't stay long because the pay is not GREAT. They underpay ALL of their staff."
good,I actually worked for an agent. The office manager is insane. She kept harping on me for work that I was not even doing wrong. I would love to still work there if it weren't for this lady. Everyone else was awesome.
good,"Worked in a small agency with not much chance for advancement. Mainly customer service work, as there were no programs set up for growth and increased sales opportunities. Because of the above, I elected to give my 2 weeks notice to find a job more rewarding with a better chance for growth and advancement."
good,I really loved the company but training was bad and my boss was very discriminated towards me and had no respect to his employees. I wished I would of lasted there longer
good,"clocking in , you have a morning huddle, where you learn of the days struggle area, and where out outbound work will be for the day.you will then answer calls you will be filing claims, answering questions about the claim and setting liability as well make payments when necessary."
good,"Allstate was a very good place to work the only thing that bothered me was my co-workers they were not very nice, they were making me do their jobs for them they always make me take their calls stuff that I didn't have to do my co workers made me do them"
good,I loved doing my job and working with my unit. A great place to start off with.
good,Great company excellent benefits. Management is great. THEY take their time. Several training class when New tools is introduced to the company. I enjoy how they kept employee knowledgeable of software updates and thorough training class.
good,"The job it self wasn't hard, if you work in sales it can be competitive but fun if you can make it that way. If you are a team worker and your staff works as a team, work day will be easy. Agents, the owner, is a different story, poor management can hurt any place. i would recommend to look at reviews of how customers feel about their agent before working at a certain office."
good,"I enjoyed working for Allstate contracted at Usxpress enrolling 10,000 employees into their benefits. I worked mostly with the truckers on a daily basis."
good,"Job was too far commuting and not enough structure. Although I did really enjoy working there, hours were changed after hiring to hours that were unacceptable to using public transportation."
good,"There was no room to move up, the pay was very low, as sales people we just made money for the owner of the agency. I loved the people that I worked with but felt like the leads they were buying were weak and the owner I was working for had very little experience."
good,This was an okay starter position. A great place to learn the skills. Billing system is not the best. Compensation isn't the greatest I have learned after 4 years. Working for another company now I realize how my services were underpaid. Allstate is a great stepping stone to learn the skills but I wouldn't promote a long staying position. Customers are really displeased with billing and it consumed a lot of my working hours. This takes away from sales but the managers and bosses do not want to deal with service so they put it on your plate.
good,"All aspects of claims handling autobody estimation. Total loss processing. CCC software, and all aspects of auto field estimating"
good,Enjoyed my time there and was mentored very well on how to help customers and offering the beat options for the clients.

good,"While with Allstate I have learned several different programs.  I manage TAG, Blitz, Magic CPR, Robo Agent,and B.O.B. Audits. I am fully licensed for personal and commercial property and casualty. I average 1-2 policy sales per a day, and strive to move up and eventually own my own agency."
good,"I love the company , the pay is great!!!!!! It's not a easy job , but the company take care of you."
good,"I love selling insurance and have been a sales person for 17 years, Allstate has the least amount of job security for any company I have ever worked for. They need more training programs and much more patience when it comes to performance. A sales person should come in with work to do, not hope and pray that customers come out of the sky to sell to. There are many things wrong with there business model."
good,"Good Company, nothing bad to say. If you have the required down "
good,"Office workplace is a different culture from a retail job. Office is all about organization, keeping up with people's insurances, commitment, and ensuring all of the paperworks are completed or keeping them up to the date."
good,"The agency I work in is great , and very flexible with the staff members.The most enjoyable part is helping our customers and helping them understand the importance of being well protected."
good,Great Place to work but I was a contractor during Hurricane Harvey. This time i=of the year s not ideal for field adjuster as we have to deal will a extremely large amounts of claims on a hourly basis
good,When I started with Allstate in the 90's we were a busy office with friendly clients so it was easy to work with them and build their profile to protect there family.
good,"The people I worked with as a Financial Specialist at Allstate were great. Unfortunately, it was difficult to earn enough to justify the time, effort, energy, and gas required to be a Financial Specialist."
good,Fun work environment. poor management. Pto offered. Stressful work environment due to high call volume and irate customers calling regarding their accidents.
good,"A typical day at Allstate was checking on clients and taking calls, payments and starting claims.  The hardest part of the job was explaining rate increases.  The best part of the job was relating to the customers and getting them the information they needed to make an informed decision."

good,Excellent quality products and insurance policies. Very enjoyable environment to work for. But no place for advancement. I learned a lot their products. But management is not very friendly.
good,"Maybe because I was before mu time, but the work I did, I did not get paid very well and that is why I left after 6 months! I really don't have anuthing to say except at least u get to dress nice everyday and people are very nice while on the job."
good,"I loved the atmosphere, ie: people I worked with. Sitting behind a desk all day was the drawback. The travel was great as I was only 10 minutes from the office."
good,Allstate is a good place to work for unfortunately I did not get to experience that like some because of customer focus involved with working in the call-center.
good,"Good place to work and good work and life balance but difficult sustain your job,salary is less compared to other companies but its a good company if you are working on .NET or Java ,Tibco."

good,"My job at Allstate is highly stressed position due to everything that goes through me before everyone else in the office. A typical at the office is busy , alot of paper work, follow-ups and customers to deal with. Co-workers always on your case because of the stress they go through as well. The hardest part of the job is getting the blame and just taking it. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the customer comply to everything that needs to be done and the days goes smooth."
good,"I open the office at 9:00am "

good,"Overall great place to work. Facility is very clean, also has its on gym on site. The work life balance is great, not adding any stress or crazy long shifts"

good,"This was my first job out of college.  I learned a great deal, and the office environment was very professional."
good,"With the ability to prove management skills in a productive agency utilizing training and program capacity it is easy to succeed with Allstate.  While having remote management, the ability to master the role of agency manager was a great opportunity!"

The enjoyable part of the job was dealing with our customers , co-workers and making a difference in the community."
good,Good place to work. Cares about there employees. Sometimes can be stressful as it can get very busy. Hardest part of the job was not always being able to fix the problems.

good,"incoming/outgoing Sales calls"
good,All state was a bit confusing for me as i never was in the insurance business before.  but i gained a great amount of knowledge from there i am happy i worked there.
good,Allstate culture was to keep changing goals and bonus structure ..Making goals sometimes unattainable - not being realistic in the specific market area
good,I would get to work and clock in and start my computer. Also if a customer comes in we need to assist right away and if they ask for a quote for auto or home we would provide them the information needed. Also if the customer needed to make changes on the current policy then we would assist them with it.

The co-workers that i have are always willing to help out if i have a question,or vise-versa. The hardest part of the job sometimes is all the hard work you put into a quote and you can't beat the price or you cant help them get covered due to an issue they have to fix but i dont let that hold me back, as i just move on to the next customer to help. I really like closing the deal cause that means more money on my paycheck!"

good,A typical day at work would consist of a lot face to face customer service interaction.
good,Every month you start with a $0 pay check and it is up to you to make your money. While that gives you unlimited income potential it still leaves openings for bad months. The team is great and my agent owner is very respectful to family.
good,It is a very busy job that rarley gets slow. I have learned a lot about insurance how it works what is covered and how claims are handled. My co-workers are out of this world amazing i almost think of them as family. There isnt anything bad to say about them. The only thing that is hard about my job is how busy it gets sometimes.

good,Great training. Training was very effective. Great pay. The managers were not on the same page which made it a bit stressful. Over time was great and the hours provided were great.

good,"Really enjoyed working there overall. The management was not as effective as they could or should have been. They would only promote the people they liked. Not the people who actually deserved the promotion through excellent work habits, dedication, etc. Lots of politics being played while I was there."
good,Extremely busy. The agency owner was great. Management was always looking over your shoulder. Everything was recorded. Supervisor was ok. The hours and paid time off is good once you have been there one year.
good,"First job out of college, great company that offers a strong culture and benefits.  Main counter is that their compensation was below the market at the time."
good,"Blue print operator, small office, training while I learned, company vehicle and card to run errands to city and county building, fire depts. for permits and building inspection approval for construction, learned a completely different field of knowledge, worked with a engineer and learned to read blue prints for installation of fire protection sprinkler systems."
good,"Allstate is a good company to work for, they help you balance your  work and home life.  Allstate has good benefits for all.  They also train on the job for better opening within the company."
good,"Great place to work, needs room for advancement. Commute needs work, management were willing to assist. More work from home options needed. Room for improvement on employee morale."
good,"Independent Sales Agent – In home visits, help train new hires, top 2 in sales consistently, familiar with perils and losses, begin claims process...."
good,I worked for Allstate in two different regions and it was a great company. I outgrew the company as I was unable to relocate to grow within my role. I learned a lot and a lot was invested in me as well. Would recommend this company to anyone who wants a career in insurance.
good,Great atmosphere. Managers appreciate the employers. Enjoyed working here. The only cons I have is the pay is not that great and it's a production oriented environment.
good,Competitive. Goals must be met in order to succeed.depending on how big your office is their may or may not be room for advancement. Typical sales job
good,Great company and great training... unless you want to buy the agency there is a lack of advancement. All agencies are different so if one does not fit others might.
good,"The management was very knowledgable, experienced, and very welcoming of new ideas. The office is a very nice established agency that I learned a lot of product knowledge from. Very by the book! =)"
good,Grateful for my time at Allstate - worked with some really great people and enjoyed all that I learned there.  Great company who will be there for it's insured members.
good,"Allstate is a fast paced environment "
good,"Claims adjuster through an independent Catastrophe Adjusting Firm being deployed to storm ravaged area. "
good,"Very busy and active small office.  Alot of one on one customer contact and most times you are alone in the office.  The phones are constantly ringing and customers walk in at any time.  Most have a lot of organizational skills to keep all these people, phone calls and interruptions in some type of order. The hardest part of the job is trying to juggle sales, claims, changes and payments while working alone."
good,"Allstate Insurance in my opinion is a great insurance company both to work for and to be insured by.  I have been able to help so many people by giving them the insurance they needed as opposed to what the competition felt they should have as well as save them money.  Insurance to me wasn't about saving money, it was about being there for my clients when they needed me the most."
good,"Great people to work for. The manager at ALL State was very helpful, always ready to give input when needed. The hours were assigned to me to be scheduled around my convenience. I didn't find any part of this job hard."
good,small office environment has a lot of benefits.  The agents I worked for always understood that small chance that my kids would be sick and juggling work and home life.  Perhaps they gave me the extra mile as I would do the same while working for them.
good,"Open and close the office daily.   Greet customers, weekly payroll using, answer the telephone, filing, taking payments, doing the daily deposits and providing good customer service.  I also assisted customers with their P&C insurance needs to ensure their needs and the needs of their families was covered."
good,Love being able to help with people with their insurance needs.  It means a great deal to that we are able to provide a solution when someone will need it most.
good,I learned about the insurance world here.  I did receive my license to perform all jobs as agent.  I loved to work with my customers
good,"Typical work day is easy going most days, a lot of data entry, filing scanning etc. "
good,"Enjoyed being able to work with public, help them meet their insurance needs. Agency owner is excellent, however, supervisor is not professional. Most enjoyable part of this job was being able to help customers insure their most important assets."
good,"I loved the experience I received working for this company, they strive to put customers first and provide excellent customer service."
good,"Allstate is a good place to work. As long as you are with the right agent! Room to move up, just get used to being on the phones all day and trying to sell things to people that sometimes might not want to hear from you!"
good,"I got to coach youth basketball to underprivileged kids. A typical day at practice was opened with prayer and followed by ball handling drills, lay-up lines, shooting practice, and the ended with conditioning. The point of this was so the kids would be able to focus their brain power on learning basketball and then display tenacity after a hard practice by continuing to push throw after the physical exertions of the skill-honing portion of the practice."
good,"C & C Financial Services operating as Allstate Insurance is independently owned and operated.  Small office staff of three.  Light work load, and relatively stress free environment.  The hours and location are great.  The light flow of new customers makes it very difficult to earn a high commission."
good,You get to meet some very awesome customers.I learned time management and patience are a must in this field. The most enjoyable part is talking to clients who have been with the same company for 20 + years.
good,Looking to work in busy office with friendly staff in Southside to beaches areas of Jacksonville. Would prefer to stay with Allstate as I know the computer system and product lines to sell and service.
good,I worked at Allstate at the beginning of my career as an employee and am now back as a contractor.  This is a solid company that knows what it needs.
good,Awesome culture - demanding yet balanced.  Company is quite profitable as the strategies are working and there hasn't been too many weather related events recently.
good,"Being in claims world, you never know what can fall on your lap. You may have a simple rear-end collision case, to 11-car pile up, and same with injury situations. "
good,"Allstate is overall a great company, however working for them now is especially challenging with all the relocations and job changes.  Overall, I loved my job and my position as Agency Manager and working with commercial insurance.  The most enjoyable part of the job with speaking with clients and helping resolve any issues they had."
good,"Team,company,and corporate policy,procedures,goals,incentives updates daily,weekly,monthly,customer satisfaction,process auto,mortgage claims,assign an adjuster to a home,body shop,location to inspect a auto or home damages,file repossession notices,send out pass due notices,file bankruptcy,post payments,negotiate pays or arrangements to bring account current"
good,"My typical day at work consisted of processing commercial insurance endorsements and problem solving customer service calls as they came in.  Before the changes at allstate a typical day could result in at least 60 phone calls from agents, insured's or underwriting department.  I am a self starter and had minimum supervision in the 29 1/2 years I worked there.  My coworkers were my second family and I will miss them.  We all worked well together as a team to get the job done. Our goal was 100% customer satisfaction.  Everyday was a learning experience at Allstate, with 29 years of working commercial insurance you found out that there is always room to learn more. No file is the same and everyday something new would come across my desk.  My biggest accomplishment was when my agents would tell me that Allstate needed more Karen's to get the job done."
good,i loved this job but the office i worked at closed down when i went off to college.
good,"A typical day at work for me is to scan and code insurance documents into computer, greet customers who come in to make a payment or meet with a licensed sales associate. I have learned about insurance - what type you need for different scenarios and what they cover. My co-workers are wonderful women and I have learned greatly from their experience. The hardest part of the job is when the scanner breaks or does not want to feed the documents which makes it difficult."
good,Handling incoming calls and inquiries. Investigating auto accident claims for liability and injury. Settling and evaluating medical claims.
good,"I enjoy working at the office, one due to the other insurance agent, the enviroment. Its a quiet, clean office. My supervisor is helpful, friendly."
good,Great place to begain a career i would love to be apart of the team long term.
good,very organized business.
good,I worked there for a short period of time prior to becoming a police officer. All of the training I completed was organized and precise and the management staff I dealt with were knowledgable.
good,I would have enjoyed working here fully if the Agents has direction
good,Allstate is a great company to work for I just wish that my time there would have been longer.
good,"Creating quotes on a daily basis, as well as post accounts and take payments."
good,"A typical workday included ordering materials, filing,receiving payments, explaining different insurances to customers, answering the phones, calling customers when their insurance lasped, receiving and sending faxes, and adding up all forms of revenue for the day. I learned alot about different types of insurance, how to deal with customers, and how to carry out administative duties. Management was very helpful and hands on. Management was always helpful whenever I didn't understand or needed help with a customer. My co- workers were older peolpe that always had something new to tell me about the insurance field along with other aspects of life, which i enjoyed on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers that didn't want to listen to what I was trying to explain to them. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things."
good,"once you learn the product easy to do great business to work independently and make a good salary"
good,The business was family owned. They were great to work for and they were willing to work with me and my children if I had to stay home. Would work there again
good,"Pay is lower than averages for my role. And the raises are less than than 3% each year."
good,"I really love me job, and love what I do. Allstate allowed me the felxability to think outside the box, and put the customer first. As with any job there are some managers that may have a different way of leadership then i would like but this doesnt refelct the company as a whole. "
good,Allstate is a great place to learn the ropes of what you are trying to do. It promotes a sort of family environment within the smaller team. The problem is that there is a massive shift to other locations and they are hyper sensitive about costs. It feels that there is going to be no advancement in the future if you work in the field or live in North brook.
good,Awesome to work with Subject matter experts who are with the same company for all their life. They are full of knowledge and open to new changes and technology coming to their way.
good,"I will give a 5 to the company I been working for 15 years and i been learning a lot all this years "
good,"I come in and I review my tasks, I make my phone calls to my customers, I have meetings about my performance and what I can improve on. I have set goals and areas of focus."
good,"Loved my customers, provided 100% customer service and anything I can exceed to help, also developed relationships with them in a positive way. The agent was positive, friendly, helpful, promoted the business, took good care of me, understood family issues and personal, bought lunches and offered bonuses."
good,"The day started with client file reviews and making contact with clients.,  Office meeting and setting goals for the day. Customer Service , Phones, payments and underwriting review. And Sales."
good,Worked in the local office of an Allstate Agent. The agent was very helpful and helped us learn the ins and outs of the insurance world. The agent provided a friendly working environment.
good,"On a typical day, I would greet new and returning customers as they arrive, determine what their needs are and direct them to the appropriate Insurance agent."
good,"Following up with clients that are late on their payments, Cross selling to offer more coverage. Giving customer service to customers that call in or walk in. Help co works in areas they need help with.  "
good,"If you like helping customers that's a perk, but the Job security is not what it should be with outsourcing and this company's very good for doing that"
good,"Let me preface this review, by stating I worked at an Allstate EA agency for an agent. I did not work for the corporate Allstate Company. "
good,"I mainly applied to this job so I could get my foot in the door, to be completely honest I would tell any one that is they needed a good stepping stone into the professional world then Allstate is the place to go. They really should pay more though, it was the only downside"
good,"good management team for the most part.  great staff to work with.  sub par tech systems, little to no opportunity for advancement, very good benefits."
good,its a ok job to work ..it can be stressful when your just getting in field but all ways something new to learn every day .. hard work pays off so if you work hard you will get paid
good,The job itself can be very stressful however the people that I worked with and for where very great. I had a great manager who would go above and beyond for his team
good,"I enjoy my time with Allstate.  However, there is no place for me to grow in the tech department unless I move to Chicago.  They have good retirement and benefits."
good,Typical day was answering phones and assisting any walk-ins. I learned a lot about the insurance field. Especially all the discounts we could receive that no one know about. The management was all right. Could of done a better job instead of throwing you out on front street with no training. If you want to work for an Insurance company make sure your bi-lingual.
good,It was fun to start career with Allstate Insurance as it gives a very friendly and supportive environment. mentors provide a great helping hand and makes job easy.
good,Allstate company doesn't provide much time for us as individuals to enjoy our free time. We are given very minimal breaks and forced to work late hours. It's frustrating when you have to rush a 15 minute break with barely enough time to relax during an 8 hour shift.
good,Laid back atmosphere. Fun loving staff. Easygoing office. You have to work hard for your sales. Customer service is top priority. You have to learn to sell your product well.
good,"It is very busy, which I like. Customers call in to receive assistance with billing, paying bills, adding cars, removing cars from their policies. Customers need situations explained to them regarding their policies, retrieve information from potential customers who need insurance quotes."
good,"A typical day consisted of incoming and outgoing phone calls.  Processing endorsements, face to face appointments, quoting, policy reviews, billing and payment handling.  The office was a three person office which therefore made us very close.  The hardest part of the job was the travel to and from.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping clients."
good,"Great job, great vacation time, great people, however no job security what so ever, the company's upper management is disconnected form the lower management. You are micro-reviewed each day."
good,Allstate Insurance is a good company to work for.  The agents that I worked with were very knowledgeable and willing to help their staff advance.  There is room for growth as in obtaining your licenses and becoming an agent yourself.  They have good training and all in all are a good company to work for.  Their customer service department is top notch for both their agents and their employees and their customers.  They sell good products and are a very reliable and trusted insurance company.
good,I love building business and new relationships.  Fast paced position that is rewarding in recognition and compensation.  I have learned that to manage a team effectively you have to be able to lead from the front.  Time manage is critical for success.  The toughest part of my job is work life balance.  I enjoy helping people.
good,"Could definitely have benefited by the agency owner having been more attentive and caring of clients and employees, noting accounts better and providing followthrough."
good,Allstate is a good client to work with. Gained a lot of exposure to technologies and got to learn at each step. Colleagues were very supportive and working in the team was fun.
good,"We wrote mostly auto and home insurance policies for people. The company sent me to school so I could get my insurance license.  We had a lot of people that still came into the office every month to pay their insurance bill, this office had the most customers that came into the office to pay their bills or make changes to their policies. I really enjoyed seeing and talking to the customers. We were very busy and we wrote a large volume of policies. I really loved giving people a quote that would save them money."
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,"Doing this job I worked w/ some very knowledgeable people. We argued, then laugh. We hung out after work and never took anything personal. It is part of the job. Awesome group to e around."
good,"Its a good place to work with excellent support for education and the company is growing fast."
good,"A typical day at work would be interacting with the Automotive Sales Consultants to quote their customers after they deliver the vehicle. I learned a lot about property and casualty insurance and the importance of maintaining positive rapport with the Sales team for leads. All of the co-workers were helpful, outgoing and pleasant. The hardest part of the job was to actually have the sales consultants send you their customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the compensation and being a part of the team."
good,A great place to work with all the overall a rating including: Work/Life Balance with fabulous management and staff. Learning and using what I had learned from both training and hands on.
good,"decent place to work , they treat employees really nice and you are going to get your scheduled hours weekly . hgardest part of the job is honestly the irate customers which rarely happens ."
good,"A typical day at work was very busy trying to process transactions in the time allowed by upper management. I learned how to read legal documents and became more familiar with computer programs. I enjoyed my co-workers immensely, we are still friends today. The hardest part of the job having to send back submitted requests repeatedly to our clients because they were either incomplete or had errors. The most enjoyable part of my job was being recognized by our clients for a job well done."
good,I learned to communicate well with customers. Assessed clients needs and learned to gather information quickly and efficiently in order to process claims. I enjoyed talking with people from the around the nation and offered a listening ear for concerns during what could be some emotional times when filing an insurance claim.I enjoyed the training and worked well with team members everyone hired seemed to have a positive outlook and personality.
good,"I would start my day at 8:30am.  Plan my day and by 9am start making phone calls for business.  Minimum of 100 per day.  I learned many different computer systems.  Great management.  Being able to help my customers and coworkers with product or people knowledge.  Hardest part was, sometimes having customer leave and purchase with  competitor."
good,Top performer in Sales and Customer Service and consulting to customer needs to benefit the customer. Loved interaction with all types of people and learning about some of their personal info to build great rapport.
good,"A typical day is making outbound sales calls, quoting customers and helping them with their insurance needs.  Allstate provides excellent training for their agents, making it easy to be successful."
good,"Work week was organized with the following process."
good,A great environment to teach myself.  Lacking in technology and management.  A very weak customer service quality.  A lack of focus for running an insurance office.  Lack of training and other important focuses being a successful producer.
good,"Arrive in the office early, read emails and prepare for production meetings on a daily/weekly basis. maintain sales records and manage individual goals for sales personnel. Manage daily production and service for existing customers. The most difficult area of concern, is the completion of services between competing insurance companies. the are most enjoyed, is the knowledge that you are helping people and you can provide protection and help manage their risk in life."
good,Loved working for the owner but unfortunately the financial backing wasn't there and the company ended.
good,"On a typical day I would respond to email requests from national life insurance policy activity problems and make the needed changes.  I would then research a database to locate any similar mis-coded transactions and re-book them. I would instruct individual email recipients on details regarding migrations of certain data."
good,"Good entry job, good people, enjoyed helping the customers, worked during Katrina Hurricane - rewarding"
good,"My daily routine included answering email, phone call, fielding question from 4 processors that I managed as well and questions from upper management and the client."
good,"I was very happily employed with great results from Allstate, but once catastrophes stopped regularly happening, they laid off 20% of the department, namely the people that were making the better salaries.  My scores were very good at the time of the layoff, and I felt betrayed."
good,"Typical day, answer phone calls, solve customer's issues. Take payments. Call existing clients about cross-sale opportunities. "
good,I scheduled all Officers to meet all requirements of Allstate. I loved everyone who worked there
good,"Working as an agent for Allstate consisted of daily policy reviews, payments, and setting up new policies for home, boat, and auto. I worked in a small office setting and learned a lot regarding more than just the average insurance policy."
good,I was a Customer Service Representative involved in policy sales and modifications. I learned a lot about different types of insurances and different coverages. I had wonderful coworkers.  The hardest part of my job was having to be after clients with regards to binding a policy.  The most enjoyable part of my job was making my clients happy and meeting their expectations.
good,Training is provied and paid for but you must pass the insurance exam in order to write policies.
good,"Great years working with Allstate.  Level of excellence and systems where at an all time high.  Great training, and benefit.  Great tools to be able to do work correct and accurate and great benefits on time off."
good,"Typical day consist of inputting customer's information into system to calculate their home insurance."
good,Allstate has been a great place to start a career and I have been fortunate to have great managers.
good,"I worked here as a Licensed Staff Producer,  Seemed like there wasn't enough work for 2 agents in this office.  I did some leads and cross selling but the agent different ideas,  This was a good office and nice working conditions,  just was bored because no walk ins or activity in the office."
good,"Great place to work, learn, grow professionally. Friendly environment"
good,I love working at Allstate. I do not like that you cannot take unpaid paid time off or personal days ever though
good,Willing to grow and develop individuals
good,"I was the HR Consultant for Allstate Protection Finance, the state regions and Procurement Governance directly involved in client consultation regarding full cycle recruitment planning, salary analysis, negotiation, career fairs, on-campus recruitment and direct candidate contact. I had a team of great co-workers, and enjoyed campus recruitment. The hardest part of the job was being laid off."
good,"Small group, but very good vibe! Close to home and great location. Great earning potencial."
good,"Enjoyed my time there, however the rate increases and stipulations for insuring people hurt the incoming business in my opinion."
good,"Strong team structure and stability of new ventures -- fast to change as a fast follower toward new ventures. Agents tend to rest on new sales and have little interest in retention, very weak cross-sellers. Value of the front-lines (customer services/claims) is the foundation of their business."
good,"Good company to work for. Great benefits and compensatioon, great work eviroment"
good,Working at Allstate was awesome. I had so many wonderful opportunities to become a better me in the most professional way. It's really a pleasure to be apart of the company.

good,"I had a great experience working for Allstate and I enjoyed what I did immensely. The management, customers, and my co-workers were all fantastic people."
good,"Allstate is a good company that takes care of its employees. Monthly and weekly incentives and medical, dental, vision and life insurance all come with employment. It is a stressful job, that requires a thick skin and on-site training. I would recommend this job for its benefits and really good paycheck. However, this job does deal with people on a daily basis. You will be yelled at, called names and cursed at by customers."
good,Worked thru a temp agency as a CSR for Roadside Assistance; the job was great.  People I worked with as a team were really good people.  Enjoyed the job; pay was good.  Did not get a permanent job as I relocated.
good,"I ran the office(s). I trained the agents, planned and implemented different marketing techniques, met an exceeded all goals, team player an leader for sales & training etc"
good,"If you are a good seller, then you will have lots of fun here, and be happy on payday. Hours are very normal, you learn to deal with a lot of upset customers, but also get to meet some amazing people!"
good,Relatively relaxed management. Great benefits especially PTO and retirement. They still have a pension plus the standard 401K. Actually pay is low for the position.
good,"I learned how to manage accounts of current customers and my position allowed me the opportunity to show empathy to customers who had experienced loss, whether it be a loss of property (car or home claims) or a loss life (life insurance claims). I looked forward to going to work to help our customers and drive the book of business of our agency."
good,"I loved working at Allstate I got a chance to help customers to setup and submit claims reports, the work was very competitive but rewarding I felt like I was helping customers to understand their policies."
good,"My experience working with Allstate was very rewarding.  Allstate has strict guidelines to follow which is appreciated when reviewing documents for information.  All the employees and the management team were fair, reasonable and informative.  I had confidence in Allstate and what it offered their insureds."

good,"Overall company is great. Management needs improvement. Great customers. Great coworkers. Workload could be overwhelming sometimes, but that comes with any adjuster position."

good,"Great management"
good,Upward movement from sales/customer service to management. Great way to learn about the insurance industry and to gain knowledge in sales and management.
good,"I enjoy working at Allstate, I know the products & I am successful at my sale's ability. I have good people skills & maintain retention with my customer service."
good,"I became a much better listener to each of the customers who were seeking an insurance quote on auto, renter's, or life insurances. Once they advised I moved forward to assure they were pleased."
good,Interning here was fun! You must undergo a background check and agree to keep customer information confidential. Working for Allstate allows you to earn commission.
good,"I haven't worked here long, but the atmosphere seems good so far, I am excited to see how quickly you can move around in the company.  The company offers an employee funded pension as well as a 401K."
good,"For the most part my experience was positive.  I hated having to tell the agency.  I would recommend the opportunity."
good,"Enjoyed working with insureds to help them solve their claim quickly.  Met different people on a daily basis.  Some of the people were very upset at time of meeting due to having a variety of claim issues (i.e.  Fire, Flood, Vandalism, Burgulary) so I would calm them down and assure them I would help them."
good,"As a office manager, my responsibilities was creating graphic designs, promoting our office to a new community, cold call sales, customer service, quoting insurance rates, bookkeeping, inventory, and assisting my bosses coordinating events for our weekly network meetings between Allstate professionals and the professionals in our real estate and business industry.  My biggest complication for this position was I was overwhelmed with work, not given a opportunity to provide customer service and hospitality in a timely matter to our clients, and not perfecting the many minor duties that were extremely important  to be processed before the deadline.  My bosses were 2  intelligent, independant, successful young ladies that mentored me into achieving all goals and dreams through hard work and motivation."
good,"I just want to start by saying my boss here was the best. I came in with the company having not that much work experience, but my supervisor really wanted to help me to succeed in the company and gave me a chance to take my insurance exams by offering to pay for it. A day-to-day would be taking incoming calls as completing request as asked, faxing/scanning/filing of documents, typing out letters/insurance cards as requested, and other office duties. My work environment was ideal, with an understanding boss and one great awesome co-worker. This is the best job I ever had due to the people that I worked with."
good,I enjoyed working at Allstate. The people were very good. There were a few that were cut throat. I would go back if the opportunity presented itself but not working for the same manager.
good,"Excellent company to work for fast pace very busy company,  A typical day would include answering customers call internal and external customer.  Maintaining field adjusters schedules handling problems that the adjuster/customer may encounter during the inspection."
good,"I worked for the manager to mow the yard of the Oswego office. He was pretty lenient about when I could come in to cut the grass. He pays me occasionally to rake leaves for him or perform other, similar work."
good,Days started based on appointment settings. I learned how to scope houses after storm related damages. Management was critical to my success. Hardest part of the job was travel in the city of Houston. I really enjoyed helping people get their homes back in order.
good,Everyone is well treated and fairly compensated. Lacks structure and is often times like the wild west. Tech updates come fast and furious sometimes creating problems but the company does things right in terms of security.
good,"Managing a steady volume of inbound calls to assist Allstate customers, third party carriers, claimants and vendors in our claim process. Leveraging resources and computer applications to file new claims and complete outbound customer contacts and follow-ups to bring existing claims to resolution or towards closure. Utilize critical thinking skills to discover better ways of working and resolving complex problems in a team environment. Thriving in an inclusive team environment that encourages diversity, balance and innovations. Assiting new employees with questions regarding the claims support process and problems that may arise while under training."
good,Allstate is a wonderful place to work but just ready to move on and up in the work force! Excellent co worker with wonderful work ethic. And there is a lot to learn from Allstate.
good,"A typical day would consist of a daily meeting, going over potential leads, following up with those leads, talking with potential leads, and current customers.  The culture of the workplace is varies from day to day, some days is fast pace, and others it could be slow. There is nothing really hard about this job, follow up with leads, make calls and you will close business. Working at here is great when working with people that have your back"
good,Very competitive environment with deadline and quotas. It was a learning experience to work with an environment that did have actual customers.  I enjoyed the aspect of the entrepreneurial environment.
good,"I actually worked for an agency.  We sold Allstate insurance, but I technically worked for the agent.  I learned a lot about insurance and sales, but found I did not enjoy selling insurance."
good,"I worked with a wonderful agent and co-employees, most of them."
good,I would walk from door to door giving out flyers to people. I would do whole neighborhoods in about 5 hours. It was a relaxing job and I met lots of new people.
good,"Good Place to work, All ways thinking of things to do for the employee.  Long life.  Listen to all suggestion.  Sometime can be a bit  hard on time management.  (breaks, Lunch)  Employees work hard and should have more time to reqroup.    This is a huge place and it take time to get from  point  A to point  B.If you have to sign in and out for breaks it can be a  bit challenging.  Depending on where your desk is sitting."
good,"Beautiful and interesting place to work wih a nice location  tucked away from traffic.  Awesome benefits and  friendly coworkers.  "
good,"You get so much time off at Allstate, that alone is worth the job.  You also get a matching 401k and a pension which is very nice. The pay is a little less than you would get at another company doing the same job but you do get raises often.  Overall it was a good experience but they do have lay offs every few years so the future is not guaranteed."

I love solving problems and making them happy. Honestly there was nothing too hard about my job if there was someone upset or something that I did not know, in the end I knew there was a way to make them happy or someone I could go to for the answer.

We were a small team, which helped us gain a great amount of respect and cordial caper amongst the ""annuity team."" I rather enjoyed my job, as the dress code was very relaxed, and I was able to utilize my superb customer service skills. We had training, and job aides we followed, as far as filling out forms, and sending out requests. If calls came in that were not of a deceased owner, we passed security with the caller, and transferred them to the appropriate department."
good,Great place to work if you don't have a family at home. Schedules are late.
good,High marks for this company.  I can't find much to say that would show any reason for anyone not to apply there.  The only reason I am not there is due to outsourcing.  That is the downfall.

The most enjoyable part is when you have helped provide someone with a policy that they need."

good,"I was really excited when I became an adjuster. The job is challenging and they change little rules all the time. If you don't get the memo you can easily fall behind. This is Catastrophe claims so its dead then it's crazy, staying all night, kind of crazy. They do pay really well if you do have those nights where you're there all night and about once a month you work a weekend. Weekends also get paid extra plus a day off for each day you work over the weekend. They make up for the weekends and late nights partly but the work / home balance is very UNbalanced. They don't care how much work you have, you better get it done and get it done without flaw or you Will suffer. Can you keep up? Its' hard to leave work when you know there's someone out there with water in their basement waiting for you to call and it's never fixed fast enough. I grow tired of having to work with upset people all day. Most of the customers are in a catastrophe situation and that's why i wanted this job, to be able to help. However, it wears on you after awhile. It was a nice challenge but I am looking forward to getting into something new."

good,"Katlyn and Justin were incredible to work for! They care for their employees and seek their best interest! They take care of their team. Working in customer service was difficult, as you deal with all the claims and billing issues, but Katlyn and Justin did everything they could to make the difficult situations more manageable.

Fill out paperwork for bank deposits and close register/business for the day."
good,"A typical day at work includes incoming and outgoing phone calls, processing payments, prospecting new insured, sending out quotes, adjusting premiums, processing claims, and clerical duties. Working for Allstate for six years, I learned how to effectively communicate with different personalities in an office and with customers. I also learned how to manage employees based on how my employer interacts with us and delegates and supervises our work. Four of the most important collaborative skills that I learned are how to leverage and delegate my workload, ask for help when needed and negotiate deals and favors. The work atmosphere is very friendly, open, and positive; therefore, my co-workers are pleasant to work with. Each co-worker can count on one another for assistance in tackling a task or a difficult and unfamiliar customer inquiry. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rejection when attempting to close out a sale. The most enjoyable part of the job is solving a customer concern and experiencing a shift in attitude and language once a customer is satisfied with their resolved concern."

good,Allstate is a great place to work the only issue I have is the low pay.  You will be trained in several different jobs which is good but you will be required to do all the jobs at a low rate of pay.  Allstate needs to bring their pay scale up for processing positions.

good,"At Allstate I worked at a desk where I primarily did input and verified information. On some Mondays I worked in the claims department. I learned how to be self sufficient knowing each day what I needed to do and going in to work doing it and not having anyone standing over my shoulder, although there were job reviews done by managers to inform me of how I was doing. I had a good relationship with my managers and co-workers. The hardest part of my job was working in claims when there was a tragedy.

good,The day would start with analyzing reports to see that the team is on track to meet or exceed goals. The majority of my day would be working with my team coaching them and assisting them to provide an high level customer experience. I would work with my peers to ensure management coverage on the production floor is adequate and work on various projects that were assigned to us. The hardest part of my job was handling the amount of information that would be sent to me but was not relavent to my team or department. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the specialists on my team and helping them develop.
good,"I was very proud to be associated with Allstate Insurance. If you did not learn something everyday you were not working. I order to have a growing business you could not be afraid to put in the hours it took to complete the goal. We also had fun even if the other Agency's were your direct competition we still helped or gave advise when needed. We on the same team. Being a contract I as an agent did not qualify for benefits, except being allowed to purchase group health insurance."
good,A typical day at work for me is I sign onto my virtual office every morning in Florida and I pull up my contact lists and away I go.
good,I work at a nice laid back office and its really nice. Great people nice atmosphere the prefect company.
good,"I appreciate my experience with Allstate Insurance Company. Allstate has a complete training program for all new agents and sales representatives. I enjoyed selling insurance products to our clients. Although days were long, it was a joy to see our customers."
good,I learned how to be quick on my feet as well as manage and work with people of many backgrounds from the young to senior community.
good,I have enjoyed working with Senior Management to put a continuous monitoring compliance process in place for the company.
good,Productive & fun work environment with free coffee and great desks and comfortable chairs.
good,"Very warm, welcoming enviornment. If I were not moving, I would stay here for years!"
good,"Allstate is an excellent company and I enjoyed working there for close to eleven (11) years. A typical day includes writing/reviewing new/renewal commercial accounts - phone calls with agents - reviewing loss control reports. As an underwriter, you also learn about the ""law"" as well as the appropriate coverage U need for home, autos, and life insurance. My co-workers carried themselves in a professional manner- of course, one doesn't get along with everyone, but I try to just ignore situations which can result in a confronttion with a co-worker. The hardest part is declining to write a piece of business because it goes against the company guidelines, however, the agent is someone you really like and wish you could assist them on that account. The most enjoyable is when you spend a lot of time working on a new account and the agent calls and tells you that he will place the account with your company. I only left because there were rumors there would be a staff reduction. Of course, I was concerned even though I always had favorable reviews - just didn't know whether age would be a factor. Coincidentally, a friend worked at AON and told me about a position that was opened. I interviewed and an offer was made and I accepted."
good,"I was a part time receptionist at an insurance company, small office. I would come in around 10am or 1pm depended on how many people were in the office. I would assist customers who mainly spoke only spanish since I was the only bilingual employee. I greeted all customers, answered phones, handled payments, distributed quotas on auto insurance. I transferred calls, took messages, called customer, mailed letters, answered emails, called insurance companies, ran errands such as post office needs. I believe the hardest part was when we had a difficult customer in which nothing we did to assist her was good enough but eer put on a brave face and at the end of the day my co workers and I managed to get her content with her situation. She went from cussing and arguing to thanking us for our time and dedication to her. My most enjoyable part was having a very good relationship with my co workers, we grew insync and it helped the office work flow rather gracefully made the job a tad bit easier to manage all the paper work and customer services."
good,"A typical day includes cold calling leads, following up on prospects, appointment setting, and face to face consultative sales."
good,"First insurance job for me, never made more money than working there."
good,I believe they look for the best customer service skills out of their employees. Their training is the excellent.
good,"I like everything about Allstate. It's a great company with great people. I've learned a lot of new skills since I started and I can easily say that my managers have always been very supportive. The best thing about my team and department is easily the work/life balance. There are times when extra hours need to be put in, but that is not the norm."
good,Culture was fine as long as you successfully developed relationships.  Hardest part of job was the team was short staffed and each team member was assigned too many projects
good,"At the developer level there is lot to learn and explore. You are not limited to just your duties, you get to learn how different team work. "
good,The work environment was really great. The schedule was flexible and management was very understanding with my school schedule. The pay was the worst part it was minimum wage but I am grateful for anything.
good,Great place to work if you can keep up. There's pressure but the team and management is supportive. focused on giving back and inclusive diversity. honestly good benefits.
good,"Very evolving workspace with the management and culture to win in the industry of Insurance and Financial Services. The atmosphere is great, fun, and empowering."
good,Allstate was my best entry level job that gave me a clear path to a career. They really take care of their employees! the longer you stay the higher your pay is there. I would recommend this company for anyone wanting a career and a quick way to advance.
good,"A typical day at Allstate is long, stressful, yet relaxing and challenging at the same time. The employees there become more like family than co-workers. Everyone is so nice and they treat each other with the upmost respect. Everyone is there to make money, but at the same time, to deliver the upmost amazing customer service that a person could possibly give to an insured. The hardest part of the job is juggling all the claims and tasks that come with those claims that have to be completed daily. The challenge of this is very humbling and at the end of the day you get to say that you helped change people lives for the better. You have such an impact on people's lives that it becomes challenging yet so rewarding! I have learned who I am as a person and an employee working for Allstate. I can honestly say that there are too many places to work that are this rewarding from a human helping human prospective."
good,"It was a nice place to work and great team and great environment."
good,"Team atmosphere is amazing and everyone is very helpful and friendly. Great pay, benefits and holidays. The only downside is that they workload can be a bit much."
good,Great place to work Just ended up with a kid as a office manager that had ego issues. Had that not happen I would currently still be employed by Allstate.
good,I was very happy to work for Allstate and would love to find a job for another Allstate agent. Great work atmosphere and coworkers. The agent really cares about her employees.
good,"Great management, coworkers and company values. Allsrate is an excellent company to work for!!! Supervisors and Managers extremely supportive of employees personal work goals providing opportunities to employees to further development their career and grow with Allstate."
good,"Its a good place to work, lack of work/life balance. Scheduling PTO is a problem as there is never an availability, and to approve you have to speak with your manager, however they did got approved. They do have lots of internal opportunity, but getting them, that's another story."
good,Working at the agency I learned a lot of computer skills I needed. We were and entirely paperless office. I also got a lot more quoting experience as well.
good,"Over the course of my employment here, I have learned a lot more about the insurance field that I didn't know before. I have always had the opportunity to do more training and expand my strengths"
good,"I retired after 34 years of great career at Allstate. there are a lot of good companies out there, what makes Allstate different are the great people at all levels of the company. As a former manager I know what it takes to be successful and it is possible for anyone to achieve success if they want to work hard for it. Yes, you will work hard and yes, it is challenging, but you will have the best support structure available."
good,"The following review is based on my experience as an Exclusive Agent. Overall, my past experience working with the company independently was rewarding and enjoyable. Although, there were numerous obstacles in my position as a agency owner. I was able to maintain my momentum."
good,excellent service and great customer caring company.will help you out of the way when you need it.Employees are amazing and always happy with the culture and flexibility they have.

good,"Learned a lot here. Got exposure to different projects and was able to facilitate and demonstrate my skills of handling different projects. "
good,"it was simple, I learned how to mange people and multitask. I worked Monday through Friday typical for an office. I read emails and answered calls...."
good,Loved working at Allstate had to leave due to personal reasons. Most peole will get the pay they want and schedule they want.Management and team leaders a top class well trained and actually care.
good,It was easy going and a friendly environment plus it was decent pay for the amount of work that was required on a daily basis. The people that I had to deal with were always super kind to me and respected my position in the company
good,"Varies from agent to agent. overall, there is a lot of call volume and you need a skill in networking to be a success. You generate what you sale and you are never off the clock."
good,"I really liked my boss, was a very good mentor for me. Also allowed me free reign in the way I achieved my tasks. After a couple years I left because I felt like I wasn't being challenged anymore and not learning as much. Am very grateful to have worked for the company."
good,"You are able to set your own pace and work in an supportive team environment. Allstate is located in a good area and very nice building with extra perks. The culture is open and diverse, a good chance to network with different classes and ethic groups. The company offers nice benefit package but the payrate could be higher, to match the marker rate of charlotte, nc."
good,"Allstate was an amazing company to work for."
good,"Great place to work.. Incredible advancement opportunity, awesome balance of work and family life.  Fast paced environment of constant change and evolution."
good,"With almost 30 years of sales and Agency owner experience, I possess the required skills to succeed in any environment requiring initiative, self motivation and sales success."
good,"I have done many jobs while working with Allstate.  One of the jobs that I enjoyed was working in the Legal Dept. for house counsel for Allstate.  We would have to deal with preparing court documents daily.  Contacting clients (insd's) or Attorney's office to schedule depositions, set medical exams."
good,Good place to work.  Left because of better career opportunity elsewhere. Allstate has plenty of areas to excel and gain exposure and opportunities in.
good,"Made phone calls to customers. Organized files and papers. Printed out papers. Cleaned up the office, (janitorial duties). Gave out cards on occasion. Great job experience."
good,"I worked at the Brian Weller Office and it was the best job I ever had! I loved every second of everyday that i worked there. He was an amazing boss! and the office manager was great as well. I could have worked there forever, never intended or wanted to stop working there very much enjoyed everyone that i worked with!"
good,I recommend it. I only left because of the distance. The people that worked there were family and folks genuinely cared about each other. Minimal gossip and BS. Management for the most part was great. Everyone worked together to reach the common goal which was customer service.
good,"My wife and I were both licensed. We developed the business over 4 1/2 years to be the # 3 Commercial Agency in the Nation. Using the newest technology available while staying focused and driven we were able to sell our Book of Business for over $650,000 in profits."
good,Enjoyed working with Allstate!  If you are a Mom they were very understanding of issues and the life of being a working mom.  Pay could not as competitive as I feel it should have been.
good,"A great place to work, with an emphasis on family. Given time off for family events as necessary. Very centered on customer satisfaction and providing the best service possible."
good,Unfortunately most independent Allstate agencies do not provide any health insurance for their employees.  Cross trained in many job responsibilities.  Fast paced office and very family oriented.  Management has a open door policy.
good,"It was a great environment, however there is constant change in procedures and policies. They had a wide arrange of benefits, 401k, and other alternatives."
good,Who doesn't know Allstate and their wonderful commercials? If you put in the time in the right areas you can make this your career. They encouraged us to help people with claims so they weren't all alone trying to figure it out. The hardest part was leaving I would gladly work for them again!
good,"Working at Allstate was a wonderful place to work.  I enjoyed working with all the managers and team leads. Not to mention, I learned so much about processing auto claims."
good,99% on the phones. You are immediate on another call as soon as you're off one. Calls are 100% about claims but you never know what type of caller can be on the other line. Every day is a new day.
good,"great job experience, great opportunity for advancement.  Allstate also pro\vided continued education. The benifis were very good and good health coverage."
good,"A typical day at work involved a lot of sales calls. This was probably the only aspect I did not enjoy, but I always enjoyed talking to people. The management is always encouraging and helps motivate you."
good,"I enjoyed working for my Agent for the 22 years that I was there. She compensated me well and I received flex time and vacation time that was probably more than what other agents are willing to offer. I loved working for the Agent but not necessarily for the Company! Allstate does nothing to support the office staff! They do not offer benefits or 401K,  absolutely nothing for the support staff. So had it not been for my Agent/employer offering me some type of retirement while I was there, I would have left empty handed."
good,I loved my job and my boss. If I didn’t have to relocate I would still be there. I loved the outings at main event twice a year. Schedule 8-4:45 perfect. Really easy to get days off if needed
good,"Working for Allstate as an underwriter was an amazing experience. Everything done during the day was to help make the agent and customer experience top notch. Data from each day was collected for review the following day to determine where strengths and areas of opportunity were to ensure we were working efficiently and providing excellent service. The most enjoyable part of the job was the atmosphere. All sorts of fun contests, food days, and celebrations, plus all of that paid time off! The hardest part of the job is the fast paced environment an occasional grumpy agent, but those are few and far in between. Overall, working for Allstate was amazing. I would recommend it to anyone."
good,"Love work life balance, great benefits. Management is very friendly, but lack management skills. Very relaxed environment and management trusts their people to do their job."

good,Allstate was a great place to work for. The claim department is a very fast paced environment.  I learned so much in my ten year career from entry level to management.
good,"I loved working for Allstate. It takes time to learn everything, but you will. You will continue to learn. There is advances in the company. You haver the opportunity to take free classes. You will find the greatest of friends. When they say team they mean it. I am not crazy about the new knowledge management system. I worked there for seven years. Cheyenne call center is the best! You will be a part of the team you will learn about NET SAT. Customer satisfaction. They have done the most amazing things to help you explore  customer satisfaction."
good,"My job was to protect those things that meant the most to my customers, their home, cars, other possessions, and to provide the best life insurance product for them. That was the most enjoyable part of my job.  The hardest part of my job was telling a customer I could not offer a client protection or coverage. "
good,It was great working in the sales department at Allstate. The culture was very positive and laid back. The company really took good care of the employees. I really liked that I was able to be competitive with my peers and also had the opportunity to earn bonuses based on my performance.
good,All together as a company they were great to work for in an emerging environment. Lots of work but lots of reward. Many new managers but overall a satisfying environment.
good,"Allstate as a company has been a very rewarding to work for, through recently has caused the need to explore other options. the feeling of family among employees is invaluable and you truly do develop a work family. The pay and benefits are fair and they are a variety departments and areas to apply for. Metrics vary by area. I will cherish the time i worked here."
good,Working for this business for the past 2.5 years has been amazing. As my first corporate job I can truly say that it has aided in my growth as an employee and an individual. When people hear about all the great benefits everyone comes running. I think that as far as compensation they need a little more improvement but overrall it is Family.
good,"Learned a lot while working there.  Do not believed I will get the same type of experience in other company.  Company is willing to train their employee not only in technique skill but also in business skill.  Actually, the training also included personal enrichment as well. However, that is too far away for daily commute.  I stayed to finish a full system life cycle."
good,I started as a LSP for agent and moved up to office manger for one of the top agents in AZ.  I worked long hours but loved very second of it.  I ended up opening my own agency but regretted that.
good,"Half of the week was telemarketing existing customers.  General office duties included heavy data input, mass mail-outs, accepting payments, and following up on leads."
good,good company to work for if you are 20 years old no responsibilities you can retire at that company and have a great career need better trained manager
good,"I am the go between the agency and the claim department to answer questions related to the policy as well as any claim file concerns.  I have been here 40 years and have handled Auto, Property, Liability and Personal Injury type of claims during my carrier as well as support functions."
good,Helped customers with insurance needs. Enjoyed working in office as well. Management was helpful for any questions I needed help with for customers. Claims always a challenge
good,Good company but can vary agent to agent over all the agents seem to take care of their employees. Would be nice if vacation pay was offered and some benefits
good,"Allstate is a great place to work. Amazing staff, excellent management and creative work environment. The position can be stressful at times but the management takes note of that and tries to help make daily work more easy. I've learned the key to customer service and how to relate to customers more easily. I've made the work place environment more relaxed by establishing a place of laughter and joy. The best part of my position is that I can help customers and fellow employees find peace in a stressful time of their lives. I really enjoy working for such a progressive company."

good,"Good culture, management, and co-workers."
good,"I see a bunch of companies claiming they have military programs, but this is the first I've seen that backs it up. They pay for your training, and you end up with a job with a salary. Not like other insurance. I went through the licensing program, and received a $500 bonus for passing the licensing test. I received my second bonus of $500 when I hit my 6 month anniversary. Allstate is truly doing what's right by the Vet, and I greatly appreciate that."

Duties included , insurance sales, customer service, office management and staff training.  Allstate provides continuing education and sales training as required to maintain compliance in a professional environment.  I enjoy helping clients meet their protection needs as well as helping provide financial security.  I worked closely with the financial adviser team to make sure their no gaps in the client portfolio.  I would say the hardest part of this job was generating leads without a lead source available."

good,"Unlike many call centers at Allstate you could sometime go 1 hour without a call. Management also didn't push average handle time as priority. Allstate values their customers and management understood that sometimes a call could take up to 1 hour. Management asked for sales, but understood that sometimes there are slow days. Everyone got along there."
good,Great place to work. I enjoy coming to work; helping people in need is what I do. Coworkers have a great attitude. Great opportunities for advancement.

I have worked for Allstate insurance company for 13 and even thought my office closed a year ago I remain very close to the people I have worked with.

good,Trainers and my peers were very helpful and friendly. I worked there for almost fifteen years.
good,Excellect job security. The job had significant rewards for those who brought their best. Others might find this career less rewarding as leadership will push you out by withholding raises etc.
good,"I loved working for Allstate. It has its ups and downs like any employer but overall I was happy working there. I only left because there was a 50-50 chance my office was going to be closed down and I had too many responsibilities to just wait and see if I was still going to have a job so I looked for a new job and left. I'm kicking myself now seeing as how my office was the one picked to stay open. The only gripe I have about the job was the schedule. I hated working every Saturday, it was just part of your schedule there was not getting out of it"
good,"From the top down I believe Allstate is heading in the right direction. I have been under several leaders and managers in my four years with the company, and each were enablers of high performance team work. The positions I have held are challenging and rewarding. The four weeks of vacation (instead of two/two for sick days) is a great benefit. There are lots of great things to mention. If you like the hiring manager I say go for it - Allstate is a good place to work."
good,Was able to work from home which has been a plus due to the weather.  Management have all been great about  being flexible.

good,I built this agency from the ground up which was challenging considering that I was new to the industry. The best part was meeting new people and watching all the referrals flood in the door.
good,I enjoyed my time there but they closed that building. we did have a option to relocate but I chose not to.
good,I have had the ability to work in many different departments and learn so much in the insurance industry.  Discovered skills I didn't know I had before.  Gave me the ability to increase my confidence in sales.  I also learned that change happens often and last minute giving me the ability to utilize my adapt and overcome skills.
good,"Over all a great place to work for a well structured insurance professional in the San Antonio, TX. area. "
good,I was only a part-time employee but I learned a lot in the customer service field. Interacting with clients was the best part of the job as well as the worst at time. The management was amazing
good,"Allstate was a great sales experience for me. A typical day as a Licensed Sales Rep was making 50-100 cold calls from a variety of lists trying to win/earn business. The hardest part of this job was learning the products and actually how to sell an intangible item to people. The most enjoyable part of this job was all the out of office opportunities it provided; we hosted a 5K race, had partnerships with several vendors including Bass Pro Shops. My co workers and management were great at Allstate."

good,"The best job\career I have ever had, I have developed and matured at Allstate."

good,Worked in the data entry department and the preferred pay department. Great People! Benefits were Great also.
good,"I've been there for over 6 years and i cant really say anything bad about the company. it is a very fast paced place there's always a million things to do. I've picked up so many skills there doing maintenance from a good group of guys with tons of years under their belts. management was generally pretty good i worked for a couple of goofballs due to the constant rotating of jobs and locations. i have to say the hardest part of the job was how physically demanding it could be at times but nothing was never impossible, and i have to say i enjoy my team and my thousands of customers who make the place feel more like home."
good,"Great Atmosphere. Training and guidance. Fast paced. Phones always ringing, great place to keep busy."
good,"Not only does Allstate stand by their customer satisfaction, they also provide a great work and learning enviorment for their employee's and other agents. It's so pleasing to introduce improved solutions to both our valued customers, and new members alike."
good,I learned so much in time period I was there. Management opened alot of doors for me and for the most part had my best interest at heart.

good,If you are a go getter or good at sales Allstate is a phanominal opportunity. Your check relies solely on how much you want to work in office or outside of the office. There is no cap on commission and you can choose your own commission rates.
good,Allstate is a well known company that offers great customer service. work space was always clean and organized and communication within the company was always superb
good,"I learned they importance of Team work, to always listen to customers,  to empathize, to trust but verify. The hardest part is not being able to provide a win\win solution for the insured, due to circumstances beyond my control. The most enjoyable part is being able to make insured feel whole again financially and emotionally."
good,Great management team with lots of flexibility and a very well balanced work/life environment. job security is low for processing jobs and reductions in force are a common thing.
good,"Great company to work for. Great benefits, generous PTO., Good benefits. I wish I would have never left. I had no insurance experience when I started. They teach you every thing you need to know."

good,Allstate is a great company to work for! The benefits are great! It more than a job it’s a career! The only issue for me is the work life balance! They will not budge with your shift!
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is working with your co-workers. There will be  busy days but the people and culture are what helps you get through.
good,I loved working for my managers and had a great learning experience. I feel i was taught properly to do my job. My hours were great and enjoyed being part of a team.
good,"Being able to help Allstate Customers recover from their losses/claims was the most rewarding part of my job. While on the CAT team during the aftermath of Hurrican Katrina, I learned first-hand what it meant to our clients to be able to help them get back on their feet; their stories were both heartbreaking and encouraging and I will never forget my time there."
good,"Really fun small offices with tons of workplace culture and great management, at times sales expectations, can be unrealistic due to the high price point of the service being offered but besides that, it is a great place to work. ( hard to sell someone something that is on average 30-40% more than the competition but is essentially the same product)"
good,"Great training , constant work and improvement. Great people to work with. Education reimbursement "
good,"Allstate really cares about their employees. They want you to understand work/life balance, healthy choices, and self management. They offer training and advancement opportunities. Lots of friendly competition and incentives for various types of success, frequent free food, and a fair number of PTO days are just some of the great things about working at Allstate."
good,"Allstate was a great environment to work in. They offered a lot of benefits and a great environment. They stress team work and transparency. They do recruit and promote within. Each person is recommended to manage their own careers, but at the same time managers do look out for star employees and will help you along the way. They do a lot of community work."
good,"This job definitely isn't for everyone and during the warmer months when storms run rampant it is easy to get burned out quickly. However,  management is supportive and helpful."
good,"As an Allstate Claims Service Specialist,you were given the tools needed to succeed.It is a great company to work for and respects customers/employees"
good,Allstate is a great place to work. The customers are fantastic and they grow on you as a whole. You always have a smile on your face at the end of the day.
good,"This is the kind of company that you either love or hate. I loved it. My manager and co-workers made it worth waking up and doing the ho every day. I loved what I did. It is very stressful, but there is a GREAT supportive team to back you up. Of course I can only speak for the property department. You can advance with this company and they will work with you in order to develop you and increase your skill set."
good,You walk in the place and you knew what had to get done. You didn't need a supervisor to tell you what needed to get done unless there was a special project that needed to get done or if you didn't have the stock put away in a 24 hour period. I was in control of inventory of the warehouse that the stock was put away correctly and the bills were able to get paid. I was in charge of making sure everything that came in the warehouse or left the warehouse was documented correctly by the people on the dock. The most important thing i was in charge of was that everyone was doing it safely. I was also in charge of that the pressman had the stock they needed for the jobs that they were running.
good,"A day at the office answered phones addressed problems and complaints educated customers on product an services offerings. updated policy, successfully controlled appointment between  employers and clients."

The management team is great, very encouraging, always providing feedback, and was always available for assistance and/or questions. The most enjoyable part of the job was the atmosphere. We were encouraged to celebrate each other in all ways from birthdays to accomplishments to retirement. Management also had fun ways to take a break or build team morale and it definitely helped form friendships with coworkers.  The only downside to my position was the hours. My shift was 230pm-11pm full time which doesn't allow for much time outside of work with people who work 9am-5pm or so."
good,This agency is very family oriented and flexible when needed.  Monte and his wife Connie travel quite a bit and trusted me enough to run the office alone.
good,They make you feel like family here. They are great about encouraging you and preparing you to advance further in your career. Very open and transparent.
good,Taking to people about their insurance needs.  Explaining all the benefits. It was fun meeting new people. Client coming in and out all day. Kept us on our feet.  Helped they day go by fast.

good,"Working at Allstate you learn how to manage your time. The management and company is amazing. There is room for growth and development. A typical day at work would consist of scheduling insurance reviews, scheduling/following up on claims, handling calls with customers, and dealing with billing. The hardest part about the job would be dealing with complex situations and questions. The most enjoyable part about the job is making the customers happy and making sure they have the most coverage with the best prices."
good,If you can come in a produce under good management this is an amazing place to work. Your income can be limitless and you can really help people. If you have the right work ethic.
good,"Great company to work for, learned a ton about P&C. Job security depends on the Agent you work for. Highly recommend to anyone wanted to get started in this world. Really the most viable option for advancement here is to open your own agency after some experience is accquired."
good,"Working for Allstate was fun and a great learning experience.  Speaking with customer's and assisting them with the claim's process  and feeling a sense of satisfaction knowing that I was a part of changing their lives around during their difficult times.  The office was diverse and we were all like family.  The hardest part was leaving at the end of the day, but I always enjoyed waking up and looking forward to returning the next day."
good,Cleaned out all the files and then would look up customers that were still in the system but were not active and would make a file with all the non active customers. Drive to bank to deposit cash of cash deals.
good,"Thoroughly enjoy my current position.  It's a sales job; therefore, there is a lot of focus on making the numbers each month.  Great salary, great benefits, good management."
good,"Great Boss, Great Office Manager. I didnt want to leave... commute was killing me. The pay was great, The vacation time was great. Snow days sick days, the owner was awesome."
good,"everyone was extremely nice. I never had any issues and everyone was very positive. You get paid decent, and get offered full benefits. I'm actually sad that I quit this job because it was such a great atmosphere with such wonderful people. At the time I worked here minimum wage was still only about $5 an hour and we were paid well over that, almost double actually. You are required to work 1 Saturday every month, but everyone does and you all get rotated out. It's very fun and family oriented. I miss these people."
good,"As part of the telemarketing team at Allstate; we were issue a team goal and an independent goal. Before starting our day Management would do a team rally which was intend to energize the team and get our adrenaline pumping; before getting started we were given any additional incentive for that day ($25.00 Starbucks card for top producer, Money card for the individual who transferred the most calls to Sales which resulted in a new policy, etc....)  and reviewed previous days numbers.  This was a high energy, positive, production driven atmosphere; everything about this position was sales driven the focus was to transfer solid calls to Insurance Agents and write policies."
good,"Come to work do your job type place. Sometimes you feel like you are just a number, con would be too many meetings. Pro - good team atmosphere, money decent,"
good,"Executed day to day operations in a small office, which included but was not limited to greeting and answering customer questions, accepting payments, selling P&C polices via cold calling, cross selling, and walk-ins/call-ins etc. Working for Allstate offered me the ability to get licensed in Property and Casualty and afforded me the opportunity to refine my skills with on-site sales seminars and license renewal courses. Management was easy to work with and extremely tolerant of the work/personal life balance. Being able to build lasting rapports with clients by satisfactorily assisting them with their insurance needs was by far the most enjoyable aspect of the job. While there was the ability to learn, there was not much opportunity to advance as the office was small (2-4 people)."
good,"Good hours, pay was good. They offered incentives to do a good job. Fast paced environment, it kept things interesting. Our department was one of kind and we helped create others in different locations."
good,"Great team environment. Work/life balance is great"

good,"Wonderful team mates. Back to back phone calls, Keep plenty of water at your desk, Plenty of overtime to assist the company needs. Best part of the job, Working in a friendly, clean environment with great coworkers."
good,"At other places I've worked at, there have been large sections of downtime where no calls are coming in but there are also no calls to be put out. At Allstate, there is such a large database that even if you somehow run out of cold calls to make, which I never did, you also have all the prospects your agency has accumulated. It makes for diverse and fulfilling work."
good,I learned a lot and really enjoyed working for allstate. Unfortunally had to moved but i'm sure i would of made more progress if i would of stay with them.
good,Great company to work for and are flexible with work life balance. Have had great learning experience here. Company is always making your health is 1 st priority
good,"I have spent 6 years with this company and would love to end my career with them. Unfortunately they may not have any availability where I am moving, but if I can find anything, I will stay."
good,As a claims adjuster your main focus is customer service. Allstate has high standard for customer service however you are very limited with what you can provide customer to ensure claim satisfaction. The claims adjuster role is stressful and customers are typically unhappy. Allstate is a great company and takes great care of employees. Management understands the stress of the job and are great team leaders. The work culture is great and pay is good.
good,"Overall the work place was awesome, it was a family environment work with the Glazer Agency.  I learned how to write policies, handle customers accounts, and change lien holds and bank accounts. The most enjoyable part was being to have my on desk, my own schedule (for the most part) and the coffee every morning!!"
good,"I worked for Allstate for 26 years and had a wonderful working relationship. I would have love to retire from this company, but unfortunately the company down sized during tough economic times."
good,Allstate is a laid back. Not all departments were the same however. Claims department is by far the best. Advancement is not easy- every large company. Tons of PTO!
good,excallent place to work supervisor helpful unobtrusive pay and benefits excellent great work environment great cafeteria great fellow co workers parking a problem at times but shuttle available
good,"ALLstate Insurance was the first place who give me the opportunity to work in US I keep them in a very special place on my life. Allstate give me that opportunity that I was looking after I finished my school I work for them for long time and Remember there as the best company for a woman to work for it. I always give my 103% when I work for them, I miss all my friends at Allstate because we always work as a team."
good,I love working there because it gave me a flexible schedule to go along with college. I would recommend anyone who is attending college to apply and gain valuable skills.

good,The workers and management are extremely nice and encouraging. Compensation is good compared to other insurance sales companies. This branch is great to work for.
good,working at Allstate was a very good experience for me and I had little to complain about also the hardest part of the job was being able to multitask but once you know what you're doing its very simple
good,"A typical day started at 8am and ended at 5pm. We contacted customers and future customers about new polices and what would work best for them. What I learned was that not all customers where nice, nor where they in a good spirit. The work place culture is very Christian, but they do not push their religion on anyone, they greet you with a hand shake, and say God Bless, and if you open up to them they will pray for you if asked! I absolutely loved that part of the company. The hardest part of the job for me was when i would call a future customer an they would think i was a scam and hang up on me, when in reality i wasn't a scam and i just wanted to help them get the best insurance around. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing customers faces happy when we helped them with there problem or helped them save money!"
good,"This office is no longer in existence, but was an excellent company to work for."
good,It is a great facility. Great flexible hours and great customer service. The environment is definitely one that I would recommend. The culture is fast paced but productive.

good,"The Luv culture is excellent. work/life balance is excellent as well. I enjoyed every minute of the day at SWA, coworkers, management etc was excellent. "
good,"The Parma office was very small, with only 2-3 other employees working there at any given time, which made it ideal for working with few distractions.  There was always someone on hand to help answer any questions, and they were always polite and eager to help, which for a temporary worker or a new long term employee would be beneficial."
good,I absolutely love working for Allstate. They are very good to their employees and flexible when it comes to families. The environment is very open and friendly. The best part about my job is being able to help customers save money.

The owners are also very appreciative of their staff, which you don't see very often.  The only downside was at the time I worked there they did not offer health insurance, but they may have changed by now."
good,Planning and setting up workshop for the external sales associates.  I learned time management because things had to be shipped and set up for the conferences.  My co-workers were fair and appreciated our efforts.  The hardest part was making sure the flyers and all the sales material arrived in a timely time when the weather was bad.  The most enjoyable part was when the managers would appreciate your efforts and say thank you just for doing your job
good,"I basically bring in new business, process insurance applications and do office work.  Very small company and we get along well."
good,"Allstate is a great company t work for/ They were very professional and willing to allow us to take ownership of our customers needs. While working for Allstate I learned many things such as inputing claim information, subrogation processes, and determining liability on clear situations. The hardest part of my job was not being able to help a customer when they were in need. The most enjoyable part was getting feedback from our customers that helped us to improve there overall experience. At Allstate co-workers were more like family. We attended each other's birthday gatherings and weddings. I am even a god mother to a co-workers child, so they are really my family now.

My original assignment was to make calls requesting payment and document my conservation and also collect Insured deductible. After about three months I was moved to a higher level of collections asking not only for the deductible but also other collections related to payout on behalf of Insured. Third Party would promise to pay at a certain time and some would not keep their promise and I would have to start process all over again that was the hardest part of the job. Most of the communication was inbound and data entry using dual monitor and responsible for email response and also outbound calls as well. My overall experience was good, co-workers were awesome and very helpful also good benefits. Paid bi-weekly and not weekly.

They gave incentives such as gift cards, bonuses, health/dental insurance, not to mention vacation time, PTO, Emergency time which allowed us to be in adherence should we be running late or had to leave early.  They truly cared about their employees.  The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with prospects that really didn't want any help.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the friendships I built with my teammates/co-workers.  We'd always make our own little incentives such as buying lunch for the person who sold more than their competition whether it'd be more sales, better adherence, more ""same day bundles"", so on and on."

Programs were updated for the next week upload. I worked with 20 million policies, all agents countrywide.

I was fortunate to have an amazing mentor who, if he didn't have an answer, could point me in the right direction.
