bad,"This company never ceases to amaze me with violating the privacy of their employees. I know of quite a few employees who had to go out on FMLA and/or short/long term disability. It would spread like wild fire to all other employees and sly comments would be made about that employee to the other employees (such as: that person will never be back on my team again!) They  also pick favorites and will only consider those particular people for advancement. If you party/drink alcohol with those particular supervisors outside of work on the weekends, then you have a better chance of advancing into a leadership role."
bad,"TIAA churns its employees.  By raising sales goals and service requirements to impossible levels, Wealth Management Advisors are pushed through a  revolving door of hiring-firing.  Clients are so frustrated with turnover, they've long since fled to Fidelity down the street.  No one stays for long.  Before taking a job in the Palo Alto office, ask the length of service of other employees.  It's the best indication not to work there."
bad,"You must be armed with a strong character and a can do attitude in order to be successful in an environment with a multitude of competing agendas, lack of vision and support from managers."
bad,"Trust Co. is way under funded relative to growth.  Wealth Management WMAs are churned at an annual rate of 20%.  Clients are unaware that technology, product line and service are 10 years behind industry leaders - Fidelity and Vanguard.  Trust Co. management are want-to-be's who are incompetent and full of themselves.  TIAA Direct was on the verge of being shutdown under OCC consent order.  Client's get practically nothing in exchange for a management fee."
bad,a typical day at work was very interesting and at times very interesting. This company was great at first with time and technology  things change.
bad,"Do not work here.  It's a passive aggressive, ""kiss-the-ring"", stale culture that's filled with has-beens.  People smile to your face and stab you in the back.  The veterans that have remained here for so long have evolved to protect their own seat at all costs, so finger pointing/blaming, lack of accountability, and sabotaging ensue, especially now given the markets are volatile and the recent asset management acquisitions have been making everyone nervous about losing their jobs. Instead of looking to thrive as a business, people are too busy putting energy into identifying and creating coworker scapegoats for their own ineptitude, insecurities, and sub-standard work.  Top management have their ""pets"" and turn blind eyes to bad behavior yet are hypocritical to/come down hard on all others. The firm thinks they are going to be the top 10 global player, and they are delusional - they are not a BlackRock or JPMorgan or Fidelity to name a few.  They tout how they live by their ""values"" but it's all for show just to say they are doing it.  The reality is the place is a joke.  Try finding that news article about their ""voluntary retirement"" internal announcement recently.  Read their internal memo - it's written with a ""smile of the face"" and stresses ""voluntary"" but really you know what the secret really is - age discrimination and trying to save a few bucks.  It's a highly stingy/cheap organization.  They are hurting badly but don't want to admit it to save face and to placate the participants. This institution is a loser, and so are the people who are still working there."
bad,"HORRIBLE. Do not go to the call center. You will die a slow painful death. The management sucks, systems sucks, no work life balance, mandatory overtime everyday, horrible bonuses, you are a robot there."
bad,"Just a number in the layers of management. No one cares about the company, just concerned how far they can advance. "
bad,"Interaction with various departments and cities.  I learned e-procurement, and how to service internal customers efficiently."
bad,"Poor management and discrimination. If you don't hang out with managers or don't have inside networks,  you're just a number. They promote based on who they know rather than based on qualifications."
bad,When you have worked there for less than a year and your Boss cant answer your questions you know your in for trouble.  Management has no clue what they are doing.  Company would run better if they promoted for merit and not for longevity or the status quo.
bad,"Constant change and re-organization.  Middle management is very confused.  They hire and fire at random with no thought. Most are trying to climb the corporate ladder and only care about themselves.  They gave no idea about teams.  Lot's of politics!  Lot's of drama!  Be careful when you see someone smiling at you, your demise will follow shortly.  Not many happy people working here.  ""When's the next firing""?  There is no trust of the company and their managers."
bad,"If you are seeking stability, this is not the company for you. Years ago it was a great company however it has changed for the worst."
bad,"If you are in between jobs, TIAA CREF could be a place to land until you find other employment. Do not resign from your current job to work at TIAA CREF. No work life balance - no matter what they say during the interview process. The beautiful campus is the only positive about this organization. Unethical management, culture of fear and blame. Annual layoffs before the holidays."
bad,"TIAA is a firm in financial trouble. It uses unprofessional, dishonest and unethical tactics to deceive not only its customers, but its employees.  This is a firm that pays money for their nominations and awards as the 'best place for' (fill in the blank): working mothers, diversity, LGBTQ - and this one kills me every time - 'world's most ethical company.'  I was the sucker who wanted to believe and was looking for an employer with a vision and greater sense of purpose. What I found instead was soul-less executives who simply care about the bottom line and are willing to sacrifice anyone to meet that objective. That mentality, unfortunately, filters down if you want to keep your job there.  It is by far the worse professional work experience/employer that I have had in my +20 year career. Stay away as an employee and as a customer."
bad,"Every activity is based on an individual Metric as opposed to success on an overall score, a collegial approach or being a team player.  At some point they have to let you out of your nest and fly, something i clearly never found."
bad,my desk was ransacked and my personal belongings were stolen.
bad,"Stressful environment, with no appreciation for hard work and extra effort put in.  Seem to enjoy operation in dysfunction and no very collaborative within the area in which I work.  Expectation seems to be no separation of work and personal life.  Lack of resources to get the job done and seems to be comfortable with managing key functions with temp staff."
bad,"I would only recommend this position if you have zero financial services experience and don't mind working with a bunch of loud mouth 22 yr olds who live with their parents...and getting yelled at by your grandparents (clients) all day. You can get all your licenses and move on. This is considered a remote office from ""corporates"" perspective, although 350 employees are there. They do not value any outside financial services experience, just their own."
bad,"Management horrible, blatant disregard for employees, almost contempt, unrealistic expectations."
bad,"In all the years I have been in Project Management I have never seen an establishment run the way I did while working at TIAA. My introduction to the culture at TIAA began with an immediate discovery that my new manager had zero integrity. My first day there he/she filled me in on all the gossip by listing everyone on the teams personal problems. The following week I was expected to do unethical things in order to get my job done faster, of course I didn't do them. They manage by being verbally and mentally abusive and when you push back they either threaten you or begin their most enjoyable part of their job which is ending your career there as quickly as it started. The enjoyment I saw from managers actually excited to make their direct reports miserable and quit was disgraceful. If you quit they can replace you but if they fire you they have to prove your position is needed and it's a long process. That was the explanation I was given when I called my manager on his behavior. "
bad,"TIAA has great benefits and is one of few companies to still have a pension. However, none of this is makes tolerating the poor leadership worth it. Within the Finance organization, inappropriate behavior of leadership is permitted. Issues reported to HR are brushed ""under the rug"" until it can no longer be ignored and then the Manager/Director is just moved to another area without ramifications of actions. This is a trend and not just my experience at this company. You DO NOT want to be a female (especially of color) working at this company. They say all the right things about work life balance, employee satisfaction, and promotional opportunities. However, reality is they just want to work you to death and show very little appreciation and then demand more. When/if you express concerns about working 70+ hours a week and receiving call at all hours of the day/night, your manager/director reminds you of the current umemployment rate. Management by fear."
bad,"One word to describe management, ""VICIOUS"". I contracted with T/C for four months. I have never seen management treat their employees more horribly then when I worked here. I was appalled by the things that I saw take place and was out of there asap. No human being should have to endure the things that happened in that place. I understand the mentality of Corporate America but this company took the dog eat dog mentality to a whole new level of depravity. The managements total lack of regard for the employee was something that I would not wish to happen to my worst enemy."
bad,"I was hired in 2006, at that time, $1Bil was leaving the company every month. Our mission was to reach out to HNW clients and build financial plans to deepen and strengthen relationships. It was very rewarding and fun. By 2011, assets started pouring in; the mission had changed. The only thing that matters was bringing in assets. Management changed and it became a very un-fun place to work."
bad,"Working for TIAA was very stressful and there was not a good work/life balance.  The culture at TIAA is very bureaucratic and old-school and they are not progressive in their ideologies, technology, or thought processes.  Management is very biased and it is a good-ole-boy system where they promote based on who you know and how much you are liked. "
bad,"Micro managed absolute Mill of a call center. Heavily Scripted, will fire you for no apparent reason...Hit all of your goals, no matter, they will figure out a way to send you packing. Everyone desperately tries to get up ladder to ""save"" themselves. Constant fearful attitude from workforce...thus breeding a secretive workplace. Constant changes occurring, due to managerial unsteady demeanor. Mission critical systems will fail all of a sudden, with no real warning.  Brokers and Advisors (Producers) from regular brokerage houses will find their myriad of annuities to be a strange brew of financial products. A culture that tries to assimilate you into their ""Borg"" atmosphere, where if you don't drink the ""Kool-Aid,"" you are branded an outcast by management."
bad,"Smothering environment for any advisor with experience in the industry.  Incredible amount of micromanagement and lack of experience and professionalism at the management level in Wealth Management."
bad,"Managers only care about themselves. No opportunity for advancement, even though they say they are hiring due to others being promoted, when they really quit and went elsewhere."
bad,"There is no transparency, no room for growth, and no work-life balance. It is impossible to get ahead here unless you know someone in upper management."
bad,"Management & upper Management only cares about the clients & their money. They do not care about their associates.  Especially true in the Trust Department.  Overwhelmed, overworked, stressful, hostile & chaotic work environment. No room for growth or development in Trust."

bad,"They will work you to death here.  Most people are great people to work with and most are good at what they do individually, but organization is being overrun by people from cheap labor countries and really poor decisions are being made.  I am also surprised, at how far behind they are on design and quality of the applications that support their main area of business and income.  A company that has been in business as long as this company has been, should have a higher quality software product to support retirement funds management."
bad,"Administrative Staff is underpaid and you can only get promoted if you have worked there for 20+ years."
bad,"While TIAA-CREF has one of the most beautiful campuses in Charlotte, it is all exterior fluff---a reflection of the highest levels of management. While the company has an important mission of serving those of the 99% who have devoted their lives in service to others, it is run by the 1%, who are devoted to serving themselves."
bad,I have worked in both service based n product based companies but worst experience i had in this company. They never give u the technologies u have experience but while rating they give the same reason for bad ratings.
bad,"From the top down, TIAA’s leadership is extremely poor, to say the very least. Upper management constantly pushes “improvements” (i.e. cheaper software replacements) through without prior notice or training leaving its customers beyond frustrated, and its employees looking like incompetent imbeciles. TIAA is constantly trying to find ways to cut costs, and it truly shows. From terrible, cheap and dated software, to even worse hardware, TIAA’s employees are often left stranded with no solutions to provide to their customers. TIAA claims to care about its customers as it’s a “not-for-profit”, so they tiptoe around sales terminology, referring to it as “advocacy” instead. TIAA’s flagship investment, TIAA Traditional, is truly garbage, and is the cause of at least 70% of TIAA’s customers’ frustration. The only way TIAA is able to retain a customer base is to lock them into illiquid investments, and by wooing large organizations to allow them to manage their retirement accounts. Once a participant moves on from an employer for which they’ve had a TIAA account, 90% of the time they run as fast as they can to Fidelity, Vanguard, et al, and wisely so! If you actually care about taking care of your customers, TIAA is not the place to be. Oh yeah, and 50% of your scorecard, which is how TIAA determines how much of a bonus you’ll receive each year, is based on Voice of the Client (VOC) reviews. With terrible products, web design and no solutions, it’s easy to get dogged on in a VOC for something that is completely and totally out of your control. If you’re considering a career in the Financial"

bad,Closed 20-25 IRA retirement accounts daily and mailed checks to customer. Resolved completed customer complaints and account disputes. Best part about the job was the people I worked with. We had a great group of staff.
bad,Management is horrible. Complete chaos. Good Pay. Jobs not as described.
bad,unless you really need the money avoid this place at all costs. It is the worst job i have ever had the displeasure of working at. The clients are all doctors and professors. This means they will without a doubt be arrogant and condescending as much as possible.

bad,Our team has no ethics. Sr. Indian Managers under F&A are really retards they have no work standards they take share for retaining and retruitment of false consultants who aren't good for work.
bad,"Boring, thank goodness I quit.  There is a reason why people end their careers here, because it is boring."
bad,Too much work in the pipeline to allow any true professionalism. The situation is more about pumping out work and less about quality and messaging.
bad,Great clients and co-workers.  Previous director was not very supportive and did not listen very well.  New director means well and will either have to adopt a more controlling and micromanaging style or will be forced to quite.  Goals increase each year and resources decrease.  Work life balance doesn't exist.  Role is very customer service focused.  High goals and sales quotas make it difficult to give attention to clients. If the client doesn't have any assets to bring into the company there is little motivation to help them.
bad,"As a  Contingent employee they are used and abused. No advancements, no holiday pay, no benefits. Been there 1 1/2 and they still have not hired me on. They only extend the contract. Once I reach 2 years they will terminate the contract."
bad,"Poor management, untrustworthy and dishonest. Backstabbers and liars. If you escalate concerns to management they will tranistion you out and not take care of you. They do not look out for your best interest but only their own. You will not be rewarded to any extra effort put into your job. New management brings in her own people to replace you. Be very careful if you make a decision to join this firm."
bad,"Zero loyalty. I was there 17 plus years and they will drop you in a second. I had an exemplary record until a certain manager - popovich , took over. "
bad,This place is the biggest ball of confusion. No one knows what is going on. The systems are ancient. The management aren't knowledgeable. NO work/life balance. Mandatory overtime with little notice (the night before).
bad,"oppressive, depressive, overbarring and under imaginative management."
bad,"What started as a non-profit,  who cared about their people went to a public company, with a massive emphasis on production, puts to much stress on the avaerage person. The only way to advance is to know someone."
bad,"I love helping participants with their retirement goals and needs."
bad,"Unfortunately, I was let go because my Department downsized."
bad,Worse IT Shop I have ever worked in. Worked staff round the clock during week and on weekends. Technology Management would not acknowledge need for additional FTE's even when seasoned FTE's were bolting for other external opportunities.
bad,"Throughout my 10+ years working here every year I had different Manager, I guess that explains the organization is always on reorg, before you figure out you will be reporting to different person. You need to kiss upper management to get yourself good bonus - not actually working. If you are good in kissing then you are great fit for the organization. If you are not kissing then you will be imposed with lot of unnecessary work which are absolutely not productive or add any business value to the organization."
bad,"The management staff were unfair to some of their employee's, given the circumstances, they did not train properly, and through unsatisfactory performance, it resulted into termination, after 4 months of hard work and dedication. their lack of acknowledgement to some of the employee's were not justified, and always went uncaring."
bad,Not a good environment for employees that seek to grow in information security
bad,"Yuck.  My particular area was not a pleasant area.  The insistence of upper managers to make production changes on the weekends and on Fridays was just terrible.  It was their way, I suppose, of getting more effort out of the staff without bothering with details like time off, etc.  The communication skills amongst the managers in my area was atrocious."
bad,Great company to work for and wonderful supportive colleagues
bad,"TA Management is very disfuncational, self-serving-do not live by the firms Code of Ethics and Fair Hiring Practices. You will be treated in a demeaning manner, unappreciated, overworked without the pay. No work life balance on this team. You will be made false promises, bad follow thru and with ever changing processes and procedures. Management wants only to make themselves look good and use you up in the process. I would not recommend working in talent acquisition at this firm. It is a sweat shop. You will have very little support and training. Then you will be blown out without any consideration for you or what you have done for the firm. Lots of turn-over!"
bad,The political climate there is such that out of fear associates are discouraged from process improvement. The fear is based in the fact that IT associates have normal problem resolution tasks under hand and this amounts to job security in their eyes.
bad,"The pay is good and the benefits are great."
bad,"Managers are only looking out for themselves and will put blame on their subordinates to save themselves from being fired. Also, some managers like to exert their leadership to make sure everyone knows they are in charge and hold power over you!"
bad,"Overall Tiaa is a good company but lacks good managers. Managers can make up or break up teams. There’s good culture, work environment, and peers are great to work with."
bad,"great company, but with additional assets under management, the structure is unsteady. There have been many rounds of layoffs as a result. I think the culture will be better down the road."
bad,"Better know somebody or you'll go nowhere.  They talk about job work/life balance, but there isn't any such thing there.  It's a constant culture of do more with less."
bad,2 of the biggest let downs was the employee satisfaction index and other was the management role in all this.
bad,"TIAA was a non-profit that erred on the side of taking care of employees and clients.  The motto was ""...for the Greater Good."" It is transitioning into just another financial services firm with multiple reorganizations, layoffs of employees, etc.  For the risk/reward ratio, choose another firm until the dust settles and its transition is complete; then decide."
bad,"I did not have good experience with this client, hardest part of the job is to work 24/7 all the days it was like that. I personally don't like the work culture here."

bad,I have learned and excelled in using the Six Sigma philosophies.  I have proven my Project Management skills by saving the company over $15 million in cost per participant expenses over a three year period.
bad,"I was there 9 yrs, changes brought lots of people to unemployment. Rather then proper training they outsourced. I worked very hard put all my passion into the place and for a short time there was rewards even if it was just a thank you. No more appreciation, every man for himself. CYA cost people integrity and jobs. Tiaa cref of 5 yrs ago vs now was amazing and worth getting up in the morning. Sadly things changed and not for the better. Benefits were cut. Sad state it is now in."
bad,"Many very talent, sincere people.  But watch out for the few rotten apples in management who are just looking for people to chew up."
bad,"You are looked down upon if you do not make this job first priority. Promotions are given on a kiss up basis not by actual skill. It is also frowned upon if you don't attend after hours ""meetings"" that are always at a drinking establishment. Everyone is sneaky, throwing rocks and hiding hands."
bad,"After being hired specifically to bring in new processes and improve procedures, it seemed every suggestion was met with a condescending dismissal of ""that isn't how we do things"". And occasional overtime was 10-12 hour days on a regular basis. The pay and benefits package was GREAT, but sadly I had to move on."
bad,Within the last two years TIAA has gotten much worse.  The company keeps reducing the work force and employees left are expected to assume the additional work load.
bad,"There is no place to go in the Dallas office. Expect to stay in some form of your entry role for 4-6 years. "

bad,"A competitor of TIAA-CREF might ask a prospect:"
bad,"I found early on that they reorg constantly. You could be working on a new project/direction, and 6 months later get new manager and a new direction, leaving the previous project unfinished. IT was about 15 years behind Fidelity. Technology will be playing catch-up for years. Treated as 2nd class with no room for advance if worked from home. You need face time with the boss, so you can kiss his butt, and brag about the fabulous job you did, and also say yes yes yes to your manager and never disagree. On the flip side, salary and benefits was very good."
bad,"The company is going through a cost cutting phase to where the workforce is being reduced.  The expense reduction is needed, but it can be done in more ways than simply reducing the workforce.  The maturity of TIAA's processes and systems are approximately 10 years behind industry standard.  However, people stayed there because of the culture and the mission.  The mission remains, but there is a decreased focus on maintaining a positive culture."
bad,"Collaborative work environment, heavy focus and commitment to favorable client experience.  Consensus environment, can be a bit cliche with teams but generally very friendly."
bad,"Great benefits and a very stressful place to work.   The processing department has no clue what they are doing.  There is no set standard procedures in place so it is an environment where if you have an issue you will get 12 different resolutions which turn out to be wrong.  The co-workers was the best part of the job, younger individuals who enjoyed being social and going out after work.  The hours are horrible and they discriminate against homosexuals and individuals with disabilities."
bad,"DO NOT take a position with TIAA-CREF in the NCC. On the job training is unnecessarily stressful due to poor organization and attitudes of managers and mentors. New employees are strictly evaluated throughout the training process with threats of corrective action including termination. Trainers and managers assisting with training seem more concerned with being right and in control versus the success of trainees at their jobs. Due to the poor training and massive amounts of functions to be performed on dinosaur systems, even tenured employees seem confused in their roles. The on-boarding process was a nightmare; duplicate info had to submitted to HR SEVERAL times; training was supposed to be 3 months but lasted over five...do not work here!"
bad,"TIAA has a great heritage, mission, vision, and values, and the top tier of leadership really seems to buy into them. Benefits are good, and the organization is large enough that you can find opportunities in whatever you're looking for if you wait long enough for an opening and are willing to claw your way over external candidates and management toadies to get an interview."
bad,"Upper management was clueless about the work we did in Editorial.  We had to assume many hats to get projects completed, overlooking levels of account managers and so-called strategists who were incapable of driving the content creation."
bad,"When I decided to leave my prior corp job to work for TIAA, I was told that I would appreciate the culture. I think that may be true for some areas but not for the group I worked in. It was very cutthroat and hypocritical. Try and get some interview time with your future potential peers before you decide to leave your current position."
bad,"The only thing that kept me going back to TIAA was the amount of money that I was making. It's a very clique-like environment that includes one woman who likes to bully people in order to get what she wants. She's never called on it, and never gets into trouble because so many people are ""afraid"" of her even though she's a low ranking administrative assistant. She creates a hostile work environment for everyone working there."
bad,"- A typical day starts with morning meetings "
bad,Challenging.  I don't use a lot of words. It depends on which department you work in. 
bad,"TIAA-CREF has a history of boutique services. Unfortunately the culture is infused by the history and “one-of” solutions are the norm rather than exception. This means a lot of manual processes that are difficult to streamline and automate. With the last several years of economic turmoil, the drive for cost-savings has meant staff reductions and now most departments are understaffed and employees are burnt out."
bad,"Reorg after reorg with the common thread of self motivated, protect your bonus at all costs management at the helm.  "
bad,"The company does not hire based on merit, skill, or knowledge. It thinks ""diversity"" and ""inclusion"" are the only things that matter.  The interview process is a joke. Every job including entry level positions requires 3-4 unnecessary interviews.  Interview questions are all situational based. Interviews are solely for show. Recruiters and hiring managers know who they are going to hire prior to the interview process being completed.  Hiring is largely based on visual differences of the applicant.  Management is not empowered and they for the most part do little if anything to aid in your personal development or career advancement. Management is very passive aggressive. No one is direct or honest. The products, systems, and processes are archaic.  Avoid making any suggestions or providing any input as you will be seen as a detractor and you will be blackballed for promotions even if you provide great ideas and constructive actionable feedback.  Also the value system that they supposedly possess and instill in everyone is complete nonsense as no one is ever held accountable for anything which they may do that contradicts the beliefs."
bad,"The job pays well overall and the workload is not too heavy most days.  Most of the team spends about half the day socializing with one another so it makes for a pretty laid back job to be completely honest.  It is definitely one of the easier jobs I've had in terms of how hard I have to work. "
bad,I would not recommend TIAA for Wealth Management Advisors who want to be able to think on your own and run your own business. This position is very micromanaged and very data entry driven. It is hard core sales. Not much support. Work life balance is non existent if you are to make your goals.
bad,A good place to work especially if you don't want to be original or unique in approach to the business.  Punch the clock and cash the check and let someone else worry about the problems.
bad,Company touts a non-profit image but is very much in the business of trying to create revenue. HIgh pressure place with unrealistic demands and expectations. They pay fairly decent but goals arent relative to opportunities.
bad,The operation function of the company underwent  a huge transformation implementing many process improvements that focused on better serving the needs of the many clients and internal business partners.
bad,Will Update this section at a later time. Firm is undergoing huge transformation and is a very difficult work environment.

bad,Did a great job of micromanaging you
bad,"Things are great there until you realize that the management doesn't really care about you, especially the C level management. It's probably going to only get worse up there."
bad,The work day is a very fast pace. You alway keep busy.  I have learn a great deal since I been with the company. In my department the management is not fair. The reason I'm saying is because the manager is friends with  almost everyone on the team. And it's very hard for them be fair with other team members. The hards part of my job it seem it's not enough time in the day to get everything done. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I get along with my team and other people outside of my department. And upper management alway make sure that you can always get more job experience. By letting you go to different type of work shops.
bad,"Execute marketing campaigns using internal applications that contain consumer and marketing information."
good,I had worked at Schwab as a Series 7 broker- call center- before joining Tiaa.  Much more variety in dealing with customers from all walks of life and all age groups at Schwab.  The calls I got at TIAA only dealt with getting cash out of retirement plans for teachers and medical people.  investments in were limited to only annuity funds and mutual funds.
good,The move to India was a chaotic disorganized mess that created risk and pressure to mid level managers like me. The C level leaders where in disarray after the Chief Digital Officer took much of their responsibilities. Lots of mismanaged change that created a terrible work environment.
good,"TIAA has a reputation as a great firm that follows its mission...but it is more like the Hotel California song - you can check-out but you don't have to leave.  Unfortunately, the mindset that you can just coast on by under the radar for years at a time is not only tolerated, but rewarded.  "
good,"I moved to Denver and had positive thoughts about the company. My experience at the Denver location was a very bad experience.  Maybe part of my bad experience was that I do not like Denver.  I do not like the culture of most Denverite lifestyles. I enjoyed my 9-5 job worklife on the east coast at my former job and being required to be at work from 7 am to 4:30 with a mandatory hour lunch was ridiculous. The atmosphere was boring and monotonous. The management was the worst part of the job. It was such a joke, I could not take the company seriously and I ended up moving out of that city. The management was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to experience working in downtown Denver and realizing Colorado is not a place I enjoy."

good,"I started working there as a contractor. I became ful time after 3 years. They don't treat their entry level people well. There's a lot of in fighting, gossip, and blaming from the top down. Hard to advance unless you know the right people. Management encourages stressful environment. Recognition for hard work is superficial with nothing to back it up (raises, promotions, etc)."
good,Work life balance is terrible. You draw shifts out of a hat and you are stuck with what you draw. Very little opportunity for advancement. People typically quit before becoming vested. You only work the full first year so you wont have to pay the company for licensing.
good,"You have a large book of clients, most of whom who have be re-assigned from other advisors. There are a lot of changes taking place currently and it should be the best place to work, but the operations processes are outdated and slow."
good,"TIAA-CEF started off as a good place to work.  Due to a CEO change major lay offs occurred almost overnight without warning.  The lay offs made it difficult to feel secure in the workplace for all,"
good,"The firm is in transition, creating a lot change for clients and employees.  The change is necessary but the jury is out on the results.  Good people."
good,Good benefits. Poor management. In order to hit your goals you almost have to work at least 10 hours a day to make up for the lack of management/process. Processing goes out of their way not to get paperwork completed.
good,"Good company to end your career on. Great benefits! Not innovative or forward thinking. Two Businesses: Traditional Pension and Insurance, Wealth Advisors, and Asset Management (nuveen)"
good,"Cref was a difficult company to work through. We were expected to work long hours and create a lot of documentation.  I was responsible for working on a specific project. As a result, I attended meetings specific to that project. It was hard to get information from SMEs, but once you got it, you could run with the project.  The campus was nice, but the way the departments were set up, it made it hard to reach people.  Many were in New York."
good,Did not care about people. Everybody afraid of everything.
good,I was a contracted to work there so it wasn’t the best place. Okay didn’t really get the best training for the job and it was all over the place. Okay Job
good,Adapting to change is an understatement for this company.  Demanding work schedules; poor workplace culture. Favoritism amongst management and poor HR communication.
good,Loved working there until they did some changes to the Managment Team and then I was assigned to a Manager that wasn't as much of a Team player as the previous one.
good,"One time TIAA had an awesome culture & work environment, but over the years it has not lived up to it's values. That's how it was in Marketing."
good,"TIAA has a great mission in providing retirement planning for educators.  They really do try to fulfill that mission with integrity and commitment."
good,The job isn't very challenging but it pays market price.  The process is very convoluted.  The hardest part of the job is that others don't perform theirs.
good,"Most client-facing employees have a strong customer-service orientation. The most difficult parts about working there are that management is weak, the operating systems are anachronistic and the operations department is inconsistent. When Operations receives a form from a client, that form may be processed differently depending on which processor gets the form as well as whether the form is processed in Denver, CO or Charlotte, NC."
good,"Typical day involves meetings with various teams and management, manage the various storage platforms and complete assigned tasks that were assigned to us in a previous work cycle. The job has its pros and cons."
good,"This review is based on working at TIAA in several years ago, so the culture may have improved but the management in the finance and accounting at that time was chaotic and disorganized."
good,Stressful with heavy workload. Some Management needs improvement and recognize hard working employees and need social skills to communicate with different personalities.
good,Pressure.  Too much change.  It's more a CYA type environment.  Not much enjoyment in the job.  Groups tend to work against each other instead of with each other.
good,Management pushes selling products vs. focus on customer needs.  Support is only to sell products and not focus on what is best for clients. Customers
good,The company has gone through many changes and currently is a very competitive but old culture company.  If you are looking for career advancement and a progressive company it is currently transitioning.
good,Internal employees do not have a chance at career growth.Managers are overwhelmed and always chasing conflicting priorities.  A lot of corporate politics.
good,Work culture is evolving into a culture where management does not value the employees or appreciate the work being done.  Management focuses on achieving results at any cost.
good,"TIAA is a great company if you are a full time employee, but not if you are a contractor.  Many projects are delayed and delayed again.  Contractors in Charlotte sit in hotel cubes with 4 people in a cube."
good,"Call center job. Most of my time I was resetting passwords. Not great for building a resume if you would like to advance in careers that require real financial analysis. Job sold as a sales oriented job with a merit based bonus structure, THIS IS NOT THE CASE. "
good,"A typical day at Tiaa-Cref was a very fast pace and intense job placement. I answered multiple phone lines, dispatched officers to appropriate locations, dealt with medical emergencies on a daily basis. I was Administrative Assistant to Corporate Security."
good,The managers are horrible and do not look out for their employees. The company is to top heavy and does not recognize the people on the bottom doing all the work.
good,My typical day would start by reviewing with our production team on what happened the night before. If there was an issue they could not resolve i would be task to work on that issue. I learned how to manage many different projects. i enjoyed working with my co-workers very much. The hardest part of my job was being on call 24/7 and being the go to person. it seemed that i got called for everyting. The best part of my job was working with others and designing solutions that would make our Database systems better.
good,"TIAA CREF could be a better place to work. The positives that were there in the past have been replaced. The company used to be employee friendly and a great place to work and it still has it's advantages, but nothing like it used to be."
good,TIAA's culture is Making a Difference.  The benefits are exceptional.  Their 401K match is above average.  The Client Intelligence Unit is very different from the rest of the company - poor leadership.
good,Employees are really engaged and are open to assisting others. TIAA has their own way doing things and the learning curve for most positions are about 18 months to two years.
good,"They are transitioning a lot. They are not sure if they know how to be a sales company, but they want to sell. They are ultra conservative. They just closed the entire life insurance part of the business."
good,"TIAA is very different today compared to a few years ago. A non-profit with multiple billions of dollars in managed assets has driven the company to lose some of its core cultural attributes. Today, it is like working for any other investment company."
good,"Productive and fun workplace with indoor games. Long working hours. Free breakfast and lunch in incubation centre during joining."
good,"Small company with very closed culture.  Compensation and benefits are excellent for an analyst, but management needs improvement.  Small company with very closed culture may not be the best work environment for many."
good,"TIAA ran on antiquated systems and had very archaic processes when I worked there. Direct management tried to make the job easier for Consultants, but the system limitations and extensive rules made helping the customer a challenge."
good,The changes were too constant and it made it difficult to maintain a high level of accuracy.  Interesting company to work for at the right time. I wish they recycled!
good,"TIAA is a great place to work as long as you're not in operations. Operations is treated with less respect and zero chance of advancement, unless you stay in operations. The whole company views operations less than equal business partners. The managers are the absolute worse and are bitter themselves due to the treatment. The goals are unrealistic and provide little hope of ever achieving them. Morale is at an all time low due to the goals and poor leadership. Other areas in TIAA treat their teams with gratitude and appreciation. This shows in their pay and extremely attractive bonuses. Just stay completely away from operations at all cost."
good,"OK Place to work, managers, consultants chemistry, team leads, IT directors, ok place to work and that's all for today's news have a nice day!"
good,Typical day at work includes anything you can think of when it comes to managing a book of business for three advisers.  I have learned to be resourceful and about financial planning in general.  My co-workers are the highlight of my day.  I have worked with my team for a year and some some of my co-workers in previous positions for approximately 3 years.  The hardest part of the job is attempting to appease management while taking care of your clients.   The clients are generally understanding and patient which is really helpful.
good,"Very specific products, knowledge practicly not applicable else where. You can learn the job without having any specific background."
good,Title pretty much says it. Best part of the job is the people we are upgrading for are friendly and understanding.
good,I learned a lot about team work and knowledge sharing being critical to the team's success.
good,"computers and operating infrastructure is archaic, at best, which is frustrating when the quality of your work and level of service is dependent on your ability to navigate through the systems on a pc that is slower than my x286 from back in the day. Overall, the benefits don't outweigh any proposed level of ""change"" that always seems to be discussed, but never implemented."
good,"very busy & productive, not teamwork oriented. I learned a new system for processing stock and mutual funds transfers. The management on levels are open and fair. The hardest part of the job was working in an environment that did not encourage teamwork. The most enjoyable part of the job was completing assignments."
good,"When i first started working here it was a great company to work for. Great benefits, good pay, relaxed yet productive work environment. Over the last two years they have implimented a production system that does not fit the needs of the company and requires the employees to compensate, they have raised the costs of benefits, lowered our pay scales, and implimented what they call ""lean"" production. Lean production is strictly numbers and quality based and does not accurately reflect realistic human capabilities. Over all I was happy to start working here, now I will be happy to move on."
good,"Working at TIAA was a pleasure for a long time. The company's commitment to their core values was something I was proud of. In recent months, new leadership had come in and changed the culture of the company to something that no longer aligns. I planned to retire from this company. Now, I'm not sure if I can't last another week."
good,"You will be taking 25-30 inbound calls a day, from often upset and angry customers.  When it is busy season you may take up to 45-50 calls.  Of course some of the calls are tense, and the customers are angry.  If you are not good at smoothing things over in a tense situation, this may not be the place for you.  If you can take it on the chin however and not let it effect your next call, which is waiting for you the second you hang up the phone, then I would not recommend this job.  All that said, this job does pay very well for what you are doing, and if you make the right relationships you may have a chance for a much easier life than working in a glorified call center.  Additionally the benefits are excellent, including 23 days PTO year one, and 4 months of paternity leave.  People stay for the benefits and the pay, but most people truly dislike their jobs most the time, which is likely the reason they pay so much and they reason people stick around."
good,TIAA is a great company but recent changes and management have made it very stressful and nowhere near the company the founder had in mind. The diversity in higher management is severely lacking.
good,"The systems are old and they don't care about their employees, great culture and great friendships for life.  Management not very transparent. Its been an ok Ride"
good,"Mid management lacks leadership skills.  Executive leadership lacks empathy, is condescending and doesn't understand frontline associates.  Parroting the mantra of inclusion is more important to getting promoted than actually practicing diversity of thought."
good,"There is little opportunity to advance and the same issues are ongoing and were never addressed. They were simply ignored and allowed to happen. The systems were slow and constantly misbehaving. When something was being implemented in the system to advance the working ability, it seemed to do the opposite."
good,TIAA was one of my best experiences in life. It was like I was in college again. The best training in the world... high-performance culture and very committed to their mission.
good,My typical day at work was stressful. I learned how to present topics in many ways to capture everyone's learning style. The managers were not helpful as well as the corporate culture at the firm was very tense. The hardest part of the job was creating projects most employees needed to use and helping all stakeholders with get the material and create final projects that prove the understanding create positive results.
good,TIAA is a company with a great value set and mission but poor execution. Management changes decisions quickly without regard to how it will affect other departments and without any sort of communication about the changes. There is a lot of focus on the future with little regard on how to fix major problems in the present moment.
good,"Excellent benefits."
good,"Fast paced, tough environment. Rewarding pay and benefits! People are fun and pleasant. Beautiful locations. Great CEO and CIO. Great management dedicated to the customers."
good,"TIAA is a great company with wonderful work-life balance and office atmosphere."
good,Employees are great to work with and very supportive.  Some areas in the company are better to work in than others.  Operations and Wealth Management teams are good to their employees.  CEO is a big believer in communications to employees and meets regularly with employees in town hall meetings.
good,"I worked a lot of OT but they constantly had mandatory pre and post shift OT with shortened lunches. 8 to 6 with a 30 minute lunch and 2 15 minute breaks ( morning and afternoon) was my normal schedule. My lunch and breaks were constantly changing it was like hitting the lottery if you got a lunch at a normal time."
good,"Not much to complain about however if you do not find your own projects to latch onto you will have no work to do. Very drab, grey looking offices as well."
good,"-a typical day of work is full of emails and follow ups"
good,"** Assisting customers w/ their financial investments."
good,Textbook project management was non-existent as it related to projects. More time was spent on planning an out-of-country wedding than was spent on baseline source version control and project implementation schedules leading to much confusion and unexpected results during implementation. Incorrectly modified source programs had been passed from non-employee contractors to the project team employees as if they were baseline stable source programs. Needless to say there were unnecessary problems encountered during the implementation phase without any knowledge of changes. Only one project manager on the floor had actually successfully completed a project management course and received a CPM designation prior to relocation layoffs in the last six months.
good,"Was not a pleasant place to work over the past several years, although benefits and pay were good. Has management issues."
good,"The company has good benefits, but lacks any innovation.  They do not invest much in technology and their investment products are way outdated.  I was there in 2014 and they just had started investing in derivatives."
good,"Nice convenient location, offering a covered parking garage in a quaint village-type setting.  Flexible hours, generous paid time off, and good benefits."
good,"A transparent environment, everyone is made aware about the decisions and the reasoning behind it. It works like a democratic environment, which hinders into making decisions quickly. But since the industry is in the retirement space, maybe that the prudent choice."
good,"They release all work from home positions after more than 6 years.  Wanted everyone to return to hub, but would not pay for relocation after 21 years in the company"
good,"There has been a frequent binge of sending jobs to India so the culture is getting a little toxic. "
good,"Call center entry level position."
good,"TIAA pays more than just about any firm in the Charlotte area but it comes with a price. Having just crossed the hundred year anniversary of the company, many of the applications are complex, outdated, and essential to the company. There is also a lot of churn and reorganizations that make getting things done very difficult, especially in IT. I am glad I spent the 4 years there that I did, but I don't know if I would do it again. Leadership can also be an issue when deciding important decisions."
good,TIAA is a good company. The employee retirement plan has a good match. The fund line up in the 401K has also improved after an employee lawsuit. The company is a not for profit.
good,TIAA was going through major changes during my time.  They were reducing staff in NY while moving to a new location in the south east of the united states.  They were also going through a lot of changes at the senior management level.
good,Very good place to work depending on the department you work for. The culture has changed a great deal but still its a good place to work and I don't regret ever working there.
good,"Daily - it's been high-paced, work looked over daily by management. Culture - hard work can get over-looked, feedback should be looked at more. Learned - broad spectrum of things related to finance."
good,I do not care to review this company.  I am only interested in posting through Indeed.com.  This section is just a placeholder to meet the minimum required words.
good,Great company with excellent benefits. The company tries very hard to provide the lowest cost to its clients and is competitive and honest with how it presents it's investments.
good,Brought in to conduct all facets of fund accounting.  As the assignment progressed the staff was introduced to converting the accounting system out of TIAA-CREF to State Street Bank.  I was able to draw on my previous experience to facilitate the project.
good,No respect to each other and worked in small team and micromanagement. No career growth and no work life balance. Latest tools and enterprise standards followed.
good,"The management team I work with was pretty good. However, the accommodations provided for an IT employee (I was a contractor), not so much. A better work environment would be a positive."
good,Very structured environment. Customer focused in nature.  Not an organization that embraces change or new ideas very quickly.  Very disjointed among the various departments.  It's almost like each department is it's own separate company.
good,"Very traditional corporate atmosphere. Staff and management were like many companies, some good, some not so good. It was a good place to work and I learned a great deal."
good,"Overall a good place to work.  A little sleepy and little slow to compensate, but a great training ground to gain substantial expertise in related fields."
good,"Its a great place to work if you can handle stress well, constant change, and deadlines have to be met daily along with SLA agreements for certain processes. An Eco pass is offered at a discounted price."
good,"Its been a few years since I worked at TIAA but I left because of the leadership in my department, and the high stress environment they've created. I would suggest doing your research before joining the firm - not all departments have the same culture described."
good,"I have absolutely nothing to say about tiaa i was going through a stressful time in mu life whil I was working there"
good,Great interpersonal skills and relationship management which were very instrumental regarding my success with TIAA. Being a team player was another tremendous attribute in getting the job done.
good,This job was fun you was always on the move from building to building the downside was the workers have been there longer would always hate on the new temp workers afraid you might take this spot because they wasn't doing that job correctly and been there too long and thought they owned the company haters I'll call them
good,The workplace is great. It is a team environment and  a very positive place to work. Not very much opportunity for growth. The only way to grow is leave the company and come back later when a better opportunity has presented itself.
good,There was little to no projects in this department and there were so many management changes that it was hard to keep up. I respect the company but feel changes are needed in this area.
good,"I have not worked for TIAA for almost 10 years, but during my time new competition was entering the market and TIAA was not ready. They were not nimble and management was in disarray. For a friend that worked there 3 years ago, not much had changed. Could be great now. Ask lots of questions."
good,Little respect for production level employees.  Keep your head down and don't ask questions.  No creativity or collaborative culture present  Top down management style
good,"collaborative atmosphere"
good,If you can produce results and prove your worth this is not a place you can advance in your career. The only advancement is given to those employees that are in the manager's clicks. Promotions are not given on results but on who the manager's believe is most like them in which they like them better.
good,Good working experience and a great knowledge learning experience and a very encouraging team.  Testing and developing scripts across applications using selenium
good,"Since 1918, we've helped millions of people like you build secure financial futures. It's because we understand and specialize in the financial needs of people who work in the academic, government and nonprofit fields."
good,"The Bank has a very difficult culture than the enterprise.  There is not enough staff, people are micromanaged and there is very little support provided to colleagues."
good,"The environment there was great, especially dealing with your peers which is always helpful. Management was up and down. Overtime was available. There was a lot of training."
good,"Management was unorganized and didn't know how to manage work or how to assign correct people to support which components.  "
good,Great company focused on their mission. Competitive pay and benefits are better than any I have seen or know of. People are very professional and they groom their people to succeed.
good,Pay and benefits are comparable to the industry. But because of attrition there is not a lot of work-life balance and a great deal of uncertainties.
good,Great organization for working parents depending on role. Somewhat of a laid back environment. Plenty to learn while working.
good,Days are always 8+ hours.  Some departments allow work from home.  Some really great people.  Complex work environment with some duplication of efforts and teams working at cross purposes due to lack of communication across departments
good,"I think a lot has changed since I left, but think it is a steady place to work with a decent set of benefits.  Think now they are a bit more aggressive and market-driven than the sleepy pension fund attitude."
good,"My day starts with login into my Account."
good,"Average company, they tend to use your energy against you. epically if your young. a lot of work for little pay"
good,"Processing retirement payments as requested by the participant, via OMNI system.  Managing retirees' request for their funds greatly enhanced my acknowledge of the payout of funds, as well as the tax implications.  "
good,its a small quiet company but has leaps and bounds planned ahead is a great place to wrk
good,"High level of stress, management left a lot to be desired due to excessive overtime request and overload of emails and procedure changes that often did not work"
good,Its long and hard but its my job and i do it to the fullest. Some days are better then others. The people are very friendly and are always there to help. The job has great team members.
good,Good place to work but long hours are expected. Employees on call 24/7.
good,Financial services company trying to reinvent itself.  Good benefits including generous number of vacation days.
good,Very busy working with internal and external clients daya to day needs
good,Its a big company and huge setup in charlotte.
good,A good company to work for if not in front of the client. The support roles for the WMA position are quick to offer help/guidance but the follow thru from the support people is spotty. You could work with someone knowledgeable and do fine but they are growing quickly and you will probably work with someone new like yourself and that becomes difficult.
good,learned about retirement requirements/ mdo payments and ipro payouts to retirees
good,"Company not appreciative of a young perspective. As an Intern I was promised an extension and then when I met with my boss a few weeks later, he did not remember me agreeing to it. If you do not work in IT or have 5-10 years experience in any related field, this is not the company for you."
good,Very structured and process driven organization that makes day to day activities easy to manage
good,"The distance one way to work was 98 miles, sometimes taking 2-4 hours. Once at work I would log in to my computer system and start taking calls. The contacts could be from anywhere in the U.S. and I would provide retirement service to the customers. Assisting them with their retirement needs, form completion and selection of investment securities. I am licensed in life and health insurance, variable annuities, 63, 6, and 26. One of the hardest part of the jobs is bringing in money, getting people to start new investments or transfer their retirement accounts to TIAA-CREF. Ensuring that people receive exemplary service and make sensible investments."
good,Established my career at this organization. Thankful to have been given the opportunity to work there.  Great group of people who became more than just co-workers.
good,"The company offers some of the best benefits and has a pension plan which is 100% after 3 years of employment. Other than that, I'm not going to bad mouth the company, just looking for more than what I'm currently receiving."
good,"-A typical day at work includes receiving phone calls from participants that need help with updating their file, or need help with their financial goals."
good,TIAA is a great company to work for as far as the culture and continued employee loyalty.  Reorganizations can be distracting but change is normal. Recently the alternative work space option was done away with so required employees that work remotely to go into the office daily - many employees did not live near and office and took the option provided to look elsewhere and many talented employees left.
good,Certain areas are more toxic than others such as finance and marketing.  Still has a culture of helping out in the community but has become less so over time.
good,"What once was a great company with a great mission is no more.   Greed and need to survive in competitive financial services landscape has led the company to lose sight of its mission and if you are not on board with the new mission of pushing products, and selling at all costs with no regard for ethics and the client, then you are managed to the margins.  The NY Times article was completely true and set the company scrambling a little over a year ago.   The CEO went on a PR tour but it was nothing more than lip service.   Fortunately or unfortunately the masses have short memories.   The culture has changed for the worse, not the best and continues to do so, as it does away with work remotely options and generous paid time off policy."
good,It was wonderful experience working with the team here i gained a lot of  knowledge on lighting and the team was very aggressive they use to finish the task with in the time.
good,"TIAA offers many challenges and rewards to those who demonstrate and exhibit tenacity, strong work ethic and business acumen, integrity, changes in a face-paced and dynamic work environment."
good,"TIAA is a good company depending on what department you work in. Work life balance does not apply to everyone. I came into this company  excited and ready to learn and work hard only to not have anything to do and whatever I did do was not challenging. There is a lack of growth opportunity, not enough to learn and figure out a development path. After going through this for a few years I feel I've given this situation enough time to change so I'm looking to leave."
good,"Organization has great potential - culture, values, benefits, and compensation are unlike other large corporation. However, the pace is often frantic with little to no prioritization - so there is a feeling of ""cart before horse,"" in many circumstances. Though the D&I is a leading charge in the organization, LOTS of decisions are still made in silos, often lessening advancement opportunities for certain demographics."
good,Typical day at work included managing an organized workflow of the Participants and the Beneficiaries  financial profiles.  The most challenging part of the job duties were to focus on the time managing of each profile.
good,"A little background on TIAA-CREF; at the time I was hired, there was a sense of panic that was communicated in state of business meetings.  TIAA-CREF had a stronghold on the education and medical retirement plan arena and due to government deregulation, TIAA-CREF lost their monopoly.  The company was hemorrhaging assets and my role was to retain and build back lost balances.   I had some success but the salary plus bonus didn't keep me engaged because I didn't feel the direct correlation between my labor and a bonus pool based a gray math.  It wasn't a long-term fit for me, I didn't feel energized to be at work."
good,"I worked for TIAA-CREF for many years. Like most companies this company has kept up with the changes required to build a successful Organization. The company's benefit package which includes salary was quite attractive in former days. For the majority of my life there, my experience has equipped me to understand many aspects of real life challenges, including budgeting, preparing for my senior years, family and being able to control my life. My last manager really worked with us on Job Work/Life Balance. She was empathetic but ensured that our job was executed in timely manner, the quality had to good and coached us to deliver the best quality within the allotted or before the turn around time. Today, with the changing world, Management had to make decisions that were not always favorable to all workers. Cost to serve was one of the main topics and many changes had to take place. This may have caused some tension, however, if you maintained good working habits ( quality & productivity) then there was some assurance that your job was secured. No Organization could promise its workers retention, raises, bonuses to name a few that was previously enjoyed. The years of working with TIAA-CREF have given me family and friends that are lifelong. I am thankful to TIAA-CREF for the benefits and opportunities given to me. The feeling of serving the clients and hearing them say to you,  ""TIAA-CREF will continue to manage my money and render thanks for clarifying their questions made for an enjoyable day and satisfaction. Wishing TIAA-CREF many more years, having founded in 1918. I miss"
good,A typical day at work with company great learning experience inside the company learned extra while there good benefits
good,Good organization as a whole. Good benefits. Good people. Interesting work. Lots of organizational layers that can lead to feeling of being micro-managed.
good,"Provide a distinctive service experience, tailored to the unique needs of High Net Worth clientele."
good,Learned a lot about retirement rules and term date requirements
good,"I've been with Teachers for awhile, I've known the company to be a family oriented, friendly, optimistic company, but now it has become a low morale, and hungry money grabbing organization. The benefits are great, but advancement is not there."
good,"People were great to work with.  Great benefits - medical, vision etc.  On-site doctor/nurse."
good,The company has a good reputation with the client base it has built over the years and the products and services are strong. Management is weak with several managers looking out for their own agenda rather than those they manage. It also not an ideal environment to grow your career and forget about job security.
good,The company has great retirement benefits. The quality of your work and work/life balance are mainly going to depend on which organization you are in and what your manger is like
good,"I support what TIAA says they stand for, I just don't see managers supporting employees equally and fairly.  Favoritism and retaliation are overlooked."
good,The asset management side is constantly changing which means restructuring and layoffs about every 6 months.  Overall TIAA company offers more stability and incredible benefits.
good,The role with the field is great but the uncertainty of business direction and the lack of acknowledgement they are a sales organization is detrimental.  They push clients hard but do get a ton of info from them.  offerings are limited but decent.
good,It's a company based on finance and MONEY. It's not the warm feeling that you get from the major banks in the area. It's a cold feeling and not really welcoming. But; The starting pay is more then competitive. Probably the best in Charlotte. You can LEARN a lot about finance and all the resources and tools are there for you. The retirement plan is the BEST i've seen so far. It really depends on what you want to get.
good,"The corporate culture is very performance driven.  For some people keeping up with the changing metrics could be stressful. Regretably, there is old guard middle management in place for years and the chances for advancement may depend on your network within the company."
good,I worked more than 8 hours on a daily basis.  Most people worked at night and on weekends on a regular basis.  Implementing a new work improvement was time consuming and took months to years.
good,"Was a great firm to be a part of 10 years ago in the IT field. Somewhat antiquated and unique processes, hardware and methodology where process improvements were easily applied.  Massive data amounts, lots of hours beyond 40 per week, outsourcing IT to India, direction of IT uncertain. Training is at mgr's approval although company's policy to promote training. "
good,"Casual atmosphere with management that truly cares about work/life balance, but compensation is at or below industry standard and mobility in a large firm can be tough."
good,"The company is losing ground on clients. Fidelity, Vanguard and others are capturing clients because of better service, products and ease of use."
good,Overall this is a good company to work at.  The benefits are good and the work life balance is fair.  If you work here you will gain a lot of hands on experience due to the manual nature of everything.
good,tend to hire over qualified people for the financial consultant role. its is glorified customer service in a call center. do not take job unless you are okay working in an inbound call center with scheduled breaks and lunches and aht. heavily managed schedule.
good,It can be a great place for the later part of your career. I would caution anyone who is looking to start or develop their career.
good,It's a good company but very sleep and conservative. Not a lot of career progression and limited mobility opportunities. Feels a bit like working in higher education versus a private company.
good,"Review and process investment withdrawal and transfer requests. Determine eligiability, make outreach to clients and/or institutions for verifications. "
good,"TIAA-CREF has been very good to me these past 14+ years. I have enjoyed the variety of duties I've had as an a Senior Admin Assistant. The most enjoyable part has been being kept very busy supporting VP's, Directors, Managers and the hundreds of staff they have."
good,A typical workday is assisting and guiding clients with there investment choices.
good,"TIAA-CREF was a great, stable place when I started there 4 years ago. Compensation is competitive. Great retirement benefits. Great benefits."
good,Lots of job stress on a daily basis with mandetory overtime and shortened lunch breaks required often.
good,"The daily client interactions and work load kept me busy and I loved it. But there were constant changes due to the company not knowing how to operate, which caused the employees to have a negative outlook that became contagious."
good,Great idea. Poor execution.
good,"I really admire the CEO of the organization and I think the mission and the vision of the organization are what attracts and retains employees for the most part. There is a definite miscalculation when it comes to communicating the value of internal human capital, compensating employees for long term loyalty and developing high performing internal candidates. Work/life balance can be great unless you work in a department where the workload is completely unmanageable and lately, it seems like that is every department."
good,"I was given the opportunity to acquire insurance licenses for all states."
good,Company going on 100 years offering much needed services to clients.  Great deal of change in preparation for the next century.  Systems are still behind those of other firms I have worked at.
good,Good company with great benefits. Work/Life balance is great. A good company to start your career and grow. Compensation is competitive with top of the line benefits.
good,"I looked forward to being at work each day. Each day presented you with tasks that were challenging, you had the resources to get the job done. Management was supportive of the projects as managers had an open door policy to help the project run smoothly.  Criticisms were constructive and co workers were quite cooperative. Everyone's goal was to see that the project was successful. This made the job easy and a lot of fun."
good,"Very collegial environment, relatively decent compensation, but not much of a culture that encourages new thoughts or innovation."
good,Benefits are good. Easy to get to know people in different departments once you are in the company.
good,Company had history labor law violations relating to overtime compensation.  Management incompetent and lazy.  Systems outdated and inefficient.
good,"The company has great benefits and compensation. Some managers are better than others however, HR as a whole is fantastic! Everyone is so helpful and supportive- great team work."
good,"My role as Sr Director of Data Distribution required multiple responsibilities, since ""Everything Involves Data"". I created and implemented a Data Quality program for public and private investment assets, I was responsible for vendor relations and keeping market data cost low. I was responsible for implementing a trading system and data management strategy. I also was a key member of the Enterprise Data Stewardship team."
good,People are terrific and the benefits are excellent.  Long work hours required for the job make work life balance hard.  Management does not  listen when advice is given regarding improving the work flow.
good,"TIAA-CREF is a great company to be apart of, unless you are in operations"
good,"Working on behalf of a group who worked hard to be among the sharpest, smartest participants in the street.  Striving to achieve the best returns for its funds participants yield a job that had purpose.  Gathering market updates and data from overnight exchanges in order to translate how domestic markets were going to open gave work something different every day.  There were many, many layers of management, while mine was accessible, most were pulled into different directions making decision making and approval somewhat of a daily challenge.  Great employee benefits but there was a negative correlation between workload/hours and compensation.  The hardest part of the job was getting approval for decisions that required timely responses and the daily commute  The most enjoyable part of the job was the purpose and the mission and having the opportunity to work along some of the brightest individuals in the business."
good,I was hired 3 1/2 years ago as 6 months contract to hire. TIAA_CREF never fulfilled their promise.
good,"Scan many files from customers and analyze and  read many letters, documents that needed to be processed. Special codes was entered for the underwriters needed to process the files and distributed."
good,"Great company too work for, but be prepared for long hours and often times dictatorial management.  Many Wealth Management Advisers  burn out after 3 to 4 years. High number of resignations after annual bonuses are paid.  Customers are great to work with as the target market is the secondary education market for retirement planning and in some markets, state employees, so the clients are well educated and eager to plan for their retirement.  The high caliber of the clients and the other WMA's you work with are the best part of the job."
good,Very good benefits and pay.  Always treated fairly by co workers and management.  left as part of an early retirement incentive otherwise I would still be there today.
good,"As a contractor it was a nice place to work, although the management changes often. Wonderful campus and people are very professional.I wish I had full time opportunity to work for TIAA."
good,"Good company with excellent investment, annuity and insurance products. The company has a strong commitment to the financial well-being of its participants."
good,Somone dropped the ball here. No work came to my department. When we received work everyone was complete by 10 am. My department was created and then upper management decided to close the department after 16 months. Everyone was laid off.
good,"Overall I really like the people I work with every day, management is not always the best.  The culture has taken a turn for the bad and it is hard to grow."
good,"Excellent company, unfortunately I was layed off due to corporate restructuring. Great work environment. Average pay, however great retirement/pension."
good,"Trying to get there, but consistently make poor decisions. Lots of change, much of which has been well identified and executed by the ceo. However leadership at many other key levels is poor"
good,Not an ideal department for fresh graduates. Manual paper pushing job. Description was misleading. Office was beautiful and had it's own cafe. Ability to openly communicate to all levels of business
good,"Pros"
good,"This is a great organization however there work life balance has a void.  They have parts of the organization that want to meet all day long.  Meetings on top of meetings on top of meetings.  Unfortunately that leaves employees to either do the work at night at home, stay in the office late to get the work done, or continue to fall behind.  "
good,Great place to grow but the benefits are not good as they were acquired by a new company TIAA. I learned a lot in this company. Very easy going.......
good,Great company with excellent benefits and opportunity for growth.  Encourages and provides employee career growth and guidance.  Provides training for career goals.
good,"After a huge re-organization, the IT management changed, laying off hundreds of great people that had a lot of knowledge."
good,"Lower to middle management is poorly trained, if trained at all. Likely to have a new manager every year. Co-workers are ranked against one another, which creates a competitive work environment, which could prove to be beneficial, but many times leads to interpersonal issues. Worst part of the job is managing ever-changing Goals and Metrics as well as ever-changing management. Most enjoyable part of the job is that the employer is very charity-oriented and tries to promote a culture of giving back to the community."
good,"IT division has been working hard to catch up and surpass industry standards."
good,"The most enjoyable part of being on the  the Imaging Production Support Triage team is the variety of issues that could arise and working with the people in the various departments we support. I really enjoy being the 'go to' person for many of my peers.  "
good,TIAA-CREF is continually struggling to break-out of it's not-for-profit heritage and become a competitive firm. Customers are intensely loyal with breeds an 'entitlement' attitude among long-term employees -- they feel entitled to their customers without having to continually earn that loyalty (kinda like a public utility company).
good,"receive calls and Demonstrated proficient ability to quickly diagnose, troubleshoot and resolve client issues. Provided efficient customer service to 50+ end-users per"
good,"rewarding work.  low pay. no job advancement opportunities.  hire from outside.  reorganizations every couple of years"
good,"thirteen yrs perm FTE + one previous yr contract (6 mos, ext another 6 mos), free to transfer internally, work-from-home option available (but I didn't choose that)"
good,"You will be hard pressed to find a position that has better pay and benefits.  The retirement plan is very attractive.  It is disappointing that so much time and energy is spent on non-business related items (reconfiguration of the office space, PTO policy, elimination of the work from home option etc."
good,"TIAA has provided me with a great income to take care of my family for 19 years but with change comes layoffs for continued growth. That's why I'm no longer there..."
good,The most enjoyable part of my day was the nice colleagues I've grown very fond of. Folks tend to have a positive attitude and are always willing to help or give opportunities to learn and grow.
good,"Keeps always busy with too many meetings and over expectations."
good,"typical day involves multiple meetings, numerous reports to senior management; important to develop relationships for advancement; the people were great to work with"
good,"The call center is mundane with strict rules regarding PTO, and mandatory over time. The IT department has a lot of autonomy with regards to projects."
good,"I enjoyed working here. Great work environment, plenty of learning opportunities,management and other employees provide a great work atmosphere. Thankful."
good,"TIAA is a great place to work, very diverse and inclusive culture, lots of growth opportunities.  A little bit slow and old school culture wise, great people though."
good,"Friendly, place to work, great benefits and perks.  Can be stressful at time but also very rewarding.  Company also offers pension as well as 401k with match."
good,TIAA was created to take care of teachers in retirement. Inspiring mission to teach the teachers (and/or doctors and nurses) how to prepare for future financial wellness.
good,"4-5 Hours work per day."
good,Where most companies have automated everything these days... 100% of our back office processing is manual.  The company has a great heart and there's great people working here but we make lots of mistakes bc everything we do is complicated and manual.  The folks in charge just won't spend the money needed to bring the company into the 21st century.  It's hard to take good care of clients when the company handicaps it's employees.
good,It is nice to work & lot to learn about annuities & retirement work part. learned about enrollment. Workplace culture looks good & enjoyable to work..
good,"Hi, i never faced a typical day at my work place, i learned lot of new things including technologies, the management is superb, we use have good fun, hangouts in the weekend,thanks."
good,"I'm grateful for the 4 1/2 years I worked at TIAA. I worked from home for over half the duration of my contract. I wasn't working for the company directly, but was a contract worker through a staffing agency. I gained a lot of experience doing web content management: building and editing web pages in Fatwire. I also performed a lot of admin/clerical work for the team as well. I'd say that my experience with the company was a great one. They are very successful and are continuing to grow."
good,"Overall I appreciate the opportunity to work at TIAA (Operations Department) serious issues between Management and Employees,  constant change in procedure, long work hours sometimes, competitive pay, great benefits with multiple options."
good,"Good company to work for. If you work in CO, or NC there are more opportunities to grown with in the company. nothing more ......................................................................"
good,Was a good working environment with work from home options. The managers were good and a lot of opportunity to grow. The jobs are demanding and we have to get used to it ourselves.
good,"I was fortunate enough to work here for 17 years in several different positions. During my time there, I enjoyed my jobs most of the time, I had the opportunity to build my skill set and apply my skills.  The current environment and culture is different from when I started; while I am not adverse to change, much of the change was due to the challenging business climate.  I would strongly recommend the company to someone that finds a position that matches what they are looking for."
good,"TIAA provides up to $8000 per year in tuition reimbursement which will help further your education. The company is a good place to work, they have some challenges in making things easy for the customer. Processes are antiquated, yet it is a very established company."
good,TH Real Estate is a new company formed from Henderson Global Investors and TIAA CREF. Its is a property fund managers and I work on the AP team
good,"Tiaa is a big organization having an excellent architecture and multiple applications, this project is a very good learning experience for me."
good,Great company to work for.  Management puts a lot into putting their employees in a position to be successful.  Unlimited growth potential.
good,Good overall company.  However there is Lots of change in the organization.  Trying to do too much with too little which causes stress with work/home balance.  My opinion is that 2015-2016 will be difficult years for the company
good,"Great place to work that serves great people.  TIAA-CREF has been around since 1918, and  is uniquely positioned to serve their market."
good,I like the mission and the purpose of the company and what it stands for.  The Charlotte campus is also amazing.
good,"Great management team. "
good,The daily assignments were sometimes overwhelming and monotonous.  There were occasions that the tempo would change and you'd be expected to work on special assignments. Lots of meetings....
good,"Partnering with associates to define requirements, while planning and executing tasks to achieve project deliverable."
good,"It's a great opportunity, they are quick to train and put you on the phones. You have to make sure that you learn quick because managers are always in meetings and you have to run around a lot to get answers. Although I heard that it's common for call centers. So if you are good in reading a lot of information it's a great job for you. Everyone there has been there long enough to answer any questions and it is definitely a nice work environment. It's a lot of information but you do it on every call so you get use to it."
good,"The roots in the company are non-profit, currently reflected in the . dedication of the organization and it's employees to provide financial support to individuals that serve others ensuring that they are financially stable in their retirement. "
good,"Great people, Not much structure. The people I work with are great, however the company has not laid out many best practices or processes to follow in managing work. This can cause a lot of chaos. "
good,"During my contracting work there, I had access to a superior line of product to work on.  It was a casual environment but always professional."
good,"One of the best as large corporate environments.  Training was extraordinary as were benefits and opportunity for advancement.  Highly talented employees, professional and ethical.  "
good,"Behind on technology, they stress the skill level of their people to compensate. It can make you feel needed but without the assistance of tools to help, mistakes are common and become stressful."
good,Very good reputation in the financial services industry. TIAA-CREF has been around for decades assisting clients with their financial portfolios.
good,Stable company with room for growth; extensive client base
good,Love to work with TIAA CREF. This is place place where i had time to learn and implement.
good,"My tenure @ TIAA was good, but I got sick of the layers of Management. No one will make a decision & will always try to throw somebody under the bus...."
good,"Long hours, but fulfilling work"
good,GREAT pension.  Some leaders exhibited great leadership skills.  There was one IT leader who was very abrasive.  The CEO was soft spoken and exemplified what he wanted clients to see.
good,The was great to work for with excellent benefits. Poor management in the Operations Department. Promotions were dictated by the Sr. Director. He hand picked who he wanted in certain positions. It wasn't about what you knew but who you knew.
good,"- I learned how to write materials to explain the functional uses for our financial products."
good,Lots of systems to learn and use. Call center environment. Management is just glad to be off the phones but is responsible for the teams on the phones.
good,"My duties includes: Build and solidify client relationships pre- and post-retirement; leverage unique value proposition; Serve as a relationship manager for high net worth clients of Wealth Management Advisors; Engage existing and potential clients, using Consultative Sales Practice ( CSP), and needs-based approach to financial planning and advice; identify value-added products and services for clients; and identify and acquire client assets held outside; developing additional business and adding to books of business proactively and through referrals. Conduct client engagement in the absence of their Wealth Management Advisors/Senior Advisors; Make proactive communications with clients and follows up on appointments; Execute client transaction requests, such as implementing advice recommendations."
good,"Nice company and I learned a lot but you need to take full advantage of opportunities. Networking is imperative especially because the management tends to change a lot. With good management you can go far but be transparent about what you want to do. If you can shadow others take advantage of that as well."
good,"Great private company. Small family feel; great people and culture. I would recommend as a place to work, although, when I was there, they did not allow working from home, which would have allowed for a better work, life balance."
good,"Needs to make some improvements, a bit overly bureaucratic.  Company needs to improve in order to be able to compete with similar companies in its space."
good,"Great place to work and good environment for diversity. TIAA offers many opportunities for career advancement by offering tuition assistance, internships and continuing education courses.  The company makes volunteering and giving to charity a priority and matches all employee giving to whatever charity of their choice. Anyone who is employed at TIAA under the leadership of Roger Fergurson will leave his town halls with a good understanding of the business, products and awareness of your individual contribution to the success of the company. Roger makes each employer feel important regardless of job status."
good,A typical day was in-line with other Fortune 500 experiences over the past two decades. Only caution would be the level of restructuring underway which one could expect to continue for the foreseeable future.
good,Good company with great benefits but leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to work/life balance.  Management is hit or miss depending on area and location you work in.
good,"I worked with a small group of highly professional, dedicated investigators performing all investigative functions for the company. The focus was on the customer first and was a very rewarding position. On a daily basis I would review case progress, network with other directors throughout the company while liaising with local, state a federal investigators and prosecutors."
good,"Company is looking out for the customer.  Good benefits, vacation, teamwork. Lots of meetings and you get accustomed to working in a virtual or distanced environment."
good,"TIAA-CREF is a wonderful place to start a career. In addition to the downtown atmosphere, it is a progressive and caring employer. The people are what make the company. I have learned that retirement readiness is one of the biggest shortfalls in the United States. There are millions of people that do not have enough saved to transition out of employment. "
good,"Each day is unique, presenting it's own challenges and successes.  I've learned the art of compromise and thoughtful risk, in addition to increased confidence when making decisions that touch our thousands of customers.  The hardest part of this job is the constant pressure above the ideal threashold of stress.   "
good,"Longevity, awarding, and advancement to every employee. Honest and reliable company, I would highly recommend to anyone seeking a long-term career."
good,"Nice work place, Good team, helped to learn a lot, team always help"
good,Gathering Incident Reports and assigning to the IT Analyst on the team.  Recording metrics and sending out reports to Senior Management.  I learned the procedures involved in documenting incidents and all different monitoring software used for customers.  Management didn't  micro-manage.  The co-workers displayed excellent Team effort.  The hardest part was assigning the incidents because the criteria changed regularly.  The most enjoyable part of the job was gathering metrics for daily reports being sent to management and stakeholders
good,"I really enjoyed working for TIAA-CREF. T/C is an ethical company, a non-profit, which puts its customers first. There is room for advancement and they hire from within. T/C has a new mentoring program which will encourage management to develop a leadership role with its employees."
good,"The scope and scale of responsibilities of many jobs are broad and on any given day, you can be working on any number of matters, from routine transactional routines to complex strategic planning for multi-year periods."
good,You will have great benefits at this company. The pay is fair but could be better in some areas. Work life balance is great especially if you have a salary position.
good,"TIAA is a special place, where employees appear to be highly valued.  The company must be one of the top in employee development resources.  However, there is a fair amount of stagnation; mid/upper management decisions are tepid.  "
good,"If you are looking for a clock in and clock out environment, this place is for you.  You must be located in Charlotte, New York or Denver.  No remote work allowed."
good,"During my 6 1/2 years at TIAA, I have experienced a culture that is mission driven, focused on employee development, team-building, and work-life balance. I have grown my marketing, branding, customer research/experience, and analysis skills. The experience with management has varied over the years. The most enjoyable part of working at TIAA has been the level of autonomy I have had over my development and my work."
good,"I worked at TIAA for 2 years. It had a amazing work culture with talented people around.Their hard work inspired me to learn more."
good,"This is a wonderful place to work ideally. This company values the employee and their contribution.  I had two very sharp and supportive managers during my time at TAA,"
good,"This role involved a lot of personal interaction with students, university staff and faculty and hiring managers.  I definitely enjoyed the role and the responsibilities.  My only concern was where the department was headed."
good,"TIAA is extremely customer focused which is a good thing, however since it's a non-for-profit company, it is hard to them to justify investing in there business, so TIAA frequently lacks the technology to remain competitive.  However the brand is so strong that it does not have difficulty retaining clients."
good,"My career is based in the Financial Services industry, where I built a career spanning 19 years with this Fortune 500 organization. I built relationships across all divisions of the organization, working with institutional as well as, individual clients."
good,This is  great company with a great culture. The employees are friendly and inclusive. The company is working hard to reinvent itself and transform to the digital demands of a technology financial services company. This has led to a lot of priority churn and frequent reorganizations making it difficult to progress a particular position for too long.
good,"Good overall, but too much restructuring and corporate politics.  Culture and values definitely changed over the years.  Good compensation and benefits."
good,"good working hours. good knowledge of banking and retirement. its a great place to be at and start.  good benefits, but if you dont like sitting behind a desk for a long time, this isnt the job for you."
good,"The culture at tiaa is very competitive. If you don't respond and compete at a high level, you are talked to and even written up. They pay well and even pay great bonuses but that might be changing soon."
good,"I had two wonderful managers in TIAA and my experiences in those positions were great.  I had flexibility and their willingness and encouragement to expand my abilities with the amazing support of these individuals."
good,"Perfect place to learn and expand knowledge of retirement planning, while working to educate those in the non-profit community and beyond about finances."
good,"This was a work at home experience. My typical day began with reviewing and acting upon emails, followed by a number of conference calls (8 - 15 per day). I learned about web application design and development. I worked for a manager who was remote most of our interaction was via conference calls. The culture at TIAA was very supportive of working from home. The hardest part of the job was the lack of face to face contact which made it difficult to read an individuals reactions. I found working from home to be extremely enjoyable."
good,TIAA was a great place to work for.  I always enjoyed being able to learn and the opportunities.  It started to change when the company believed it needed to make changes by laying off and not offering job security.  It was believed if someone was there longer than 5 years it was bad.  If you get a job there try to stay with the business that is client facing.  Client facing groups have the best training and upper management values the input and work of everyone.
good,"A typical day at work is pretty good, not too shabby. I've learned some test driven development thanks to the Android Lead. My co-workers were always happy to help if I was stuck with an issue. The most enjoyable part of the job is figuring out the problems that we are faced with in terms of programming."
good,It was a very political environment and you had to know the right people to get noticed to move up or get put on projects that are very visible
good,Rewarding and great job to work for.  Specialized in planning for your retirement for educators of colleges and higher education.  One of the top 10 companies in this field and will give you the opportunity to advance in this field.
good,"TIAA-CREF has a long way to go on defined career pathing.  Very subjective.  GREAT benefits, mainly PTO and retirement plan."
good,"Tiaa-Cref is a great place to work.  The Employees and Management team are friendly.  Although the Company is now going through many changes, I would still recommend this working here."
good,The culture at TIAA-CREF is one that fit with my work and communication style.
good,"Tiaa-Cref is a good place to work, salaries are nice people are great."
good,"Enjoyed checking  incident reports and assigning  to Team Members.  Also liked compiling  daily reports for Senior Management. Great place to work. Close to home, good environment and friendly people."
good,"Due to the nature of my personal work experience, IT is both demanding and stressful yet fulfilling when objectives are met in a timely fashion.  Co-workers were excellent, customer service was on par with excellence as our goal.  Management although constantly under pressure to deliver with limited staffs was flexible without losing sight of overall objectives.  A typical day at work meant servicing a large and varied business platform which included marketing department, accounting and payroll, law division, insurance and of course IT networking.  The best of of the job was being able to satisfy our customers by allowing them to meet their objectives to their customers."
good,"Great co-workers, tele-commuting made it easier to handle the frequently long days."
good,"Mission to help teachers, educators and those in the non-profit world to save for and live in retirement.  Deeply rooted within colleges, universities, hospitals and museums throughout the country."
good,"Good thing is that TIAA likes to listen, bad is that they wait to long to get stuff figured out and in motion.  Too academic in the mindset to effectively execute business objectives."
good,"Given the opportunity to learn SAFe, new planning techniques, and reporting capabilities.  Great place to drive teams.  Enjoyed the supportive culture.  "
good,"People are great and focused on a mission to deliver the best in financial services to teachers, hospitals, non-profits.  Work is distributed across multi sites and days are spent on the phone in meetings."
good,"Work/Life balance was always a challenge.  Work was a challenge, as not every item is the same, and so may variables existed.  The company has many programs to help promote inclusiveness.  There is a doctor's office on site, with a low co-pay for employees, and an onsite cafe."
good,TIAA has a great company culture. I learned a lot of the company's processes and system during my internship in TIAA. Everybody from the associate through director was very helpful and resourceful.
good,"The company needs more leaders than managers.  There are many in leadership roles that are not equipped to lead or motivate employees. Some departments have no room for growth, which may lead to frustration."
good,"TIAA is a very traditional corporate atmosphere. Staff and management were like many companies, some good, some not so good. It was a good place to work and I learned a great deal."
good,Fast pace and Learning Environment. Work Culture is very Diverse. Hardest part of the job is Culture. Most Enjoyable part of the job is the holidays and celebrations.
good,"good work life balance, based on what project you end up working on. Company is always striving to work on cutting technology, so lot of exposure to new tools and technology stack."
good,TIAA could be very challenging because it is a political environment. The people are great and there is always a challenge around the corner. The benefits are the best.
good,"Benefits are great and the employer does care about your career progression. Unless you work within a main headquarters, the office culture is going to vary, as there are multiple regional offices across the country."
good,"The workplace culture allows room for growth.  It fosters a camaraderie that is positive and rewarding.  The focus is on serving the client and ensuring that the needs of the client are being met. It is an environment that allows the building of internal and external relationships to work toward a shared goal, and again, that is to serve the client."
good,"Things are changing and some changes are for the good, but many are for the bad. This have felt extremely reactionary for a long time and the 2020 Vision seems to be taking the company into unchartered territory that isn't good for employees."
good,I worked at TIAA over 5 years and had a great overall experience. The values of the organization are not just lip service. TIAA does care about working for the greater good and hires people that live life that way. I'd definitely recommend working here.
good,Company has very competitive pay and benefits.  Not much room for advancement and very political. Good work/life balance and great co-workers
good,TIAA is at the forefront of the Insurance/Annuities industry in helping participants obtain their retirement goals. TIAA values their standing in the community and works hard to make community out reach.
good,"I very much appreciated my experience with TIAA. Great people, great culture. Strong values.  People are motivated to do their best for the company and leaders.  There have been some reasonable cost cutting measures in the past 18 months resulting in job eliminations/downsizing. Unfortunately, what hasn't changed/reduced accordingly is the volume of work/initiatives. This has created at least a temporary imbalance of work-life (perhaps not in all business areas)."
good,"The environment and culture are exceptional, if the corporate values are placed into action, great things can happen.  If not, then they are merely words on a piece of paper."
good,"Good company, good people. Small company mindset.. in growing pains.  Enjoyed the culture... management was struggling with a transition to a larger, more mature operate model.  New leaders were from outside and myopic on the current state of the machine."
good,"can't say much about the company as I was a contractor so the world there for me was very different than the full time employees."
good,Company you can grow into with a great work like balance. Because the company is always expanding the job security is high.
good,"Growing company with opportunities"
good,"T typical day would be scanning microfilmed sheets into the scanner and looking at the info on the documents and making sure they are readable. After that is done we store and file them away in alphabetical order. We also used army time at the workplace. Which was confusing to me at first, but I learned it very quickly. My co-workers were great. We got along just fine. we helped each other out if one was finished with their assignment and the other needed help. Their was no hardest part of the job. I enjoyed working there. I just enjoyed working with the mangers and the co-workers. The security in the building was great to work with."
good,"My typical workday was training, coaching, mentoring, quality assurance, and workflow distribution for several off site teams. As an Operations Helpline Representative my day was answering inbound calls from National Contact Center, and regional staff members local and offsite. I learned how to share my knowledge and expertise with all who need support with various system functions, work in progress, status, navigation, rules, standard operating procedures and internal knowledge based websites.  I still have a working rapport with my colleagues, peers, and co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was being laid off. The most enjoyable part of the job was performing and overseeing the day to day operations, research, and problem resolutions, working on projects for root cause analysis and completing my education in business management and earning my MBA. "
good,Insurance company
good,Good culture and great people. Opportunity for advancement. Must be willing to climb over fellow workers. Outdated systems.
good,"Fast pace environment. Workload was very intense due to downsizing of department. Great co-workers, management on a whole was good."
good,"My typical day at work was working in a queue to contact beneficiaries to complete their loved one death claim. When I came to TIAA-Cref I did not know about Death Claims or After Tax Annuity. Leaving that company helped me to educate not only my family and friends about their future but strangers as well. I worked with a great management team. My co-workers had been with the company and department for many years. The information that was taught to me helped to enhance my skills to better assist grieving families. The hardest part of my job was having to go home at the end of the day after not being able to be face to face with a beneficiary that just needs a hug or some personal guidance on the paperwork. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that what I was doing for the beneficiary was greatly appreciated. The beneficiaries did not know the first step to start a claim after calling TIAA. Some did not make the call to TIAA to notify of the death, the funeral home did. In this case the beneficiary is shocked to receive your call to know they might not have to struggle after all."

Management is well above average, I have had no complaints thus far. I work with many different people, from different cultural background, this job is indeed a blessing when coming into contact with people from different walks of life and age levels. I really can't say there is a hard part to the job outside of just being adherent to all the rules and procedure, through different states.

good,excellent place to grow and be recognized. Learned to follow my dreams and ambition and worked with fabulous people.
good,"Always busy, moving from one project to another.  The atmosphere amongst co-workers was one of unity, respect each willing to help when needed to get a specific project completed.  Management, though firm in seeing projects through was also notably considerate and helpful in giving clear guidance."

good,"TIAA-CREF is always evolving and like most companies there are days where you're super busy and other days when it's not as hectic. When I joined the company the company was very family oriented. Parents, uncles, nieces, cousins, siblings, married couples, etc worked at the company. There is a 25 year+ club. People work there for many years and they celebrate this milestone where people who have made the 25 year (plus) club, return to the celebration and toast the new members. The hardest part about working at TIAA-CREF would probably be the technology. Although it has improved 100%, it's still behind industry standards. I had enjoyed our yearly giving campaign. We'd have fun events and the employees would gather together for various charities, you could feel the sense of community. We also have a yearly tricycle race that was hilarious to watch and participate in because of how people would trick their bike and seeing adults riding little tricycles that are for children."
good,As part of this team I took in customer software requests. I evaluated the software against corporate standards and tested for compatibility with the MS Windows image.

I learned how to be more sympathetic when dealing with people during their time of grievance and how best to accomplish making our clients happy when working with multiple areas.  Worked with a variety of very intelligent and devoted associates whose main goal is to make our clients a priority.  The hardest part of the job was notifying family that we are unable to complete their request due to incomplete paperwork, but in the same aspect the most enjoyable part was being able to help other families with a financial surprise that they may never have known they were entitled to."
good,I worked at TIAA for over 30 years what I enjoyed most about TIAA was;
good,I love the company. No security though. Too many lay offs. I trained an outside company person to do my job then they took my job. Profit seemed to be the bottom line for this company. The cafeteria was great. The people were great.
good,"Study work pace that was fair and had many opportunities, which I took a shot at, although the chance did not work out it was a great company to work for. Learned many different financial computer systems and made many friends that I have been in the industry for some years."
good,They'll compensate you well (watch the fine print on the retirement plans). Management is engaged and they've had a culture shift. I don't know that they'll succeed in the space they envision themselves occupying but it's a dynamic place right now.

good,"Worked here for over 4 years and left on my own accord which had nothing to do with salary (which is well above industry average).  Very flexible, competitive benefits and less stressful than a bank environment.  They will allow you to move up and even relocate to different offices after 2-3 years of time put in.

good,"Began with team huddle"
good,"Retirement benefits (when I was there) began after 5 years and they are great; BUT, before then you are on your own. This company is a multi-Billion dollar solvent since Andrew Carnegie started it. Drawback was 2008 corporate-wide downsizing where managers were REQUIRED to release one individual in the department. There was a recent change in CEOs. Low performance scores, consultants, temps and people caught in a limbo placement (not really attached to a department) were released in rounds. Again, it was the beginning of the recession. It is still a fantastic place to develop a career; but, as with any place WISDOM warrants contingency plans when released from employment."

good,"I love TIAA, but did not like my area's leader.  I was put on a 2yr plan aimed at getting me to the next level--either Manager or Senior Manager and I crushed every milestone.  Additionally, I went above and beyond by managing several vendors and conducting site visits."
good,"There was no set rules or required deliverable for the job. ""Stuff""rolls downhill when something doesn't get done. Very big 4 culture as many of the people who work there have escaped the lifestyle of public accounting. Your career lies in the palm of your managers hands. Expect to work for a partner or senior manager that never really made it at a big 4 to exemplify their hard work, passion and dedication that was never appreciated at said big 4 only to put it all on you."

Typically you do work hard and you should be a self-starter and go-getter who can work well without being micromanaged. It pays off with the people you get to work with because uniformly, the employees and culture are great. Benefits are outstanding and comp is industry level or sometimes better. Work from home is also fully available for most all positions which can be great for working parents, senior care, and other situations. Hours tend to be flexible and you start when your team starts.

TIAA is someone what flexible with work schedule but contractors are limited to the amount of time you can work remote....The  most enjoyable as completion of project work and receiving Kudos.............................................................................................................

good,"Good culture, benefits, work-life balance. Great pople to work with. Management very supportive. Some mobility but would like more of a fair assessment of internal skills. Seemed to prefer external candidates."
good,"In all honesty, TIAA is the best company I've ever worked for in terms of company culture, diversity and amount of paid vacation (which is important to me).  I'm not in love with my role but definitely a great company that gives individuals room to find their niche outside of their role, if they desire to do so."
good,"TIAA is the place where you can learn the Annuities lifecyle completely and can get the exposure on other business lines like Brokerage, Life Insurance, etc. The work life balance also is one of the best you can get."

good,"I've been in this industry for almost my whole career and this is the only firm that I've found to honestly put the client first.  It's not a firm that expects you to sell a quota of certain products.  The real focus is on financial planning and making a difference for the client and you get rewarded for doing just that."
good,"TIAA-CREF is a great financial services company, one built on integrity and service-oriented focus of its clients. A typical day consists of interacting with clients to help them meet their financial goals both to and through retirement. It is where I learned how important preparing for retirement can be. It is also where I built my administrative skills as well as my public service skills. At times, the hardest part of the job has been dealing with clients because people are very particular about how their money is being handled. At the same time, that has been the most rewarding part of the job because I get to see people retire without worry or fear of how they will make it after retirement. They know that they have properly prepared and will have enough to keep them financially stable through retirement."
good,"With unbeatable benefits, competitive pay, and a great work atmosphere TIAA is hard to beat.   Only issue is so many business cultures coming together as the company has grown makes delivery difficult."
good,"A typical day at work is interacting with individuals from other departments,driving effective change, acting as a thought partner and facilitates change activities as needed, plans the timing of communications, activities, and events.  Managing projects from beginning to end, works with project team and other project support roles to help formulate and coordinate specific plans and activities to support project implementation."

good,Worked with a lot of articulate DBA's in developing initiatives to improve business while keeping databases operating successfully and securely.  Protecting data integrity is key to the company.
good,"TIAA is a great place to start and build a career. They have many opportunities until you reach the upper part of middle management. That is typical is most large companies. The corporate values are second to none, and they promote the employees to give back to the community as the corporation does. They promote diversity and inclusion of all aspects of employees and contractors. The benefits are second to none."
