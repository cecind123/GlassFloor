I can see why IBM is losing customers, sales and market share. "

good,"Outsourcing overseas has caused issues resulting in layoffs, resource action, etc.. There is no seniority for workers- every day at work is like your first day on the job. Managers are just that - managers. Many cannot do the job that their direct reports can do. There is no hope for advancement. You have to apply for a new job in a higher Pay Band. If you are doing a good job and getting ahead of your work, your reward is to do more work, and/or pick up the slack for someone else who is not doing so well.  You are also rated against your peers at review time. So as a Band 7, you are rated against other Band 7s in your department. A percentage is rated 1, or 2+ or 2, the rest are 3s and 4s. Someone has to be rated low, and those folks are usually handed a pink slip. This creates a ""dog eat dog"" work environment where everyone is trying to outperform their peers instead of working with them. "

good,"Extremely professional conservative environment. I got to experience a very large corporate environment and how the jobs are much smaller in scope, than in small companies where you do a bit of everything. Lots of coop students and it was a good experience overall."
good,"A typical day at work I would come in and go to my work station. My desk was in a pod of 4 but it didn't get to loud. There was plenty of work space.

good,overall good
good,I had a great opportunity to work for them but one major factor I didn't like to was the way jobs and roles were silo-ed thus very little cross training or interaction.

good,Days were nice and fun.
good,"Working for IBM was very fast-pace enivronment. I was a liaison between my customers and service engineers. Any concerns the customers had I was there focal to get their concerns handled.

good,Point of contact to support Field Technicians via phone. Some days were worked under a lot of stress supporting your technician and the customer due to system being down or power outage.
good,"I have worked with IBM for 3 and half years. It is a good company to work for, especially if you're a developer. All the cutting edge software are readily available to you. In addition, IBM lets you work from IBM, which is a huge benefit for parents. It is relatively difficult to move up the ladder in IBM."
good,Management changes often. I had 9 managers in 6 years. Fear of layoff is always present.
good,"It was a great place to work, but very easily to feel unrecognized amongst your colleagues."
good,"Good Working Environment "
good,"it is as what you would expect in an IBM culture, Agile and quick and very business oriented which allowed for success. The biggest issue during my stay there was certain managers who liked to swing their power around in a very unnecessary manner, it really did not help in building that relationship, however this may be a one-off."
good,"IBM has a lot of potential, but the issue is the leadership holds people back. There are a lot of qualified people that work hard and don't complain. The management there seems to be under-qualified and gossip about those who work hard. Very disappointed."
good,Good company..good work environment.only problem in salary increment and all..working in Noida operations team. Delivery good.fast sites..technical updated
good,"Probably the greatest software and procurement company of all time. Its a little autonomous the work. Otherwise there's no pressure or stress, Co workers are chill too."

good,"C est une très belle entreprise , a recommandé,   une très belle expérience"
good,"- Good Management"
good,No secure job position. Salary lower than industry. Too many layoffs and changes. Management not relating to employees or contractors. Work from home great choice.
good,"I liked working at IBM and I will like to work there if I get selected in a Database support analyst /BI developer and ETL developer role"
good,"Great Company, lot of opportunity but lacks job security. Must come on site but work life balance is great. Work great with managers to accomplish ability."
good,I worked remotely and rarely worked directly with IBM. The culture was similar to other places that I've worked. There are some people eager to work with you and some that can be difficult. You just need to recognize who you're dealing with and adjust the conversations accordingly. Overall it's a good place to work.
good,"There are many learning opportunities but one have to prepare to take most of the time in their work-life for career path.  Corporate culture includes process-driven and compliance focus. Hence, you will need to follow them meticulously."
good,Good place to get experience for collections and Mortgage industry. Pay is competitive and good hours to start and close. Okay benefits. Good place to work over all.
good,"Impressionante il lavoro di Team. Considerando la complessità dell'offerta e dei processi, si ottengono risultati inaspettati."
good,"IBM is a very good place to work and work culture, management will support in everytime."
good,"Its good learn new things and get ourself updated along with your daily routine work and get paid for it."
good,Great Experience and exposure. Awesome place to work in the midst of professionals. All verities of job role can be experienced if interested. Internal movements are possible. Good Management.
good,Good place to start. Company culture have changed over the years. Performance evaluation and compensation structure was designed to save company money.
good,Many work responsibilities. Lots of duties and busy days.  Learned to delegate and kept constant open communication with management.  Coworkers very helpful and hands on.  At times work was fun.  Finding space for all equipment was challenging but everyone worked as a team.
good,IBM is a good company to learn and get skilled up but not a good payer. Also the culture of promoting diversity employees is leading to lack of opportunities and leadership for male employees.
good,"I started my career in IBM, it was good and i learnt many things from management and team members."
good,"Whoever hasn't heard of IBM in today's time is probably living in stone ages."
good,"Good company to work for..."
good,IBM has very systematic work culture. Salary paid on time. The interview process was long. Managers were friendly. pick up drop facility was systemactic.
good,While it is prestigious to work for IBM it is just another organization with the same types of problems other organizations experience. Sometimes it large and bureaucratic and other times fun and challenging. It all depends on what type of project you find yourself on and the quality of the team mates that determines how innovative you can be. I was fortunate enough to work with almost total freedom and allowed to be as creative as I wanted to be.
good,"great place to work if you want to be surrounded by smart people, do challenging work, and have a really good work life balance. not fast paced or terribly innovative, and the culture could be improved."
good,"great work culture and great for people looking out for an retirement."
good,Go into the office 4 out of 5 days.  All support groups from ibm cloud are within one building which makes it easy to pull together different members to solve customer issues and provide quicker resolution to problems.
good,"IBM is an amazing company to work with. If you want to grow horizontally, IBM is the best company. Trainings available on IBM internal portal unmatched in the market. Multiple benefits such as work from home and perfect work life balance."

good,"Nice place to work. Balance between work and family"
good,E' stata una belle esperienza lavorativa sia per la flessibilità del lavoro che per il contratto.
good,"I was lucky to work with very talented people.  Worked and collaborated with teams from NA, Europe, AP, Japan, China, MEA and LA.  Worked remotely having conference calls on a daily basis with my team the Geographies."
good,IBM is a good place to start working.  I was able to understand how the management works and if possible would like to work again with the organization

good,"Excelente experiencia que estou tendo. Ambiente, pessoas e cultura mto bem aplicado as atualidades."
good,Great place to start career and gain great experience while working with client through the United States. Great training programs to help develop and attain new skills.
good,"I felt my internship at IBM was very beneficial. I learned a lot about Finance, specifically revenue, tools to utilize revenue, and how revenue is calculated and tracked at a large corporation. My colleagues were very open to helping me, despite the stigma in today's day and age of being ""just an intern."" They made me feel welcome and approachable for help. My managers were amazing and wanted to see me grow and learn. There were a few times where I felt underutilized, such as being bored. But, there were times I was busy all day. It had its cycles. I was proud to call myself an IBMer while at my internship and look forward to calling myself an IBMer once again when I start as a full time Financial Analyst!"
good,A good environment workplace with family oriented culture. Between bosses and workers are great just like friends. Work as a team by helping each other. Able to learn more things and adapt easily. The best place for the internship programmed or fresh graduates.
good,I had a fantastic boss and that is what made my position so desirable. I was able to work on a variety of functions outside my normal scope which I enjoyed.
good,Professionalism beyond belief.  Employees are team players and share knowledge and skills.  Senior Management has lost the ability to make decisions and the strategy is solely making EPS. bb
good,"I came over to IBM from the PwCC acquisition. Had many opportunities to manage some of the largest projects in IBM during the SAP R3 days. Most of my time was spent traveling and majority of projects were European international corporations. Overall, a very good experience, some very bright technical people anxious to share knowledge. It is a very big company and you have to aggressively manage your career and stay current with the technology."
good,"Good projects and technologies and stability there. Good work environment, good learning. Big brand. "
good,"A good company, Managers are also very helpful. Work culture is very professional. Enjoying the work and also people will help you to grow here. Good Experience."
good,IBM is a company where you have the opportunity to lead global teams towards a common goal. Great opportunity to learn from  the experiences in other geographies .
good,"There are positions and promotions within the same groups, there are not many growth opportunities within the organization. They are hermetic in that sense."
good,bien algo bueno esperaba mas pero no estuvo mal me agrado estar por alla
good,Busy workplace. A bit slow to change but overall friendly atmosphere. Safe working space as you aren;t constantly feeling the threat of being fired but this also breeds incompetence.
good,The only fall back to a fantastic opportunity was the 100% commission structure. It would never allow me to plan ahead as i never really knew form month by month what i would be taking home.
good,"I worked here as a Tech Support for over a year. I was a fresh graduate at the time and for me, I learned a lot, technical skills involved but most of all, psychologically speaking  in terms of dealing with various people, situations and working under pressure. As a first timer in the corporate world, I am proud to say that I consider working here as an asset to my resume. The workload at times gets heavy but that's just normal. The management is so-so, sometimes they're considerate, it depends on the situation for that certain day. You won't be needing to bring your job with you once you leave the office and that's a plus for me. One thing, I regret that I left too early to pursue my other endeavors but overall, its a great experience to be an IBMer. I might be coming back but not as of now..:)"
good,"Company is competitive, good training and great opportunity to growth on Cloud services. Management is great, low management environment and great salary."
good,"Great training program.  People were very cool and down to earth.  But a lot of waste and inefficiency.  Depends on what department you work for. Some depts are great, others can really keep you down."
good,Working in this company helps me to communicate to people well and respond to the inquiry in a responsive way. IBM helps me to be gained more knowledge.
good,"I loved working with IBM . Always something new, but after a few layoff, 8 yrs in you kind of get tired of the layoff and want consistency in a job. IBM is a great place to work , but the inconsistency on knowing that you have a permanent job has gone out the window for most companies not just IBM."
good,"A IBM proporciona um ótimo ambiente de trabalho, seus benefícios são excelentes."
good,Een bedrijf waar je veel kunt leren over innovatie en samenwerken!
good,"Company is now more cut-throat. You can get laid off whether you are a good employee or not. It's numbers game. Managers use flowery words like, ""we have to participate in resource action"". Which means someone is getting axed. You can only imagine how good the employee morale can be when they do not know how long their job is going to last."
good,"Work life balance is there."
good,Very open exchange of ideas and access to education.  Internal groups encouraged for specific disciplines or products  Hardware and software resources were provided as needed.
good,I enjoyed working for IBM.  The salary was lacking - the salary increase process was vague.  The management was interested in providing coverage for clients more than the careers of their employees.
good,More customer focused was required to improve the services in BPO team.
good,Die IBM heute zu bewerten masse ich mir nicht an. Es ist zu lange her seit ich dort gearbeitet habe. Auf jeden Fall anschauen. Ich hatte dort eine gute Zeit.
good,"Many years ago, IBM valued its employees for their years of Loyalty."
good,"Muy a gusto trabajar en la empresa, procesos definidos y burocraticos. Mucho foco en los Bussines Conduct Guidelines"
good,"A IBM conta com uma ampla plataforma de treinamentos que permitem que o funcionário aprenda várias tecnologias, processos e metodologias. Há certificações aceitas pelo mercado o que ajuda no crescimento profissional."
good,"Productive and Fun Workplace"
good,"Contracted position did not get much insight therefore unable to provide the required number of characters that you all are looking for with this question,"
good,"I was responsible for providing a productive and motivating working environment, and addressing any issues/disputes from customers or clients. I managed a group of 10 help desk tech and was responsible for organizing their day to day activities as well as, implementing processes and outlining what needed to be done on a daily basis in reference to AT&T servers."
good,Good company to work. Flexible with scheduling and allowing employees to work remote whenever possible.Fair compensation and opportunities for advancement.
good,"Faz muito tempo que trabalhei na empresa, acho injusto colocar minha opinião."
good,"Solid company, procedural Company, paid on time, Flexibility."
good,A typical day of work is monitoring the systems and releasing jobs.  What I learn was how to install system upgrades. The workplace culture is team driven
good,"Salary is not up to the mark one thing company should do change the management not the employee."
good,"IBM was my first job in consulting and did not disappoint. Training is plentiful and relevant, and actively encouraged. The people you work with are genuinely knowledgeable and willing to help. If you are new to the consulting game, this is a good company to teach you the ropes."
good,"Good company to work "
good,"Okay place to work, not the IBM of the past. Benefits are not good, very high priced or cover nothing. Can not say enough about my direct supervisor but past that managment is lacking."
good,"They expect a lot but do take care of their employees. "
good,IBM's cloud strategy has been in flux for the last few years.  Strategy for IBM cloud changes quarterly.  Makes it a challenging environment to work in.
good,A typical day at IBM is full of learning experiences. On a day to day basis there will be payments that will be received from the borrower's. Accounts will be reviewed and if there is any information that is important to the borrower then it will be provided to the borrower. There is also available time to get coaching to provide information and to be able to give feedback on situations that occur on a day to day basis.
good,It is a great company sometimes too much meetings but in general good benefits and opportunities to grow and learn. I recommend the company. Some people has been working many years in IBM.
good,I worked out of my company provided van and received my jobs via cell phone. If any help was required to complete a job than there was other techs assigned to area when available to help.
good,Constant reorganizations within the sales structure.  While companies are acquired the value never really transcends to the offering.  IBM would be wise to take an internet startup mentality to key and emerging business lines.
good,"Many large tech companies do not invest in R&D to the extent that IBM does.  It is an interesting place to work."
good,"If you get a project with the facility to work from home, then its really a very good place to work."
good,"tienen excelente fondo de empleados , excelentes equipos  e instalaciones, lastimosamente no ven el trabajo de las personas, si no le caes bien al jefe te sacan."
good,"I used to start my work around 10 am everyday and sometimes it ended early and at times it extended upto 5 pm. The work hours were flexible, you could leave the office if you were done with your work, I was an intern after all. "
good,"In some projects, work life balance is very good but for some projects it becomes difficult."
good,Good company to start with and build a career. Management is supportive and opportunities for growth are available. Free conveyance too. Management supports higher education.
good,"In general, IBM is a really good place if you want to learn work in a place where you can learn new technologies. Their pay pay at least when you start is competitive. However, unless you get a very high rating during the annual review your pay increase will be small or none. There is a lot of very smart people there and it is very hard to get the best rating unless your manager really like you. That is unfortunate because you can have an entire department that is very smart and it comes down to a judgement call in terms of who gets a higher rating. The culture in general is good. However, there are constant turnover because of the annual layofff's."
good,"A IBM é uma boa empresa para se trabalhar e conta com bons benefícios. Contudo, exige muitas horas de trabalho e baixos salários."
good,"My direct boss was very nice and helpful.  Unfortunately, the new test lead liked to break scripts upon re-write and design the tests using complex dictionaries which are out of scope for the way RobotFramework was designed."
good,"There are healthy challenges in a typical day of work, integrity and work ethic are highly regarded as part of the workplace culture, which is also exhibited by management."
good,"I liked working in the company as I had good team members always willing to help me out with issues  either professional or personnel. "
good,"IBM definitely lives up to its mission to be Essential and to Think. People are friendly and willing to help. There is not as much vacation time as there is at comparable firms which can eat into work-life balance; however, flexible and remote work is highly encouraged which offsets the lower vacation time somewhat."
good,Work with teams of highly trained and educated professionals from different cultures. Strong management teams. Future focused company direction to ensure longevity. Internal training programs for those who take advantage.
good,"IBM, is very good for people who like bureaucracy and a slow comfortable environment. If you like fast pace and cutting edge technology you probably need to consider a different career path."
good,typical day  sign in put out a list of where the operators were going to be working then get counts of scratch tapes on the floor so we could run a list of tapes to pull for the operators to use through out the night then getting list of tapes out to the operators to pull to send off-site this was one of the best jobs i ever had
good,"Overall IBM gives you really good options to balance your work and life also to excel your skill but not good in compensation "
good,Good and great working experience. Very fun place to work. I love my team while working at IBM. Management was very helpful with career goals. Great pay!
good,Good company but losing due to the strategies at Higher management level. It provides a better work life balance and flexibility but the Salary increments are very bad and there is no market correction for the loyal employees. Losing competitiveness due to some awful decisions at higher management not to retain their existing employees y doing a market correction rather pay higher and bring in new resources and spend more money on training them.
good,"Got many managers assigned and found how do they manage things."
good,"Enjoyed working in IBM. Worked on the latest technologies and learnt a great deal. Worked simultaneously on multiple projects"
good,"setting up a new office equipment,  not to much supervision required.  a lot off room to improve and learn from seasoned professionals.  a lot of co workers are willing to help."
good,Varied experiences.  Working with the experts/PhDs was very motivating.  Some ventures were historically unstable.  Flexibility during downturns is required.
good,"A IBM é uma empresa boa para trabalhar de maneira geral, porém como uma porta de entrada para o mercado em empresas multinacionais."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at IBM. I had the opportunity to work with some great minds and some of the best leaders in the industry. The education options are endless and it's nice to be able to switch roles but stay with the same employer."
good,"IBM works on  main motto as below"
good,"good place to learn your skills with good support and managers."
good,Direct management was good however overall IBM involvement in the RPO was distant in assisting with training and overall support.  Unfortunately most consulting companies have been similar
good,"It is good company to work ,nice policies and  culture. Have offices in egl and manyata. have multiple patents. Comapny is growing, its good to work over here."
good,"It was an overall gopd experience as the working environment is good and has a good management system at IBM DAKSH malad mumbai"
good,"C'est un emploi temporaire, un contrat de 22 mois. L'ambiance étais bonne et le travail intéressant."
good,Focus on  customers and employees is not a daily practice.  It's all about stockholders first.   Bad managers are not removed.  Too much good old boys controlling decisions and protecting each other.
good,"Our company was acquired by IBM but we retained our core business which is Recruitment Process Outsourcing."
good,There is a lot of pride in the company culture.  IBMers take pride in working for Big Blue. It is a staple in the industry and has diversified itself into so many different industries that it will always exist
good,I worked at IBM as a Masters Thesis research assistant. I was a very nurturing and supportive environment for me. They do concentrate on hiring individuals with PHDs over lower degrees.
good,"I can tell you that my time at IBM was spent with some of the greatest people to work around. I made friends that I will stay in contact with for years to come. As for the digital business group that I was a part of somedays were just overly stressful. Not near enough transparent for a sales/marketing position. You could be hired going in with a specific mission and it would change the next quarter. There were many great managers and directors, but at the same time there were just as equally terrible ones. One negative to say about IBM is the politics that happen for career advancement."
good,I enjoyed working in the city. This was a very demanding job with long hours needed to complete bids and proposals. Overall I enjoyed the challenge of this position.
good,"Good place to work but the salary is not what you would expect."
good,"Great exposure to different business functions and the ability to network and collaborate with employees, which allows for great development of skills. However, growth opportunity from a junior role is very difficult."
good,"Responsible for setting up and troubleshooting IBM machines, install all of its IBM systems and software that are needed to interface with the IBM network.  Perform and install IBM specific functions such as; Lotus Notes, eClaim (ILC), Access Connect, RTO, wireless networking, identifying and backing up important data, preloaded with generic business applications such as Microsoft Office, PGP data encryption software, Blackberry Setup and Support, Sine and IBM VPN."
good,Challenging management at a high level. IBM is going through a challenging shift and it is taking time to get there. Hopefully IBM is likely to transform and return to growth but I see it unlikely.
good,"productive and innovative work place. "
good,"IBM was a great place to work.  They were always miles ahead in office comfort and competitive pay. the work life balance was perfect."
good,"IBM envisions itself as professional and highly standardized with enthusiastic co-workers but in reality loses professionals because of incompetent management, ignores it's own standards and co-workers are fed up with the above."
good,Not bad a place to work for 18 years. Tried several roles throughout 18 years of service there. Work life balanced company with work from home options
good,Empresa americana con una ambiente de trabajo correcto. Trabajé hace 22 años por lo que no sé cómo se trabajará ahora pero si se solían hacer horas extras excesivas.
good,It allowed me access into the workforce with my initial employment from my academic career.   I was constantly given opportunities to grow the position.  My direct manager always provided me support.
good,"When you work somewhere for 20 years obviously it can't be a bad place to work. "
good,"You would be in a good postion if you have a project and a client to work for. Otherwise , it is just like any other consultancy. Good work culture and people to work with."
good,The management promoted viable team work that aligned  strategically with the interest of the organization. There are opportunities to advance your career in IT.
good,"Você tem que dar o sangue para ser promovido nessa empresa, muito difícil. Exagero de horas extras, muitos benefícios no entanto salário baixo, cultura organizacional retrógrada."
good,Most people start as a contractor for about 3-7 years before they're hired on full-time which really sucks. That part is very stressful but other than that it's great.
good,"Can't really speak to this, IBM was pressured into lowering cost by their client, so the cutting started with the Employees that were outsourced to IBM from the company supported."
good,I undertook a year's work placement at IBM in 2016. The flexible working hours were great however management was often poor due to the large size of the company.
good,IBM work life balance is indeed a good one. The work flexibility is a great experience. Really enjoy and appreciate the company culture of implementing this work life balance.
good,"Worked with many clients over a number of years allowing for a rich exposure to different cultures and experiences."
good,"learned a lot, was given support at all levels, never felt unwelcome. excellent way of treating employees. the opportunities to grow are enormous. one of the best companies to work for."
good,"A IBM é uma empresa onde o funcionário sente prazer em trabalhar pelo fato do reconhecimento."
good,"At the time I worked for IBM, they would re-organize every 6 months, managers would be changed every 6 months, which resulted in th work that I had been working on for the past 6 months usually being discarded.  When they started shipping all of our work to other companies, it became very clear that my job would be eliminated.  6 months after I left, I found that out entire department had been ""Global Resourced"" meaning all jobs had been removed from the U.S. to out of country.  Also young college resources were paired with us so that we could teach them our jobs, it was made clear that they were being groomed to take over our jobs by management."
good,"Foco no cliente, dinamica e atenta a disponibilidade ao suporte."
good,"You will login and focus on your to do list for the day ."
good,IBM has a well-oiled set of processes for managing people and equipment.  Training is readily available in a number of formats.  This is offset by minimal guidance on what training would be most productive for advancement and a complex set of requirements for promotion and no cost of living increases except through promotion.  People are encouraged to better themselves but are given only general advice.
good,I worked in a specialized area of IBM and was not exposed to the overall company culture. From my limited experience IBM is a good company to work for and offers many areas of growth opportunity.
good,"Did many good/productive projects , not just for the customer , but for our own Unix/Linux team. (infrastructure tools)"
good,"I really liked working for IBM, when they came up with the idea that you had to work at one weekend per month and had to make up any vacation time you take. well, it quit being my dream company to work for."
good,"When needed to work from home as home office IBM is very flexible."
good,"Corporate culture is typical of most large companies, hard to get things to happen quick, easy to get pigeon-holed to very specific engineering roles.  That being said, enjoyed my time there, but I prefer a job that has more breadth and variety of skills required."
good,"-great team benefits"
good,"IBM still a workhorse but focusing in the wrong areas in my opinion.  They also try to play with their stock price too often by giving workers temporary layoffs, and then have them catch up after they return to work."
good,"IBM is a great starter job right out of college, they promote from within and the benefits were amazing! Depending on your manager you could work from home when needed. I would definitely recommend."
good,"My positive experience at IBM is due the people that work there.  The company is large and come with the expected corresponding bureaucratic frustrations one would expect.  Overall, the work environment was challenging and there was never a dull moment.  Flexible work schedule was good.  Benefits were good but expensive to the employee.  Little to no upward movement and salaries remained essentially flat due to constant budget cuts."
good,"Es de mucho crecimiento en todos los ambientes, tecnológico y profesional pero su principal contra es la estabilidad laboral, tiene muy poca."
good,"exposure to the latest and greatest as well as oldest is what you'll get.  company however was never known for competitive rates. so if you are eager to learn and not too concerned about pay, this is the place for you.  for professionals with families/dependents, there is a very great need to do your due diligence before signing up."
good,"The company is good,"
good,"Good and hardworking people and great management mostly, but job security is a big question mark unfortunately.. as IBM is known for layoffs multiple times a year.. :("
good,"IBM is a great company. So many approvals required for everything, plus old tools caused slow down of productivity. If new tools where available to capture the info they wanted it would of  saved time and money."
good,"I enjoyed working remotely with IBM, I was able to work on several customer contracts, Even though working remotely the team was organized and communication was important"
good,"- typical day at work at client location would be from morning 8 Am to 9 PM "
good,I have been an IBMer for over 20 years.  IBM has challenged me to upskill myself to stay competitive in the IT industry. IBM employs the best and the brightest resources.
good,"The usual day is based on routine jobs that usually takes some time to deal with bureaucracy, but it is fast paced somehow. I have learned how to deal with all different kind of personalities and how to deal with customers more often. The culture based on agile and less approvals seems to work in some sectors of the company, not so much in others. "
good,"IBM ofrece una gran oportunidad a todos aquellos interesados en trabajar con servidores, con un buen ambiente de trabajo y buen sueldo, desafortunadamente la subcontratacion por medio de KELLY es un desastre y aunque en el area de pruebas el trato no es tan malo es indignante la manera en que se trata a los operadores y trabajadores de otras areas"
good,"I have been privileged to be a part of IBM Team for more than 2 years. This was my first time in such a big company which employs more than 100,000 people only in India. Managing such a huge work force is a mammoth task in itself but IBM scores 9/10 in this. The only part which I didn't find it so good was that you get lost in such a big company. And the other is target pressure which should be more realistic."
good,IBM is a great company to work for. Opportunities for advancement are available only if you find yourself with the right team and Manager who is willing to support your move into another position. Be aware of the Resource Layoff Actions which are likely to be unannounced and have taken many by surprise.
good,Empresa sumamente organizada con buen ambiente laboral
good,"Typical Day:- Client facing, focussed on innovative approaches to sales to achieve targets,"
good,IBM prend le temps de former les employé pour être plus efficace dans leur travail.
good,"IBM is typically a govt job culture, all you need to do is finish the work at given time.very nice place to relax and work, and growth and salary hike wise it is not the place."
good,"Typically day at work is placing VPN and Managed Internet Service for top 500 AT&T accounts.  Help sales team with pricing, contract addendums for new sales. 29 years experience in telecommunications."
good,"Nice place to work, working with different culture and countries."
good,"good company to work in has global presence and clients ,good policies and growth along with a good salary structure and perks .big multinational companies and clients,Technologically the most advance company."
good,I was recruited into IBM by a VP of HR; for the first several years I was part of a world class executive leadership business team with Semiconductors.  I was recruited to move into IBM Services and had many assignments with Global aspects; the company was pivoting.
good,You work directly with clients and IBM senior management to ensure you meet the client's needs. They try to have you lead teams as soon as possible to ensure you are growing your management skills.
good,My time at IBM was great. The business unit that I worked with was very collaborative and helpful to my development as professional. I would recommend this company to everyone.
good,"This can sometimes work to your advantage, and then at redundancy time it can work against you."
good,Learn a lot of new things. Always on constant learning through own IBM learning courses. Have team building and activities to gather together to know each other.
good,"Good Work life balance, opportunities to advance are scarce but available. Overall, good company to work for in the right role and in the right department."
good,"IBM gives you the option to work and advance on different levels. Whether it is in the same business line or you are able to try different fields.And if you decide to change fields, you are able to take courses to enhance you talents, for that job."
good,Good place to work but constant cost cutting erodes good processes & practices - very corporate. Management don't always communicate effectively with staff therefore bad decisions made.
good,Corporate culture is prevalent. High turnover and not getting enough projects to sustain. Morale is low and management has freezed hiring for past 1 year.
good,Parts are IBM are good depending on the department.  I like a lot of the people I worked with and enjoyed things when they were busy and there was enough work to do.
good,"Good company, low wages for offshore accounts. "
good,Good for expereinced people. I worked for 2.5 years in Noida location and got transferred recently to hyderabad. Overall i have experience on server administration in AIX technology. Also nominated to Smarter Blue Program which is IBM internal technical training. To my intrest i learnt AWS and looking for a way to grab oppurtunities on cloud technology.
good,Excelente lugar si lo que buscas es obtener conocimiento. IBM tiene una cultura de autoaprendizaje y no restringe las decisiones u opiniones de sus empleados.
good,"Good company to work for. Very productive, collaborative and competitive. Growth in such company is well desired. I would definitely love to join this company again if given an opportunity."
good,"IBM has a decent starting salary, but don't expect your pay to increase on pace with inflation and cost of living.  I worked there for 10 years and only got pay raises with promotions, even though I was consistently rated as meeting or exceeding all of my goals.  Benefits were great when I started, but it seemed like each year they decreased.  The work can be interesting though, and for the most part people that you work with are good workers and very competent."
good,Salario soddisfacente rapportato al lavoro e al tempo.
good,"This was a good place to work. The tasks performed were almost always very challenging but that is a good thing."
good,Slow paced work environment.  The working culture and environment is good here. Freedom to employees and facility of work from home. A lot of experienced researchers forming great teams
good,"Quando sono stata assunta la situazione aziendale era gia' all'inizio della crisi economica, ma ho comunque lavorato bene e svolgendo ogni tipo di mansione mi venisse attribuita. Poi hanno cominciato a fare tagli di personale...."
good,"Empresa que tenho carinho grande por ter trabalhado lá, salários compatíveis com o mercado, oportunidade de crescimento, ambiente agradável, benefícios muito bons, dando destaque ao plano de saúde. Porém para qualquer processo dentro da empresa existe uma carga burocratica enorme."
good,Only for job security we can prefer IBM.  We can not expect more hike . IBM has a very bad culture the employee work life depends only on manager decision that is really not good.
good,Empresa muito boa para trabalhar. Ambiente agradável.
good,"Worked for travel agency in Dallas, TX contracted to coordinate IBM employee travel nationwide........not an employee of IBM.........................."
good,I have had the opt to work with Directors and Senior Mgt.  Benefits and Pay are very fair.  The company is at times too big to have a personal investment in focusing on employees career development. I felt that the company and I invested equally in one another.
good,"Vale a pena ter uma experiência em uma multinacional, pois no dá a oportunidade de sentir-se valorizado principalmente pelos benefícios."
good,"Very good company to work with, Flexible and work culture is good. "
good,"Company that I am working is very good place to work, but the middle management does not have the correct people in place. Has very good process in place. But people who are implementing the process are not good enough"
good,"After years of leading the telework revolution, we were forced to move into offices and most of us are still use video conferencing to collaborate with colleagues. "
good,IBM was not doing good at the time when I resigned but now it looks like it has come back again. I have seen most of my ex-colleagues are travelling abroad very frequently. Overall good company and has good flexibility of work culture.
good,"Allows Us to Explore Various Roles, Flexible working hours, Fun Working Environment, Good management, sufficient benefits, people are engaging and the staffs are friendly"
good,"Extraordinary campus, research center, teams, labs. No negatives. Very supportive, mgt, teams, and professionals assisting across professional disciplines at all times."
good,"Hoje em dia parece que esqueceu o que significa diversidade , pois tem 99% de mulheres no setor de RH , que diversidade é essa com essa diferença de gêneros masculinos e femininos . E também tinha funcionários acima dos 50 anos de idade , hoje em dia quantos funcionários nessa faixa etária existem e se ainda são admitidos , creio que houve um retrocesso"
good,"Supporting clients, assisting them to resolve complex technical issues, allowing them to meet fast paced productivity and high level revenue goals while working with a diverse group of engineers, clients, developers, and colleagues. Some of the most difficult parts of the job were the language barriers and trying to determine the failure at hand. The most enjoyable part of the job was resolving the problems and keeping highly prestigious customers happy while meeting highly aggressive Service Level Agreements (SLAs) of a) Acknowledge within 1 - hour b) Arrive within 2 - hours c) Resolve within 4 - hours."
good,"Goid work environments because coworkers work as team"
good,An amazing center where you can learn about great new products to help move a business forward.  I have attended a few Proof of Technology sessions here over the years and they've always been very beneficial.  They have a large parking garage to the back of the building with overflow parking beyond that.  Funding a space as a guest has never been a problem.
good,There is constant transformation which is good as the industry is changing every 6 months.  Challenges exist to grow revenue and reduce cost. Keen focus on profitability and streamlining.  There is a real teaming approach to supporting bids and proposals for Clients with a lot of attention to using our partners and suppliers to develop winning solutions.
good,"Pessoas competentes que possuem um grande conhecimento na área de TI, onde pude compartilhar e adquirir do mesmo em todos projetos em que passei e tive a oportunidade de mostrar meus skills."
good,"He tenido la oportunidad de teletrabajar, pero con un horario fijo, dando soporte de seguridad a empresas de Europa, África, Rusia y Oriente Medio."
good,"job security is good"
good,Started out being a good company but changed over time.  Motto was respect for individual   but that slowly went away.  Kept getting more workload for the same pay
good,"IBM is not your typical IT company, its a massive conglomerate consisting of numerous dept and competencies boasting expertise over various fields you can think of. The organization has an impressive knowledge database compiled over the years of experience and any new recruit joining the organization regardless of the initial job role has an opportunity to chose from a number of career path across various fields whichever he/she desires.The corporate world exposure its employees get is unlike any other. you get to meet and work with people from different walks of life developing a unique bond and a diverse work culture within the organization. the hardest part of the job i found was dealing with the intense workload caused by the shortage of staff and inefficient work flow."
good,"My job was 100 % travel - IBM Global Business Services."
good,"Learned so much working with this company for 2 years and a half years. A lot has changed and happened, has been promoted last May and worked with AT&T and Accenture network team."
good,"I enjoyed the position I had and working with my peers and colleagues, however the quota and compensation seemed to be designed for us to fail no matter how hard you worked to exceed your goals. I had 6 different managers within the first two years!  They each had a different expectation of the position I held."
good,"Design and develop the code to align with the use cases. "
good,"IBM has great benefits in terms to Healthcare, Medical leave, and vacation/Holiday pay. However the work/life balance is a struggle if you have a family and if you work remotely, it's hard to feel connected to the company."
good,"poco estable"
good,"Work, Fun, Work, Fun..."
good,my time at IBM was short i was only there for about 4 months... the number of call we take are crazy we took over 160 calls a say... just know what ypu apply for
good,make outgoing calls on past due collection accounts for payday loans. Skip trace customers to advise accounts past due and set up payments arrangements or payment in full.
good,IBM management was in the process of trying to lower the support staff numbers and payroll costs. It was a great company to work for once a long time ago. Not so much any longer. No standby or shift differentials any longer as they were taken away as a cost cutting measure and employees are expected to answer their phones at any time of night to take calls.
good,"Overall a very good place to work. You are well compensated but are required to do what you have to in order to get the job done. In my position, on-call was required which could result in you working all night and through a weekend."
good,Relaxed work culture but compensation is not that high. Join this company if you want a good work-life balance.But the salary seriously sucks. It offers a good scope of changing your technology.
good,"Even though the work environment is same, it depends on project to project and the role that we are responsible. Even sometimes the our manager also plays a major role for career growth."
good,Manager hired from Accenture that destroyed my career at IBM.  Had a great performance track until this individual was hired.  Upper leadership was afraid to speak out in my defense.
good,Occupation required servicing personal and mid range systems for businesses and their employees. Also required inventory requisition for all parts used.
good,"Could use new management as it is rather stale these days and they need some excitement, There are lots of opportunities to learn. I would like more opportunities to travel."
good,"Since i was contract employee, and i did my projects completed in assigned time, and also with various benefits to account..still management did not initiate a procees to make me permanent, that is hurting me and any employee will feel like putting more and more effort if it is appreciated for there past work."
good,"Very fast paced environment with lots of multitasking.  Some room for advancement but low pay.  Great benefits, 401k, and decent amount of PTO and sick leave."
good,"On a regular day, I would be in the office working on the computer doing various tasks on Microsoft Word, Excel, Power Point, Remedy, and other programs. I When I received a message, via my company phone, I would check the message. The message would be a service call. I would call the requesting customer, and verify the details of the service call. I would then contact the parts warehouse and see if the part was in stock. If it was in stock, I would go pick it up, and go to the customers place and perform the repairs.  Sometimes I would get called out in the middle of the night to go to a customers business. "
good,THe company is too large and cumbersome.  Very good people wrk there but it's like trying to turn qa battleship in a pond.  Also employee commissions were screwed up to the point that one time the company decided to cancel all commissions after promising a specific dollar amount to each employee!
good,"É uma boa empresa para trabalhar, infelizmente muito burocrática para promoções e mudanças de departamentos/funções. A possibilidade de transferências para outras unidades de negócio dentro da empresa, dependem muito da gerência de cada departamento ( mentalidade do gerente)."
good,"I did not have a good experience at IBM due to unrealistic expectations that resulted in 70 hour work weeks while in the consulting world. However, I truly believe that depends on the department you are in.  I advise you to get to know the people doing the job and evaluate whether it is the place you would like to work."
good,"Acá no existe mucha balanza vida trabajo, y no hay teletrabajo, por brindar servicios a otras empresas la estabilidad laboral no es muy segura."
good,"Overall great place to work.  Management tends to be decided on but the atmosphere is terrific"
good,"Excelente aprendizado. Empresa muito dinânica, com os processos muito bem montados e controlados. Mesmo centenária, é referência em inovação e uma das mais sólidas de seu nicho."
good,"Good environment"
good,"IBM is a global company and the chance to travel and learn from foreign fellow IBMers is invaluable. I was able to work from home (while not traveling) and was able to utilize my time much more efficiently since I did not have the commute."
good,The main benefit of working with IBM is its huge brand value. It also allows you to work from remote location which really helps people manage their work life balance.
good,"1. Good environment to work."
good,It was a good company but always had issues with life balance. Requires too many overtime hours. It was a good company to start my professional life as I leaned a lot there.
good,Great place to work for new IT professionals.  The culture is very competitive.  The company expects you to be promoted every couple of years and if you don't then you employment could be at risk.
good,"I work in an extremely complex environment on our highest priority projects that usually have extremely short runways, so in that sense, it can be stressful. On the flip side, I'm forced to a lot of interesting challenges which has accelerated by growth and given me some really strong technical skills. "
good,"Worked for many years with IBM.  Was not expecting to be ""retired"" but due to layoffs I was affected.  Want to say the the first half of my years with IBM were awesome.  Took care of their employees.  Things have gone downward with each passing year.."
good,Very good environment to work with. Get to work with several researchers. Good country side natural environment. Fall colors are wonderful to watch here.
good,Work is good it's nice company to work. Manager are very supportive only thing nothing  is free in IBM. Life will balanced in IBM. Work culture is also very nice at ibm.
good,"Company is in transition from mainframe to cloud based company. Management is overloaded and disparate. With that said, you are paid above average with reasonable effort."
good,"Buen lugar para los comienzos de la carrera, despues no"
good,"All 3+ Yrs of Service in IBM, new , self esteem and confident and proud working environment while I was working in Service Delivery Management and later moved to Solution Manager role. IBM Motivates and empower employees to grow in their line of interest."
good,"IBM is a great employer. They offer great benefits, vacation and 401K, as well as career development and advancement opportunities. IBM requires 40 hours of continued education a year, you can find internally as well as externally. As a top performer you may be recommended for projects within IBM as well as supporting their clients. IBM is consistently updating technology that keeps your skills fresh. However, work life balance is a challenge."
good,"•	Maintained high levels of promptness (resolving most issues within targeted 10 minutes) "
good,"Can go for this company,  a bit work pressure, have to be determined and smart worker instead of hard worker, great fun activities on floor, on every weekend"
good,"IBM in the late 1970's was a great place to work, with unlimited opportunites for those who were so inspired. I'm told it has changed a great deal, but don't have personal experience with todays culture."
good,"IBM has always had a strong heritage of making substantive contributions to communities in which we work and live. Since IBM began operating in Singapore in 1953, their presence and investments in Singapore have grown many times over - in size and variety."
good,"A perfect place where all your honest efforts to work hard and improve does not goes unnoticed.  Your customer appreciations is rewarded and your areas of improvement are mentored by the expertise. You are always taught to have fun and enjoy your daily work.This automatically makes this place better for you every day."
good,"Good benefits and pay."
good,"It was one of my achievement to get through IBM GBS ( Global Business Solutions) in the Year 2007 as Test Analyst."
good,As a fresher it's golden chance to be part of MNC like IBM.IBM is having a huge infrastructure which will help employees to learn very quickly.Overall IBM is very good company.
good,I enjoyed working for IBM but I was assigned to work at AT&T who was very budget conscious. They constantly made us take days off even when we were busy. They eventually laid me off even though I was leading the testing for several projects and never told my Lead QA Test Manager.
good,"Company needs to focus on Middle level and low level employees rather than senior executives."
good,"Over time the company changed.   More cutthroat, no gratitude for anything you accomplished, management's style was hostile."
good,"My day start at 7 we found out what line we will work today ,i learned how to work every line in the building the people i work with are very nice the hard part of the job was when i first started and had to learn everything the most enjoyable part is at the end of the day when it's time to clock out"
good,I spent more than 30 years at IBM and developed a very broad skill set in Finance and Sales. This experiences are invaluable as I move forward to my next set of opportunities.
good,IBM was a good company to work for. I enjoyed my time there. I had a wonderful Manager and learned a lot. My one beef with the company was that there seemed to be an expectation that all managers use the same management style. I understand that there are benefits to consistency but I believe there is also advantages to diversity. Pay was not extraordinary but not bad. There didn't seem to be very many opportunities for advancement.
good,"A good company to work for but the culture has changed for the worst since I initially joined in 1985. The education is very good, and sets you in a realistic position for another job."
good,"A IBM é uma grande empresa com muitos desafios profissionais e oportunidades de carreira, encontrando o departamento corretor e com vontade é possivel crescer na empresa, porém ultimanente enfrenta desafios financeiros que atrapalham a operação e retira automonia dos lideres. O salários da IBM tb não refletem a realidade do mercado"
good,Many years at IBM Growth was limited depending on what area of the business you are in. Salary and Benefits very fair.. management at mid levels excellent.
good,"Job security -- very little of it, people are good but fearful."
good,woman friendly workplace environment . managers were good. but very less salary increase. hardly ever got good increments. was able to change my doamin ea
good,"It was a nice work place. Supportive Colleagues, Excellent Manager. However the salary was very low. There is nothing much to add as I worked there only for 1 year."
good,"It is overall ok company, management is bit rude. Overall job is ok but domain switching opportunity is not there managers are not supportive of you being multi domain experts."
good,"I wasn't getting paid what I was worth. For the amount of work, responsibility, skill level and experience, I wasn't being compensated fairly. I had received only a single 3% raise in almost 10 years. I Left for more money and less stress."
good,"Strong relationship and partnership skills, working with clients to influence change and innovation into next generation RPO. "
good,"Es muy  interesante trabajar en IBM, yo trabajo en la parte de Asset Management para una empresa de gas de USA. He aprendido mucho y estoy muy contenta de ser parte de dicha empresa, destaco el hecho de tener días de homeworking y de esa manera poder realizar tanto mis tareas laborales como las de ama de casa y poder balancear mi vida como madre soltera de la mejor forma posible."
good,"Great place to learn"
good,Great place to work. Interfaced with people both domestic and international. A typical work day was interesting because you worked with personnel around the globe to solve problems.
good,Empresa boa mas nao nos proporcionava um crescimento e uma evolução nos cargos
good,"IBM is a global leader in Terms of Technology "
good,More pressure to produce results with deadlines. Always afraid that your job was in jeopardy as layoffs occurred several times a year. The work provided flexibility as needed and allowed.
good,IBM is struggling to find itself.  Keep your eyes open to what is going on around you.  Some are very safe and happy there.  If you are looking to go into hardware sales or development you may want to look somewhere else.
good,Can be difficult to find leadership truly invested in its people and putting the priority on people and not on meeting revenue numbers through whatever way possible.
good,IBM has plethora of knowledge base & people from different ethnicity. It has good work culture. You can learn a lot here. Your work-life balance depends on your manager else it's good to work here.Two things that I don't like here: 1) slow salary progression 2)They hire too many contractors which cause flux & insecurity
good,Started as a fresher out of college but got to meet a lot of people who were willing to help me out when stuck. Moved into new domain to learn new stuffs
good,"Basically one of the best companies to work for.Stressful at times but well compensated. To reduce production costs, management enlisted a temporary workforce which was hard to consistently train and unreliable. In my opinion this resulted in a sacrifice in quality of the product. This put undue stress on Regular employees and led to bad feelings among Leads & Quality Advocates and gave the impression that management was more interested in the bottom line than it's commitment to quality. Toward the end of my employment , business had reduced noticeably which led to layoffs. Some of this was due to the current business climate but the feeling around the plant was that poor management made it worse."
good,"A global cloud platform and cognitive solutions company continually evolving to remain at the forefront of technological innovation. "
good,"IBM was at one time the best company and best products and best service. No longer. In area I worked, they obsessed with off-shoring.  Off-shoring is being made at the expense of local workers, who know their jobs very well."
good,"IBM is probably the greatest Corporation there ever was . But like every great company or institution , it is facing some tough challenges . "
good,The work place is full of productive and fun working with co-employees and i have learned many things in my workplace culture. A typical day at work starts with a discussion what we need to  complete and achieve them before the set time.
good,"I worked in 3 different departments of IBM-Payroll, Cabling Dept and Accounts. In Payroll I was one of a team of 4 people and we had to get the salaries out each month to 1500 employees. In the Cabling Dept I recorded the expenses for each job.I got awarded Top Performer of the Year in Cabling Dept. One of the jobs I had in Accounts dept was ensuring we kept our blanket import licence with USA."
good,"Good and fun place to work"
good,"Quick paced environment, exciting work.  Company engages in frequent reduction in force so lack of job security is a concern.  Excellent compensation but lack of benefits"
good,"Overall within design studios, there is a great culture with young professionals and senior designers. It's enjoyable but, sometimes hard for advancement"
good,"Amazing technology with amazing people making a difference on a daily basis."
good,"Good work life balance with the opportunity to work remotely in case of genuine need and able to independently manage work remotely without impacting the work assigned to you."
good,Good company.  Very bureaucratic.  Great place to start.  Good benefits and the people are very smart.  Great training program. Good work life balance.
good,"Good Company."
good,"Working in an IBM Contract since looking for a better job, Unable to find any upgrade in the position and salary as well, Tried for entering for direct IBM Payroll but no use"
good,i joined IBM before 2 years and i learn alot of things in this filed of working.i learned many new things which made me technically strong.hardest part was the salary
good,Empresa com muitos processos e sistemas próprios. Você precisa ser muito bem relacionado para alcançar com maior agilidade méritos ou promoções. Em relação a benefícios é muito boa.
good,"IBM is really an awesome place to work for people who are looking to learn and grow technically. Although work life balance gets messed up in few projects. Great opportunities to learn. No much extracurricular activities, gym or employee engagement activities. Hikes per year are not much but again it counter balances the stability and security it provides"
good,"only one week off that too on any other day, not on saturday or on sunday. Different shifts, and heights those changes weekly. Employee finds very difficulty to adjust with changed shift every week."
good,"Great company to work , work life balance, learning , opportunities to move to different roles from technical to managerial is good.  Overall good but not comparable in the market on pay."
good,"A empresa foi um bom local para se criar ótimos relacionamentos profissionais, alguns amigos na vida pessoal com duração de década, apesar de nem trabalharmos juntos. Há muita troca de informação como não visto em outras empresas."
good,Trabalhei nesta empresa por 11 anos e sou muito grata por tudo. Ambiente corporativo mas clima entre funcionários muito agradável.
good,"Great vacation and pay and pretty good health care, dental benefits.  The company has been going through some downsizing over the last decade so job stability isn't what it used to be.  Great flexibility on when and where you work (though co-location is now a new restriction - i.e. certain sites are strategic for certain businesses, so you might need to re-locate to those if you were remote)."
good,"I worked from home mostly. I worked on projects that didn't need a lot of direction. Standing up servers and infrastructure and building production IT environments was the main focus."
good,Good interactions with employees with the ability to learn new skills. Stressful job with many hours and yearly stress of your job moving off shore to another country
good,Good to start here as training is given a lot of attention. But not enough growth afterwards. Good work-life balance. Work from home facility depending on your project.
good,"The job was good, except for the fact that the contractors are often furloughed and there are no benefits.  Overtime is not always approved but is often required to perform the job successfully."
good,BPO culture in Daksh. Leave issues even with genuine situations. Started as technical engineer. Promoted for twice and then they assigned me to a new project/process Advance Auto Parts AAP US.
good,Get a good designation and work it from there...... There are lot of departments to chose from even if you are a non technical person and training modules are good !
good,There is plenty of great work available for someone to do. Although there is a high competition type culture since there is no dead weight anymore. People you work with are very skilled and competent.
good,"Here in Vizag workplace culture is not good, There are lot of managers who are working from min 5 years and above, they do not know have enough knowledge, how to improve the product as well as growing the team, they will see security of themselves."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of reviewing new products and preparing for client meetings. During this process, learnt a lot about the IBM portfolio and technologies being used in the industry. The workplace was comfortable to work at and learning and performing well on the job was highly encouraged. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to grow and understand the different technologies and convey that to the clients as per their needs. The hardest part was doing all of this in a limited time frame."
good,"Strict company rules"
good,"A good place to work that is in the middle of changing their overall culture from top-down hierarchal to a more Agile change tolerant one. They are putting support structures in place for this change such as the Agile Academy.  They offer the ability to work from home, which is big plus in my book.  Opportunities for growth are available but you own your career. You must be focused on the actions that you need to take in order to move where you want to be."
good,Overall IBM is a good Company.IBM give flexibility to their employees.Work from home facility is there for any level fo employees.Also IBM is very trustworthy to its employees.
good,"Good company, good work culture, need to improve on compensation. Managers are posted at different locations, chances are that you never get to meet them face to face."
good,"I enjoyed my 25 years at IBM."
good,"Most roles allow you to be flexible and work from anywhere. Management is good in the weeds, but upper management makes poor decisions based on lack of patience and letting initiatives run their course. Many decisions made to please shareholders in the short term, but long term investments are lacking. Good benefits packages."
good,"Good learning experience. Work and personal life balance can be maintained here. Great opportunities for professionals to innovate."
good,"Good place to work with lot of different roles to play around. "
good,"Job and work life balance is good.  lots of training material to learn latest technologies, easy to move around around other technologies, Management need to improve more on sales"
good,The company has lot of line of businesses and thus every employee get more option to learn and grow. the security system is very strict. No work pressure (based on process to process)
good,Cognos was a great place to work. I felt proud to be working for an all Canadian company. It was very fast paced and busy at times supporting international internal clients.
good,"To work with an organization and leverage upon my skills by utilizing my capabilities to their optimum level, aim at continuous growth, success and team-work, to achieve organizational goals with commitment for every task given to me."
good,"Overseeing Cash postings & Month end closing activities for client."
good,Good place to work here. I love the process and the way we handle our clients.... Good experience to work here.... IBM awesome place to enjoy work experience.

good,"I was laid off after almost 3 decades, following the best year of my career. Mostly it was a great run. The company seems to be on a youth movement. I worked with top notch people who were extremely professional. Much less politics and drama than at most employers. Lots of flexibility with work-at-home and little in the way of micromanagement.  There are way too many reorganizations which have a tendency to really infuriate clients and have employees flying all over the country when they could be covering clients in their own geography."
good,"I was working as procurement specialist, operation buyer Malaysia"
good,Great work life balance. Excellent learning opportunities and support for first line management. However pay is generally below industry average and increases are hard to come by. Basically what you get hired on is likely what you will be earning for the foreseeable future.

As the reporting structure is an upward reporting, the team has high visibility to CFOs and Controllers. This is also the most challenging part of the work. However, having co-workers who practices team work, knowledge sharing among team members are encouraged, which have also made works simpler."
good,Name recognition and company offering are some of the best in the industry. Security and Analytics we the best products in the industry. Great place to work and the people are what make it great. IBM is struggling with leadership. I real enjoyed being able to compete each day and win.

good,"Concentrix is multinational company. It is "
good,Here we go again. Indeed needs a sanity check for this stuff. Indeed needs to create an escape to eliminate this nonsense. There is NO need for all of this typing other than a phishing expedition on companies. Indeed has no morals for doing this to us. I now seriously question this site (Indeed). I would not RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE!

good,"Depending on what role you are working as, your responsibilities can vary significantly. It also depends on the account that you are supporting.

good,"IBM has been an amazing place to work.  I enjoy working from home with freedom to manage my work/life schedule as needed.  I support primarily East coast operations and tend to be ""online"" for work around 7am PST.  This allows me time to spend with my family in the late afternoons and evenings.  I work about 10 hours a day but that is to be expected in this day in age of IT professionals at this level.I occasionally work an on-call rotation supporting all of IBM's GTS clients.  This happens about 4 times a year, twice on primary contact and twice on backup contact.  My typical work day is working remotely supporting customer's data center support needs.  I spend a lot of time on conference calls, writing technical support documents, implementing solutions and email.  My coworkers are top notch, highly skilled, technicians in their field. Knowledge sharing is key and critical in our industry and I never have to pry to get data from my colleagues.  The hardest part of the job is keeping it.  IBM's policy to offshore as much work as possible is creating a stressful work environment, diminishes morale, and supplies sub par service to accounts that sign up for IBM support.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my first line manager, the team of techs and the appreciation of my work from the clients."

good,"This is a great place to work, I've been working here since I graduated 15 years ago.  I work with an incredible team and was very well compensated for my efforts, however due to down turn in quarterly profits, I don't get to work with the same team and compensation is pretty well at a stand still.  I've spoken to others and it's the same issue in other places.  I know the grass isn't greener, but it would be nice to see a new lawn."
good,"Great  place to  start a career , supportive management . Space given for personal development .The day starts with  cheerful  good mornings, regular reports, checks. Toughest  part would be during disasters , when resources are limited and demand is high. The best of times comes when you receive ""thank you "" from customer ."

During the summer internship, I have helped co-workers to do account plans which basically did the researches on different companies (banks etc...) on their computing systems. The role of what IBM does, is to help other companies to improve their computing systems such as sercurity systems. On the other hand, after finished doing each account plan for individual company, I had to present infront of my co-workers and manager, also I had to meet clients with my co-workers on different working days."
good,"IBM's Seterus unit services loans. The HQ is in Oregon so many workers in RTP are remote. It is much harder to advance than IBM says it is, but they also offer a lot of training, which is good."
good,"I was in technical support team for new project. Lot of Knowledge transfers, learning new things. Received appreciations from client and Management."

good,"Empresa que cobra o auto desenvolvimento."
good,"A typical day starts with team huddle. Work environment is fliexible and good co workers. Higher management is knowledgeable and helpful if needed.

good,"After completing basic training I was advanced to the post ship team for a fortune 500 company. I loved being a subject matter expert and for the faith the company had in me and the feed backl I provided.

good,"A place to grow . "
good,Very good company for gaining experience telecom industry.
good,"One of the great things about my job at IBM is that I am able to dig into a network transition project that typically lasts anywhere from 6 to 9 months, complete the implementation, hand it off to the steady state team for 'day 2' support, and move onto a whole new project with a whole new team and an entirely different scope of work.  It has also provided me with the opportunity to manage cross-functional project teams and third party vendors who are critical to the success of our deployments.  The demands of the job force you to be a good time manager, and to manage your workload around a heavy meeting schedule.  The most difficult part of the job though, is the uncertainty over whether or not that next project will be there to roll over too after I close out the current one... and if it is there, whether or not it will be fully funded.  The potential of being furloughed or forced into a reduced work schedule has been an ongoing concern, which has worsened this year, especially because I am a contract employee."

good,"There were no typical work days, this is position required 100% travel, to all regions of the state. From installs and upgrades to break-fix calls. On some service calls I was the only technician on site, but at times I was part of a team of technicians, and many times I was the lead technician. Going on site, for the most part we knew what we would face, particularly with the upgrades calls, they were pretty much scripted. The break-fix call were get there, get it fix.

good,"IBM is a great place to work, however job security is a risk. Your day, if a salaried employee, can start and end within a window of time, to accommodate getting kids to school or picking them up, car pooling, those sorts of things. Management, the higher you go in the company, is too ready to pull the layoff trigger if your division is not making money, even if the entire company is profitable."

He apredndido muchisimas cosas como el manejo de la presión y el trabajo en equipo a través de mi experiencia laboral. La parte más dificil del trabajo es equilibrar la vida personal con el mismo ya que al pasar mucho tiempo dentro de la empresa ha sido un poco complicado. Por otra parte, lo mejor del trabajo son los aprendizajes que no son solo profesionales sino de vida. Y la ventaja de trabajar con un gran equipo de profesionales que dia tras dia enseña a manejar las situaciones de la mejor manera."
good,"I have been with IBM over 26 years now, and I love the poeple I have meet over the years. I enjoy the work I do. The company seems to keep off shoring, and this is a rality here in the USA."

good,"Empresa com ambiente de trabalho muito agradável porém trabalho num projeto com muitas pessoas e as chances de ascensão profissional acabam ficando limitadas. Sempre tive, e tenho, um relacionamento muito bom com meus colegas de trabalho e com a gerência. A parte mais difícil do trabalho é que no meu projeto seguimos o calendário americano, portanto, há quase 5 anos não tenho os feriados nacionais.

good,I work in Strategy & Transformation which is the management consulting arm of IBM. While important to the strategy of the company it is not where the company is setting its priorities.

good,"The work was a regular steady flow and sometimes so involved that it could be stressful. I enjoyed the work and felt confident in myself. My boss was a good man but not always as stern and disciplined as he should be with employees. He often allowed to much office drama with one person in particular. Most of the people that I had teh opportunity to work with were great team players.The hardest part of the job was dealing with the drama and backstabbing in the front office by one particular person. This person always made me feel like I was beneath them and had way too much authority. She was very deceptive but the boss could not seem to see threw it or just chose not to, I am not sure.The atmosphere of work was very enjoyable and I thoroughly enjoyed the position. I learned at this position to leave your family problems at home and that all people were not what they were percieved as."
good,"IBM India has a nice work culture, helps to maintain good work-life balance. Flexibility is very much there. Plus, there are many peace-of-mind benefits that I did not find elsewhere."
good,Management need to give employees more accountable assignments and base reviews from all contacts employee worked with.

I worked in a call center in a casual atmosphere handling 50-60 clients a day. I learned soft skills in addition to my technical skills I already had. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting feedback from a customer telling me that I provided excellent service for them."
good,"The company is built on a solid financial foundation, and has stellar values and expectations for honesty and integrity."
good,"I have a love/hate relationship with my current career. I love working for IBM as a company, the vision, the senior leadership and the prestige of a 101 year old company. I am a work-aholic and with places like IBM that feeds my type A personality. I work 10, sometimes 14 hour days, every day. I work weekends 4-6 hours each day and it is my fault."
good,"The most noticeable fact about IBM was that they maintain the ""Open door"" policy to the core , there are no separate cabins for Managers or Sr. Managers, every one sits in cubical. Also there is a freedom of logging in from any of the IBM locations, may be IBM has the max number of remote workers. Such routine things if under scrutiny might not aid the right environment for employees but stead, here we had the willingness to put in more efforts as all other things were at ease. Loved the work environment here."
good,Too much of process which makes work cumbersome.
good,"Great Support environment to work in, Team Leads are patient and Supportive and can always be called upon for assistance."

good,the company introduced me to a different world. it helped me developed my communication skills and be able to deal with people world wide
good,Opportunity to acquire new technical skills in a variety of business environments.
good,"Initially a great company, one of the best. Management was either tremendous or poor depending on the project; always a secure place to work until they hired a head hunter CEO; after that people were always looking over their shoulder. IBM management lost their agressiveness and the way to get to the bottom line was to layoff as opposed to being creative"
good,"t IBM, we believe in world-changing progress: the full application of intelligence, reason and science to improve business, science and the human condition."
good,"IBM is a good place to work if you are looking for a work life balance."
good,"I tend to go above and beyond to get the result the customer expects and I enjoy doing so, it gives me a sense of accomplishment. There are challenges I love to undertake and feel great when I figure them out in a timely manner and too the satisfaction of the user."
good,"The Carrier growth is limited. Process  is very important. It is not a employee driven company rather a manager driven company. I enjoyed working in IBM as I was getting involved in projects and accounts which I directly do not manage, as it is a huge company and has a huge client base I had a lot of extra projects to work on and i simmply loved it."

good,"Good company... struggling with its place in the modern technology market, but seems to be finding its path and seeing successes.  The aquisition of Red Hat may help push them further along."
good,Ho lavorato in IBM per 16 anni e nonn posso che dire che è stata una bellissima esperienza di crescita.
good,Organization premises and the environment is good for the personnel. They providing lot of allowance to the personnel.where the management hierarchy is the fundamental factor of making good relationship in between business
good,Had an opportunity to work with different technologies and different areas of business for clients. Had a good work life balance with flexible hours and good supportive management.
good,Most of the permanent employees are familiar with doing things the IBM way. Of course there is a management hierarchy that extends vertically and horizontally. The concerns of your business unit may be impacted by adjacent business units but it is easy to get assistance on any task. There are plenty of people willing to assist you.
good,"Best place to learn. Have many IBM badges."
good,"work culture depends on your team, as well as morale. Overall satisfied with my experience. Not much room for advancement. OT is considered a bad word. Great benefits, though the 401k match is only once a year."
good,IBM is a relaxed culture that allows their employees to feel relaxed withing a busy work environment. It's a place that contains many great people to work with!
good,"Its good if you are a regular."
good,IBM has an excellent work life balance.  Benefits are good overall.  Not much opportunity for advancement if you are not an engineer or software developer.
good,"Very good place to work for in terms of knowledge, learning, and work life balance. However, salaries, benefits and career advancements are not as good in comparison to other big companies. In summary, if you have options and you know you have potential then choose a more dynamic company."
good,IBM provides a video range of training and that's good for a newcomer. The work environment is fast paced but not stressful. But I think they lack in rewards a recognition area... People are not appreciated enough and that lowers the team spirit.
good,Working at IBM was a great experience! There are a wealth of technical and communicative skills necessary to succeed due to multi-national nature of this company.
good,IBM has been a good company to work for over the years. I have been with the company for 20 years. Typical day at work is going into the office and spending a lot of time on phone calls or in meetings. Working in presentations and xls files. I learned a lot over the years that got me to where I am now. Management is hit or miss. I have had some great managers who look out for you and some who are looking out for themselves. Hardest part to the job is meeting your revenue targets. Best part of job is coaching new people to your business unit or new hires to shape them into what the job role needs.
good,Good work-life balance. Good exposure to technology. Got to learn new languages. Made many many good friends. Worked on a new product called IBM Cloud Orchestrator.
good,"Overall my experience in working in IBM was excellent. I had learned many new things which I was not aware of it. A lot of memory was created during this tenure which made my journey fun ride. There were ups and downs in this period, which had to manage reasonably well."
good,"good experience in general but with less growth. it honestly just depends on your management and leads, along with the kind of project you receive and get to learn from it."
good,Enjoyed my time there. Remote work was available and that was a great benefit as it allowed for a better family life. Great educational opportunities as well.
good,It was good experience  with IBM India Ltd. And good place for fresher to  start there career with lot of to learn and share your experience.It is one of the best for job.
good,"Good Place to work and get your aspirations aligned "
good,"Good place to learn and collaborate. Management is fine but you won't always find leaders who are very clear in what they are doing. Opportunities for exploring your capabilities are good, you can always try your hand on new technology and master it."
good,"Empresa tem grandes oportunidades, mas dependerá da gerência, o salário não é muito bom, mas compensa trabalhar pelos benefícios."
good,"Focus remains achieving quarterly revenue targets.  Opportunity to learn is there if the employee is willing to pursue, don’t expect management direction  or assistance to attain career goals."
good,I like working at IBM as I was working at a process driven and happy environment.  Clients and IBM employees were greatly appreciated and there was a lot of understanding.
good,IBM was great company to work for. I was a top performer so they took care in promoting me to numerous positions in the company. They even provided an executive relocation when they wanted me to relocate for a new role.
good,"A great place to work. great work-life balance, but too much internal politics. Few opportunities for advancement and growth. technology not that great for a technology company"
good,"Working with users with Desktop issues, configure Computers for new starters. Provide excellent Customer Service while meeting the SLA for requests. provide IMAC activities for users in the office."
good,It was very good experience to work with IBM client . I learnt so many things at my work place . The Company is employee oriented company.  the management is very flexible
good,"Empresa boa de trabalhar,"
good,Being a fresher IBM has given me ample opportunities. But the people here are very slow paced. Salary structure should be looked at. And one thing i meed to add is that in training they should give options to people on what they want to get trained on.
good,"Solid company it is huge though so important to find mentors. Have had many roles within the company, hard to generalize based on my experience because there are so many people. Maternity leave policy is great 4.5 months paid with sometimes option for part time."
good,"Laid back and flexible hours"
good,"Great place to work, great people, but no job security. Does not matter how well you perform once Finance begins annual planning sessions - short sighted decisions at times to appease Wall Street, And way too many middle managers remain"
good,A typical day involved being on the phone and fielding 30-40 calls per day. The most difficult part about the job was that you are held to high standards for time to answer and your talk time.
good,Relaxed and convenient job and good place to work. Specially for womens it nice place to work. can grow with multiple domains .. cross training provided in this company
good,Las personas del equipo son amables pero la cultura no es tan abierta como en Argentina.
good,very relaxed and chilled out. However not all teams are the same. Saw an issue of favoritism among leaders. Pay and work quality could be improved. Some teams could be rejigged.
good,"A typical day was fast-paced and included multi-tasking.  A very productive environment that rewarded hard work.  Management was not very involved with employees, but that gave the employee latitude in completing projects."
good,"The key goal of IBM's work culture is 360 degrees fairness to all associated stakeholders. This means zero tolerance to any form of discrimination, evaluating performance solely on merit to stimulate healthy competition to enable the company and employees to thrive in a competitive world. "
good,"I enjoyed the team I was on - there are a lot of people at this organization so you need to make sure you build your internal brand."

good,"Good company but slow career advancement.Not easy to change team."
good,"Managers company. There are a lot of good thing as well as bad things. "
good,Massive systems that are inspiring just in their sheer size. It easy to get lost at IBM but the systems they host and maintain is worth taking a look.
good,IBM is more focusing and Productive environment and client success. Getting more exposure to working  on different projects and technologies. People are helpful in organization.
good,"Good place to work overall with intelligent people.  Everyone comes together to get the job done.  Unfortunately, many of the people have left due to company restructuring."
good,"Environment that i work on, is really the best. IBM as a whole is the best company to work on, for any individual. I would definitely recommend IBM to everyone."
good,"Great leadership principles and many fantastic projects. However, culture isn't the same in different parts of the company, in spite of similar roles."
good,"great work and life balance, and according to the employees' satisfactory rate of the company, it totally depends on the team you are in. If you have a good boss, maybe it is very great."
good,Great place to work and heading in the right direction.  Drove new business aka White Space.  Landed and expanded current accounts.  Lead Innovation team
good,Excellent place for Work life balance. Flexibility to employees is major pro in IBM. All my managers I have worked with in IBM were supportive in every aspect .
good,Cost saving was a big focus during my time there but actions and procedures incorporated were the exact opposite. The job culture was great and I enjoyed going to work in that data center.
good,"Buen lugar para laborar, buena cultura, pero poca oportunidad para ser promovido"
good,"Hello,"
good,"My experience with IBM was mostly positive. The work environment  was at the client site as I worked as It Specialist supporting Sears Canada! As Sears Canada had out sourced to IBM, there was a lot of turmoil and stress and most Sears staffed had left and the remaining staff plus new IBM staff were left to support Sears Systems. That in itself created stress. I find the training interesting and their facility at 3600 steeles intersting also"
good,made me realize i deserved something better and made me shift my perspective towards development and technology and made me work towards what i am capable of
good,My life at IBM has been fun and very worthwhile. The atmosphere is very relaxed and informal and has been very enjoyable. Overall I would say my experience working with IBM has been a pleasant one.
good,"My time at IBM was some of the greatest experiences of my life.  I was able to learn the SW business in one of the most dynamic companies in the world, while traveling from coast to coast."
good,Management is very supportive and introduces new and improved process improvements to reduce the pressure. Peers are also very helpful to each other. People co-ordinate with each other which makes working fun even though work pressure is present.
good,"Various people with various backgrounds. The management I met was poor and I was only assigned basic work. Good work-life balance though. The clients in Beijing are all government-related, which was terrible for me."
good,"Large international company"
good,The environment was a bit depressing but peers are willing to work with you and help out as everyone is the same boat.  Job security is never there as layoffs happen frequently.  Good experience and a lot of very smart people to learn from.
good,Good place to work generally but there are better companies. IBM is a great place for women employees. not that great for men. IBM just focus on business and you do not have time for any other activity
good,Enjoyed working at IBM.  Had a great experience working at IBM.  On request management provided work from home options on emergence basis.  Work life is balance is very good at IBM.
good,I worked as contractor in IBM Canada & USA. Work culture is great and peoples over there professional. There was minimum discrimination between contractors and full timer with reference to provide opportunities to learn new technologies / hardware
good,"IBM is going through some fundamental shifts in focus and culture.  The changes are difficult, but necessary in order to remain relevant and responsive to our customers' needs."
good,You can have a career at IBM but not many last more than 10 years. Process intensive can lead to many delays on deals and projects. Good place to get some education and learning on the fly.
good,Job was not difficult.  Easy work environment. Management was good.  Extra education was available for IBM products including IBM Watson and the various components.
good,"IBM offered a variety of career paths and the opportunity to work with new and emerging technologies. The team members are some of the best in the industry, many of which are excellent mentors."
good,"IBM, é uma das maiores empresas do nosso planeta, foi gratificante fazer parte do corpo funcional desta companhia durante quase 11 anos."
good,"bad managemt and bad bad co-worker and non team workd. a polital comapny, it will be a good place for 70 percent chinese people included 1st and 2nd lne manager"
good,"I have been there for years and I am able to balance my work and life. and learnt new things as technical and personal. I was proud to be an IBMer, lot of opportunities available to grow horizontal and vertical in the organization."
good,"Working from a home office for almost 20 years has afforded me work life balance, even though I work on average 50+ a week. Not everyone has the discipline to work from home but it has allowed me to raise a family and deliver exceptional outcomes."
good,"- Good career opportunities to explore and grow your skill set"
good,"Lacks company benefits that IBM alike companies provide. "
good,"IBM is awesome to learn and grow, it provides many tools for improvement and training. It is a place where you can easily access very skilled people to ask about anything you want to learn and become a better professional."
good,"A typical work day at IBM would be to work on accounts that are assigned to look for any additional growth opportunities of existing accounts. Another would be to help answer RFI/RFPs and prepare for customer demonstrations. The sales teams that I worked with were all incredible and helpful throughout my time there. The only issue that I had was that the pay did not commensurate with the level of work output and the size of deals when it came to commissions. Outside of that, excellent place to work."
good,"Great place to work, with a large amount of learning resources available. "
good,"being one of the largest businesses in the world, IBM models the typical work environment one would expect when thinking about how a business looks and runs."
good,IBM provides a lot of opportunity to work from client locations and to work remotely. The hardest part of the job is to find a new relevant project . One needs to have connections & a strong network to be able to grab opportunities
good,"Companies who understand that Proposal Management can be VERY effectively done from any location, and who support that model of employment, should be commended.  IBM does, and it works very well.  Occasional in-person meetings are reasonable, and expected for particularly complex responses, but otherwise requiring a daily in-person presence in an office does little more than waste time and gasoline."
good,Working in IBM I've learned and gained a lot of experiences. The management was very good in handling employees and my colleagues and manager are all friendly plus with good compensation. I am very proud working in IBM and hope for the company's growth and success.
good,"They trusted you to do the work right."
good,Good place to work but keep in mind you are practically an independent contractor.  Good for experience and the resume but you can get let go at anytime.  Not this is not your fathers IBM.
good,The experience was productive and challenging. Typical workplace culture was the most challenging aspect as is often the case when so many people work in one location.
good,"Good company, good benefits and  they have a lot of resources to help you expand your knowledge .Lots of areas to grow within the company if you train for it. Enjoy my job with IBM.  As far as work life balance depends on the customer your supporting.  Job is only as stable as contract your working on."
good,IBM is big company with lot of  bureaucracy.  But very big knowledge base with lot of technologies and lot of educational resources. salary and benefits are not so good.
good,IBM was a very good company to have worked for.  Management was very supportive of their employees.  They were willing to accept new ideas and procedures.
good,"You will get to work with some really clever new technologies, although IBM has too many products many of which compete against each other.  Middle managers excellent although company structure is overly complex. No real career paths unless you are a sales person. Work from home a lot, good perks / benefits. Headcount is strictly controlled by the numbers game, and expect an annual cull, especially of the more mature workers!"
good,"It was one of the best professional experiences I have ever had! The kind of flexibility and very co-operative on-shore team. The only sad part was, translators were not recruited on the IBM payroll. And since the Third Party vendor did not offer any salary hike for 2 years, I had to look for job change."
good,"Muy buena empresa, ma cambio de ciudad por eso estoy buscando trabajo"
good,It was fun interacting with and building and creating morale with my team. It was awesome to motivate them  watching them develop into rounded agents who could accomplish every required goal to meet the company's bottom line.
good,"I worked with incredible people, learned a lot about the complexities of analyzing the data and financial performance of a multinational technology behemoth."
good,"work environment   good & cool but salary bit of less.We will learn alot while working with different accounts.Nice work culture but No promotion and hike"""
good,"Before the major layoffs in the 1990s, it was the dream job I had always looked for and wish that I was able to continue with. I was one of the 8000+ casualties of the layoffs.  I was very happy there."
good,"Over the course of time working at IBM there was always priority given to our customers. Internally there was a strong sense of value shown towards the employee through incentives, recognition and awards. The culture was one of open corporation among teams. The most enjoyable part of the job were the opportunities to be creative and participate in many leading edge initiatives."
good,IBM's consulting will give you a chance to learn quite a bit in a short amount of time. This is specifically the case when you are someone who seeks out opportunities.
good,"Working for IBM in Buffalo was a nice experience. Working the weekends was kind of boring, but we kept busy. "
good,"I only worked for ibm for a little over 1 year. I was transitioned to ibm from att under a contract agreement. Since I continued to support the att products, I never got a chance to get acclimated to ibms culture and learn about their company to see where I would fit in."
good,"Working with IBM, was a great opportunity for me to delevop my skills especially in printer and computer repairs. The added opportunity to learn things like coding and web page design also was a great bonus."
good,"The opportunity to head up business development efforts for IBM, as they rolled out the IBM Spectrum Storage Suite, and to be part of a growing market in a technology-driven industry was advantageous through networking with C-Level / IT Leaders as well as leveraging professional development skills."
good,"One of the best place to work especially for women but if you expect the salary hike/bonus every year as other organizations, then its not the place for you."
good,"It all depends on your manager who you work under,  "
good,Company is committed to finding growth high growth segments.  Acquisition of Red Hat is exciting as it solidifies IBM as a cloud provider.  Strong management team.  Culture gets a bad wrap.
good,Leuke werkgever met veel opleidingsmogelijkheden. Soms was de werkdruk een beetje hoog.
good,"IBM is good IT company and good working environment and lot of onsite opportunities and can stay for longer period only constraint is the salary, GDP and PA"
good,Have been working with IBM close to now 10 years. Have been fortunate to work on multiple projects across the continents and have got the right exposure at the right time. This is an organization that is flexible to give its employee adequate time for the family also.
good,"Empresa gigante do mercado de TI, mas extremamente burocrática."
good,no opinion worked there for 20 years in the begining IBM was a great company to work for thru the years management and demand became very hard to please
good,"El ambiente y trato es excelente, las oportunidades de crecimiento son un reto que se ofrecen con las personas y áreas muy accesiblemente, ademas se tiene una cultura de aprendizaje y capacitaciones constantes."
good,"Quando ci si trova all'interno di un progetto le giornate lavorative possono diventare un po' routinarie, ma l'ambiente di lavoro è in generale molto stimolante e piacevole. Inoltre IBM crede nello sviluppo delle competenze dei propri dipendenti. Purtroppo a volte però la volontà di ottenere una certa crescita professionale può andare a discapito del bilancio vita - lavoro."
good,"Nice place to work provide the management is good too."
good,"Management was extremely strict - no employee motivation. Despite that, they did offer a very comfortable working environment and working hours. If they had a different manager, I would recommend working at IBM."
good,"A great place to work if you want to work remotely, that's the only benefit."
good,Great place to work. Employee friendly. Exceptionally good work-life balance. Provides so much to learn on their learning portals.Very Good work culture with good people
good,Great location loads of parking though can take some time to walk to your desk but great people. Food options can be limited to purchase but many kitchenettes to heat and prepare food
good,I started my career in IBM as a test engineer whish was under C2H position. I loved working in IBM with my team. Good work culture and availability for work from home
good,"Tienen una cultura de mucha seguridad en los edificios. Sin embargo la manera de trabajar en los puestos es desordenada. Tambien la descripción de los puestos no es muy específica, te das cuenta de que todo lo que haces solo cuando ya entraste al puesto."
good,At IBM the working environment was like my previous job at ABN AMRO. It just was more strict and demanding. Working load was reasonable. The only negative is that they expected improvements from every annual  review.
good,This was a call center opportunity which pretty much ran like one. All about business here. Not too many employee engagement opportunities. It had it's good moments along with the bad. But this is exactly what you would expect in a older company that's been around a while.
good,"- great place to attend training sessions and workshops (Internal and External)"
good,Overall it's good and flexible working atmosphere. It's great place to work and learn new things and connect to people across the globe. Highly recommend.
good,"When I joined the company the company, It fulfilled my expectations at that time, gave me opportunities to work in different projects and gave me flexible hours of working."
good,"I have been there for 10 years, and overall, I have been treated well.  I have had many opportunities come my way and have been given choices to make about my future."
good,Colleagues were fun to work with but the company as a whole did not value employees because the company started laying off quality employees in order to balance their books.
good,"It's a good company ,main thing is job security, sufficient leaves, unlimited sick leave,u can take work from home also depends on projects. overall nice company to work."
good,Great place to work but IBM needs to pay their employees better. Sometimes feels like there is no growth. External certifications and education is not awarded monetarily.
good,"as I approached retirement age, there was less effort by staffing team to get me assigned to projects."
good,"good place to work, they provide you freedom to be innovative and creative to deliver quality software products.  they provide the necessary trainings and resources to improve your skills"
good,"I think IBM is not different in any country where this company is stablished. So I think I don't need many words to write a review about IBM. But, as a place to learn, this is for sure a good company."
good,"Nice and fast pace place, most co-workers are very easy going, atmosphere is great, food is ok, fresh, very nice customers (almost always the same customers) we provide service to multiple buildings, offices, and personal."
good,"Still a good place to work but not as good as it used to be.  Benefits are good, Work-Life balance is good but there are frequent layoffs, or at least there have been in the past."
good,"I worked for IBM Singapore in the Asian Travel and Transportation market.  I was all over Asia based on our customers - South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore.  We often used the team approach to our customers.  Depending on what they wanted, we brought in the right people.  The hardest part of my job was having conference calls at 5 am  ending the day at another call at 11 pm because of the location.  For me it was very stressful but I tried to not show it. Going from United Air Lines (etc) where I worked more on the Continental US to an international company where they have staff everywhere and experts in everything,  it was overwhelming.  There was no typical day!  But everyone at IBM was really nice to work with."
good,"The work atmosphere was pleasant with a great group of people who shared ideas and best practices to enhance everyone's work performance."
good,Needed to find a role that was a better fit. The company provided a lot of opportunities and seems to be recovering from layoffs that were recent at the office location I worked at.
good,In 1974 IBM was a fertile environment for a young college graduate that had a technical bent; there were seemingly endless exposures to component parts whose availability stimulated thought & imagination that were fertile soil for innovative ideas & invention. The chemical projects I worked on daily were equally enjoyable & educational. I cannot recall a hard part of the job.
good,"I was with IBM for 3 years and I am gratefull to IBM for learning everything I did and giving me an oppurtunity to grow and make a life changing decision that I am super proud of."
good,Good for working mothers.Great work life balance.Good amount of learning experience and the management is supportive.Overall a fantastic place to work.
good,Mooi bedrijf maar helaas zijn vele werkzaamheden afgestoten en /of naar de lageloon landen gegaan waardoor er voor het meeste  technische personeel geen ruimte meer was. Binnen het bedrijf is er veel respect voor het personeel en is de relatie met collega's respectvol en prettig. Mijn fantastische werk op het datacenter kwam te vervallen omdat het datacenter naar België is verhuisd.
good,"I recently retired. IBM was my last job. I was at IBM for 18 years. I have 20 years previous experience in Silicon Valley with 5 other companies and  befor that with a couple of ""old school"" fortune 500 companies. So I have aperspective perhaps different from most IBMers. It is my impression IBM wants to be a ""Silicon Valley"" type company But is still struggling with it large East Coast business values. And this mix varies  depending were you are in IBM. Unlike days of old, the new hires for the most part do not look upon IBM as a life time job. (And should not since IBM has changed and will ""resource action"" employees regularly.)  The old timer who joined out of college are fewer and fewer and less of the mix. And the best to work with. Since those that are left are ""first rate"". But they are also just trying to last as long as possible before retirement. Those in mid age (30-40s) have decide to stay as long as possible, but are open to opportunities in other companies. "
good,I've learned a lot at IBM. However not really a place for advancement if you live in the U.S. Most job openings are out of the country. The most enjoyable part oof the job is the people you meet.
good,IBM was a productive and great place to work for. They are a family fist company and has a fair compensation program.  I worked at this company for 4 years and had great managers
good,"There are high expectations at IBM but the benefits are incredible.  This is a self-driven company.  If you want to advance, you need to take the initiative.  There are opportunities to get a mentor and to move around, but these are not things that are pushed, you must self-initiate these changes.  There is a huge online culture, so prepare yourself to do much of your interacting with your colleagues remotely."
good,"The hardest part of the roles in IBM is ensuring all the key stakeholders have as many of their requirements documented and met via a number of rigorous reporting methodologies. "
good,Professioneel IT bedrijf met een goede samenwerking. Het is te merken dat de meeste medewerkers trots zijn om ´IBMer´ te zijn. Goed ondersteuning van management om in je carriére door te mogen groeien - wordt zelfs gestimuleerd.
good,They provided extensive opportunity to learn.  I was taught project management and they reimbursed my entire BS degree.  Opportunities to travel and attend conferences.  A day working from home was on the phone all day communicating with other teams around the world.
good,During my tenure of 9+ years in IBM I have grown from a junior to a middle management level and at the same time I was able to keep myself aware and hands on in technical area. Management has been very supportive and often gave free hand to manage work and team.
good,"I was working as a mainframe tech lead for nationwide insurance.cobol jcl vsam db2 cics."
good,"The typical day in IBM was fast-paced and demanding, I was in charge of delivering post to the 6 buildings on the campus. I brought in the post at around 8.45am and sorted it out to distribute to the different buildings. I learned and observed how people in the 'real' working world operate as it was my first time working in a large MNC. My manager was very helpful and gave me the required training in order to carry out my daily tasks. The workplace culture was generally relaxed, but there was the underlying hard-work ethic among the staff. The hardest part of the job was the time management aspect of having to manage what order I did which jobs, for example, I would have to decide and manage whether to deliver post or ensure if the confidential waste bins should be shredded or if printers were needed to be topped up. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with different office workers who worked in different departments which showed me what to expect when I start working for such a company in the future."
good,"A typical day at IBM consisted of: coming into work, booting up your computer, do work or converse until the morning meeting.  After the meeting get back to work and update servers.  I learned how to navigate through 2003, 2008 and other Windows servers.  The work culture is fantastic.  Very relaxed and easy going.  The only reason I left IBM was because at the time they were down sizing."
good,"The IBM brand status has steadily decreased since I was there. I don't now what it is like anymore. "
good,Continua capacitación a los empleados. Posibilidad de hacer carrera. Exceso de responsabilidad a puestos con sueldos bajos en relación a cargos altos.
good,"Pesado muy demandante, incluyendo días festivos, no fue muy ameno laborar ahí."
good,"IBM is a solid company but like every other company, it needs to shave its operating costs.  So it goes through cycles of hiring and laying off.  It's hard to enjoy work living through those processes."
good,I enjoyed the people i worked it with. very good mix of cultures learned alot about different people.management was cool had some bad ones for the most part great. hardest part was staying up some nights but mostly good.
good,"A typical day at IBM starts with a teleconference covering the status of the testing engineers. Then, each tester begins or resumes tests on servers. These tests include set-up and instillation of hardware and software on servers. All steps must be documented for the final test results. Each tester is responsible for running tests as efficiently and completely as possible."
good,"Overall a good company to work for. Lots of opportunity for learning, career growth and compensation. Extremely stressful at each quarter end as unattainable sales targets are generally missed across sectors."
good,"As a consultant, I was able to travel and work with different companies.  Got into Project Management with IBM which made my job more enjoyable.  Would work here again."
good,"Good place for Work life Balance/Self Learning, and sometimes Classroom training as well."
good,Great Place to work but not for a fresher cause there is no scratch to top knowledge given to freshers and increase in salary is also difficult cause IBM focuses on work. It is a good place to come when you have a good profile and you want to secure and live a easy life after all the struggle for fresher advice is to get a very good profile in IBM or go to a company where you can upgrade your skills first.
good,"Empresa boa de se trabalhar, ambiente agradável, dinâmica."
good,"Good company for fresh graduates. However, they cannot assure to put designate you based on your primary skills. Work At Home is a Privilege for regular employees. "
good,"Ik heb bij IBM een enorm dynamische tijd mogen hebben waarbij ik mijn IT scope behoorlijk heb kunnen verbreden, ook op internationaal niveau."
good,"Ensures work safety, flexible working hours, a lot of opportunities to learn. Provides a lot of compensation benefits. You are exposed to a lot of technologies"
good,"I am responsible for calendar management for three executives.  Scheduling meetings, booking travel and assisting in team events."
good,"O ambiente de trabalho é bem competitivo, mas compensa a correria diária, pois quando seu trabalho é reconhecido vc ganha reconhecimento, há incentivo, o pacote de salário e benefícios é bem atrativo, existe história na empresa e pessoas que acreditam nela. Não é raro vc encontrar nos corredores gente com mais de 20 anos de casa. Como toda empresa, a IBM também tem as suas crises, mas os funcionários se mantém engajados. Inspira. "
good,可能过公司于庞大，感觉内部沟通不够简洁流畅，机构化严重。但外企的氛围还是不错的。工作环境也好。总的来说不错的企业。
good,IBM has invested significant time and effort in promoting an inclusive and welcoming culture.  They have perks such as food/beverages available in the office and host after hours events for employees to socialize.
good,"Was a great experience, however it's very difficult to move from a contract role to a full-time employee role.  The environment is very collaborative, typically you know where you stand with your superiors.  IBM is trying to turn the corner to focus on cutting edge technologies, it was very interesting work."
good,"Pros "
good,Was a consultant and enjoyed avoid working here. I was assigned to a good team but trying to interface with other teams is often met with resistance as it seems that everyone is working towards protecting their kingdoms.
good,"So yeah, back in 2015 I did IR Installation as a temp job at IBM. Took a few weeks, but it was really nice overall. Loud Servers, cold rooms, pleasant to listen to audiobooks while working in."
good,"Good oraganisation for ladies to balance work l"
good,"The workplace is fun with helpful Leads and Colleagues."
good,A global company that has gone through a considerable off shoring exercise over the years. Focus has moved from excellent customer service to reduced budgets and cost. Typically great employees but difficult working conditions.
good,"working in IBM had become painful for lack of assertion and creativity by managers. It is hard to figure out stakeholders, and immediate managers do not help. to make an idea into a working project is so hard not because of the technical difficulties but because nobody knows who the sponsor is, customer involvement is barely there."
good,Job security is issue since they are releasing/ off boarding their resources. But work balance is ok. They are not allowing resources to work during weekends without approval from supervisor
good,This is a contract job through Manpower.  My contract runs out this week but has been extended while job searching.  Typical day is welcoming new employees and assisting existing ones.  I've learned a few new computer skills and how to interact effectively with employees of different ethnic backgrounds.  The workplace is very interactive and somewhat fast paced.  I really enjoy meeting  and being of assistance to many different employees of several diverse cultures.
good,"Cultura e ambiente de trabalho são excelentes, cursos internos oferecidos muito produtivos."
good,"its nice place to work and having fun with work, nice workplace culture, enjoyable place. I learnt that how to manage the resource efficient way and assign work."
good,"A great company to learn how to be a business professional.  The lessons learned surrounding expectation, execution, accountability, and results were invaluable."
good,"IBM is a good place for beginners as a platform. Role wise, I am happy to work with IBM. However, salary hike is comparatively minimal. "
good,Excelente empresa com valores importantes para o ambiente profissional. Focada em diversidade e inclusão.
good,"Good working place to learn and grow in knowledge. IBM have a significant array of products; most are middleware that enable businesses to conduct transactions to serve their customers. At IBM, you will learn a lot about the products offering and master some few ones so that you can become a Subject Matter Expert (SME), who can speak both at breadth and depth about them to customers."
good,"Es una compañía que permite, a través de sus cursos virtuales, crecer dentro de la misma, siempre y cuando se cuente con el tiempo necesario para poder certificarse. En área de Help Desk no se cuenta con dicho tiempo por la cantidad de flujo de llamadas"
good,"Ingresé a IBM por el programa jovenes profesionales (Developer)"
good,"respectable company that overall knows how to serve their clients, I would join them again, nothing more to say no more tosay no more to say no more to say"
good,"Excellent work life balance, best place for learning ,management is average, Good training opportunities,  low salary hikes but overall great experience"
good,"I worked form home at IBM and enjoyed it a lot. It allowed me to be productive and be able to care as a single Parent for my son who has autism. I started out in the Center in Debuque, Iowa, and was double promoted to the team lead position. I worked under excellent managers the whole time , the salary was not good however, but it was a job. I was able to grow and take on not only Team lead for UNIX, but for Windows too and Security Focal."
good,"Um lugar onde eu cresci muito profissionalmente, obtive muitos exitos e acredito que a experiencia adquirida será levada para a vida toda."
good,"Innovative and customer focus.  "
good,"Global corporation, with incredibly talented individuals coming together to provide the best solution for the customer. Very process driven, can be a double edged sword. Difficult to maintain work-life balance as you are always on the go. Do not care for personal or family needs."
good,"Ability to work as required, and still have personal items taken care of.  No one watching over your shoulder.  Enjoyed the ability to take work with me on the road while heading to vacation, and also get things done while on vacation, so as not to miss anything."
good,"IBM is a process drive company with strict info sec rules and guidelines. Its a truly global company with the best in class training's, skills development programs etc."
good,"Hard to get a raise even with excellent yearly reviews. Otherwise good place to work, My managers have been good, Only complaint is that I've been here going on 5 years and have only gotten one cost of living increase."
good,Work / Life balance and diversity & inclusion frame the culture fostered in IBM. There are opportunities to grow but you must keep a pulse on the business direction.
good,"I work from 8-5 Monday through Friday. I have learned how to better use copy machines and replace parts in them. I have learned to better use Microsoft Office, have a great manager that is always there for support and any questions I may have. My counterpart is an excellent worker and we get along very well and in turn work well together. Most enjoyable part of my job is being respected by all the people in the office because they know that I am good at my job and can always help them with any problem that they may have. I have learned that the harder you work the better the results and the more accountability you gain."
good,IBM is an incredible place to work. The culture they work so hard to grow and maintain is unparalleled and management trusts each person to do their job so work/life balance is incredible.
good,"Great company but the salaries are very low compared to similar jobs in the market."
good,"IBM is a great company to work with. However management team in some departments are not always qualified. "
good,IBM is a great company to work for. The only problem is they contract out most of their work and very rarely do they bring people on permanently. Hopefully this is something that will change in the future.
good,"Working at Manufacturing test  Engineer Technician III . Working more overtime at the end of the year. Every year health benefit raise up.   Time is flexible , learning new product every year."
good,"The company set up is very professional and very competitive when in comes to business. All aspects considered, this is one of the nicest companies I've worked for."
good,"Very good place to work, good work and personal balance. Had learn a lot, encourage new technologies and innovations. Appreciation on right work gives more encouragement."
good,Working with IBM gave me a good exposure to different methodologies used. I enjoyed working in a team and enjoyed the easiest and the hard day of work.
good,Solid company with many opportunities and growth. Work from home philosophy with minimal supervision . Employees are held accountable for their actions and various projects.
good,"i haave been there more than 2.5 years for this company,i have worked different project like banking and all doing pega related work like ui ,case management."
good,"Empresa agradável de se trabalhar, ambiente confortável e amigável."
good,"A Great place for a work life balance career, but given the scale of the company you will become another cog in the wheel of the machinery. Good for those who want a stable job. But career growth may get stunted due to lack of any new challenges in technical growth."
good,good company to work with especially the flexibility in work timing. Ease of approvals of leaves and other benefits. Leave Flexibility................
good,"IBM is a fast paced goal oriented environment. Where expectation are high. The environment allows for growth within certain parameters due to the location. The company is evolving, hence the work environment is constantly changing thus causing uncertainty and anxiety."
good,"The work was not difficult, I wanted more of a challenge. Management was not consistent. The people were a joy to be and work around. I worked there for many years, but would not go back to the state that the company is in now"
good,"IBM is a good place to start and advance your career.  Plenty to learn, good training programs and great people."
good,"Pros:"
good,"Too many process that will not help you to work efficiently. "
good,Have worked here for nine years. Main reason to move out was less opportunity for growth and low compensation compared to market and friends with same skill set.
good,Growth opportunities were good at ibm and work environment was awesome.. management was also good and cooperative with everyone..the best part was they give opportunity to everyone to share Thier views
good,Loosely or Unstructured organizational management style and internal competition very frustrating at times. Bureaucratic style gets in the way of responding to fast paced market and nimbler competitors
good,"As a company IBM is very good in terms of work culture, flexibility, work-life balance, facilities, management."
good,"Working from Ireland, the day starts at normal business hours but often finished late due to time difference with West Coast of US. I learned many aspects of big company operations at IBM. Management is hierarchical and upper layers are often remote. "
good,"Although the demands for travel were challenging sometimes, I loved helping clients rethink the ways they operate and work with internal and external stakeholders."
good,Work was good there.People were good. location was good. parking was outstanding. Busses qere adequate. Water quality was never bad. Cafeteria needed painting.
good,"If you have no plans of growing up on the career ladder and enjoying perks but all you want is a good job which pays you ok and makes you have family as priority you are working at right place, but if you want to see yourself growing up the career ladder and keep enjoying perks and salary hikes and you are fine spending some time away from family or being busy then its high time make a switch :D"
good,Assemble computer modems and test them to be sent for shipment. We worked on an assembly line that pushed us to do 100 modems a day. Productive and very fast pace.
good,"IBM iX is a very innovative workplace, driven to create transformative experiences for clients' users and challenge the status quo. With a myriad of project opportunities leveraging innovation accelerators such as design thinking, agile and DevOps but also latest technologies such as machine learning, cognitive computing, blockchain and cloud software  services."
good,"I enjoyed my team, work and manager at IBM. After fourteen most of the positions in our department were ""resourced"" overseas so it was time to move on."
good,"-Independent time to work on projects"
good,"Offered on line information for legacy system documentation to help with future projects.   Travel was 100% which is too much to do long term. "
good,"working for this company was amazing until they decided to down size employees without notifying them"
good,"When I worked at IBM, I was in one of the call centers.  The day-to-day workload wasn't bad.  It was pretty steady unless we had a major outage.  Major outages weren't bad if we had the right stream of communication going to alleviate opening multiple trouble tickets for the same issue."
good,I was an LTS (long term supplemental employee) for 21 months. I had a lot of freedom and autonomy to 'call the shots' while working for IBM. Good benefits effective from Day1 .
good,"Great place to work and friendly culture..but the only this is no proper hikes,"
good,Well known Brand. decent pay and Benefits. Superb culture. Bad poor managment in some areas . Unfortunately does not live to its potencial used to be a fantastic place.

good,Aprendi muito e me especializei em áreas da atualidade e pude ajudar na carreira de outras pessoas.
good,"IBM is a nice place to work. Recently, it has adopted Agile way of working with daily scrums. Also have regular planning sessions, discovery, retrospective etc. Very casual atmosphere over all."
good,Great career starter company but hard for advances and pay raises. Very flexible on schedules. Great benefits. Enjoyed my time there and learned a lot.
good,"I normally has opportunity to work from home that is a great benefit for us because we can focus more time in the specific task/activity and our job become more productivity. When we are in the site company, is good place to work, it is clean and we have all the time opportunity to learn with yours co-workers and using the portal learning web sites. Also, our managment is easy to work because they understand what we need to acquire more skills and knowledge to be hired for new positions."
good,"Good place to work and every change was very well documented and implemented as per ITIL standards. "
good,Lot of learning opportunities and options to choose from for trainee programmers to start off IT career and good company to settle in for lateral hires as well
good,"Nice place to work, but pay less than the market standards."
good,"Wonderful organization with very smart people, only hindered by bureaucracy and weak management. Great brand but constant turnover has caused distrust by employees and clients."
good,The job offers great opportunities in technology consulting and also encourages skill development. The management team is committed in ensuring that the performing employee gets career growth.
good,This is a ok type of comapny.This is a ok type of comapny overall work culture ok.Do not expect salary or bnous then it's ok. Good for ladies and old aged people.
good,"I worked as a Lead Developer for an IBM brand in a team of 4. "
good,It is a good place to work and I enjoyed my work experience here and found enough opportunities to learn and improve my skills and also has job security.
good,"Lots of travel, can be more than 100% of the time. A good way to see the world if you are interested in that. Hard to move up in role and responsibilities."
good,Very much a closed shop and contractors are viewed a little as outsiders. On-boarding process very poor for contractors. Communication was an issue with small groups of people gathered for meetings but not necessarily the right ones.
good,"Good Place to learn about new Skill set, however work pressure is there not in all account/projects but few of them, best part is some projects allow work from home culture."
good,"Ibm was fun and professional, we learned all about how to do taxes, hardest part of the job was being on the phone for 8hours straight. The most enjoyable part was helping others and having great incentives."
good,"Ability to work globally with colleagues and clients"
good,There is many positives working in IBM compare to other companies of same business. It gives more flexibility and learning opportunities than any other company.
good,"Title says it all, you will be able to handle your own workload and career advancement.  If you need someone to closely supervise you, this company will not be a good fit."
good,"IBM offers incredible opportunities for training and learning new skills. If anything can be said about this industry, it's that the only constant is change, and this definitely holds true at IBM. One pro or con, depending on how you look at it, is each new year begins with major organizational shifts, with many management personnel changing roles. This results in approximately two months' lost production across the firm, as well as a lot of uncertainty and confusion. It also, however, results in opportunities to learn new roles and get to know new colleagues. The people at IBM are some of the most professional and helpful people I have ever worked with. If you need help, you need only ask and it will be forthcoming. This is a fast-paced environment with lots of moving parts! One caveat: IBM often performs what they call ""Resource Actions,"" wherein they let thousands of people go; these RAs are not performance-based and can seem random. Job insecurity is a real issue with this firm."
good,"A good place for driving."
good,"In china, IBM going down year by year."
good,"Muy buena, sentido de responsabilidad y compañerismo"
good,"Valeu muito a pena trabalhar nesta empresa, otima metodologia."
good,"It is a good place for fresh graduates for it provided comperatively good training system for its new employees, so that greenhands will have a good chance to get familiar with the whole produre or life cycle of software development, understand the way how a team work, how its members cooperate with each other."
good,"Good place, very hectic environment, but you do get exposed to different technologies and people from all backgrounds. The company is shifting and you better be able to have the skill set to transition with the firms view or you will be left out."
good,"Boa empresa empresa para  trabalhar."
good,"	Analyze & assess calls for Quality and Compliance Team."
good,Uma boa empresa para se trabalhar e se desenvolver.
good,Very bureaucratic and process driven with people being put into roles rather than moving into them. Massive recent job cuts makes it a joyless place to work with poor work life balance
good,Good people. Good work environment. Godd management.  Unfortunately IBM is driving into the long sunset. Wished I could have finished my career there.
good,"I learned how to handle different types of the customer of the Domestic and the UK market of JetAirways. Multicultural Environment. I used o book tickets and amendments and solve customer queries on phone or email, where I improved my communication."
good,"Flexible work culture"
good,Over all its Good  nice company  i like it.  Flexibility  is there we can do wfh and good working culture but management is lillte weak but overall i can say its very good place to work
good,"Apesar de ser uma das maiores empresas mundiais, e de estar no Brasil há mais de 100 anos, a impressão de quem trabalha nela é que a empresa não foi ""tropicalizada"" funciona como no EUA. As decisões não são dinâmicas, batem e voltam na gestão regional, nacional, Latam, mundial.... Muitos negócios são perdido por esta rigidez ."
good,IBM offers great benefits for all employees compared to most companies. The company is also more relaxed when it comes to work time flexibility and personal management.
good,"IBM is actually a great place to work. The company takes great care of the employees and there is plenty of room to move up and around within the company. The only issue is the same issue with any coprate job, the layoffs and lack of job security. You never know when your ticket will be pulled. Only a few make it to retirement."
good,Its a big giant you gotta be smart and networking to stay informed and be progressive. Management changes often but information is not passed on. Benefits are good but if you are in consulting its just impossible to know the sales pipeline and bonus if any.
good,"The company works collaboratively in close knit teams. Even though the team might not be located in the same region, the productivity is still high."
good,I could learn a lot of new stuff. Was mentored by some of the good managers. Was given the independence to innovate and generate out of the box solutions.
good,"Unless you are high up the ladder within the corporate company, the job growth is not great. You would have to relocate depending on which departments you are in."
good,"Ambiente confortevole, giovane, smart.. con tante idee da poter proporre ma con le restrizioni di casa madre IBM"
good,"IBM has a good name, talented stuff, but upper management doesn't have a straight direction and jumps from one side to another. Each year company brings a new flag product, and than abandons it."
good,In terms of growth and learning you will acquired alot of skills both technical and  leadership & management to leverage your well being. You will learn to be self independent as this avenue is for matured thinking practitioner. If you are looking for comfort venue where you can spend your career with this is not the right venue as you will always be challenge of lots of circumstances for you to grow as individual both personal and professional.
good,"Defined job role and duties"
good,"IBM is goed voor zijn werknemers qua arbeidsvoorwaarden, maar helaas staart het management zich blind op de cijfers. Hierdoor is het niet meer mogelijk om het belang van de klant te dienen."
good,"Overall IBM was a great place to work, friendly staff and lots of opportunities to chase. However the lack of organisation from management at times was frustrating and an aged work ethic that needs to be adapted if IBM wants to compete with their competitors."
good,"The company provides a good health benefit package to both the employee and their family.  This is very beneficial in case  of sickness and emergency, because as we know hospital rate now a days is very  expensive."
good,IBM GBS as a company is very good providing job security and relaxed work culture so that work-life balance is really good.But as a fresher its not that good in terms of learning perspective.Its luck if you have been deployed in good project from the beginning then its fine otherwise not.
good,"Inicié mi beca dentro de IBM. Aprendí mucho. Quería quedarme dentro, pero no me ofrecían el contrato. Estuve trabajando 8 meses después de graduado como becario desempeñando labores de personas contratadas al 100. Mi salida fue por esa razón."
good,"Flexibility and aged management won't allow new gen to push forward, it's demotivating and makes one lose interest to work."
good,IBM was a good place to work with.  The company offers very good healthcare benefit and discount prices on the company products but at one point in time IBM was focused heavily on net profit that may have caused difficulty to maintain the staffing status.
good,"The majority of the team members are helpful and positive. The stress of not knowing if your job/team/dept will be gone tomorrow is not pleasant, however."
good,"- Several opportunities to change and advance career."
good,IBM has a very rich learning environment. Employees are encouraged to explore new training every year. The Learning catalog is Large and easy to use. I enjoyed working for IBM.
good,"I came to IBM as part of an acquisition.  I was given a retention bonus to remain for a year.  I ended up staying for 7 years, performing tasks that gradually moved outside the scope of my original role. As the acquired company (NovusCG) was integrated into the IBM structure, my importance diminished.  I was eventually released during a period of layoffs.  During my time, IBM evolved from a company that retained and rewarded hard-working employees to one that released them if their departments were considered bloated. To be fair, technology changed at such a rapid pace, it could be difficult for long-term employees to keep up.  But as different business divisions were evaluated, it created difficulties with inter-departmental cooperation.  Each business unit wished to protect its ""turf."""
good,IBM is a good place to work.  You have to be drive and competitive to success.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with.   The company is constantly changing and adjusting so be prepared for change.
good,"The job is good start for people wanting to make their career in IT. You get to work in one of the biggest IT companies in the world. Job is not a very hectic one with good balance however, on-site opportunities( as coveted in the IT industry) depends on the group in which someone is placed in. Overall was a good experience."
good,Productive environment and good place to learn new technologies. Can enjoy working from home towards balancing personal and professional life. Remuneration is decent but gets extra incentive for extra time worked. No guarantee on appraisals and salary hike yearly.
good,Working hard and delivering  the business mission timely is not always enough to secure a job. It is a great place to work with very intelligent people.
good,"A empresa é uma empresa que preza muito pela diversidade, pessoas de todos os tipos, roupas, cabelos e personalidades."
good,"Managed daily operations of a large Recovery Management team. Provided oversight of 400 impacting incidents per month. This contributed to 99.99 percent availability of IT systems for the Kaiser Permante Enterprise. Directed Internal and Vendor Information IT resources, as part of the Enterprise Operations Command Center."
good,"The pace of work in IBM is just right. Neither stressful nor too relaxed. Nice trips with the team. Learnt the Business Analysis, planning, process improvement, critical thinking etc."
good,Opportunity to provide broad enterprise solutions to my clients through a collaborative approach with peers and other SME professionals.  Helpful environment to grow professional that provides great sales experience.
good,"Competitive pay and dedicated to educating employees. A requirement of 40+ hours of self-paced learning was a requirement. Additionally, a career tracking site where yearly goals were entered was used."
good,Competing head-to-head with Indian Service Providers was a lose-lose scenario for IBM Global Services business. Too much internal competition between service lines.
good,"It's a high tech company with traditional culture but transforming right now. People is good here but high end management is not so transparent. Hope this big blue elephant can transform as fast as they can. :)"
good,"Very laid back, great supervisor, but no benefits for part-time employees.  Work at home and do my job when desired.  Would like stability.  Good job."
good,"IBM provides Great Growth Opportunities. You can upskill yourselves up to any level. The learning never ends in IBM. "
good,Projetos técnicos interessantes e boas oportunidades com grandes empresas.
good,"IBM is a bit more aggressive organization ( GTS Labs to be precise ). There was lot of focus on timely delivery, with less focus on people."
good,"Work quality immensely varies project to project, great work-life balance with flexible work from home practice. Very poor growth in terms of both monetary & promotions."
good,"Typical workday included using early morning to build and send social content for the week on Twitter, LinkedIn and other social sites. Make calls into territory, at least  25 to 50 per day. Create at least 5 new C-level contacts per week. Schedule face to face meetings to introduce company or  IBM products and services. The hardest part of job was getting folks on the phone to speak to and the most enjoyable part was working through client requirements from beginning to end and seeing the solution work to solve client problem or productivity."
good,"IBM is good mostly for experienced guys, Management is poor, A lot of learning opportunity, less work ,work life balance, A lot of Enjoyment is here, You can play TT and do other stuff if you do not have any work , it depends on your project."
good,Relaxed work environment. Rochester is a growing city that is continuously trying to attract young workers. I believe IBM will be forced pay more competitive wages in the future.
good,24/7 kind of job.
good,"I have spent lot of time in IBM India since 2008. It feels nice to work in this company. There is job security as well in this company. Worked in different teams like Prepaid, BI, PACS,RA etc."
good,I enjoined working with IBM. The working environment is good.There are fun activities on Friday which give us  the opportunity or to open up with our management
good,"IBM, being a large multi-national company, had your typical corporate ups and downs.  What I did enjoy was being able to work from home which gave me a lot of flexibility in my work day.  Overall I did enjoy the time that I spent with the company."
good,"Buenas prestaciones laborales, compañerismo, puntualidad en los pagos quincenales, prestaciones de seguro de gastos médicos mayores, fondo de ahorro, fondo de retiro."
good,"Stressful job requiring long work hours to close sales. Quarterly sals targets did not provide time to learn customer needs, thus sale cycle often exceeded quarterly target. Meeting quotas was financially well rewarded."
good,"Great Place to Work and Learn new skills."
good,"-	Management of Contract Governance/Compliance and Customer Relationship: "
good,"I enjoyed my experience at IBM. It was an internship as a lab administrator maintaining servers, laptops, virtual machines and automated backup solutions."
good,"Depending on what management team you work with makes a big difference on your ability to perform.     "
good,I loved working at IBM Europe as it afforded me the opportunity to collaborate and to work with a diversity of people from countries around the world.
good,Working in a support center with a team makes life easier. Everyone knows what their strengths are and how to service clients. Communication is first.
good,The group I worked with was a stressful environment.  It was difficult to take vacation time because too much needed to be done and sometimes it was necessary to come in on weekends.
good,"Great people, but culture struggles with executing products into the market;  Great environment for technology innovation and collaborative idea sharing."
good,"I learned a lot as this being my first official work. As a contractor there were no the same benefits as employees however the work was the same. Very process oriented, however it is so big that it doesn't have a good knowledge management in place, and it turn bureaucratic and filled with grey areas to execute your job."
good,"It's Productive and fun workplace with opportunities to learn and grow in the organizations. Organization is very good, and give you a lot of opportunities to grow professionally, unless you are ruined by some biased and undeserved manager"
good,Worked with great people. Knowledgeable and helpful.  Traveled 80 to 100% but taken care of on the road. When not travelling was able to work remotely from home.
good,"Un ottimo posto per chi è disposto a dedicarsi interamente al lavoro. "
good,"All very professional, dedicated, smart, tech-savvy.  You get to work with the IBM Fellows, Engineers, and consultants who are at the top of the industry, often with 5-25 patents each"
good,The job environment is fast paced and quite demanding but manageable. You have good team mates and managers to guide you. Growth is there. If you like to experience a different role you can always ask the management for it.
good,"Typical day at work with long processes, great boss good work life balance, standard politics good place to work for entry level allowance should be higher as they are paying 50% less than other company."
good,IBM is a great company to work for in terms of work life balance. It needs to improve on work culture and salary structure though. Work from Home is the greatest privilege this company has offered its employees.
good,one of Fortune 500 Companies. Balanced Work Atmosphere and mental peace. Had to relocate frequently due to change of Projects - Changed projects / location every 4 months.
good,Good Work Life Balance. Give opportunities to work from home too if need arise. Though recently the salary raise opportunities have gone down and has led to disgruntlement.
good,"People who want to go to Management side. IBM is the best company. In most of the projects, some major decisions would be taken by Managers. Odd shifts are more and some times an employee would have to work for 1 - 2 days at a stress, when there would be any outage."
good,"You can work as independently or connected as you need.  There are many, many venues to reach out and feel a part of the global atmosphere within the organization."
good,This company was a bpo call center where the job was to trouble shoot the problems over the call for the customers using internet facility. also helping them fix the internet and make it faster then before.
good,Very good organization with lot of scope for learning new technology. Best place to learn and work. 24/7 makes people to work.. job security is there but very poor management
good,a typical work day involved a vast amount of calls in hardware and software support. You are put through training period where you are taught about both sides of the system. great work environment. a great area to future your education.
good,company provides a lot of opportunity but due to complexity and managerial and team dispute productivity decreases. culture of seniority and politicism should be looked after immediately
good,Bra arbetsklimat. Trevliga kollegor i ett väl sammansvetsat team. Hjälp finns alltid att få.
good,"Good company and have learned lots of knowledge, including technical skills and management skills."
good,"unos de los beneficios con los que cuenta ibm es la variedad de rutas de transporte, comedor y vales de despensa. "
good,bom lugar pra trabalho localização perfeita ótimo gerenciamento
good,"Empresa na qual o dia de trabalho é sempre dinâmico, com diferentes tarefas a serem realizadas, o que leva a um aprendizado sobre como gerenciar o tempo e lidar com prioridades. A gerência, em geral, é bem engajada e está sempre em busca de melhorias. A cultura e o ambiente de trabalho são modernos e, por isso, tornam a empresa um bom lugar para se trabalhar. A parte mais difícil do trabalho diz respeito ao excesso de mudanças nas equipes, o que faz com que, constantemente, muitas funções fiquem com pouco pessoal experiente, gerando problemas de resultados e retrabalho. A parte mais agradável do trabalho é que a maioria das equipes são compostas por pessoas colaborativas e determinadas."
good,You can get a lot more materials to learn and grow . Mostly you have to follow all the processes . Lots of work pressure in some of the domains . I hope one will enjoy working here .
good,"Coworkers and colleagues were fun to work with and the laboratory equipment was state of the art allowing for an innovative work environment. "
good,"Si sono verificate situazioni in cui il lavoro in team su grossi progetti ha reso il mio lavoro molto stimolante. Inoltre il rapporto con i colleghi ha amplificato questo aspetto consentendomi di crescere anche su aree di confine alle mie per competenze dandomi una visione d'insieme, a 360 gradi, sulla realtà di progetto. Lo stimolo maggiore lo si prova, a mio parere, quando il progetto ha un aspetto di internazionalità."
good,"Its very good organisation to enrich our skills and knowledge          "
good,"IBM is a large company, so experience will vary with division and management.  If in a growth area it can be a great place to work.  For mature divisions cost cutting can make it tougher."
good,"-Multiple locations on any single day. "
good,"Its pleasure to work with IBM."
good,"1. Good Work Culture"
good,Got robbed of my benefits over the years. Company execs are greedy. Too many obstacles in the way of getting the job done. Have to do other peoples jobs as well as your own........................................................
good,"IBM is a good place to work, given its size; but have to look for the right groups. Not all of IBM is the same, it has some old culture and not so old culture, finding the right group is important."
good,Good place to work. The team in which you get to work is very important. As each team has their own style of working. Management is good. The work environment is good.
good,IBM is one of the best companies we have today. It was totally a learning experience for me. Colleagues was supportive . Canteen was good. Very friendly environment.
good,Company has not been profitable in 5 years. This has led a lot of layoffs and a lot of short-term decision-making. IBM seems to be playing catch-up to the cloud software phenomenon.
good,"Great Place to work, with dynamic vision and business agility.  Aggressive earnings objectives make strong performance a requirement, not a desire.  Only the best survive at IBM.  Be ready to jump in and deliver results, while navigating and leaning a complex organization."
good,"good benefit. ok salary. depends on which department, which team you are in, your job could be very stressful and laid back. workplace culture is diverse."
good,"IBM is a big company, so the experience varies with the team you are in."
good,"Great people to work with.  Exciting projects, but need more focus on productivity for employees within the tools.  Unfortunately Layoffs happen without notice although jobs are posted internally and externally.  Need to focus on the People inside IBM working day to day instead of shareholder.  If you say People are your greatest asset.... Mean It!"
good,IBM was very much driven by corporate guidelines and stringent about adhering to them.  The opportunity to advance was based on performance and integrity.
good,Its always a hectic day at work. No can never expect for time to relax yourself. Management is really bad. What I learnt from IBM is not to depend on anyone.
good,"A positive experience given the breadth and depth of my responsibilities over six years. During my time there, I grew professionally.  Also, I found my (extended)  teammates to be of high quality and supportive."
good,IBM has been known recently for laying off career professionals in order to increase stock prices and profitability.  During my last five years with IBM  I traveled one hundred percent of the time.  I worked very long hours and was away from my family most of the time.  Though I enjoyed the work very much I had to make a difficult decision to either continue working there and place my personal life on the back burner or resign and reclaim my personal life.  I chose the latter.
good,Organizations are always good.Your stay with company was good or bad is decided with the people your working in the organization.IBM is such great company.
good,"My experience is good as well."
good,"A Good place to work without head pressure.. Can learn technically & be strong.."
good,"No doubt IBM is one of the best company in the world, you can have lots of chance in the company, because the company almost cover everything, from hardware to consulting. The working process is also perfect, when you get used to the work, it will be easy, but you still can learn lots of things there, as I said, you can have rotation or training almost in every area if you really put effort on this."
good,"Balance life and good working culture, flexible working hours, got a chance to work on latest technology,  i learned a lot on the marketing software including IBM Unica Platform, Campaign , marketing operation, interact, IH and AM, MPO, Journey Designer, and PEM, PP and PR"
good,"it offers rapid growth to the employee in terms of career road map."
good,"I was outsourced to IBM by AT&T when the billing software development groups I managed were moved there, primarily to facilitate offshoring of the work.  At first it was a good place to work, and I had several excellent VPs that I supported, but by the time I left (voluntarily) the work environment and morale had deteriorated substantially and I decided to try my hand at running my own company."
good,"•	Worked with research teams to conduct research and development of new software applications."
good,"HI "
good,"I have been in the company for 9 years now, and I have seen much career growth and opportunities , but there is the problem with salaries increases and bonuses., the are not growing as expected, that why some of us still have low salaries but but high experience when comes to work"
good,"Overall program/project management, project review, addressing project and team concerns from work and personal perspective. Managing meeting, governance and account related meeting(s)."
good,"A Very good place to work, Always a employee's favourite place to work, in spite of some general cons which are  usually in IT Companies this company still is a better place to work"
good,Best place to work where we can balance the personal and professional life and the work culture is good and salary benefits nil and management is having enough experience to handle.
good,"Good organization to balance professional and personal life."
good,"No growth,No hikes"
good,"Very professional"
good,"Good place to work overall. My last manager was beyond excellent, most of my co-workers as well. The job itself is incredibly stressful. Long hours are the norm. My salary had been rising toward the base for my position, but as I left I still had not reached that plateau."
good,"Being a part of IBM is really means a lot because it builds growth, productivity and challenges to work with every possible environment."
good,"IBM is not a good payer, you can get exposure to multiple areas of interest and according to your skills, you can perform extra ordinary however you can not expect a good hike on your existing package"
good,"One of the Best Companies to work with and every body is given chance to grow and given chances to get into the relevant roles as per the project needs and employee growth too."

good,"started as a senior process analyst and became trainer"
good,"This was an interesting assignment, with no firm job requirements and no historical basis for the assignment.  Everything was conceptual, proprietary and the project never came to fruition."
good,Worked at IBM as an intern for 13 months. The hours varied but generally the day started at 9am and finished around 6pm. There was a 'corporate-centric' culture although there was a clear direction to each role's requirements and business unit's direction. Most enjoyable part of the job was the social aspect of it as there were over 100 interns in my year. There were challenging aspects such as having to understand and know the projects and offerings in a short space of time.
good,"I work as a contract consultant, so not sure much about benefits. "
good,"Great heritage but needs to become current. Inability to take inventions and introduce them to the market. Their sole focus on commercial accounts have cost them. they needed a consumer focus as they had many of the technologies that other companies have introduced, It may be too late for that,"
good,Worklife balance is easy to achieve the current Organization. Innovation is a primary goal. It was very nice working here. Complete freedom of what needs to be done
good,Amazing culture. Ample opportunities to expand your skill horizon. Open door policy with management. Open discussions to drive new ideas and innovating thinking
good,"IBM is a self managed and result oriented work place. People who are highly motivated, creative, and energetic fit the company the most. "
good,"Highly demanding customer's service , solving customer's problems"
good,"Huge capability to learn. can learn a lot in the fields of IOT, cognitive and advanced analytics. But the project are less so you have to prove yourself and showcase your capabilities to move into the projects."
good,IBM Is one of the good companies for the work experience and to grow in terms of knowledge if you are looking for the long term stay in IBM then IBM is good choice to work in.
good,"Libertad de horario pero se debia cumplir con las metas y objetivos. Se trabajaba bajo presion en los cierres contables no habia horario de salida, seguiamos derecho."
good,"Great place to expand your knowledge but poor job security and highly stressful. Typical day included Checking emails first Am to ensure there were no first to extinguish. Then check results of testing that occurred overnight. Making sure team analyzed results , generated defects and consulted with developers."
good,IBM finance dept offers rotation of jobs every 2 years which gave the opportunities to learn different things and have different exposures. The finance team is big and it's a fun working place.

good,IBM provides tools and mechanisms to grow your skills as a Consultant with contemporary software and applications. It occasionally rewards hard work but benefits a specific race .

good,"Stressful daily.   "
good,IBM is a great place to work. The only downfall is the mentality that the customer is ALWAYS right. But that is a bit of a larger cultural issue we struggle with in today's market world.

good,I was working thru a recruiter. IBM was not looking for a permenant hieree. I enjoyed working with the employees on site at AT&T.
good,"A relação com colegas de trabalho, desde funcionários regulares até a gerência sempre foi muito boa e de fácil convivência.

O ambiente era agradável e eu tinha liberdade no meu trabalho."
good,"Empresa muito boa para se trabalhar com grande flexibilidade para seus funcionários, bons benefícios e grande possibilidade de conhecimento."

good,"I love Mondays, mostly because the day flies by in a flash. On a given day, during the early hours you will find me speaking to the clients, finding out – proactively – what their priorities are for the week, meeting with team for half hour to communicate the clients’ needs and organizing the team schedules around the client’s priorities."
good,IBM provides lots of opportunities to learn new things. Management is very supportive and easily approachable. The most enjoyable part working with IBM is the work culture . Everyone is professional in their approach towards work . IBM also provides opportunities for mentoring junior to achieve their goals. Overall its a very good company to work with. The only Cons is the salary.

good,"Disclaimer: A lot of what I'm writing below of course depends on the work area and management chain. But I found this to be fairly pervasive policies in IBM in my 9+ years with the company."
good,Need to work directly with other region that we are attached to. Allowance are paid according to region we support. Meetings are always held to update team members regarding job progress. Employees are allowed to work from home when necessary. There are always good team members and subordinate to rely on when facing issues and problems with clients. The challenging part of this job is to stay awake during the night (Malaysia Time) since I was attached with the USA time region. The best part is the relaxing work environment despite the need to achieve the daily target.
good,"Empresa que visa a flexibilidade, e estimula aos empregados de pensar e sempre ter ideias novas."
good,A lot of downsizing over the last 10 years. Ability to advance diminished due to the downsizing of the U.S. employees and sending the work to India.

good,"Good platform For Freshers"
good,"Flexible working hours and work with a lot of talent people."

good,"A typical day contains of fulfiling clients demand by working with dedication. It is to be a part of such a big name,working here is totally full of zeal and enthusiasm."
good,"I am lucky enough to be a part of a dynamic team of bright, intelligent people.  Sometimes the daily grind of reaching your monthly goals and metrics can get tedious but group meetings and conference calls are very important.  Brainstorming and idea sharing work very well within our group and promote positive attitudes and fresh perspectives."
good,"bom ambiente  de trabalho , muitas ferramentas, gestão boa , colegas brincalhões mas trabalham bem , a parte dificil é o tempo que levamos de casa até o ele , pois moro em cascais e trabalho no parque das nações expo."

good,"Employee Friendly but no hike since past 3 years."
good,"IBM is in the midst of a transformation to become more competitive in the cloud, analytics and mobile technology.  It's a few years behind Amazon, Microsoft and Google, so it's going to be rough. The plan seems to be to acquire smaller start-ups rather than grow the knowledge in-house."
good,"I manage my time according to project workload, flexible schedule is nice. See my resume for more information about day to day activity."
good,"Company is in transition.  Moving more to cloud, virtual, SAAS-type stuff.  Profit-per-share is the main goal and loyalty to employees is excessively on the decline.  Proof point: In March, 2016, IBM laid off an estimated 1/3 of it's U.S. workforce (~23,000)."
good,Had lot of chance to explore other BI Tools and also IBM provided me a Opputunityto learn verygood process knowledge.Flexibilty in job timings was also a greater advantage to make a work life balance.
good,"Formation des professionnel au top"
good,"Loved my job, but laid-off.  Liked working for IBM and did for many years.  Worked at home and had flexibility for time off, etc.  Only complaint is massive lay-offs as people get older, but aren't quite ready to retire yet."
good,"My day at work starts at 4:00 a.m. (eastern).  I work with teams from India, Costa Rica, Argentina, Malaysia, Brazil and U.S.  Since I am a team lead, my key responsibility to make sure the teams that are working under me are transitioning their work properly at the speed required for quarterly targets.  "
good,"Great company, too much uncertainty in the hiring process.  To many different levels of the process that create barriers which become unclear, therefore a, a solution only comes through an uncertain amount of time, approved by lord knows who!"
good,"IBM was in the process of selling their company and had the attentions focused on that. Working on Night shift I was the only maintainer for over 50+ measurement, metrology, and photo-limited yield tools. The vendors for my tools did not work nights unless absolutely necessary. I would say that the company was trying to reduce as much spending as possible to the point they where willing to risk a tool staying out of production for an extended period of time and willing to push tools past their required monthly maintenance stop time. Which resulted in several broken tools and delayed product development. Management was overwhelmed on night shift as well and with one manager for a huge facility it also caused some teamwork and moral issues. The hardest part of the job was not being able to fix issues on tool due to lack of manpower or lack of knowledge.

good,"It was nice working with IBM Daksh. After joining IBM i learned a lot. Especially discipline and professionalism became a part of my life. I learned how to remain calm even in the too much work pressure. As 10 hours of working and continuously doing a billing and calculation working and making that explain to about 100 customers per day was not that easy but still i managed. Hardest part of the job was not the work ,, it was the management. The HR department was the best and the worst part was the process manager and the transport management. The most enjoyable part was the training period."
good,"IBM was a good place to work at. It had many experienced employees who were experts in their field of work and very helpful as well. A typical day at IBM would start off with daily meeting updates. However, the client whose project I was associated was very demanding. Initially there was work life balance but it gradually disappeared in the two years that I was there. In my opinion the management was a bit at fault as they gave in to each and every demand of the client not considering the fact that some employees were working odd hours as well as on weekends. Of course if this were a one off scenario it would have been much tolerable but unfortunately that was not the case. Of course as a fresher I learned everything of what I know by working in that company. So in that sense I am indebted to IBM for giving me the initial exposure to the corporate world."

It is a fine place to work and gain experience, especially when working outside of the United States or Canada.  However, jobs in North America would have limited upward mobility.  In summary, if you want to work for IBM, my suggestion would be to take a contract position.  "

The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and the experience.   "

good,"IBM is a very large company and is world wide. I conducted business throughout the month with people not only across the USA, but also in Brazil and India.

El entorno de trabajo es flexible, cordial, aprendi muchisimo de trabajo en equipo, a desarrollar mis competencias de comunicacion, coordinacion de equipos. La parte mas dificil del trabajo considero que puede ser la transicion de cuentas a otros equipos dado que a veces por el idioma se dificulta la explicacion de los procesos. Lo que mas me gusto siempre fue el grupo humano, profesionales con altas competencias y sobre todo seres humanos con grandes valores."
good,Days at work usually was challenging since there was always something new to learn for the clients. The management was not always what you would expect from a co-operation such as IBM but they did try their best.

good,I enjoyed waiting on members of the credit union. I leaned how to open and close the branch daily. I learned how to process the ATM daily. The hardest part of the job was leaning to do the gift cards because you had to go through too many screens to do the transaction. I loved all of my co-workers. We where a small branch with six employees. We all got along well.
good,Joined as a fresher and i would say i was very lucky enough to . Learned lot of technical stuff that i probably wouldn't have to gather in my 3 + years . They promote lot of learning activities which is great . Had been with different teams with different tools and each time i had something new to gather from them .

They demand a lot from their employees and provide a lot of training for your career development. At times it can be too big and the lowest employees can tend to get lost in the system. The culture is very customer oriented whereas before it use to be employee oriented. In some respects this is good but in others it has been very detrimental. All said, though I would work here again just with a different state of mind."

good,"IBM is a large company, and with large companies come various items, some good, some bad."

good,"I was lucky to have a great manager right out of college. He was highly supportive in what I was interested in and found great mentorship opportunities for me within the firm. We had many collaborative projects with Yorktown, and that further broadened my technical horizon."
good,"IBM is a good place to work. You will get lot of opportunities in training, and on the job learning. Integrity is key here. I would recommend all my friends to work for IBM"
good,"Overall IBM is a good company to work for and has great opportunities for growth.  They are a leader in Cloud, AI and Blockchain which is exciting.  Management is a hit or miss.  Sometimes you get a great manager who knows how to lead his team well and other times not so much.  Raises and promotions can OFTEN go unrecognized if the service area manager doesn't properly follow up and understand the role of their employees.  I've had OK success working for IBM but overall feel slightly undervalued as an employee.  Expect to take on more roles and responsibilities when employees are let go and budget concerns won't allow for a replacement.  I've taken on 4 different roles since starting and it's been more of a ""you must take on this responsibility now"" with not even a ""thanks for doing that.""  I've had good opportunities to learn and grow new skills and feel confident in my ability to get positions elsewhere.  I do like IBM but they have issues like everyone else."
good,Co-workers were the best I experienced. Most professional place to work. Training was available if you wanted. You were able to work in locations and organization on a Global scale. The work life balance was great and I have yet to experience that in the companies I have work for since.
good,"IBM Provides a good work life balance, upto date technology and tools as well as heavily invests in meaningful training. It also provides a positive work environment"
good,Very good work life balance but innovation has to go through several layers of management. Changes are rapid in recent times due to declining revenue of company
good,"IBM is a good company.  During my time with IBM I was fortunate to have good managers.  If you are in the information technology area you can expect to work long hours to resolve any issues because of the service agreement IBM have with its clients.  The most  enjoyable part of the job is that you get to work with so many talented individuals. I was a WAH employee and so I did not get an opportunity to hang out with many of the people I communicated with over the phone.  Overall, its a great company to work at."
good,Hard working culture with a strong focus on client satisfaction while also ensuring that there is a reasonable return for the shareholder. Good opportunities to work on multiple clients in different industries. Work Life balance can be a challenge on bid activity or coming up to quarter ends depending on the specifics of the role.
good,Work culture is good. Lot of opportunity to learn new technologies. You can balance your personal and work life in this organisation. I love to recommend some one in this company
good,"In this company you can stay for long time...good for learning and to grow yourself."
good,Career opportunities are a lot if you just thrive in your willingness to learn. Work-life balance is a plus since you can work remotely from the office.
good,"Great place to work, will thrive if you are self directed. Good work life balance, multiple training resources/opportunities. Not a good degree of career advancement opportunities."
good,Workday was 8-4:30.  Good group of team members to work with and first line manager was pleasant.  Learned and developed agile skills.  Enjoyed working with a variety of clients.
good,"Its a great place to work in, the benefits are good and family friendly. I am fortunate enough to had work with a great team and have a manager that is willing to mentor me,"
good,"Good company and working environment is nice."
good,"Pros: good pay, smart colleagues"
good,"Encourage people to learn new technologies."
good,It was a professional workplace with productive work culture. The only part which I realized could have been better was advancement and flexibility to move to other positions more easily.
good,"Working hours are flexible depending on the amount of work you have to complete in that particular day. For working moms I would suggest it is best company.Managers are quite cooperative depending on the client you are working on, although they are not very cooperative when it comes to promotions and perks. Job growth is bit slow along with compensation & benefits, which may be sometimes hardest part of the job. Enjoyable part is various events conducted at account level."
good,Workplace culture is very flexible depending which team you are a part.  The hardest part of the job is navigating the silos of information that needs to be accessed to share across teams.
good,"Most of the time your local team will be fine and the work will be at least interesting, but a lot of times it felt like the developers and management would have two different ideas for how best to improve the product. Most of the time these could be resolved, but plenty of times it seemed like they had unreasonable expectations and that teams would play a blame game with each other when it came time to explain things to management. I'd recommend at least trying a job here to see if you can tolerate it, because the compensation is pretty great with some nice time off, but if you find yourself banging your head against the wall taking on other teams responsibilities because you ended up being a fall guy for their project then get out ASAP."
good,IBM is an amazing company to work for. There work culture is diverse and inclusive to all. Company values it employees and its relationship with them.
good,Great company with competitive work culture.  Fair compensation package with time off.  Work life balance is fair but could be better.  Primary stress is yearly layoffs.
good,"Don't expect too much by the brand name IBM. It is like any other IT company. As far as I understood, work-life balance is better here. They believe more in personal responsibility ,so you don't have strict work hours .You can take WFH as much as you want ,provided your manager allows it. IBM have a lot of learning platforms which you can use for your career growth. Financial benefits and appraisals are comparatively low, but not too low."
good,"IBM remains a good place to work for technology professionals, but as non-traditional competitors emerge it struggles to change quickly enough.  As a result the peerless research and innovation in emerging areas such as cognitive, blockchain and cloud, fails to convert to market leadership in the way that it used to when the company was mostly about hardware and other infrastructure.  If you're in a senior role with sales responsibilities, this can make for a frustrating environment.  Despite many recent rounds of job cuts, it's a pretty good place to work, with decent remuneration, pension and other benefits"
good,"This is the a company that you want to be joining when your life is half done, Except Money you have every thing in IBM."
good,"Amazing work culture"
good,"IBM is a large company so there are many opportunities.  This included hardware, software, cloud, security, artificial intelligence and more.  In my case I am able to work with customers around the world.  The people at IBM are exceptional.  There is always someone that is willing to help with whatever question you may have."
good,"A good place to work provided one is self motivated as the expectation is one will organise and prioritise their own workload within the constraints laid down."
good,"IBM has missed a ton of opportunities in the past years, but it's still working towards a better future and the company has shown solid steps with its recent acquisitions and strategic alliances."
good,"IBM bpo sector is not that high as per the management but still working to get more clients and enhancing the area of achievements."
good,"Company Management were very nice, friendly and I have never felt any difficulties to work with them. I had a good experience working with them and I learnt a lot of new things from the about computer and about teller caller and they teach us how to stay calm and talk polity when we are talking with the clients or customers. I had a nice time and I thank the management to get me more information and help me to get the experience i got from the company."
good,IBM is still working out the kinks for what their consultancy will actually look like. As a first time consultant it was a challenging environment in which to learn the intricacies of the job.
good,"IBM bought SoftLayer, so the culture is different than regular IBM. Dress code is almost non-existent - can wear jeans, baseball hats, tennis shoes, etc. Pretty laid back in general, not like typical corporate offices. The part that sucks is that IBM does layoffs on a regular basis, so job security is iffy. Obviously no one truly has job security, but when you know layoffs are an expected event, it gets stressful, especially when you belong to a company that IBM bought - they're likely to give jobs to ""true"" IBMers."
good,"IBM is a great place to work, there is a lot of flexibility, however there is no job security, one minute you could be in a role and the next you could be out. It is very difficult to find security in a consulting company"
good,"IBM helped me to learn working with SAP and I was able to leverage this skill to help my department process orders efficiently "
good,"Currently in a client-facing role as point of contact on a Client Service Management team which handles one of IBM's largest global customers. Responsibilities include, but not limited to, establishing and maintaining a good connection with the customer and all IBM teams involved in completing the service, providing a high-level service overview, as well as ensuring proper execution of all procedures that may affect service."
good,"It's a well known company with a good place to learn and grow if you have a strong leadership, my coworkers were friendly and good place to attend training sessions and workshops."
good,IBM was a great first job out of college. I came in with minimal experience and now have a career path that I enjoy. You have to be a self starter for some tasks and network a lot but overall you will enjoy working for them.
good,Need to be proactive on the task that has been assign to you. Strong support from the teammate & management given. Work as a team & always remember that you're not alone when facing any work related issue.
good,over all it is good to work in IBM. Supporting multiple logistics client with multiple applcations. Work culture is good in IBm but there is no much employee bneficieries.
good,Large corporation so hard to generalize across the board but generally fair with a good work environment that is flexible enough for all.  Supportive of many work options.
good,"Good Working environment. Very good supporting from client and management."
good,"Review alerts escalated by client bank to my queue, send out request for additional information relevant to case investigation, closing gaps in client profile, gather list of transactions requiring monitoring for originating /beneficiary parties to identify suspicious nature and draw up coherent narrative of transaction flows and pinpoint anomalous transactions. Develop alert narratives for regulatory reporting or disposition to false positive."
good,"No complaints except lack of job security from resource layoffs. Great benefits, company culture, employee morale, and reasonable workload. One of the perks is telecommuting or working remotely."
good,"Change is everywhere and with the recent acquisition of Red Hat, there are changes in strategy and this is a great thing for IBM. Recent changes due in part to this strategy have made IBM a transitioning company."
good,"The work environment is in a great team format. No ones is left behind, and where one person has a strength is added to help another one learn. the customer comes first and freedom is there to enable you to do just that."
good,"great work life flexibility, but working hours are long as staff has been reduced. workload is heavy, pressured environment. limited opportunities for advancement once you reach a certain band/level without sacrificing location, flexibility, etc. Advancement and compensation become capped, benefits and comp are reduced every year company isn't performing. Concerns about the future reduces engagement in employees."
good,"Developing web applications in Java, Groovy, Javascript, SQL, Angular etc"
good,I enjoyed a good team and management. IBM is a good place to work. I would recommend to anyone working in technology to at least consider working there.
good,"Being ""Coin Operated"" or sales driven is critical in succeeding and advancing at IBM.  They're  a number company, if you don't meeting utilization / chargeability metrics you are expendable.  They are so big you are literally a number."
good,"Good place to learn."
good,"Es una empresa líder en el sector con grandes profesionales y con un equipo humano excelente."
good,"Overall a good experience, would recommend to a friend. "
good,Empresa muito focada na satisfação do cliente. Organização empresarial boa.
good,IBM is a fun place to work in terms of culture and benefits however I am looking for something that pays more and that will allow more telecommuting and also flexibility.
good,"Very good company to work with, can easily manage work life balance. Job is secured here in IBM."
good,"As a global icon, there are lot of positives to working at IBM -- and a some very unique challenges."
good,"My trainer asked if he could call me the N word and I said no. HR did not respond in time in my opinion, so I resigned. The atmosphere is a team-oriented culture."
good,IBM allowed me to learn how to think outside the box and nurtured me for a better future. I was able to interact with intelligent individuals who were able to guide me and improve the way I approached situations as well as solved problems
good,I was able to work my way up from Assembler to Senior Assembler to Inspector. I also worked in Customer service. Great pay and compensation. I received money from a suggestion award.
good,"During my years at IBM, the best thing about working for them was the workplace environment. Not only was the staff knowledgeable in the work being performed, they were always willing to help with any type of problem both job related or personal help. Because of these aspects, I enjoyed going to work, I was able to perform my tasks correctly/ in a timely manner. I was also able to eventually showcase my skills in time management as well as begin to train others."
good,"IBM is a great place to work.  They are very focused on their customer and measurable success.  You can thrive there if you keep the focus, and make sure to follow-through on your measurable success."
good,"IBM embraces you and gives you an opportunity for long-lasting careers with decent benefits and mediocre pay. If what you're looking for is a decent job, flexibility, and being comfortable, that's a good place. If you're looking to progress and advance in your career through hard working and commitment you will have to insert yourself in the tight little group of executive sponsors and find someone to help you out. I guess politics is part of every company, and quarter driven results are a priority over anything else. It's a fight for survival among the executives to deliver growth quarter after quarter. Often stupid decisions have to be made to achieve those targets and it's rather frustrating to watch without the full perspective."
good,People should mean more and having lay offs should not be so regular that it is expected.  It was a great opportunity to have the IBM name on my resume and would go back to try again.
good,"Good working environment, flexibility to work from home compared to be in office everyday. Good work life balance. Good learning place to learn new experience and task."
good,"good company for IT professionals for their future "
good,"Good work life balance but low on monetary benefits. Best for new learning and acquiring new skills in the technology."
good,"Very good culture as it is a melting pot, lots of team members like to share their expertise, however there can be an improvement in change management aspect."
good,"Flexible timings"
good,"The IBM culture is very unique and strongly pushed.  However, there is a constant threat of being layed-off as the company is constantly shifting its priorities."
good,Flexible hours and late mornings typically. As long as you're getting your work done that's what matters. The technologies and team members are just okay.
good,"Staff is often 'heads-down' working individually, collaborating only in meetings.  People are nice and the IBM campus is huge.  Parking is free in a covered garage."
good,A empresa possui uma cultura muito forte e bem definida o que pode ser o seu ponto forte e fraco ao mesmo tempo.
good,"The status tells the story.  As I came to understand, a long term supplemental is not allowed to stay more than three years or be considered for permanent employment.  As no internal options were appearing, I stayed there until I got a job with the State of Vermont Purchasing Department."
good,I worked as a part of the service delivery team for an leading multinational automobile client. My work timings very flexible and I had the option to work remotely as well. Enjoyed working with IBM.
good,"job security and work culture is good. "
good,mes fonction relevais de la qualité controle et production
good,"It was good working with IBM. Job Culture and work environment is good."
good,"First, let me say that my group is awesome. The people are great, the environment is not bad at all, and most people come into the office with a smile on their face. However, compensation is not that great, raises and bonuses are few and far between, and half of the team is usually not in the office due to being sent on the road. "
good,"I had a truly unique opportunity: to build a new business unit in a very hot new market space, Innovation-as-a-Service.  In support of the effort I got to travel the planet and work with some of IBM's best and brightest."
good,"IBM is a solid company. Like any huge corporation (400,000+) it will have its ups and downs and pockets of bad apples. For the most part it's a good place to work."
good,"Micro Managment is the worst thing in IBM, everything else is good.  Work life will be balanced. This company is currently managed by managers, manager can ruin your hikes and bonus."
good,It was good but I m not satisfy with the work or everything so that's why I m quite unhappy and I never would like to join this company ever again bcoz I m quite unhappy
good,I have been working in IBM INDIA for about 5 years now. There is work from home facilities and the policies are employee friendly. The work life balance is good.
good,Desktop support the only thing I disliked was the content changing of office rules with management changing .Otherwise was a nice place to work with helpful employees (coworkers)
good,"Challenging workplace, good learning, lots of work, proper processes, excellent talent, work is challenging as well as hectic, proper management structure"
good,"Frequent changes in business objectives and measurement tools created a chaotic atmosphere at times, but the people are amazing and the schedule is flexible for the most part."
good,It has been many years since my IBM career and I'm sure the culture has changed.  I did enjoy a very good salary/benefits program during my time there.  The respect for the individual was a main focus and they ALWAYS followed that attribute.
good,"Little room for advancement. Goal post is being moved on an annual basis making it hard for employers to advance in their role and reach job security. "
good,Good Place to work. It is having very much diversified culture. People are well knowledge.good teammates and also the management is supportive. the interview process is also not that hard.
good,"É uma muito agradável, dinâmica, muitas possibilidades de crescimento, oferece vários cursos, benefícios."
good,It was a call center contracted to handle Verizon Mobile's customer service. We had 2 short weeks of training and then we answered calls on our own. I handled technical calls and calls to order phones. I took a little more time with each customer than they wanted me too.
good,"IBM is a very large company with many facets that was different than any environment I'd worked in before.  Because of government contracts, there were many learning opportunities that were beneficial to my portfolio and many opportunities to gain knowledge from the different clients architectures and needs.  I enjoyed being successful working in the multiple teams and being able to bring my expertise to the table to improve their data stability and security."
good,"good work life balance"
good,As a manager my day is busy. I'm responsible for my team. IBM gives you tools to better yourself. The culture is one where no one is going to hold your hand and guide you. Management has become less rigid in the past few years.
good,"IBM provide good benefit for its employees. It is a good place to work, and great place of diversity. They provide online communities and mentorship. Thanks"
good,"Started employment as a Programm Support Rep(PSR) in the Rockford Il IBM office working with mainframe software customers. "

good,"work life balance and learning is good but compensation is less.Also less yearly appraisal but provide very good benefits in terms of flexibility leaves etc,"
good,Prospecção por telefone realizando cold calls para a identificação de novos projetos.
good,Good job for someone who is self motivated as you primarily worked alone and manage your day and schedule. Some weekends and midnight work is necessary to maintain customer satisfaction. Sometimes you may have scheduled weekends to work with  non-scheduled days during the week. The best part of the job is you are mobile and travel locally to different customers during each day.
good,"vstřícní a vysoce kvalifikovaní kolegové, motivující pracovní prostředí, motivující vedení"
good,enjoyed my time working there they made available learning tools to improve your job skill level while there i was also able to cross train with BA's to better understand what they do in the scrum process.
good,Started by career at IBM as a Operational Lead and grew into a Project Manager.  Its a great place to be in for learning and advance career ladder.  There are multiple good projects to choose from.
good,"Generally, the company has a very strong internal focus, in its efforts to deliver successful results each Quarter end across its complex matrix of management / reporting lines. This means there are many internal reviews. And also much of the decision making is short term, only for this (or the next) Quarter."
good,"First 10 days and last 4 days of the months are crucial, as we have to finalize the actual and forecast numbers."
good,Excellent work culture within a challenging environment.  Many opportunities to learn and build personal skills while having fun with extremely knowledgeably staff.

Ambition is to enhance my skills and experience within a stimulating and progressive IT focused organisation."

good,"A good place to work, Job security, Flexible working hours. Best for having a stable career. Many opportunities for growth, less work pressure. One of the best employers in the world."
good,Work culture is good & work environment is also good. IBM is taking care of woman employees.  WFH facility is there. But they are paying very less salary.
good,"I worked remotely for IBM for 16 of the 19 years I worked for them. I was given a lot of freedom and interesting work but because the team I was on was large, I was not given the opportunity to learn automated testing which kept me from easily finding a new job when I was laid off."

good,"A career with IBM offers the individual many options to develop and expand skills in technology, management and sales. "
good,"Tremendous team environment with a diverse community of interesting, caring, intelligent, and fun people.  Leveraging technology to promote flexible office hours to provide work life balance as needed."

good,it was nice working at IBM. Lot of opportunities to grow in the company. Employees have access to plenty of online training material and one has to complete 40 hour training as part of appraisal process.
good,"Not a bad experience. The pay wasn't the greatest, but it wasn't completely terrible although that would be relative to your options.. I was making $40,000 when I first started in September. But when January rolled around they gave the new financial analysts raises to $47,500."

good,"The good things"

good,"Bei IBM habe ich im Outsorcing in der Produktionsplanung für"

good,IBM is a good place to work and grow professionally. i learned a lot about the corporate IT culture. I would recommend IBM to my peers as it be a very to good experience to have.
good,"Great Company - However, mergers - Had to train folks from overseas to transition job to them.  Benefits were great.  Flexibility to work from home.  Raises and Bonuses were good."
good,Great company. Excellent employees with an incredible knowledge base. On boarding process could improve as far giving employees the total understanding of the position applied for.
good,I spent 3 months on site in Burlington Vermont area and requested to work the next three months at home because of a family situation and the group was completely amenable to my situation. I drove home worked here and sent all of the computers back to Burlington when the project was finished.

good,"Officemates are fun to work with. Along with my Super-visor and GM's of the company. Mostly are down to earth peoples. But when it all came down to work, they will push you to be at your A-game every time."
good,"I enjoyed the fact that I worked from my residence when not traveling to client locations. I was senior enough that I was given wide latitude in creating a technical response to a clients business needs. The hardest part of the job as a Senior Technical Solutions Manager, was that we led the overall technical team and very rarely did we work with our peers. So, we would create informal lines of communication between us to go for advice or counsel."
good,"Good place to work. Salary is higher than the average for Bulgaria. One of the best IBM office building in the whole world. Recommended, also good for the CV"
good,"Great learning experience & training, many different opportunities within IBM to grow, opportunities to work with cutting edge technologies, growth potential in services, software and hardware technologies."

good,"I have worked in IBM for almost 2 years and got to learn a lot during that span of time. There are lots of opportunities to learn and grow your career, the management and workplace culture is pretty chilled out. If you are in a good project working on cutting-edge technologies, you can learn a lot as IBM has really good clients."
good,"Great people, and very flexible. Human company, and very goal oriented. "
good,IBM offers good career opportunities with competitive benefits and perks. However the business consulting branch of the company has not been well positioned to acquire and retain clients. Limited funding and resources has resulted in understaffing which has in turn resulted in reduced quality of services to the clients.

good,"A IBM, em muitos aspectos é uma escola para qualquer carreira que você vá seguir, uma vez que você tenha optado por deixa-la. É uma empresa com padrões altos de exigência em seus processos, proporciona um ambiente favorável ao crescimento de seus funcionários e em retorno exige que cada um deles entregue seu melhor. Sou muito grato por ter tido a oportunidade de fazer parte desta empresa por muitos anos."
good,"IBM is by and large a very good company. IBM started sliding from ""great"" to ""good"" during Sam Palmisano's latter years at the helm, when leadership seemed obsessed with demonstrating profitability through cost savings by greatly curtailing the march to innovation. I was a product manager at that time and witnessed the preference of acquisition over organic innovation, to reduce risks and, perhaps, to mitigate the impact of the inertia that sets in when people get ""a little too comfortable"" about their position in the organization and their organization's position in the market... Over the past two years, I am seeing more invigoration, organizational agility and investment in the pursuit of innovation. The current leadership, under Ginny Rommety, seems to be true to their message. It takes a while to turn a battleship, but battleships can certainly be turned."
good,"ÓTIMA empresa, ótimos benefícios, porém o plano de carreira é condicionado ao networking interno, muitas vezes suplantando o desempenho individual perante o coletivo."
good,Good prospects and good work environment. Lots of opportunities for training and increasing knowledge base.Good friendly people to work with. Constantly changing priorities and course adjustments.
good,"Good to work and learn but not a good paymaster, Growth is localized. The amount of work is segregated in pockets with NCR being at the minimum, Bangalore the highest. And so is growth."
good,Nothing significant to document.  Provided much exposure to different roles.  Would suggest that current culture looks to hire the younger generation and experience is not as important
good,Best place to learn many I have learned many newthings. mentoring and team management and managers are good at IBM homely environment I love to work back if I get the ops.
good,"Good Place to Work and lot of new opportunities "
good,"One of best company, Very competitive. Has great vision. Get to work in multiple business areas. Company expects to work closely with Customer and get more projects."
good,Everyone I worked with was extremely helpful and willing to teach whatever was required or asked of them.   Working night shift separated me from moots my colleagues however all training I received was sufficient.
good,"• Provided tech support for American Express employees"
good,IBM employs the best of the best.  Worked in a sales office with employees who are driven to succeed.  Competition is high and can be a stressful environment as everyone is trying to reach a common goal.  Fair workplace environment.
good,As a fresher I have learned so much from the company. The company have given me opportunities grow in my technical side. Management should have been good.

good,I enjoyed helping others with their Linux installation and scripts. I also  liked that it was encouraged to help each other out. Typically I would process access change tickets. The hardest part was the quarterly audits. I helped the audits go smoother by writing a small database to keep track of changes.
good,"Nice place to work and grow in your professional career, it has a great learning opportunity. Senior management is good, supportive, having nice work life balance"

good,"I was in the GBS Consulting organization.   Utilization is a key measurement and to remain billable.  Travel is often required, but was able to work at home on Fridays.  Global organization that works projects globally."
good,A great service was being provided by helping people refinance their home under HAMP. the logistics and management style/approach stifled production. overall a good work environment.
good,The great thing about being with IBM is you get to work with the best people who will inspire you to work and strive harder to deliver client's success.
good,"I worked for Pomeroy Contract.  Worked only when needed; mostly Midnight Shift. Part time"
good,"I would walk in, go to my cubicle, and test whatever software programs that they required of the interns, go to occasional meetings (usually 2-3 a week)  and would absorb meeting knowledge and apply to rest of my job. Very relaxing work environment until it was crunch time but otherwise an overall great place to work/intern at."
good,"There are many highly skilled people at IBM, if you reach out they are willing to help / teach / mentor."
good,"Good work environment, work-life balance. CEO focused on the right technology niche and driving over all organization to a purpose. Growth has slowed down for several years but the company has maintained relevant in the market place."
good,"IBM was good in my 28 years with them.  Some layoffs occurred and caused some ripples.  They were, at times, quite good with remote work ... but then they would put in new directives to squash that ... only to see it creep back in over time.  Lots of opportunities to work with the best technology out there and more autonomy than one might assume in a company that size."
good,"É uma boa empresa, que dá oportunidades a todos, independente de gênero, origem, idade ou orientação sexual."
good,IBM has lots of horizons to explore in terms of choosing your career.The management tries its best to keep the employees satisfied with their career development.
good,Worked from home. Was treated with respect unlike some pervious employers. Had many opotunities to learn new things. Team ran out of work and was laid off. Not great job security.
good,"Typical call center, micromanaged...a lot. Super busy. Wonderful co-workers but they are serious about the job requirements. .........................."
good,"good company but pay less, work life balance, employee friendly, multi culture environment, job security but salary not upto the mark. Work from home, flexibility"
good,I have enjoyed my job and assignments . Good work life balance but too many frequent changes. Have learnt various new technologies and IBM has been leader in some and slow to respond to some. .
good,"Interact with engineers, designed printed circuit boards."
good,Com bons benefícios e com um bom suporte  de peças
good,"Lots of opportunities to learn - on the job, at IBM sponsored classes and through tuition reimbursement for advanced degrees.  Management was willing to help employees gain the skills to be successful in the role."
good,This is a truly great company. The culture is very open and very results oriented. This growing company requires a high degree of initiative from its managers and bases its decisions on performance.
good,Very stuffy finance dept. Needs to catch up. They do a great job with providing events and team building exercises for new hires and interns but can come across as brainwashy at times
good,It is a nice place to work and anyone one can get good opportunities to grow them self. The work culture is also good and learned lot from the organization.
good,"IBM has a very diverse culture "
good,"Good work place, along with exploring opportunities. Learnt new technologies, enhanced my career skills along with project deliverables. I would suggest everyone to work here"
good,"un dia tipico en el trabajo era checar hi pot, y ver que los equipos de computo estuvieran bien conectados, llegar al horario, la cultura laboral era muy buena"
good,"I spent  30 years there and for the most part truly enjoyed it all - the job, the atmosphere, the people. The company treated their employees like family in my first ten or so years there but afterwards, they started making cut-backs on many things starting with the first big lay-off and things were never the same after that. Still, I will never forget my time there and the many wonderful memories I have. My closest friends to this day are from IBM and for that, I will always be grateful."
good,"The opportunity to move around and take new roles in IBM makes it very attractive. If you network, and are fortunate enough to have a good leadership chain above you, the possibilities are endless. "
good,"I was a contractor, I was assigned to work the a specific account. I enjoyed my work. I took advantage of every opportunity to train and learn something new, and shared my experience and knowledge with others. Unfortunately to no fault of the workers, the account contract was lost to a lower bidder."
good,"Large, stable, slow-turning ship -- but you will have a stable environment to work in (no ""bro-culture""). Trying to stay relevant in cloud/container/serverless world."
good,"IBM promotes work life balance and dynamic environment to the employees. As this is a multinational company, the strategy, business direction keep on transforming and look out for great opportunity. Due to its rapid change, an employee required relocate to grab opportunity outside Malaysia. Learned a few systems and skills across different team. Cultural and employee background diversity has opened up my mind about their working culture and positive attitudes cultivated by them."
good,great firm to join and gain industry specific skills......... present in almost each and every area with the vast offerings........ good for early entrants
good,It is company with a very good work/life balance but I am disappointed with the compensation it provides to its employees. IBM needs better management to push forward.
good,Decent company to work. It has a relaxed environment. Not the difficult job to get. Operations team is horrible here.

good,"I enjoyed working at IBM, the culture and environment really make it comfortable. There is a diverse set of employees especially at the RTP location in range of age and background."

good,Good roles and responsibilities and freedom of work
good,"At IBM led a team of 13 (FTEs) and 6(Contractors) as a Resource Manager. "
good,"I was a contractor, working under another company. IBM has a nice campus to work at. Good people good environment. The Data center allowed me to further my knowledge in the IT world"
good,"Large company, lots of turn over at the manager level, had 13 managers in 4 years.  Was able to work from home, Was easy to shine if you are willing to work outside of the norm.  Find a problem , recommend a solution and a plan and work through that plan, most employees are just task doers, rigid rules of production.  I was most successful by going outside of that norm."
good,"Good environment !!!! I started my career in IBM."
good,"At IBM you get the opportunity to work on many very interesting projects with premiere companies.  The is a ""road warrior"" environment, 4 - 5 days away from home but lots of concern for work/life balance.  So if you have a family issue - that is given precedence,"
good,"Remote SSR of repairing hardware within my area.Run Diagnostics, disassembly, replace part and reassembly. Parts reconciliation important part of job. Must be a self starter."
good,No comment.  I have retired from IBM and enjoyed my time there.  Good people with unbelievable skills and a willingness to go the extra mile to complete an assignment.

good,"Very good work culture "
good,"always under the gun to be 100% (2080) billable hours.  Vacation in term only, typically had to ""make up"" time taken.  management was more focused on their job.  since we worked at customer site, we conformed with their workplace culture, which was a bit more relaxed.  Overall, a decent job experience."
good,"I worked at IBM until my retirement. I was there for  more than 11 years and I was happy with the package I have.  The health card was free for me, my husband and daughter.  There were allowances and benefits on top of the salary."
good,"When I was first hired on, IBM was one of the top technology companies in the world to work for.  I considered myself extremely lucky to start my work career with a company like this.  Over the next several years I watched painstakingly as IBM slowly succumbed  to the same cost-saving, stock-growth-at-any-cost measures that the rest of industry competitors had already begun.  As many of its traditional, core business units have been sold off for short-term stock gains in the last decade or so, Big Blue now appears to be developing something of an identity crisis with investors, prospective employees, and the public. With IBM no longer selling those printers and point-of-sale machines and PCs, what exactly is this industry giant peddling?"
good,"Ideas are encouraged, however onsite chances might be less or nil."
good,its good place to work with paid vacations. its great learning place to work. IBM is a brand of IT agencies. but in future it can be good career place to work.

good,"Austin is the most laid back IBM campus with very casual attire by many, ping pong tables, volleyball courts, Agile open spaces."
good,IBM has been an incredible place to start a career. Consulting with their clients has taught me a critical foundation for business acumen and strategy. IBMers in Global Business Services will likely work at a client site part time or sometimes full time as a consultant. I learned the importance of learning key problems for a client and their typical environment very quickly in order to be a key advisor and contributor. The hardest part of this job would be balancing internal IBM work with client priorities. The best part about IBM is the people we work with - everyone is a successful and intelligent ally who I have befriended and value working with.
good,"Good Experience, good people. I enjoyed my time here, however questioned some of the strategic direction of the group I was in. I would recommend this company to others."

good,The learning resources are unparalleled so take advantage of everything we have access to. Be assertive to get staffed on projects that actually interest you.
good,"Learning is quite a lot, salary hike should be more. Work culture is fine, more focus should be given to everyone and a bit of inner politics lets the other person who is working down"
good,"I was not a long term IBM-er, but according to those that had been with the company 20+ years the company moved from a positive, almost family-oriented organization to cut, profit, offshore.  "

good,"IBM is good place for us.I enjoy that experience."
good,"It a good place to obtain experience but not pay wise"
good,"IBM is very flexible with respect to the work culture and you can work from wherever you can."
good,"Quality organization with a very diverse set of skills and offerings."
good,"I loved the culture diversity at the workplace. My years at IBM was enjoying where I have made a long lasting relationship with many colleagues. Although the environment is face-paced, I was able to seek other opportunities in difference divisions. I got a chance to job shadow several directors through the mentor program. What I learned about IBM is to use available resources and network outside to other areas."
good,THINK - Utilize or train on a value which never ages - Values promote Innovation - IBM always lead the pack in innovation and new products - really still does - market it and get out of the old business - finish the transformation

good,"good place to work, good environment to work  "
good,For any fresher IBM is a good company to start with. There are many programmes run by IBM by which an individual can improve his or her skills. Good company.
good,"Perform assembling of computer servers  "
good,"Duties at work is fine, the people and co-workers are friendly and helpful. I learned a lot of stuff for staying in Westpac for almost 4yrs. the management is also fine. The hardest part of my job is, when i transferred to a different department without acknowledging my current situation and it more difficult for me to catch up. "
good,"Salary offered has got discrepancies"
good,everyone is wiling to teach new tasks and help develop skills. The company is downsizing so job security is not so high but the positions they do have are a good foundation
good,Good place to work but lack of career growth.Being a 100+ yrs old company -its a good place to learn but staying here a long time would mean compromising career growth
good,"It is good company..and it is good opportunity for fresher for learning, motivated from seniors and Managers.i have learnt many things about work .it is good for security purposes."
good,"This was just my contractor job while I was going to school and waited for my engineering job.  The work environment was nice, everyone was friendly and help each others."
good,"I have learned so many things like technical, non technical, management skills etc related to my working technology. It's great to work in IBM. The hardest part of the job is working in night shifts."
good,"As a placement student my team and director where incredibly supportive in helping me develop within my role."
good,"If I talk about only IBM GBS, which majorly does AMS projects, it was good experience in terms of balancing work and personal life; also for learning adventure which totally depends on practitioner what they can grab from the platter."
good,"Workplace culture and management is good."
good,IBM cared for their employees and tried to have a good life-work balance. The company is very big so it feels a bit impersonal and management is focus mainly on business and less on creating a more friendly environment.

good,Great place to work with great benefits.  Relaxed environment  at times very stressful though. Some management was not very good at leading . But overall a great place to work.
good,"The people I worked with couldn't have been better.  Great people, great attitude, outstanding to work with.  The workload they are expected to execute on was enormous...  and that was the biggest drawback...  always trying to meet those demands with a team that was slowly shrinking (job cuts).  The people are definitely the best."
good,"Good education, competitive.  Good hours, sometimes it gets too intense and apparently they still are getting rid of the old culture, IBM is still adopting agile environment."
good,"Started out as GE Computer Servce, stayed about the same after IBM took over. Great benefits, Had a team environment which empowered  the employees so we weren't micromanaged. I was a team lead and had to set priorities. always looked forward to challenges. Hardest part was the admin group second guessing our decisions. Best part management backed us up."
good,"As a fresher, I got an opportunity to work with IBM as contract employee."
good,Good sterile environment to work in. I worked with computer chips and templates. management is encouraging and there are always staff for support if you run into technical issues
good,"This is a solid and reliable place to work. The managers are strong, secure in their knowledge, non-competitive, and always have the big picture in mind. Team-work is sincerely encouraged and benefits everyone when it works. Higher pay would be desirable and opportunities for growth from the contractor to the client are limited."
good,IBM gives you vast scope of learning and will make you self sufficient and let you communicate independently with your clients. This makes candidates more self confident.
good,"IBM is a great company to work for, they are open to working from home, have excellent benefits and are a well known brand.  They are competitive in benefits and vacation time but low on salary ranges."

good,"Pros"
good,"Today's environment to get anything funded is quite a challenge!"
good,"For the most part, people had a 'can do' attitude and would move mountains to get things done.  The culture changed a lot during my time at IBM with most of the 'family' feel disappearing."
good,I only worked here for a brief moment while I was attending school. I enjoyed the people I worked with. I was working through a  temp agency while employed there.
good,Company supports people who want to improve and innovate on technology field. Learning is the key word when working for this enterprise and I had many opportunities to grow and prepare myself for the technology world.

Business Travel could be available as per the business requirements.  Work from home available.  Good Work and Personal Life Balance.  Good Award structure, like, Manager Choice Awards and etc, BluePoints which could be redeemed for vouchers and etc.  You will be removed from the organization if your work/deliverables are not met on time or receive escalations, which I think is with every organization.  On time Work with High Quality is appreciated.  Career growth could be limited within the CoE; which means, you will have to find an IJP."

I loved the flexibility of the in-office & work from home flexibility."

good,My boss at IBM was awesome to for with! Working with IBM was a great experience. Management co-workers were all great.

good,"I worked at IBM after it had transition from the old and rigid corporate culture to a ""Google like"" software shop.  Most managers I had were very eager to help with both, personal development and work. Working hours were very flexible so long as deliverables are turned in on time and most on-site time depended on scheduled meetings.  Good work was easily recognized and rewarded, though this reward mostly depended on how many top-notch team members had to share the reward with you."
good,"IBM s a great place for those looking to cruise along at a medium pace in their career in recruiting. The work environment and culture is friendly and relaxed. Work - life balance is great too. The only downside here is the compensation, which is 'Peanuts'. There is room for advancement but only if you network and connect with the right people. Simply having the talent will serve no purpose on this female dominated office."
good,"Ibm is an interesting company. its a good place to work. theres a good salary, and the hours arent overly demanding. the management are quite good. its like every other multinational: a decent, if not incredible place to work. the treasury department can be a bit quiet, so if youre the talkative type you might want to consider that, but on the other hand the people who work there ae very easy to get on with."
good,The hardest part of this job was waking up 10pm for graveyard shift. my first graveyard shift andit was even cold. And the other hard part was putting on a bunny suit. You need to be all covered up. But the job was ok.
good,Work can be very busy and hard at times...People are mostly good...Job security is not what it used to be...Overall it is not a bad place to work..It is very interesting to learn how different componets work together to make their super computers..
good,Management has been amazing at IBM.  I have learned so much in my roles there.  I think the most enjoyable part of the job is the people.  The hardest part of the job is the politics.
good,"Normally able to maintain a good work life balance. Compensation levels off after a few years so raises are smaller the longer you are there. Insurance is pricey but pretty good coverage. There's 1-2 layoffs per year which affects feelings related to job security. Advancement is highly controlled by management. Some areas will not allow you to move if they are under a lock down for hiring. Usually managers are above average, but there are some that are iffy. There's a high level of acceptance, diversity, and working as a team. One of the best corporate cultures I've witnessed."
good,"IBM is a self servicing company with tons of internal resources where you can educate yourself on any type of technology, industry, or trend.  IBM gives their employees the ability to quickly become subject matter experts."
good,IBM is one of the best IT company. And i glad to I'm working here.  But there is the only one reason i left this job because my hole team in Marathi. They will always talking our religion language. They don't speak in Hindi and English. My manager also Marathi and they doing same thing all the time.  And that time I'm alone in office.
good,"It's really good time working with IBM "
good,"Good management & leadership, Learning opportunities, Balanced life, Friendly and cooperative env, a typical day at work, onsite opportunities, job stability."
good,I have learned lot of things on IBM dring this two year's and also good work culture and management is also fine with the team members and learnings as well.
good,"IBM is a great company to work with. Im grateful that i got an opportunity to start my career with such a big MNC."
good,"Hardest part of the job was the challenge of getting the job done on time, meeting deadlines and management specifications. The sensitive handling of parts was challenging due to the fact that only certain managers could sign off.  Most enjoyable aspect of job, I enjoyed working alone and work well alone. I am also a very good team player."
good,"O dia de trabalho era intenso, sob pressão e estresse."
good,"Like other legacy vendors, IBM is in the midst of a transition to a new product line and sales model.  There will be pains as they move away from consistent mega-contracts into a more transactional (SaaS) sales model."
good,Its a place where the work life balance is not just a practice but a work culture inherited from many years. Very ethical and flexible when it comes to the maintaining such a culture
good,Très bonne expérience sur le plan humain et sur le plan technique.
good,Great working environment.  Highly technical and daily contact with highly professional engineering teams.  Difficult to initiate changes or improvements although the world wide engineering teams were open to suggestion.  Some of the management worked towards their own agenda rather than what was best for business.
good,"It nice working with IBM, have a very nice culture, every one is helpful. management is good. flexible hours,but need to work any time when its required."
good,It depends with whom you are working with. I've worked with persons who are super helpful. Always willing to help you. Again I've worked with persons who stabs at your back as soon as their work is done. Project to project it changes as well. Some times you get super exposure and great opportunity to learn. Also you can get a project that is not that great to learn.
good,"I spent 4 years at IBM where 2.5 of them were among the best of my professional career, and the rest not so much. However, I had the honor at IBM to operate in a scale and with executives that no other company (at least in the size of IBM) would give."
good,"Its nice working in IBM as we can work from home and also good work culture and great place for learning."
good,Good company for fresh grads to get experience and learn about processes. Company very process driven and difficult to advance in career unless you stay for a long time.
good,"It is a great company to start after students graduating from college. A lot of to learn: how to interact with clients and management; technology knowledge. Overall, it is a good company."
good,"I loved working at IBM.  I would go back in a heartbeat.  The company does things the right way, from management to the lower level, and I was proud of my accomplishments while I was there.  The only downfall in my eyes is the lack of loyalty to the old timers and to the administrative/operational staff.  They are consistently outsourced and let go in order to hit the numbers."
good,The company is good. Doing good internationally. Working hours are very tough and expectations from each employee is very high. The company also rewards the employees yearly who performs better than the expectations.
good,"We use to take care of all IT aspects of the Dow Chemical company."
good,There aren't many work places that allow you to have a very good work/life balance like IBM. IBM is an amazing place to build up your skills with a great network of people willing to help you even at the most challenging tasks. The workplace culture is second to none and anyone who has worked here will only have a in-depth knowledge to share wherever their new career may take them. You will never be disappointment by hiring a exIBMer as they have a wealth of knowledge to share.
good,IBM is a very vast organization that gave me an opportunity to learn a lot of things I'm good at today. It's given me the best leadership offers that is helped me to mold myself into a well-versed people management person
good,"It's an exciting place to say you work for, but not always an exciting place to work in. I have moved around IBM a few times and enjoyed the opportunity to work in a variety of roles. If you want to do something different, there is probably a role available somewhere in IBM. Unfortunately, it just takes a long time to find it. There needs to be more direction, however, and more commitment within the business to train your managers and build a consistent culture. Legacy IBMers need to change with the new age of technology and so does IBM."
good,Es una empresa dedicada y comprometída con sus objetivos y vision.
good,"Best employee friendly. Not good in salary packages, Job culture is very poor, good job security. Employee freindly as we can work from home also, good place to work for female employees."
good,"I really enjoy the work life balance. There needs to be more upward mobility. You could spend years in the same position, just due to no open avenues and new applicants."
good,"Pros:"
good,"IBM used to be very nice place to work with, You can learn lot of things . I joined IBM with 3 years of experience and i have been in IBM for more than 9.7 years, that shows its a very good place to work with and it gives lot of opportunities to enhance your skills. Management is also very supportive but at times you had to stretch yourself more when you are working on complex projects. The most enjoyable part of the job is you are allowed to participate in lot of programs in IBM."
good,IBM is one of the best companies to work for...The job taught me a lot and helped me to grow a lot. There are several IJPs that help in your career advancement. HR benefits are also good.
good,"Best company I have come across with in terms of quality work standards, great implementation projects to work with, perfect knowledge hub and strong management centre."
good,"Good working environment, overall management is good, health safety, job security, cafeterias are good, facilities are good, flexible shifts, good cabs facility"
good,"It is the place to learn technologies and grow in career,"
good,"Fortune 500 companies have their plusses and minuses like any other company. IBM overall was a great company to work for.  IBM was very big on training and were constantly hosting formal and informal education sessions.  Good benefits, and as much security as you can expect from any job these days."
good,Great company.  I would call it a university company. Ongoing professional development programs taken very seriously. You will never be the same having worked at IBM.
good,"Work life balance but salary not so impressive."
good,"A positive mission statement outlines the goals and demonstrative behavior that exemplify the highest commitment to quality and service to each other, the company, customers and shareholders. The company sets out to achieve its goals in ethical, honest ways with an elevated sense of purpose to improving the planet and humanity."
good,Its a good place to work.You can have that work flexibility for work/life balance.More projects are available.Food also good.Its nice to have worked here.
good,"Workplace culture is good."
good,In IBM employee can maintain balance in work/life. Never expect much in terms of salary appraisal or annual bonus. Be always ready to travel across in entire North America.
good,"Employee friendly, good work life balance, great place to learn.Work from home is the best.Very flexible, great learning opportunities, easy to switch roles, good appreciation for work"
good,"I think despite all of the off-the-cuff criticisms IBM is one of the few remaining end-to-end technology companies. Sure they have had to adjust based on the changing business climate however, technology-wise, they seem to always bee in the right place. There is  a difference however between good-technology and good-technology-as-a-business. That latter is IBM's challenge to figure out"
good,"Lots of opportunities outside your primary area"
good,"I worked as a Procurement Specialist. The Process and team was very good. "
good,"Excellent work life balance, as there are flexible work options. Very organized atmosphere. The company can start considering better salary options and employee friendly additional benefits."
good,Good work life balance.Though a lot of things depends on your manager and role. Salary increment is very less. Senior Management is very knowledgable.
good,"Great Place to work with good work life balance!"
good,"Good company, management needs to improve. Good work culture and learning opportunities. Immense opportunities to learn new technologies, also do not expect promotions and stuff here."
good,"A typical day at work would start with engagement call of the team followed by easy-going work throughout the day. It was always fun, also serious when it is required. But at the end of the day, I was satisfied that I had given my best to the company."
good,At IBM Life is fun. Company is known for its work life balance attitude. But some times you need to work an extra mile to achieve deliverables. Compensation is a bit of concern.
good,Good company to work with. If you are at mid career level you opt to join IBM. Technical resources are paid more and lot of focus on cloud technologies.
good,"A lot to learn with in international MNC and got a very healthy environment.The colleague, activities are up to the mark. Facility provided is also awesome."
good,IBM is top heavy but the management is very collaborative. They look after their employees and tend to provide great learning platform for new hire as well as seasoned employees. Good place to work.
good,Almost no career advancement. 3 appraisal and promotion systems in last 5 years. They are not even sure of the system they are putting in place. And it means you have to start from scratch every time.
good,"good experience, great life work balance, company still need to adjust to  the current employment market and employee expectations and improve canteen"
good,"Huge organization with a tremendous infrastructure. This was my first company to work with, so it was really special. I learned a lot about how things work in IT industries specially with such a huge infra."
good,IBM lost it way when it came to the employees. It was all about the profit and the CEO only concentrated on making that they were only meeting the wants of the stalkholders. This cause unfair layoff and a lack of promotion to their employees. A lot of people were very unhappy with the company but they continue to work there because of the company name and brand.
good,"The best place to be if you are looking for Job Security. Flexible in terms of working hours/places, should be very helpful when you are juggling b/w work and family."
good,IBM provides an excellent opportunity to work life balance and give opportunities to pursue the role you are interested. IBM invest a lot in training their manpower so that the employee is equipped for new technology that are coming in.
good,A lot of learning at IBM working on global projects with Global project Managers. Learning different ways of solving any issue in a quick turn around time.
good,I was a PM at the CenturyLink account and the experience that my team and I produced within DataCenter is unmatched in the industry. We had several resources that were masters of their own domain and we worked well as a team to deliver solutions for the customer.
good,"best thing of IBM in flexible work,lots of opportunities to learn and grow."
good,Maintaining system stability.  Everyday was a learning experience.  Management was easy to communicate with.  Work place environment was really good.  Hardest part of job none.  Enjoyable part  of job was doing my job.
good,"IBM taught a lot about working in an agile and fast moving environment which is beneficial to one's growth in time & workload management. IBM is never short of great work companions and it is a fun place to work at. Hardest part of the job is attending the endless day-to-day tasks given at a fast paced rate, but the great working environment definitely helps in going through the stress when performing at high level. At the end of the day, one will enjoy the results produced"
good,IBM provided a good work environment.   I had a good relationship with peers and management.  Technical expertise compartmentalized and sometimes difficult to navigate.
good,Up until recently it has been a solid place to work. Recently it seems there is no such thing as job security or loyalty. Our teams seem to not work as well together as in the past. People seem to get locked into their own world and are not willing to cross boundaries to be 1 IBM to our clients.
good,"Good Place to work for freshers."
good,this is a good place to work and get experience across business units. It allows you to make impact on strategy and how it will be executed. However senior management does not always support your work.
good,learned service management environment while supporting IBM clients. worked with both the service engineers that supported or built systems for the clients and with the clients reporting to them. different cultures and working with resources from different environments. providing support on a 24/7 working environments

good,"IBM is a great place to work.  "
good,"Goals are made very clear, and as long as you can hit your number you can do so however you like.

good,Being here for a decade now and I feel this is a great place to work. However with 20 quarters of revenue decline has prompted leadership to focus more on saving than betterment. IBM should rethink how to make workplace engaging again.

My job was to communicate, and  monitor my team productions through out the day. Fix any problems that may occur. The most enjoyable part was the coworkers, compensations,and vacation time. I sent out daily reports to management through intranet. The hardest part of the job standing and walking a lot."
good,"Veelzijdige functie met dagelijks contact met buitenland. Bedrijf heeft protocllen en processen waardoor iedereen weet wat van je wordt verwacht. De werksfeer is top, kleine groep die in een team met elkaar samenwerkt. Bedrijf wordt geleid door Corporate, dus leiding is verspreid over Caribisch gebied, wat het af en toe wel moeilijk maakt door tijdverschil en cultuurverschil (weinig begrip voor karnavalsmoed van medewerkers)."
good,Professional environment to expose to greater heights in your career. Progress is slow and benefits are just satisfactory. Work life balance is good for all.
good,IBM is a good company to work for. But you have to be prepared to move around in different accounts. This make take you away from your original goals preferred. If you like short term accounts to work for within a 2 to 3 year time. Working for IBM can be a great place to work.

good,"IBM India is a conformable place to work. It has good work life balance and allows employees time in case of emergencies. Work from home is also an advantage extended to employees. However, it is the employee's responsibility to ensure they are judicious in utilizing this facility. The biggest drawback if any is that IBM's processes are very complicated. The first 6 month's an employee spends at IBM are possibly the most confusing. This is a focus area that IBM should work on. Another area of feedback is the degree of Autonomy provided to people managers are IBM. This usually stems out of the relatively low involvement of HR partners in employee welfare and daily engagements. "

good,"Working at IBM in the GBS area is a stepping stone in most developers careers. It's a good start, but after a few years, its time to move on. The people and the environment are fantastic. However, the work is lackluster and most of the time support only. If you come here to learn development, most of that learning will be on your shoulders, outside of your everyday work."
good,"I was a software tester at IBM and was contracted for a year. It had a steep learning curve and management was generally not too helpful in getting me situated. After I learned my tasks, I was able to automate some of it and that made my day a lot easier. For the most part, people who work there are already in cliques and were somewhat welcome to new employees. The most enjoyable part of the work I've done there was the autonomy I was given provided I was able to complete tasks that were given to me."

My project is interesting and challenging enough for me, but some of my more able coworkers have gone months without being able to get on a project while the less skilled one are on project by luck.

good,There were not any typical days while working for IBM. One day it could be taking over 100 calls while working chats( about 20-40 per day) and emails( about 30-100 per day). Another day it could be very slow where you would only take about 20 calls and anywhere from 5-30 chats and emails. I learned how to use multiple systems within the government IT sphere as well as how to manage and prioritize work. My co-workers ranged from in office to all around the U.S. and all great people. I was contracted and my the in-house management providing updates on my work. The in-house management and I rarely had interactions due to other employees needing more direction and for the fact that they took most of their information from my reports.  The hardest part of my job was learning all the systems in a short time due to the need for coverage and no other employees able to pass the test for the positions. The most enjoyable part was the flexibility I earned to either work in office or from home as well as being able to work over my scheduled time to finish work or to help with incoming new employees.

good,"Em 2009 o mundo estava sofrendo os reflexos da crise financeira que se abateu sobre o sistema financeiro. Grandes empresas como a IBM tiveram que reduzir seus custos ao máximo, destinando recursos de orçamento para áreas estratégicas como vendas, logística e marketing, deixando setores operacionais desfavorecidos quanto à número de funcionários e benefícios. O dia começava cheio, vários países tiveram filiais operacionais fechadas e o destino foi o Brasil. Todos os dias um alinhamento constante era feito com diversos países a fim de maturar os processos recém adquiridos. Diversas contas de clientes possuíam divergências de faturamento geradas durante a transição e por isso reconciliações de contas, emissões de créditos eram necessários durante boa parte do expediente. O dia incluía também diversos treinamentos de novas equipes de processadores (40 pessoas treinadas por mim) e reuniões de estratégia operacional. O ambiente é extremamente dinâmico com profissionais a altura de suas competências, pontuais, bem relacionados e flexíveis. A parte mais agradável era o convívio com as pessoas e a divisão do conhecimento. A parte mais difícil era a abdicação quase total da vida pessoal (jornadas de trabalho de mais de 12 horas por dia eram vistas como normais e finais de semana e feriados eram tidos praticamente como dia útil. Gostaria de fazer uma observação que a carga horária excessiva é necessária em alguns picos, porém com uma remuneração atrativa o peso deixa de ser tão insustentável."

It's a huge organisation that has shown resilience and bounced back into competition. Its size and complex internal process makes it a bit sluggish to maneuver the sharp bends introduced by fast changing consumer needs and emerging trends.
good,">Good environment to work"
good,"Good company to work but after having good amount of experience."
good,IBM offered me a great opportunity to learn viable job skills.  They  provided excellent training and encouraged us to take the training.  The training was classroom as well as self paced training.
good,"Great company. Worked in the tax department. The company is very good at paying little to no taxes. My manager was retiring so he really did not care anymore about his job. Told me he was working to build his grandchildren's college fund. Put a ton of his work onto me and the other intern. It was my job and I enjoyed it so no worries. The head boss did not remember my name and after the third week, I stopped saying hello to her because I was wasting my breath. The other managers and lawyers were unbelievably nice people."
good,This is the first project in IBM and learnt many regarding Siebel technology. Team is very supportive in experimenting new ways while developing. More flexible to work.
good,"Best company to work. Learning opportunity & wfh. Exposure to learning. Great leadership team, Great place to work. Job safety is the best part of the company"
good,"IBM is very customer centric organization and gives at care to customer and stakeholders.  Lot of learning at work and IBM provides lot learning content which is very helpful for the career.  A typical day at work is non-stop requirement gathering and analysis.  Management is helpful, however, in constant pressure from top management on every aspect."
good,I have gained a lot of experience in IBM company internship i met  new respectful and high qualified people i learned more about how big companies work
good,"Its a Managers company and fine to work with IBM."
good,"Great work life balance, and you will find yourself surrounded by smart, passionate people. The culture of the company will depend on which business unit you end up in. Very mixed bag due to the sheer size of IBM."
good,"It does not matter, as this is just a hurdle to complete my profile. This requirement is something that is turning me off of Indeed, it should be optional."
good,"The environment is really great, people is thinking on improve themselves, always learning always thinking out of the box."
good,It was fun working for IBM. But later lean was implemented and it was quite interesting and challenging.Managers are quite helpful and encouraging. They trust you and help you.
good,"Like any company or organization, its only as good as the people in it. Same van be said for IBM during my time, I met some great people & then there were others (ughhhh)."
good,"IBM's name is known everywhere for good reason. The company continues to innovate, and it is that culture of excellence that has allowed the company to survive for over 100 years. The company has an unlimited amount of resources for its employees but also struggles with finding direction (its portfolio is too large) and inefficiencies (organization too siloed and disjunct.)"
good,"the work is ok..it's is fun to work  when tham but some time it's not ok and ther is no team work. IBM is the best place to work and learning."
good,"Allowed to run my own business once management has seen results and maturity. Very flexible on hours worked, able to travel whenever needed with no expense pressures. Amazing people with superior talent and strong work ethic. Have 1-2 internal calls per day depending on if we are submitting proposals which has it grow to 3+ per day. End of quarter pressure is intense to make sales goals."
good,"Overall, learning in IBM is great as well as the work life balance as work from home is allowed. However, salary does not align with the amount of work being given."
good,"Work culture is fantastic, Company is good for work-life balance, Growth is very limited in term of financial. Vast material is available for a learning point of view."
good,Good place to work. Work from home facility available. Laptop given on the first day itself. Tools can be installed easily. Manager oriented. Good facilities.
good,"Productive and fun work place.Good atmosphere and culture.Few options to work remote.There are games like tennis,ping pong,volley ball etc and refreshments available."

good,Buen ambiente laboral fácil acceso trabajo muy tranquilo
good,"I had a great experience working with the professionals in accounts payable department, clients were very helpful. Great place to work with where the people recognize the talent and the hardwork you put in."

good,"Good company to work,  flexible work timing.  Work environment is also good. If I got the chance to work again in IBM,  I will definitely join the company."
good,"Friendly and fun work place."
good,"IBM was a great place to learn and grow.  I only left because they wanted me to relocate to Dallas which I wasn't in the position to do due to family obligations.  "
good,"Lot of support projects in pune. Work life balance is good.because of the brand name..have good understanding with customers.hikes but low."
good,When you have a contract it's pretty good. Stock price has been in a free-fall for a very long time. Raises are infrequent. They push a lot of company-wide training that has nothing to do with you.
good,"The internship was really interesting, worked with a lot of different people from different countries. Relaxed workplace culture, learned a lot about Python backend developmend as well as graph databases."
good,"Learned a lot of things with IT industry."
good,"Best place to work in India if you are looking for flexibility in your work schedule, When other players in the industry turning micromanagement - such as 9 hour swipe in policy, it is only IBM where you get 100% flexibility, I can firmly say that no one in the industry today can offer IBM’s level of flexibility"
good,"A IBM é uma empresa dinâmica que fornece muito subsídio aos Funcionários, onde o desenvolvimento e crescimento depende na maioria do próprio funcionário."
good,very flexible and great people to work with. I am impressed at the knowledge and amount of information to help you grow in your job and make the best of what you can be at IBM.
good,"Solid company to work for, and they train their employees well in all aspects of working for a large company.  The company still comes through each year with solid financial results."
good,Opportunity to work with some of the brightest and most talented people around. Colleagues are always willing to step up and help in any way possible. Management has typically been hands off but always there when needed.
good,"A positive work oriented office with sufficient support for administrative actions.  Good communications network to talk directly with clients that were receiving services. "
good,"Overall its a good company to work, my experience with the senior management was fantastic. However when it comes to salary, not impressive. Hike are hilariously low and dissatisfying"

good,"i will write a better review later up to 3 months - it all depends on the urgency of the need, and how well IBM did last quarter - overall left a bad taste in my mouth"
good,"cross skill enhancement"
good,Wish I was working for IBM at SUNYPOLY helping to insure they were receiving good quality UPW and wastewater was in spec. Would like very much to mentor new employees
good,"Lot of peaks and valleys as projects go through life-cycles. Peaks were intense with lots of meetings, high expectations and pressure on performance. Constantly learning at IBM whether it be through job experiences/problem solving or through more formal/structured learning. Lower level management has always been excellent. Executive leadership decision making has more recently been highly questionable, especially inside Watson Health. Every day was largely enjoyable as everyone operates with highest integrity and encourages open communication environment with lots of emotional intelligence."
good,"IBM provides you with the opportunity to learn a great deal about selling and the product that you would be selling which is great.  I learned a great deal about cloud technology during my time at IBM and I was succesful based on the knowledge that was provided for me."
good,IBM's Baton Rouge Office is a solid place to work. The atmosphere can be lively and the support coworkers and superiors give you make you more confident in your work and gain good experience.
good,"I like the culture and the reputation that IBM provided.  It was a excellent company to work for; however, it faces challenges today.  The IT market is not what it used to be and IBM seems to keep looking for the next big thing instead of focusing on what has made them the company that they are or used to be."
good,Loved working for IBM for an entry level but really no room for growth and no solid roadmap to improve or grow to a different position. Not much communication with management but also no one to micromanage you. Amazing co workers. Get environment. Low wages and no clear pay raise format.
good,"Un lieu de travail hors commun, Il y  a tout ce qu'il faut pour se developper et progresser"
good,People are to help. The collaboration is great.  IBM have brilliant people working in the company. They also develop employees. Non-Technical Employees will be technical after 6 months that shows you the level of training at the company.
good,It varies team to team and project to project. My people manager was really nice. He was approachable and concerned about my personal as well professional growth.
good,"Productive and fun place."
good,I enjoyed my time at IBM.  I found the company and culture to be a pleasant experience.  the company gave me the ability to expand my knowledge at the time
good,"Empresa com mente aberto, muita diversidade, é um local para desenvolver grandes projetos."
good,Good place to work.  Worked with many wonderful people.  Great projects to be managed.  Many great places to travel and learn.  Great benefits of career growth and development.
good,"i have worked in IBM for almost 2 years now. I liked everything about the company like friendly environment, benefits, work life balance etc. Only problem is with the process of allocating into the project, once you are released from the current project you will have to give series of interviews to get into another project. Interview will be almost similar to how you apply for outside company. Instead of getting a project inside IBM you can easily get prepared and get into other company. This process is very annoying. Also 1 more problem is the work location. there are many work locations within bangalore, They will not give you which is favourable for you even if that place has vacancy. Apart from this I love IBM policies, colleagues, culture, and everything. No words about anything else. As i joined as lateral i dint face hike problem till now, but i have seen most of the IBMers struggling for hike for long years"
good,"Productive and friendly work environment . Less micro-management . Trust and good relationship . I have learned so many things from IBM."
good,Need to relocate based on the projects. Flexible work from home options with women friendly environment. Management is good but they depends on the team you are in.
good,I learnt lot of new things & process. Lovely team to work with. Had a great manager who helped me build my career. Overall I have pretty much fun working with the team & IBM.
good,"Good management, Work focused, Good guidance from the management for progress in work. Only draw back is that the location is a problem. Both MTP and EGL where i have worked are traffic clogged places. But overall, a wonderful experience. Management was very supportive."
good,"IBM is one of the best place for working as a software Engineer."
good,IBM is a good place to work with a stable work environment. Pay could be better but overall with the ability to work remote 100% of the time it works out well.

good,"Good Place to Work. Good Work life balance."
good,"I work for IBM since 1997-2006 although did not a good pay but I have a very excellent manager with a family oriented but the pay is not desirable work environment is more peaceful but I would say it "
good,My position was Administrative Assistant.  Those positions are not as secure as staff (salaried) positions.  Our management team was positioned between the assistant and the executive so the executive's opinion of the assistant is not always considered when performance reviews are in place.  The management team has the last say on the performance appraisal rating.
good,"Work life balance is depends on the project.   What ever project which I have worked, I love to work on IBM.  Compensation improvement will not happen immediately because of too many process and too many people"
good,"No es amistosa con dificultades personales o de salud con sus empleados.  Al final una empresa vela por sus intereses."
good,"Good Place to Work , Good Work life balance . Flexibility at working from home will will add lot of values . Good working environment and Good Management team"

good,"A healthy work environment, quiet room is good for relax, work/family balance, assign buddy to help when you are new at company for day-to-day help. "
good,"There a re people at IBM who are amazing at their jobs and if they do not know something they are encouraged and self motivated enough to go find answers.  IBM has resources and desire to keep employees trained and up top date."
good,"Good experience, learning new application and tools"
good,"I absolutely love my job, however I’d like a full time position and there is no room for that. Other than that the atmosphere is amazing the pay is great and they are flexible."
good,"Der er mange gode kolleger i IBM, og de gør det til et godt sted at være. Og der er plads til mange forskellige mennesker, hvilket også gør det interessant. Der sker også en masse interessante ting og ændringer, men der er for meget pres på omkostninger, og der er for meget at lave for mange mennesker."
good,"Es un gran Empresa, con un excelente ambiente y muy buen trato con sus trabajadores."

good,"IBM is a good place to work, they pay less than other companies but there are growth and learning opportunities."
good,"IBM is a good company to work, as work timing is flexible and work and personal life balance is very good  But salary is a con, increment is very minimal"
good,"There are tremendous resources and capabilities available. It is up to you to find them and leverage them. It is not uncommon in the consulting area, to find yourself constantly working with new people or on your own. Your teammates will equally be at clients and remote. "
good,"I was put on a great team that valued my work and interest in learning and made a strong effort to give me the best experience possible. However, not all of the interns were in the same situation I was. Some were put on all-remote teams and were therefore not given very good guidance throughout the internship. Perhaps IBM will improve their internship program as they become more experienced with it."
good,"Programa de integracion muy asutero"

A cultura organizacional é admirável, existe um orgulho em ser Ibmista. Uma crítica construtiva, por ser uma empresa muito grande as vezes as decisões não são rápidas, em qualquer area de negócios o timing é precioso, talvez revendo alguns processos pra trazer mais agilidade, horizontalizar um pouco mais a tomada de decisão seja uma boa medida, muitas vezes sentia que as metodologias ageis eram mais pregadas do que usadas."

good,"I have enjoyed my time at IBM.  However, when you work at a ""non-strategic"" location, career progression and mobility is a problem.  The Agile/Accelerate initiative is creating collocated teams, whereas for over a decade, if you had phone and internet, you could pretty much work anywhere and apply to most positions.  Since I don't want to move to my assigned collocation site, I plan to separate and find another position locally."

good,I worked as a customer service rep. The work was a bit boring and at time stressful. Management was ok. Was a good starting point for my career. Would not want to stay for long though.
good,"A temporary job with no promises you will become a permanent employee. While you are there, the pay is good, with good benefits. The 12 hour shifts are tough. Although working alternating 3 and 4 shifts a week is nice, the 12 hour shifts begin to weigh heavy after a while even on off days. The management and people in my area were fantastic, but I did hear from other employees it wasn't that way in certain areas."

The internal IT systems (email, online meetings, IT Support/HR/Sales software) used to be awful but is now mostly excellent. Learning / Training is also excellent. The downsides are the bonuses which are terrible and the management which can be patchy - some managers/leaders are awesome, but others are too caught up in the client work to be effective as managers.

Cognitive Computing (AI) is on the rise, with strong focus, and one of very few places to learn and experience this growth area."

good,"Was in constant progress & good work culture, exposure !!"
good,"IBM is a great company to work for if you are just starting out, it seems though that they are more willing to hire new grads and train them rather than promote or properly compensate their current employees. If they spent a little more trying to keep employees they could get back on their feet."
good,"Environmentally friendly organisation, with great sustainability ideas, willing to take on new ideas. pleasant  staff , with highly trained professionals."

good,"I worked as a project manager at IBM. I absolutely enjoyed my time at IBM and the people I worked with. The things that I could control were amazing, but the things that were out of my control (i.e. above my managers head) were either not clear, conflicting, seemingly cold-hearted, or just not in line with what was actually happening below them. It seemed to me that upper management would change course every 1 to 1.5 years, and oh by the way, it takes 2 years to implement those changes."
good,"I worked for IBM Design, and had a great time."
good,We work hard and we play hard.  Learned a lot about IBM operations.  Management was very informative.  Work place culture was good.  Hardest part of the job was taking time off.  Interacting with the different personalities.
good,"Nice Organization to Work"
good,"IBM is one of the biggest MNC , Its a good place to work and it helps us improve our skills regularly by helping us attend regular training program's which helps us in performing our daily activities without any issues."
good,I worked for 2.5 years. IBM is certainly a big company with lots of opportunities and stability. For a fresher to join IBM specially GTS is very disappointing because they give training in certain technology but place you in different one. They make one do clerical job more than technical work. There are many different na complicated process for doing simple work. Work pressure is high as well and salary increment is very low if you are rated as good performer too. Many of my colleagues even did not receive there bonuses. If you are very much experienced then its a good option because one can get stability.
good,"Empresa com grande plano de carreira em diversas áreas, muito aprendizado tanto na parte administrativa e tecnológica, o funcionário fica a vontade para administrar seu horário de trabalho."
good,Great people to work with and the salary is very competitive with other companies.  I am not a fan of the new co-location policy as it has cost IBM some very strong performers.
good,Salário compatível com o mercado local. Ótimos desafios profissionais que alavancam e te colocam em posição de evidência para o bem e para o mal. Alto nível de concorrência interna. No geral é uma empresa instigante para se trabalhar.
good,"IBM is a great place to learn new things , Being a project manager there are many internal training's in Project Management which helps to increase the skill level."
good,It's having great work environment.The management is good.Best place to learn the basic and advanced technology and skills.Try to be in Development side.
good,"Until recently I was able to work from home. Actually IBM initially kicked me out of my office so I had to work from home. Now they wanted me to move 3000+ miles from my home of many years and go into office every day. Full reversal. Needless to say, my only other choice was to leave the company, so here I am."
good,es una empresa de clase mundial que apoya a los trabajadores en sus diferentes areas.
good,"As the name suggests, IBM has always been a top brand setting standards all across the globe. The company's strong policies and benefits were always centered around people."
good,"The job was into management of different project, through which i got an opportunity to interact with different people across the world. this job helped me to learned to manage a team"
good,Workplace is good. It is a  good company. Management depends on project to project. Highly flexible and work from option is available.Good place to spend your whole career once you have achieved everything.
good,"• Great training and a good way to get a foot in the door of the software/ technology industry."
good,"Typically my day going okay types and i have learn't alot of work about database ,when we comes to management it good,friendly working place,the hardest part of the job is during the dr drill acivity."
good,"I was able to work from home when needed, and work/life balance was good when I started, but after I was promoted the work/life balance was not good, to say the least.... Also, the pay was not great but I've heard that the salary has gotten better. Some FA roles were easy while others were staggeringly over-worked. Overall, I learned a lot of great skills from this job, but ultimately I became burned out in my last role after being over-worked."
good,"Administrador de plataforma de respaldos TSM, configuración bajo las mejores practicas, brindando los consejos que mejor se acomodan a cada cliente."
good,"IBM is a very large and complex organization.  It requires a certain understanding and skill set to navigate and be successful at IBM. Work/life balance is great, and the culture is very laid-back and risk-adverse/conservative.  Despite difficulties in transformation and change management, there is job security and opportunities for advancement."
good,"Productive, Flexible and good deliverables. good work place culture."
good,"The benefits and salary are really great, but if you're a go-getter you will probably become bored after a year. Coming in via acquisition is especially difficult. IBM forces you to learn and use all of their proprietary business management software, which is all extremely slow and outdated.  The large reorganization of the marketing department has caused a pain and tumult and generally soured employee attitudes toward the company. Watching so many people fall by the wayside to increase company ""agility"" is disheartening and inefficient in terms of talent retention."
good,I was employed over two different stints with IBM.  My overall experience was good and I still hold a fairly favorable opinion of the company.  IBM has changed a lot through the years and a lot of the changes were not good for employees.
good,"IBM es una empresa extremadamente grande con un gran personal capacitado para lograr sus objetivos, pero estar en una empresa tan grande tiene sus desventajas te sientes minúsculo en algo que estas trabajando."

good,"A typical day- involved working projects and responding to outages and problems."

good,"Every day we get something new to learn."

good,"IBM promotes innovation through the employees, so you have the opportunity to share in patents, books, articles (scientific and non scientific), and volunteering projects."
good,IBM has always been a place where one is exposed to very high standards of work ethics. IBM provides good flexibility and open to employees redefining their boundaries and encourages them to explore opportunities and choose a career within the organization across multiple Business Units. The company invests huge on training and certifications for the employee. With over 105 years of history the company has an ocean of information. Its a company with endless opportunity.
good,"•	Create contracts from internal documentation"
good,IBM can provide a good platform to learn and explore.Employee can work from home when it is necessary. A lot of good projects to work. But very less performance pay. There is an expectation to work long hours to progress within the company. Promotion process is also slow
good,"The company employs many young and talented people. There are a lot of interesting projects  (in cognitive) going on and not enough experts to go around. My direct managers are great, however there is too many steps in a career ladder due to ....reluctance to advance people to pay more? I don't really know.   There are frequent restructuring and changes in business units and business processes."
good,"IBM is a great company for someone who is working on IBM products, it provides ample of trainings/opportunities to grow in your field. The workplace culture is also very good and not strict."
good,"IBM is a really fascinating company and I love working there. There is a tremendous focus on technical career and a true Y career path for those looking at remaining technical."
good,"Good people to work with -  the interaction between staff is difficult unless on a project since all meetings are virtual. The work is challenging and it is expected that you manage your own career and responsible for your performance. this is typical in most consulting organizations. The rewards are tied to overall company performance and not necessarily reflective of level of effort. "
good,"Although I was downsized, I would have to say that everything about my experience with IBM was satisfying.  Management was fair and helpful.  Upper leadership was visionary and provided ample support to carry out their vision."

good,"I loved working at IBM. They trained you to do what you needed to do. I taught people; I assisted salesmen; I prepared financial justification; and ran my own sales presentations.

good,"IBM is a great place to start with and to see the corporate life. Salary benefits and yearly hike is very puny, at times we feel really embarrassed to be associated with this company after seeing the yearly hike. For training and personal development it is a great place again."

good,"The induction program was excellent. The employees selected were put on probation for a month and then their performance was evaluated on the basis of their performance on the production floor. The quality team and voice and accent trainers were excellent and cooperative. It helped me improved my communication as well as sales skills."
good,You get to work among some of the most intelligent and smart people. Great work life balance. Learned a great deal about incorporating big data technologies.
good,This team does not exist anymore as it was consolidated in the US. US team is a great place to work and get experience across company. Good managers and employees
good,Very cyclical job roles. Nearly nothing to do during the middle two weeks of each and every month.  Good first role in a finance position. IBM feels too big to make impactful decisions.

good,Working in IBM was a great experience for me. I have improved myself in different aspect in the role and responsibilities provided. I worked for an Aussie Bank in Mortgage process and it was a challenging job wherein we have to complete the given task within set time with 99.9% quality to continue to be the part of the process.

good,Grande structure IT qui permet aux apprentis d'assouvrir leurs compétences et de développer
good,"My typical day at IBM is very challenging. It requires alot of analysis and modified thinking on how you should resolve a particular resolution, not to mention having a strong skill set for research. I have learned that everyday, you should do your best and that, you should not limit what you can learn, thus, never give up especially when you are facing a new challenge. All problems have resolution and you should always do it right the first time. The management has strong support to its reportees and always hear out employee's pleas and concerns. The workplace culture is dynamic, diverse and interactive that one can basically coordinate with other colleagues across the globe. The hardest part of the job is ensuring that everything is carefully done and thought of. Time management is the key in order to finish everything in a day. But the most enjoyable part of the job is having a strong and supportive teammates who never cease to provide innovative ideas, help when you need one, and endlessly cheer you up and push you up in the ladder of success."

Primarily V7000Storage, Flash, TSM, Virtual machines, and Virtual environment setup and Management utilizing ESXi. I very much enjoy working with my current team. My team lead is insightful and very good at making use of the resources his predecessor left behind. The hardest part of the job is setting up initial configurations. I set environments up correctly. With attention to current security regulations and comply fully. That being said the hard part sets in when I am handed a incorrect environment that needs changes to fit in with current security compliance and the total work is harder than a complete rebuild. That being said I take pride in my work and heartily thank my employer for building my skills."
good,Its a great company to work good work life balance and enriching environment. The compensation is not in par with the market.
good,By far the best employer I have ever worked for. The work is always interesting and the rewards are good. Coworkers are like family. Management is by far the best you can find. Work at home and you are always at work so the hours can be long. Overall a great experience.

good,"A IBM é um local agradável para se trabalhar, com flexibilidade de horários e local de trabalho, podendo conciliar a vida pessoal e profissional. Aprendi que devemos correr atrás do que queremos ou precisamos. A gerência é bem 'próxima' dos funcionários, e abre espaco para conversacão. Os colegas de trabalho são competentes e dedicados em suas tarefas diárias. A parte mais difícil é quando precisamos viajar a trabalho, ficando longe dos familiares, e a parte mais agradável é trabalhar em uma empresa que busca o bem-estar dos funcionários."

good,"Walking through the front door, turning on the computer, opening up all of the programs needed to start the day, and the very first phone call is like a car going 0 to 60 in just a few seconds, and you keep going at 60 miles an hour until the end of the day when your cars fuel light comes on. Then its time to shut things down again."
good,One of the great Brands and awesome Technology. Can practically be a one stop shop for CIOs. Losing focus on modern tech and innovations and hence getting left behind

good,"My team is very enjoyable and fun to work with. Everyone is interactive, outgoing, willing to get together outside of work. Knows when to have fun but also when to buckle down. Have not found all teams to be like this. The product I am working on is old and outdated, hard to find motivation to want to continuously improve it everyday especially with how upper management seems to leave details vague sometimes."

Promotion is based on performace and you can skip levels if you've proven yourself. When you reach band 6 supervision is a much lesser and it is more of result oriented culture, you have a flex time so long as you completed the 9 hours of work. You will have an option to work either on a night shift or a morning shift depending on availability of the job."

good,"Nice place to work. Challenging projects. Hardly any micromanagement. Flexible schedule. Excellent pay and benefits. Being a big company, procuring resources as and when needed can be challenging at times. Company supports career advancement and provides resources to do so. Challenge is making time for it as projects themselves can take up lot of time. Company also supports promoting from within. What maybe lacking are the usual perks available at a startup company such as daily free lunches, gym memberships etc."
good,"Environnement très dynamique, possibilité de découvrir de nombreuses cultures européennes."

good,"IBM is one of the best for fresher. Provides a environment where you can learn, think and implement your ideas in starting phase. so initial growth is superb."
good,"I appreciate working in a mobile environment. Training in both technical and management is likely one of the best in the industry. I've learned to take ownership of my career path. Working for a large corporation allows one to totally change career paths without having to leave the company."

good,"Typical large corporate atmosphere. Probably a bit less drama than most large corporations.  Huge footprint, incredible brand recognition, multi-layered with vast number of products and solutions. Took 18 months to become profitable but not sure if they can hold on to it. Lots of empty/older facilities which increase costs of delivery, Aging workforce not looking for change or innovation."
good,"After 14 years I was well networked into the IBM culture and knew many people. The management was kind and understanding, and I was able to perform my job duties independently. Coworkers were knowledgeable and friendly. Upper level management changed over the recent years, and most of my department was off-shored for more company profit in the short term. It was a bit difficult to make career advancements once I was in one department. My position became a bit repetitive and mundane after the years. Great community service and ability to contribute."
good,Learnt a lot of things there as they have multi-client environment. Very supportive co-workers and pay hike is good. Only cons was that they did not enough people to handle so much work hence a very hectic work place.
good,Some managers are very helpful and colleagues are helpful and ready to share their knowledge and help others. Always there is some team building activity.
good,"Had a very good and enjoyable time interacting with international clients. Wanted to stay on,however had a very little oppportunity of movement internally, hence had to shift to my actual area of interest."
good,"Manage customer own data"
good,"Great team to work with."
good,"Lots of opportunities to learn and grow as a professional. Good benefits. A lot of extra-hours monthly, but especially at the end of each quarter. Hard to get promoted"
good,"Everyday in IBM was a new learning for me. My core competency and KRAs always said Training. However, when you are handling a Inbound Customer Service team there is hardly a day when you don't encounter a new situation. Customers will ask something out of the blue for which you are neither prepared nor trained. 9 hours seemed so less specially when the most critical work starts after the team has wrapped up their day. sending reports to clients and management took almost another 2 hours so mostly I was doing a 12 hours shift. But interacting with teams and the new trainees was very enjoyable and the working environment was very healthy."
good,"able to work from anywhere"
good,A great place to work with great benefits. Very challenging but they promoted the people that went the extra mile. Economic down turn forced closing.

good,"Conforme qualquer empresa somos cobrados pelo que fomos contratados."
good,"Good place to work"
good,"The culture at IBM when I started was wonderful, we had jobs where we were responsible for producing excellent printers and sorters at Tucson, AZ. I was a Packaging Engineer which included designing, testing and training line employees, and outside suppliers. It was challenging and exciting, because it game me the opportunity to develop training modules for different parts of the distribution process."
good,"A Multinational Company Managed and run by true professionals in every aspect and all employees are treated equally across all the regions."
good,"Fun to work, a supportive work culture , where you grow if you want. Never give up and you shall win...is the ultimate lingo"
good,"I worked for ISSC, then IBM Global Services, from 1995 until 2007. I learned a TON at IBM, largely because they had a deep staff of experienced professionals, mature tools, processes and invested in education. I watched all that change between about 2000 and 2007. Friends still with IBM say the ""big Blue"" culture and the deep commitment to do it right has continued to erode under cost pressures. From where I sat (in Services delivery organization), management squeezed every last penny possible out of our Small & Medium business contracts; I was asked to slash budgets year upon year, even when efficiencies were no longer possible. The result of this was increased outages, missed SLAs, unhappy clients and lost contracts. Very sad to see IBM slip from an experienced, capable services giant to a frail behemoth. Was it bad upper management? Failed Sales/Pricing models? Over-priced CEOs taking tens & hundreds of millions while I scraped to save fractional head-count? Probably.  Regardless, it WAS once a great place to work, with lots of vibrancy, energy, professionalism and prospects and I still remember IBM fondly, even if I don't own their stock today."

The hardest part of the job is when you first start it's difficult to get placed on a project because you don't know anybody and you haven't had an opportunity to prove yourself.  The most enjoyable part of the job is doing something different and learning everyday.

good,"I enjoyed the my work and my company environment allot, they assign heavy work at the same time management provides the good support to reach my target with hundred percent of result. The management would like to recognize the employee talent and they provide the appreciation to them, for example with one year period I was selected for Bengalore Platinum process."
good,"The work was customer driven in a fast paced, high tech product development environment.  Server capacity was always at a premium which required that it be repaired and returned to duty as quickly as possible.  Being a department of one, it was a matter of being a jack of all trades and master of none in networking, hardware and security  however this also reduced the amount of career growth there was in the department.  Doing more with less is a way of life, at least in the office in which I worked.  That might be different in another location.  The toughest part was getting others to view your priorities as much their own where their involvement came.  This could be a gate to quickly turning resources over to the customer and required careful negotiation. (The last thing you wanted to do was step on any toes for those that you rely upon.)  But the challenge was always the best as well as the thanks from the customers.  If I helped them do their job, then mine was rewarded because without them, we wouldn't be needed."
good,"Each day I had to visit different kind of costumer, since small business until big companies. I had the opportunity to meet all kind of people. Was and excellent opportunity to learn how to be part of a big company as is IBM. Was the best school to be one of the best office machines technicians. Excellent benefits and compensations.

I learned early on that the only way to succeed was attention to details, no matter how insignificant it may seem at the time.    The support of management and co-workers was also vital to the successful completion of any situation (customer complaint, manufacturing quality problem, corrective actions).   The hardest part of the job was customer critical situations which required immediate action and reports to VP's, sometimes without the complete analysis of the issue.    The most enjoyable part was the working atmosphere and interaction with people, both customers and co-workers."

good,"The environment is demanding but quite likable. People are nice and helpful. Due to the structure of the company, its not very rewarding. Too many levels in the management and a lack of communication between different levels. Had to work on something I completely did not understand, but got help most of the time.

While there are over 400,000 employees it can seem overwhelming at times and navigating your way around the company's website is really the only way to find information that one might need, but the company runs fairly smooth despite the number of people and the digital jungle.

I had the opportunity to work at home some days or come in at 10 and work until 6 (if I chose).  I would say the largest downside (and this will vary by team) was that management was nearly non-existent.  There was no code quality control on my team and sometimes I had to invent my own workdays.  The ability to be independent was good at times, but I felt I could have learned a lot more if I this had been more organized.  I also found that I spent a lot more time in meetings which distracted from development work that needed to be done.  My specific division was already lacking in developers and I felt a large portion of my time was not optimized. That being said, I had the opportunity to work on three different projects as a new hire and lead one of them, so I learned a lot very quickly.  The environment is great and the folks I worked with were awesome, but I felt it could be much more organized. Again, this will vary based on team."

good,IBM is a stable organization and offers a lot for employees who like exploring different projects and systems. I like autonomy so IBM has been a good fit for me. IBM is very stingy about pay increases especially at the middle management level.

good,Did promote from within but had a very corporate and strict structure.  Management was very driven to promote themselves in the organization and tend to overlook their people
good,Good work culture and easy work. Healthy atmosphere at work and employee friendly company. Company providing effective virtual learnings and we can grow ourselves.
good,"Great work environment, you must have an ability to adapt to different situations. Team work and leadership was great tool i learn from the company and use on my next opportunities."
good,Lots of opportunities for career development and growth. Some of the MBA tracks weren't very well-defined and it takes time to understand the organizational structure.
good,"Really represent what corporate America should strive for, at least the R&D department. Have forward thinkers and visionaries focused on doing good for society."
good,Innovative culture and a great place to work.  People were fantastic and strong leadership.  The hours were difficult and lack of job security made me leave.
good,I Feel very happy in IBM having good team and good facilities in IBM they are considered the employees treat like a family  working timings also nice  and work environment also good
good,My experience was productive and had to do a lot of teamwork.I learned how to manage time and accomplished my tasks quickly. It is a job of variety cultures everyone is treated equally and with respect. A quiet environment with people from all over the world.
good,"Repeated success leveraging emerging technologies to achieve maximum operational impacts, developing, deploying and evaluating systems aimed at improving quality and efficiency. Skilled in aligning end-user needs with long-term resolutions to complex IT challenges. Skilled troubleshooter, continually focused on identifying, isolating and resolving technical issues. Accomplished communicator skilled in building and strengthening relationships across functions to drive cohesive, strategic operations."
good,"It's a really interesting and good workplce, especially for beginner or younglings, who just finished college or high school. Really good opportunities to learn, and step up on the ladder."
good,"Ibm is good company in terms of work culture and project and other benefits.project in NCR are less so they force to move to South location like Bangalore or hyderabad, so if looking for work in NCR then don't go for but if looking in Bangalore or hyderabad then good to join."
good,Good place to work with intelligent and collaborative co-workers. Job provide ability to affect change in the high tech industry. Very little growth due to long term employees.
good,"I worked for IBM for 35 years and I thought it was a great place to work until I got laid off.  I understand they need to cut their budgets every year, but a large majority of that is laying off their employees which stinks, especially when your highly paid and getting older. But the work is challenging, the opportunity for professional growth is great, and if you're a hard worker, you get the respect you deserve. I have gained a lot of skills working at IBM which makes me very marketable.  Corporate life can be easy or hard depending on what you put into it.  The key is to take on several assignments and keep management abreast of what you're doing to make the product the best."
good,IBM is a prestigious company where you can advance your career and has a great work environment. There is also a good compensation that may be relatively higher than other similar companies in your area.

good,Work with SMEs and client SMEs to get requirements
good,Overall it's a great company but I never received any bonuses or pay raises for the time I have been with IBM. Work load took a toll on me and I haven't received any offer of a pay raise.
good,IBM offers lot of growth opportunities and competitive environment. I was able to connect easily with my colleagues.  The HR and other departments were on top of employees issues.
good,"A typical day - come to work, finish up stuff from day before, stand up, code for a few hours, lunch, and come back and code a few more. I am continuously learning. They make it a requirement. I enjoy learning so it works out. My immediate management has been great, however, a few older project managers are more strict and stern. We have a lot of meetings between agile meetings, manager meetings, company wide meetings, and local office meetings. I feel our office is more modern than most IBM offices. It's not the stiff ""Old Blue"" stereotype most people know IBM as. Most of my coworkers are young, full of energy, aggressive, and willing to learn. Hardest part of my job is recognition, as soon as you do something great, they are already moved on to the next innovative discovery. I enjoy having access to large amounts of data and software which helps for learning new technologies."
good,"As one of the last remaining original tech behemoths working for IBM is about what you would expect. There is a lot of process and red tape and you are just a cog in the vast machine. If you can get in to the right department it can be a wonderful place but those are few and hard to get in to. Mostly IBM acts like it did back in the early days and expects you to just be happy you have a job with ""Big Blue"". The benefits aren't bad, about middle of the road for health.  401k matching once per year and a decent amount of vacation."
good,"Intervention sur les PC portable et Unités centrales."
good,"Des équipes compétentes, un management présent, de vrais opportunités de carrière et d'évolution..."

good,Good place to work with nice collegues around always.
good,A good place to work.They had a good work-life balance. The also had a really competitive environment. I also liked the technology which was state of the art.
good,I enjoyed working with my team at IBM. We had the best times on Fridays. Whether we are pot lucking or going out for a team outing. We spent many hours team building and branding.
good,"It is a good place to work at for driven individuals, varied work days, exposed to interesting, insightful, helpful people. "
good,"I really enjoyed my tenure with IBM India private Ltd."
good,"Excellent working atmosphere. To huge an organisation, usually in the structure you tend to get lost. Focus on work is fragmented with multiple people and multiple managers, making it difficult for the ownership."
good,"An organization that helped me to transform myself and made me realize what I need rather than what I want. There could always be some instances in your career when you are not happy with work or compensation or flexibility offered by the organizations and it can be highly confusing and misleading at times. In such situations, all need is some extra space to choose from multiple options. IBM has been helpful for me …"
good,"Good workplace, timings are flexible based on your manager and project, unlimited sick-leaves , can maintain work-life management"
good,Good salaries but medical benefits are much less than I have had a previous companies and more costly.  Bonus program is virtually non-existent.  IBM recently reduced the 401K matching.

good,"Although much of the owrk here was very repetitive, it also enabled you to find other areas within the company for you to progress into."
good,"The initial work experience provided perspective on professionalism and  the bar to evaluate other organizations.  Learned why organizations with inepted training, customer service, inferior products may not succeed."
good,It is a great place to grow if you work sincerely and efficiently. All my learning has been in IBM as I started here very young.  One of the things I do not like is that they are very policy oriented and sometimes forget the practicality.
good,"This job was fun but required a lot of travel.  I enjoyed meeting new people and the competition from my competitors.  I learn a lot about technology, but the training was not good in the beginning"
good,"Very nice place for working, everyone is friendly and helpful. Nice place for learning. Team is very co-operative. Client is also goodin nature, helpful."
good,"Very good for experienced people and freshers both."
good,"IBM is still a good place to work but has lost its focus.  It used to be that they took great care of their people but in the last 10 years, they have continued to focus on just the financials."
good,There is not much to say - it's IBM.  There is good and there is bad. We were purchased by Toshiba and shown the door.  The transition was poorly handled by IBM and Toshiba.
good,Very heavy on procedures and policies. In a state of flux after acquisition by IBM. The main product IMS is showing signs of age. It is written in PHP and is becoming difficult to maintain.

Melhorei a capacidade de solução de problemas e também aprimorei a habilidade de trabalhar com diversos setores ao mesmo tempo, assim como pessoas. Empresa tem uma cultural organizacional que prima pelo companheirismo, transparência, apreciação e respeito entre os funcionários. Para mim a parte mais difícil do trabalho era fazer todos os dias as mesmas tarefa, como sou uma pessoa muito dinâmica, procurei me desenvolver além do que era esperado das atribuições do meu cargo, fazendo com que eu desenvolvesse outras atividades concomitantemente com o cargo que exercia, me levando a também atuar como solucionadora de problemas do setor e por alguns dos treinamentos necessários para o bom andamento do processo de trabalho como um todo, e essa experiencia se tornou a parte mais agradável do meu trabalho na empresa. Time de gerência excelente, altamente focado no desenvolvimento profissional de cada funcionário e acessível para apoiar situações onde as ações dos gerentes eram indispensáveis."
good,"IBM has a great culture where people respect you and give you independence to grow and flourish. The work/life balance varies based on project role and type, but overall is demanding. It has lots of travel requirements."
good,"Always changing, very fast paced. Healthcare company that is growing. Best part for me was being able to work from home. Worst part is that my team all resides in Ann Arbor, Michigan."
good,"Hardest part was the constant down sizing, which made it hard to plan for the future.  "

good,"IBM es sin duda una universidad empresarial. En lo personal no sería ni la mitad del profesional que soy hoy sin mi experiencia en IBM. Tiene los procedimientos de reclutamiento, entrenamiento, selección y calificación de desempeño más  inteligentemente elaborados que he llegado a conocer, sin embargo siento que con el tiempo han descuidado bastante el aspecto humano ante el manejo de aspectos como productividad y eficiencia, por lo que su rotación de personal es cada vez mayor debido a la gran oferta y demanda de parte de otras empresas transnacionales que se están consolidando como empresas que invierten en el recurso humano y lo ven como parte íntegra de la empresa (como debe de ser)."
good,"A strong supportive culture"
good,"The best part about working at IBM was how the emphasis was on completion of task rather than other parameters like- put in a minimum number of hours, competition.

good,Nice people and great pay. The environment was tense. Always felt pressured to meet a deadline. My co-worker was extremely helpful and always willing to help out

As far as culture goes, IBM is not the same big blue company it used to be, but still excels in leading technologies.

So far, I love this job."

good,"The IBM motto, since its inception in 1924, is Think. The company places a high value on customer satisfaction and product innovation. IBM also places a high value on their engineering talent and has maintained an executive career path for non-managers.  The work culture is somewhat conservative but has loosened up considerably in the last decade, i.e. managers can now be seen wearing shorts and alcohol is served at some employee gatherings. The company is not as risk adverse now as it was in the 80's however new product proposals must still go through a strict ROI process. The work environment is in flux with departments using a mix of very old and new applications and procedures. IBM is such a large company though, that the work opportunities are many and the resources that can be brought to bear, in terms of employee skills, equipment and funding is huge. Working for IBM is like working for a group of companies, not as large as it once was, but still large enough to allow for big career changes within the same company."
good,"Bom lugar para trabalhar , com uma enorme gama de cursos e grande possibilidades de crescimento e mudança de área. A empresa sempre se interessa em agregar conhecimento ao funcionário. Apesar de endossar o clima competitivo entre os funcionários por causa do sistema de avaliação que compara o rendimento com o do colega, o clima no local de trabalho era  amistoso . A parte  mais difícil e conciliar as atividades que já são muitas com os cursos obrigatórios que devem ser feitos quase que sempre.

good,"Disclaimer: A lot of what I'm writing below of course depends on the work area and management chain. But I found this to be fairly pervasive policies in IBM in my 15+ years with the company. 1. IBM's policies and management are very flexible when it comes to working remotely or accommodating various life situations (sick days, doctor visits, etc.). Management is encouraged to measure an employee by their work and impact, and not by hours spent at their office. 2. Great colleagues!

Management was very hands on and my co-workers were always available to assist with any calls that required additional attention. Everyone on the team supported each other. The hardest part of the job was dealing with clients who did not want to hear that the support they expected required signing a different contract. The most enjoyable part of the job was working as a team to provide the best tech support possible."
good,Able to learn to use different types of programs to assist in the jobs that were performed.  There was plenty of training offered by the company for whatever you wanted to learn.  A normal workday was to come in and go through emails and work orders that came in after you had left for the previous day. Contact the clients and schedule the time with them to work on their issues.  Make sure that all clients were contacted and scheduled from work orders received. Complete you work that was scheduled for that day before you left at end of day. The people you work with are good about assisting you when you get in a bind and don't have a resolution to a problem that you have. The hardest part of the job was to have enough time in the day to get all the work done from all the work orders received and completed within the SLA's.
good,"I supported users as second line help desk but a few months later I got opportunity to work for customer project account which was same, but the expectations was more higher to ensure the correct business continuity. My knowledge and agile attitude helped to be good specialist in this new challenge. We supported Windows XP and 7 workstations and controlled the users and computers with domain accounts. In this company has been working more than 2500 people, so ticketing tool helped me to organize my daily tasks. The users problems were usually network errors, program bugs, program installation, driver errors, printer installation, IP phone configurations, Lotus Notes and MS Office errors, Citrix, SAP, Hummingbird, Livelink, RSA soft token, Socks, Cisco and AT&T vpn configurations, virus buster or domain account problems. The configurations were different on every project accounts. When a configuration had been changed by the project owner, we had to fix it on the account immediately occasionally more than 100 workstation. When a new account started we had to prepare for it: collect the instructions which programs would use and what kind of configurations needed. In 2013 I got opportunity to work on Cemex external project account, which was outside of IBM buildings and use their own network, servers and tools. I with my team had to ensure in this circumstances the business continuity."

It gives you the opportunity to learn and also helps you to improve the skills you need for the job. I have learned how to use the SAP and the Agile Practices. I was the leader of Innovation of my department, leading other Innovation focal points. One of the skills I have developed was process improvement. I was always thinking of a way to reduce time while doing my job or the job of my co-workers. It is because we had a team there that they were experts in Macros. So when I had an idea I used to go to talk to this team to know if they could create a Macro that could eliminate some steps of our process, things we used to do manually. In many cases it was possible. This was the part of the job that I used to like to do. One problem of the company for me was that they used to make the employees to do the job of 2 and sometimes 3 people, it was really exhausting. But I think this is a cultural problem of Brazil, I do not believe it was the same in other countries. Managers in Brazil want to reduce costs sacrificing the employees."

The management at IBM are filled with experienced and understanding staff who have a very business oriented mindset along side a good understanding as to utilization of various staff talents to ensure productivity is at its greatest potential. They are mostly friendly people who do not sacrifice work ethic but still maintain good relationships with their staff. My co workers are well rounded people, with technical/mechanical minds and backgrounds who offer their valued experiences and expertise to our area. The hardest part of the job is working around the lack of certain components needed to repair/refurbish the  parts, often resorted to salvaging, but its nothing too challenging to work around. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of successfully repairing the parts we have available to work on, knowing I've contributed to the production and found suitable solutions to overcome difficult scenario's."

good,"I had many roles in my tenure at IBM. One of the most challenging roles I had was also one of the most rewarding. It involved providing documentation and training to the production workers. Turning raw engineering processes into easily followed production documents was just a whole lot of fun for me! Occasionally I had to re-work some old ""legacy"" documents - those that existed before my tenure at IBM. One time I come across an old 20 page production document. After some thought, I realized that it could be condensed into a ONE page process flow chart. THAT is the epitome of what I was trying to provide: simplification with clarity. Instead of a 20 page process manual next to the production equipment, it was merely necessary to have a ONE PAGE chart posted for reference.

Um dia típico de trabalho na IBM é sempre cheio de mistério, onde eu trabalhava, prestávamos suporte com microinformática básica para empresas que contratavam os serviços da IBM, como eram empresas grandes, sempre tinha um grande volume de requisições, porém sempre contávamos com uma ampla documentação e procedimentos a seguir. O TL (team leader) que era o meu superior direto, sempre estava conosco e nos ajudava em momentos de sufoco, tive pouco contato com a direção e/ou gerência, mas não era preciso, pois o TL resolvia tudo para nós. A empresa tem cultura ligeiramente americana, com muita linguagem técnica e gírias em inglês e ambientes de descompressão nos moldes das empresas do vale do silício. A parte mais difícil do trabalho era atender o contingente e a demanda exacerbada de ligações e e-mails que recebíamos de solicitações de serviço, o trabalho em si não era difícil, porém o grande número de requisições tornava o trabalho bem cansativo, a parte agradável de tudo isso é que possuíamos uma equipe grande, onde fiz bons amigos que guardo até hoje."

Como em todo relacionamento social os grupos se formam por afinidades porém o transito em todos sem dificuldades respeitando todas as diferenças. Entre as coisas mais difíceis estão os fechamentos mensais onde as rotinas se intensificam e os períodos de trabalho varam a madrugada, também em função dos fusos horários, porém no fim dos processos ao poder vislumbrar que todos os pedidos sob meinha responsabilidade foram liberados adequadamente e as metas todas atingidas me enche de orgulho do dever cumprido"

I come in at work an hour early because I need to prepare my topics for the team huddle before the actual shift starts.

I have worked with different people all over the world and I can say that I understand and can easily adapt to other peoples culture. The management is fair and does not concentrate on your mistakes instead they focus on one's achievement. Point in case is I had a Major escalation when I was new to the job but that did not play a big part when I was up for promotion, the management knew that I have learned from my mistake and had been very productive since.

IBM uses the 105% billable utilization model, which accounts for salary, vacation, and sick leave. one must be highly organized, self-motivated, and extremely disciplined in time management.

I learned much of best practices with coding, AGILE methodology, and how to work in a SCRUM environment.

To top it all off it was a sensitive project so at times specifics on the project could not be made public due to national security. I learned to improvise my telephone meetings with vague information until counterpart at IBM could get a high enough clearance. The environment was what you made of it, meaning being open minded is key to success. The managers put in place do try to help as much as possible. At times it can be hard to express the importance of the project success to individual's that have never worked on a project with the military.
