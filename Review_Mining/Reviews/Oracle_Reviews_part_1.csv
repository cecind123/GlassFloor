rating,review
bad,"The work is challenging but not at all rewarding, monetarily or otherwise.  It is a policy to never give raises, not even for cost of living which is pretty standard at most companies.  I went through two promotions, one rather significant without any increase in salary despite my direct manager fighting on my behalf.  Similar events occurred in different areas of the company as well.  If an individual aspires to do better by working hard and exemplifying a model employee, he or she will go ignored and unrewarded."
bad,"Oracle is an extremely internally competitive company with multiple groups competing against one another for the same business.  In essence,  the company eats its own people"
bad,this company is great for your first corporate company but leave as soon as you can. very political and very cliquey this is not a good place to work long term
bad,"Worst management ever!   They hire dummies for management, which rate worker bees.  This is a ridiculous company that is slanted toward illegal immigration against the US."
bad,"Total disregard to Project, client and their business process. Extremely corrupt management style. Employee treatment is extremely disrespectful.  Very inefficient and manipulative executive team."
bad,I have worked for almost 3 years in oracle and they have one of the worst employee experience. salaries are too low for market standards and oracle doesn't really respect employees they just do what they want. My advice is if you thinking to join oracle think 10 times no work culture and a very sad place to work.
bad,worst place to work they hire people who dont know anything about IT or computer software most are hackers who could not find a job with their useless non computer science degrees
bad,"There was no clear direction on the DevOps workculture"
bad,"My mother died was taken away from me while i worked at Oracle."
bad,The work culture is awesome. Cool and understanding management makes life and work easier. Work life balance is nicely managed. Lots of fun activities in office besides work to break the monotony.
bad,"They replace sales people like they are ink cartridges...   Horrible non-collaborative place to work.  Every group shuts out other groups"
bad,"no new innovation, failed at cloud, you are just a number, they will do any trick to increase stock priced, management lies about business and futuire of division/job to keep you inplace"
bad,"Worst place I worked at in 25 years.   Management only cared for the favorites.  I achieved 135% of my sales targets yet was laid off, since I was over 50."
bad,This company is the worst company. If you are planning on getting a job working here be prepared to be lied to.  The shifts they offer you on your application will most likely not be the shift you will work.  Also be prepared to pay for every piece of your uniform that they require you to wear. (25$ for a shirt).  they are stingy on raises but will expect you to go above and beyond the call of duty.  Many of their high ups are two faced and morally maladjusted.  for example. instead of raises for workers they will all buy new cars up in the office.  overall you probably will develop skills that are useful for the security field and others but compared to the bullcrap that they put you through it is not worth it.  During my tenure at ops my account had over 40 guard come through it. they say that hire the best but in reality they scrap the bottom of the barrel and them some.
bad,Too many layers of management with processes that don't make sense. Seems you can't get out of your own way at this huge organization. Not very happy during my time
bad,"I was responsible for securing software sales solutions for both on-premise and cloud based products.  The job was challenging, but very strategic and rewarding.  The best part of the job was meeting with customers, solving problems.  The hardest part of the job was the internal processes that crippled the sales process."
bad,Destructive and demotivating work environment geared towards making money at any cost. Employees are willing to slit each other's throats to meet their sales targets.
bad,"Management were not friendly, and would keep staff on for a short amount of time and then get rid of them. The kitchen and toilets were old and run down."
bad,"Get thrown onto project without any knowledge or direction and expected to know and answer all client questions without support. "
bad,"No advancement in career, no pay raises, really bad management. Most of the jobs are being moved to India. They do not value their employees. Long working hours even over the ""required 40 hours""."
bad,"Run don't walk away from an Oracle position, marketing cloud or anywhere else in Oracle.  The products are not being invested in or kept fresh to remain competitive. OMC is not a priority to the larger Oracle business goals and will never be important. As such, employees and people working in the OMC group are not seen as important or valued. Its a sad commentary on the Oracle overall business strategy that is clearly focused on the acquisition of new companies to keep their sales revenues on a growth trajectory for Wall Street and shareholders. Oracle is not a technology company. It is a technology reseller, who happens to own and neglect the technologies they acquire until they become irrelevant. Price gouging and slimy sales tactics and leadership are the culture. The Leadership of Oracle sets this tone. Clients beware. Candidates: RUN!"
bad,I didn't have the best experience working at Oracle. The manager ended up getting fired not too long after I left. The mgmt. that I worked for micromanaged and didn't seem like she cared to be there herself.
bad,"Poor management, No career advancement, Long working hours, Poor pay package, Not much benefits. Managers treat employees badly and make them work extra long hours. And there is no job security afterall. There are lot of layoffs happening in Engineering, Development and so on."
bad,Oracle HW division came from SUN.  There were so many talented engineers in each functional groups.  The work environment within hardware side was supportive and relaxed.
bad,"Oracle is  the worst employer I have ever worked for. Unfortunately they purchased my previous employer and by default I became an Oracle employee. They are not invested in employees at all, HR is not there for the individual, they are solely there to protect Oracle and avoid any confrontations. The management Team is a joke, they are out for their bonus and nothing more. There are manager there that should have never been promoted to the positions they hold, they have no people skills and do not respect the diversity of the Team's reporting to them. Sadly many good people are being let go and those that remain are on the razor's edge on a daily basis. DO NOT GO TO WORK FOR ORACLE!!!!"
bad,"Extremely bad culture, low pay, lackluster benefits.  Do yourself a huge favor and avoid this place like the plague.  Go to another software giant that will actually invest money to train you, pay you market rates and manage you so that you maximize your potential."
bad,"Oracle is a well run company with lots of opportunities. "
bad,"The majority of teammates have poor work ethics and you will be taking up the slack for the slackers. Management takes advantage of this and does not correct the bad behavior. Numbers are priority. Zero perks, bonuses, or incentives. Employees pay for birthday cakes, lunches, etc. Racist, sexist, and religious comments are normal among teammates and management and I don't see a way to anonymously report this behavior. Prescription drugs are used for recreational purposes among some teammates. It is a very distracting environment. It is not a fulfilling or rewarding position to be in when the above behavior is constant and normal."
bad,"Work day includes meeting/greeting students and instructors - this was the highlight of the work day.  The culture is very difficult in that there is always the threat of reduction in work force.  The Sales teams have very strict quotas that given this climate are difficult to achieve.  I enjoyed very much the people I worked with all over the world, learning new cultures, and autonomy from managers and directors.  I enjoyed remote work and entering the Education centers 2x a week.  I also enjoyed whatever travel was involved in this role."
bad,"Honestly the company culture is...wait...what company culture? There's no real company culture here. Basically you show up and do your job like a robot and go home. Talking or creating meaningful relationships with coworkers is frowned upon. Also, don't attempt to stand out, be creative or think logically, when you are surrounded by a heavy level of ego this will put a mark on your head that you should be socially outed and labeled as ""not serious"" because you aren't angry and stressed like the rest of them. Even if you have accomplished more and bring more to the table...your positivity and vibrancy will not be tolerated. You will be secretly and passive aggressively formed into what they want regardless of how hard you work. Don't expect large raises and don't expect to be taken care of. You are disposable, always. Run from this company and take an offer from somewhere else, you will be glad you did. Just my .02."
bad,"While hiring assures you lot many benefits but after joining you will feel like you are cheated, they say Oracle hiring process needs two months meantime please work on third party payroll if you belief this and joined that's it you wont get it permanent. Food court at Oracle premises is very bad in quality. extreme micromanagement includes three meetings a day and hour to hour details of job done. no proper documentation maintained."
bad,"Always oracle is best in learning new things and as a consultant I love to code, so I'm enjoying working at oracle with lot of fun."
bad,"Enjoyable environment and challenging and task oriented job."
bad,"Perhaps it is because my company was acquired by Oracle, but clearly the phrase ""the head doesn't know what the tail is doing"" applies. It is a leviathan of a company. I went from a sole specialist in my department to being part of a team, all of which were on the other side of the country. I was asked to join ""the team"" in person, but Oracle wouldn't allow for moving expenses, time to move, an increase in pay to cover owning a house on the east coast and renting a shoebox on the west coast, or give me more than two weeks to find someone to rent my house as selling it that quickly was impossible. So I opted to stay on to head up east coast projects."
bad,"Poca direccion, mal ambiente de trabajo, muy mal equipo humano, inflexible, no se adpata al mercado español"
bad,"Tell us about:"
bad,"Place will steal your soul. You do all the work as a temp and all the full timers take all the credit. Its temps v.s. full timers, everyone hates each other."
bad,"Not enough solutions consultants, CX reps, LMS reps so the ASRs were forced to absorb those roles responsibilities. The Business Development Consultants for the HCM line was cut and that role was also absorbed by the ASRs. Overloaded with work our compensation was changed without our permission so that attaining quota would only compensate roughly 1/3 to 1/4 of the On Target Earnings originally, and contractually, promised to us. "
bad,"The management at the Hillsboro, OR manufacturing plant was the worst I have seen in the 40+ years I’ve been in MANUFACTURING. I hated every minute I worked there."
bad,"If you have a good manager then you'll enjoy your role however if you have a bad manager, you'll have a very horrible experience at work. Nepotism is how these bad managers get into position and make it a toxic place to work."
bad,"Oracle is not what it seems. Pay increases are non existent, even when moving ""up"" in the company. They would prefer to give people ""dry"" promotions and not an actual raise. It is impossible to log a complaint with HR as the management tells employees that ""HR does not exist"". If you have any problems or issues with management you should just hold your tongue. When bringing up problems with ""upper management"" you will be treated badly. Concerns are not addressed as all management is only there to protect the other managers and keep the ""employees"" quite. Bonuses are largely scrutinized and generally never given as promised. When asking about how they calculate the bonus you are given the run around. There is no way to understand the math behind how they pay out bonuses. Oracle does not appreciate any of their employees and everyone is disposable. If you think this is a good place to work think again. Save yourself the time and annoyance and apply to a company that might treat you as an individual."
bad,"No role of HR."
bad,If you want to be another name and number work here and don’t expect anymore. A sole less place ! Management culture is shocking. No respect for employees
bad,"I would never recommend anyone to work for Oracle. My experience here was far too negative, that I was basically forced to leave. My job description nor my compensation reflected what was in my original offer letter and I accepted the role at Oracle on completely false terms. Since then, I have struggled financially, unable to make ends meet for myself in an upcoming and growing city that I had moved to for this job. Working for Oracle sounded like a great opportunity to make money, get exposure and experience, but it was the exact opposite. Management is terrible and clueless with no power to affect real change. There are very little positive interactions between management and employees and quantity outweighs quality. Micromanagement is a huge problem here, so if you want to feel like a “trusted employee” and not be babysat on a daily basis, certainly do yourself a favor and do not apply to any inside sales role. Career advancement is also non-existent. In my 9 months of employment, I still could not tell you what all of their products do or how to sell them. With all the resources Oracle has, they do not enable their employees to use them, learn from them or be coached. They make it almost impossible for you to get where you want to be without it taking years and dealing with all the nonsense in the meantime. Save your talent and energy for somewhere else. I was deceived, and even if or when I could ever possibly progress at Oracle, I had lost all trust in the company after being lied to over and over again."
bad,"Tem um belo propósito e o repetem como papagaios, mas usam algumas pessoas, que representam minorias para parecer uma empresa legal, moderna e pronta para o futuro, no entanto, seguem agindo com velhos vendedores trogloditas. Vivem de aparências, politicagem e puxa-saquismo. Ou seja, o propósito é apenas uma máscara bonita, que logo cairá, pois são arrogantes interna e externamente, e por isso estão perdendo os melhores talentos para as concorrentes como Salesforce, Amazon, Google, Microsoft etc. "
bad,I was hired with expectations that changed immediately to the negative.  The person that hired me left the company and the new boss didn't know why i was hired
bad,"Terrible working environment!"
bad,"It is a difficult place to work,  many out dated processes are in place to protect the company rather than inspire the work force.  Employees  (at all levels) are to generate revenue;  if you don't you are gone."
bad,"The management teams at most companies are trying to figure out the best ways to restructure Customer Success.  They don't realize that the teams in place already have a number of great ways to save clients. They need to focus on Development no fly by the pants development but true development focus groups and enhancement request as well as implementing correctly. If every company did implementations correctly and product development they wouldn't be looking at restructuring Customer Success all the time.  To restress the point, they need to restructure implementation and ensure successful go lives Customer Success can't do anything about poor implementations also develop the product.  "
bad,"Oracle is the stereotypical corporate machine.  I was regularly set up for failure with little to no recourse (and I don't mean for myself, I was fighting for the customer).  Management never seemed to have a clue, and getting anything done requires an act of Congress."
bad,"8 years in the company led nowhere no pay rises for 8 years no reward and recognition for 8 years."
bad,"Oracle is the only place I ever worked where a promotion equaled no pay raise.  After 2008 take home pay decreased by 25 percent as bonuses dried up and virtually disappeared.  Oracle is a company that really does not have your back if you are a Consultant and you enter hostile territory where you are trying to help customers dig out of the problems they have currently either created or paid someone to create.  Also, there is a great amount of confusion at Oracle who does what.  You have Sales Consultants trying to fix customer technical problems (maybe even try and write code!!!) long after the sale has transpired when they are no more qualified to be doing this than the man in the moon.  How would you feel if you found the Salesman that sold you your car at your car dealership fixing your BMW or Mercedes Benz or even your Chevy or Ford?  In short Oracle is an 'eat what you kill environment' where Management is terrible and give themselves huge pay raises for relatively poor performance while ignoring the efforts of the rank and file that make their position even possible.  I won't even go to what should have been done with Larry Ellison who just keeps giving himself more stock options and continues to make wacky technical decisions and calls himself CTO.  Even in the early days of Oracle Bob Miner and Ed Oates were the Technical brains Larry was the Sales guy so trying to play the techie role at his age is just embarrassing."
bad,"There is no proper management."
bad,"Upper management has all but destroyed support.  There was a fantastic Work At Home program in place for at least 15 years, that's GONE!  There used to be raises and bonuses, that's GONE!"
bad,"Better get your money going through the door cause you'll never see a dime after that. This is their business model, they want the turn-over in the trenches."
bad,"Exigente com atingimento d quota, com plano agressivo de comissão"
bad,We work on the invoicing and revenue part of the process which involves frequent invoicing and revenue recognition.
bad,It's too slow paced. Training program is very poor. Management expects the employee to learn by self from the beginning. Poor training materials and trainers. Less salary. Poor transport facilities and employee benefits.
bad,"There is no room for advancement, very old boy club. No raises or bonuses. Work is capable of remote (at home) yet they treat it ver old school. Amazon will overtake them soon because they don’t appreciate human capital."
bad,"Hated every moment, constant pressure to take online tests for sales roles, crazy waste of time.  People are all pitted against each other and management is clueless.  Pay is good if you want to put up with it."
bad,If you like working For a place that has no raises receiving benefits and absolutely no job security Oracle is the place for you. Continuous rolling layoffs with absolutely no chance for advancement. The best thing that happened to me is when I got RIF’d   I did like my immediate manager quite a bit he was a very good guy but he got caught up in it too and he’s probably better off as well.
bad,"There is no career and financial growth  here. Managers  do not promote engineers to learn new skills  to get advance in their career."
bad,The recruiters could be best described as used car salesman. Sure the company looks great on the outside but there is a high turnover rate for a reason.
bad,Promised raises and bonuses. Once there no o e had seen raises or bonuses. Peers had no raises for 8+ years. No performance reviews unless you demanded one.
bad,"I worked for Oracle for 2 years and was let go without any rationale other than they were downsizing. Found out that the senior manager that fired me left the company to go work for a real estate company. Oracle was late to market ""Cloud"" services then went all in in an effort to catch up."
bad,Need to change in culture  and needs to be customer centric. Oracle missed the boat on cloud and loosing to competition. I have learned that the management
bad,"Having worked for several I.T companies, IBM/Microsoft/Boeing to name a few, Oracle was the worst company I've stepped foot in. Management feels like a frat house, good ole boys, no flexibility in terms of hours. My best day was the day I emailed my manager I was leaving."
bad,"Day is filled with multiple meetings for colloboration and status tracking. Nothing gets done on time, below average tech skills. No real motivation in anyone. Compensation structure is pathetic. Wrong choice to join"
bad,"Sales teams are uncollaborative to point that is a hostile environment to work in. No support from management and no follow through to help. High stress, quotas are unrealistic and unachievable. Poor data quality with customer information. For a technology company, they are terrible in adopting the solutions which they sell."
bad,"There are no raises, no bonuses, They don't care about the employee, only the managers. Manager sexually harassed women and made fun of handicapped workers, and got promoted. Absolutely disgusting. Also managers retaliate for contacting HR, even though it is against the law."
bad,"Beware job seekers:  No raises will be given to you once you are here.  Why?  Because Oracle does not have to give raises.  "
bad,Its a place to work and when they don't need you anymore your position will be eliminated. Management has no back bone and people who are put in middle management don't know what they are doing.
bad,"If you are a self driven, go-getter, stay off this place. "
bad,"Oracle demands 100% commitment to the job, while at the same time offering abysmal opportunities for advancement, pay increases, and zero stock bonuses."
bad,Oracle has a bottom line culture. By that I mean that all they care about is the bottom line and both customers and employee lose at the expense of profits.
bad,not a nice place unless you are desperate and already looked for a job these past 6 months
bad,"Great people to work with, but horrible management. Employees are not valued nor rewarded for hard work. There is no clear communication on product future timeline."
bad,"Modelo de gestão antigo, pessoas não são confiáveis e não existe colaboração interna."
bad,"Hire & Fire nach US-Vorbild. Vertrieb und Support sind wichtig, der Rest ist Kanonenfutter."
bad,Fui assediada e demitida por tentar uma transferência de Área.
bad,"sollte eure Firma von Oracle aufgekauft werden, fangt direkt an euch einen neuen Job zu suchen. Der Umgang von Oracle mit aufgekauften Firmen ist eine Katastrope und sie erzählen dir das der Himmel gelb ist."
bad,"You're on your own...job security = minimal at best and career development is poor because there is no clear way to know how to move up within. Work vs. Life and there is no balance. "
bad,"One of the worse sales organization for a fortune 100 companies.  Management lacks leadership, vision and self-assurance (paper pushers who will not go to bad for reps).  Practically a sweat-shop as their are too many sales reps aligned to a territory."
bad,"participated in Global Business service activities."
bad,"Right the first day my manager told me exactly how to get into the building when I come earlier than 7AM. The manager was a complete imbecile and micro-manager, insisting on minute things. His manager was the same, and all the way. All the core of this company is rotten. There is no respect for developers who are treated as commodity. Business is driven by pushy salespeople and hyped statements of Larry Ellison. All management is 50% hierarchical cronies and 50% chit-chatters. There is nothing good I can tell about this company. Waste of time. If you want to feel yourself as a useless worm under your manager's foot - welcome to Oracle."
bad,"Software developers are coders ONLY. Product managers are supposed to produce the design, but they rarely have technical expertise."
bad,"Oracle doesn't care about employees or customers, they only care about the numbers they're presenting at the next shareholder meeting. The company grows by acquisition only, because when they swallow up a new company they divest from all of the innovation that was going on and just pour all their energy into sales. Then when the product becomes obsolete after years of neglect they just lay everyone off. "
bad,"Disappointed thinking a big name like this would mean it runs like Facebook, Google, Microsoft or Amazon, for example. Nothing further than the truth. Just another job from what I have come to find out. I do not get the feeling the compensating employees fairly is one of their goals."
bad,"Not loyal to employees, no pay raises, no bonus, no incentives. Oracle is hiring India's people using them for pennies to make senior management and BOD richer."
bad,"Oracle Does not need a competition, as oracle's seven to eight LOBs only work against each other in getting the business from Customers."
bad,Not a good department to be hired into. Job duties quite exceptionable to learn but social interaction is almost insurmountable. The supervisor was part of the preexisting social department group so could not change dysfunction conditions.
bad,"(INSIDE SALES, HCM) Overhired for the position.  Not enough accounts to work to really make money.  It is absolutely a sink or swim environment. The only employees that are happy are the ones that have there account executives sell a big deal and they get the commission for it as well."
bad,Best Place to work and start a career. I have learned a lot and grow as Person both professionally and technically. Higher Management is worst and not supportive to Employees. Hardest part of the job is rarely hike happens
bad,"Clients in the IT market place mostly have a negative perception of Oracle. There are different sales tiers within Oracle trying to sell a different Oracle product.  Many times a client will receive eight cold calls in the same day all from Oracle reps trying to sell their different Oracle product. When a rep would call into a client, they would do everything they could to sell their specific product and they made sure to tell that client that they didn't need any other product tier of Oracle products.  The sales reps did not work together.  This made the dedicated territories saturated with too many cold calls. The CRM used was old and almost 90% of the contacts were no longer with their company.  I cold called on four customers in one year that had passed away years before. One was even 10 years prior.  There is no system in place to keep the CRM up to date.  It was frowned upon if you took a lunch break or even left your desk."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of my job was the group of people I worked with.  This group of people were always willing to work together to get the job completed in a timely, professional manner.  However, this was never a consideration when decisions were made that affected the entire operation in the local facility"
bad,"There is a reason customers hate Oracle with a passion.  They don’t give 2 craps about their customers or employees.   If they need to increase sales they just manipulate the numbers to make it look like they sold something, raiding their own customer base instead of making something people actually want to buy.  Management are clueless bureaucrats who keep their jobs by knowing the insane operational systems rather than actually developing their employees or fostering high performance.  Nothing you do at Oracle will make you more valuable in your next job, unless your only ambition is to play politics inside Oracle for the rest of your life."
bad,"Ironically, with oracle being such a large company, the value they place on employees is a bit mind-boggling. A typical day is 'look like you are working while waiting on work'. If there is no issues at hand, they expect you to make up work to do, even though everybody is not held to this accountability, only the employees that are the 'favorites' of the management team are excluded. This is a dynamic that runs rapid throughout the office. The pay scale is beyond unfair. I was recently promoted, which took more than a year and a half of 'training' before they would even approve. I use the word training loosely as there is no training structure its just learn what you can however you can. After actually receiving the promotion they offered me a 'raise' that didn't have any impact on my actual paycheck (it's the same as it was). On top of all of that the new employees hired for my old position are making more than I am and I have to essentially do their job and mine because they do not handle the work required at that position. So I have to do way more work for less than someone in a lesser position. This is something that resonates through Oracle as my research has led me to believe. The only redeeming factors about the job is they offer overtime pay on every weekend worked as long as its a regular scheduled work day, free Pepsi and Dr Pepper, and there seems to be endless sick time. They offer perks and discounts but most in the office don't make enough money to take advantage of that. The management team is probably one of the most incompetent of any job I have ever worked,"
bad,"You want a pencil at Oracle, you have to ask an assistant to bring the key to the supply room, unlock it and give you a pencil."
bad,"Employees are overloaded! Well educated and skilled people are being used and let go due to heavy cost-cutting measures by the management. People with low incentives who collects all the solutions from brilliant engineers keep their job forever. No advancement and overloaded. During performance appraisal management finds something to keep you at the same level for years to come without any raise or promotion, while your responsibilities and workload keeps increasing. Eventually, they will throw you out as you get older and slows down! Management there are vultures."
bad,"very average experience - keep moving teams to learn new things, otherwise mundane tasks once the initial learning curve is done. lot of middle management so lot of time waste in updating all of them"
bad,"Favoritism really shows at Oracle. Once you start working there you will see it as well. You will fit in if you are quick and on your feet. Dont tell anyone about yourself, Open up to only what you only want on the floor. Esd safe environment. So lots of tests and classes. Managers will find an excuse to get rid of you if there favorite person wants you gone. Horrible experience.  "
bad,"For starters, they will LIE to you in your interview about the REAL work load. BEWARE."
bad,"Great product obviously... But the on-boarding is non-existent. Managers are just plain incompetent. Goals, quotas are unrealistic. No training program, so you don't understand what you selling. Many employees and managers are East-Indians and if you're Caucasian, you stand no change for advance..."
bad,1. i have learned Team work during high work pressure.
bad,very political and without a soul. Great to get on your resume if newly out of college. I was part of an acquired company and they slowly but surely will put Oracle people in your place. They take micromanagement to a new level. They are in love with process and care more about that then helping the customer. The Oracle arrogance is alive and well.
bad,"don't work for this company"
bad,Only at time of hiring they will give good package later you will not get anything join any group here will not recommend at all to anyone so pls don't join.
bad,"Worst place I've worked in 30 years ... unrealistic goals.... overlapping product/service portfolio has you wasting cycles with internal competition."
bad,"no longer a leader in anything.  Oracle buys companies instead of developing their own products.  They got rid of bonuses, stock options, and annual raises a long time ago.  Continue to cut and erode benefits. The one perk of working from home now gone for most of the company staff."
bad,"With little chance of advancement, & only about 1% of people getting even minimal (inflation/cost of living) raises each year, you will loose future earning potential for every week you waste at oracle."
bad,"The company backs their management team even in the event the manager(s) are wrong and/or have violated conduct policies/HR policies. If you file a grevience against your manager, expect to be shown the door quickly. The managers are not professional and remind me of high school children.  There is no room for thinking for yourself at Oracle. Everything is mapped out for you and is very boring, and the pay reflects the lack of thinking required."
bad,"If you are interested in fixing problems for customers Oracle is a challenging place to work. It could be that all software vendors operate the way Oracle does, but creating value for the customer does not appear to be the goal."
bad,"Working at Oracle was the worst decision I ever made. It has a terrible work environment and worse managers. They call you 20 times a day, have no idea what they are doing. I have no clue how this company made it so far...what a joke...even customers hate them!"
bad,"A company that practically sells space in the cloud and internally impossible to create a shared workspace to save documents that need to be shared with the team oversees. Finance is all manual, handled in Excel spreadsheets filled with thousand of Vlookups and formulas and at risk of making mistakes. Completely unreliable data. Sales team works very hard and many times don't get paid promised bonuses. Need to save everything due to the high number of lawsuits. Horrible place to work - at least that was my experience."
bad,very high=pressure sales environment with little autonomy to make decisions in my territory.  too many approvals needed to make a deal. and now I am just writing some words so that the system will allow me to progress
bad,"Little room for advancement, plenty of layoffs to go around."
bad,"Onboarding is not the correct sales training, there is not actually any product training it was like being in a creche for two weeks and internal processes have a lot to be desired for considering it is a software company. Management could do with a refurbishment, they do not have a clear vision for the future which in return creates a harsh working environment."
bad,"If your in sales do not work for Oracle. You won't make any money and their systems are horrible. Only a few people make quota because they have large install accounts. The culture is cut throat and you will be asked to steal deals and commission if it's possible. Reason being, they have too many reps selling into accounts that are increasingly not wanting to do business with Oracle."
bad,"Customer Service is not the main focus in helping customer. Is more about the numbers. No training is provided for the job function. Managers retaliate when you file a report with HR for wrong doing. No proper process in place, manager changes rule at their convenience Recently people have been leaving. People walk around unhappy. The company does not provide raises or increase for cost of leaving."
bad,"Culture at Oracle really went down, there is no respect to employees, management expects really long hours, there is no vision  on future direction. Strategy does not exist."
bad,"The management for the area in which I worked had trouble identifying a practical goal and then implementing the steps to achieve the goal. There was lip service given to management's interest in how its employees felt about their jobs, or about the path of the group as a whole.  Morale was almost always low. The many folks with whom I worked, outside of most of the managers, were diligent, witty, intelligent, and resourceful. In short, they were amazing and made working there much better than it would have been otherwise."
bad,Poor/lack of company culture. Company does not trust it's employees. Terrible management. Unhappy employees. Ask about attrition rate for employees who stay over 18 months - very low.
bad,Management was distant and not engaged. Often difficult to get clear answers and direction from. HR was next to impossible to reach and couldn't provide answers to basic questions.
bad,"Management sucks"
bad,"Cultural Indifference."
bad,"Senior management doesn't know/understand customer requirements.  The product line does not meet expectations.  No regard for employees at all. They'd rather work you hard, let you leave, and hire someone junior for low pay.  Advancement opportunities are few and far between.  I will never recommend Oracle to anyone I know looking for a job."
bad,Empresa não emprega os valores que verbaliza. Não valoriza os profissionais que possui e tampouco avalia plano de carreira.
bad,"I was in a contract-to-hire position with another company when Oracle recruited me for the specific skill set I had.  I accepted their offer, yet they never signed one single client for my skill set, so they let me go.  They spoke constantly of all their acquisitions - 38 in the relatively short time I was there."
bad,"Compensation is not competitive, and career advancement opportunities and raises are hard to come by. You'll have to apply for another job on another team entirely. Typical corporate work structure. Management and leadership is out of touch. Their only priority is proving profitability to shareholders."
bad,"Don't go there."
bad,Very interesting to know the different solutions of partners from different industries. Very good working atmosphere. Fun to work
bad,"Arrogant directors & managers with poor mgmt skills."
bad,"Was well paid, but had no access to software development environments or tools and was tasked with software development."
bad,"When Management says in the interview, ""I will be there to train you and make sure you succeed"" it not true... Worked here temporary and Manager was very bias in meetings with talking behind the backs of other employees after conference calls/meetings that I would sit in on.  She would be stressed with the ""huffing and puffing"" sounds about corporate policies and why they do it this way....  There is limited  IT support here as needed and you will find staff being your help! The people whom are kind enough to help, but do not work for IT...    Ticket request etc. you have to baby-sat and the whole on-boarding is a mess!  Be prepared to help in your on on-boarding.  Pay was low!  Not a motivating place to work at, laid back dress code. But, don't be a fancy dresser, not sure why my high end fashion has so much attention when my work performs was on point!  They said they are flexible in your work schedule and when I had to adjust my work schedule for a personal matter.  My manager called to cancel my contract.  Sad!  I don't think it was my personal matter as I seen other FT employees have personal issues and they have a job.  "
bad,"weak management, no room to grow, repetitive work, complete lack of corporate culture. The employee is completely siloed in their practice. The company forced employees to use 4 of their vacation days between 12/25 and 1/01."
bad,No advancement opportunity once in the company. I worked for Oracle for over six years on the retail end. I worked with a software called Xstore. Was unable to to advance in the company due to politics and then was laid off after worked slowed down without warning. Beware of this company.
bad,"Oracle used to be a good company. It can still be one. Technology decisions are made by managers at so high rank that it is disconnected from the reality. Autonomy is not given. Managers are authoritative. No budget for improving tools and technical infra. No culture of team building. From inside, it looks and works like a giant manufacturing factory rather than a technology company in the bay area."
bad,"worker beware , not a great company to work for, good pay and benefit compensation, may not see your manager but maybe only once or maybe twice a year, as your manager could be located anywhere,"
bad,"Leadership in the Columbia, MD office is less than lackluster. The culture there is shut-up, do the work, go home and repeat. Typical work day involves you losing brain cells to correct the problems that people in other departments create and don't want to correct although it's their job while your job is to help the customers."
bad,"I was told when I was hired, negotiate the highest salary you can because you won't get a raise. Very true. Policies and management frequently changed. Most people seemed to fill roles simply to check a box in an attempt to advance further. During the time they were in a role they would wreck havoc with policy changes that were not well thought out."
bad,"Once hired, no growth, no advancement, no hikes nothing! "
bad,"Great networking opportunities; coworkers are amazing and upbeat people to be around.  However, management is incompetent and unsupportive. Job advancement is nonexistent unless you happen to receive a good territory, which is rare."
bad,"Used to have semi-privacy, now management went to some bull spit seminar and changed the entire floors (because some nimrod sold them idea it fosters collaboration, which it doesn't) to get rid of cubicles with partitions and it's completely open and loud when you're on the phone and two-three other people are on the phone at the same time talking over each other makes it incredibly hard to hear. Brilliant effing idea from someone high up who never worked the floor in their life. Oh, now they ""require"" you to work from an office and can't work from home even on the weekends. "
bad,"It is the private sector equivalent of working for the government. There is no innovation. Besides their DB, their software is horrible. They treat partners horribly and once they lock in a customer with their database, they then treat the customer horribly."
bad,"*Management is AWFUL ! "
bad,"It's kind of hard to describe the typical day at Oracle in the Micros side. Oracle in the Micros side you are going to be dealing with Hotels and restaurant, I deal with hotels PMS.  I'm going to start with the hardest part of the job. When you start at Oracle, Oracle is going to give you ""training"", which we think this is going to be useful for us.  Once you dig in to the training and you are on the phone you think to your self this is swim or sink because the training does not teach you anything, but when you after a few months to a year the sink or swim just leaves your mind and now is sink or sink faster since Oracle does not prepare you for whats going on.  The employees at Oracle have to learn the Opera application by your self, dont even bother asking for help because that's like talking to a mirror.  I have learned at Oracle the Opera application and how to work with their server.  I don't even know how to describe management, since every manager say something else, and no manager see's eye to eye.  At oracle you are going to listen to your manager and your manager's managers, if you listen to another manager from another property they are going to have another rules and it's going to get you in hot water with your manager, even though they work for Oracle.  I can't really see anything that's hard about Oracle, except when their cloud product crashes, mind you this happen in a daily basis.  When you know that your shift is starting, we always ask ""what broke this time""?  How many properties is being affected?  I'm unable to answer the last question, because till this"
bad,"Good benefits and salary. Very bureaucratic. People aren't happy. Good place if you have a family and need a stable work environment. Not a great place if you're young, vibrant, and want to do something real with your career. There is nothing sexy about Oracle."
bad,culture is cut throat  Management is not able to help employees get paid Everything is a process and there is no flexibility They pay the wrong people
bad,Oracle is evolving right now and it's not a great place to be depending on where you are in the company. Lots of layoffs and poor communication about direction and why decisions are made.
bad,"Oracle does not provide growth opportunities and often rewards success with demotions and/or layoffs. As the company transitions towards a cloud focus, these could just be growing pains, but I would not recommend being part of them right now."
bad,"Oracle is not the place if you want to make a difference in the world. Given that they employ over 100,000 people, that makes sense. But if you want to advance, branch out of your career or make changes that way, you'll have to look elsewhere. Benefits are amazing."
bad,"Oracle has been a let down.  They do not care about people.  Despite all the fluffy words from the CEO, Oracle does not care about the employees.   It is all  double talk."
bad,"It was a Night Shift Job,"
bad,Management appears ok with the unacceptable work environment do not recommend however great company overall. Technical experience was great but it appears there are no rules here management can do what it wants. Be careful.
bad,"sales"
bad,"Oracle has been a fantastic learning experience for me especially as it was the fir IT OEM that I worked for. The staff have been great to work with and management are good, except for an unfortunate lack of understanding of Public Sector business."
bad,The sales managers are promoted to their level of inability.  so many competing products sometimes I was competing with other Oracle solutions. Not a good working culture.
bad,Finding a way to contribute to the bottom line is difficult in such a large company.  Oracle's business practices alienate customers.  The company is run by lawyers.
bad,I decline to comment at this time.  Oracle is like any other Fortune 500 company; It has its pros and cons.  My experience was positive for the most part but I don't agree with all the decisions made by the highest levels of management.
bad,"They took me for a job at their customer place, when their project is over, they were unable to place me in any other projects as they have a very less QA presence in toronto and i have to quit and search for another job, it was a very terrible moment and i had a big stress during that time. They recruited me from a different country where i was going safe and secure. I don't recommend oracle to any one."
bad,Don't work here. No job security. No future in moving up in the company. Eliminated my division less than a year after acquisition.
bad,I worked at Oracle for 3 years as a sales engineer.  My manager was ineffective and treated people differently.  There were no bonuses or raises during the time that I was employed.  The cafeteria and campus were positive for morale but the poor leadership made the environment unbearable.
bad,Nope sure didn't. I dont know why you guys are asking and insisting for me to continue filling out this review when i do not feel like reviewing this employer.
bad,"My experience as an intern at Oracle was mixed. The team I worked with was very knowledgeable and kind and helped me gain enough experience to land a great job after I graduated from college (after about 8 months at the company). However, decision making and cross-team collaboration was a sore spot for many as Oracle's takeover left many with a bad taste in their mouths, and the overall morale was greatly effected by outsourcing and questionable decision making from new management."
bad,Not for me honestly. All the realignment put me into bad positions with no leadership multiple times. SMB org has great potential but I couldn't wait around any longer.
bad,"50 calls a day and 2 hours of talk time ended up being the death of me. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone, who doesn't like cold calling. I learned a lot from Oracle, but this role had no growth potential."
bad,"I worked here for two years moving through the sales ranks from business development to full inside sales."
bad,"Just trash. Poor management. Kind of racisiam, they don’t keep their promises. Stressful. They don’t care about employee health. Just waste management"
bad,"Push for numbers and not care about the customers experience. Numbers based company and not a customer based company. No salary increases, no bonuses, lack of incentives."
bad,"I received a great year end review but got no bonus or raise.  I asked my senior director why and she said Oracle figures if they can get 2 years out of you without a raise you can leave and they are ahead of the game.  "
bad,"Closed several deals, only to have my compensation taken away at last minute on each deal.  Even though was top performer in my field, Oracle focused on other attributes and treated people as if they are numbers."
bad,"The hospitality department is a total disaster, no structure at all.  They don't give you any training and give you unreachable goals and metrics.  Pure micromanagement and a very stressful environment, you don't feel like part of a team.  Teamwork is in-existent, everyone is only looking out for their numbers and when you want to escalate a case to a Level 2 it gets rejected.  This causes that the clients who don't get their problems fixed, to get very aggravated, and you constantly are being disrespected by them.  When you want to escalate a case to a manager they ignore you like its only your problem. And if things couldn't get worse the payroll system is terrible. After working the same amount of hours all the time, they pay you different quantities all the time (lower).  My goal when getting in to this company was to go to databases, but managers have the authority to block you which makes it almost impossible to move.  And don't expect any raises, even though you are a high performer and support multiple languages they wont give you any compensation.  The other departments seem to work our fine..."
bad,"While Oracle used to be an innovative, fun place to work about 15 years ago, for The new management is far too focused on squeezing its employees for every bit of productivity while minimizing salary costs but they have lost their innovation. Many formally salary workers are now on an hourly basis. The salary can be so variable because they can squeeze overtime and non-salary benefits such as car allowances that you can't rely on any Standard level of income. Middle management has no direction of  its own and doesn't seem to communicate to its direct reports what executive direction is. This leaves an employee with no idea how much they're going to make on a regular basis in no feeling of accomplishment for anything you might do."
bad,"I prefered working at the smaller company, Taleo, which Oracle acquired."
bad,Management is untrustworthy. Things are always promised yet are never delivered. Management would rather recruit from the outside than promote from within.
bad,"Useless highly de-Motivating job culture and work environment."
bad,This is not a place of employment that I would recommend... Poor leadership. Total lack of communication. Zero advancement opportunities. Under-paid and unappreciated.
bad,There is very little chance of getting a raise or promotion. I have been working for Oracle for four years without a raise. The same goes for my colleagues.
bad,"Large Bureaucracy"
bad,Oracle is struggling to pivot from traditional license sales to the cloud and there's a whole load of short term decisions being made that will have sever negative impact in the long term.
bad,"Produkte nicht passend für österreichischen Markt"
bad,"Oracle is only good in terms of work/life balance."
bad,"Multiple years without even a COLA, multiple rounds of layoffs forcing more work on fewer people resulting in near constant need to 'put out fires' on nights and weekends."
bad,Did not agree with Oracle’s sales strategy for moving to license base company to service based company. To be successful this strategy required better communication to both internal organizations and customer base
bad,"You work hard, you enjoy the work-life balance, but in the end, you find out there is no compensation or hike at all. Oracle is biased towards India's work-force as also found by an independent survey. But to work here expecting a career growth and personal growth is suicide. "
bad,My first manager was fired my third year and escorted out of the office by security. He was a horrible micro manager and would call or text me at all hours of the night asking me the same questions over and over again. Forcing me to get my own personal cell phone and turn off the work cell phone at night.
bad,Not much senior leadership. No growth or career trajectory. So large it is hard to really make an impact and the processes there are very archaic and hard to navigate through.
bad,"Bad upper management, resist policies, lack of empathy from managers, your are only a pawn and not really a meaningful part of the organization, long hours, unreal timelines"
bad,"Company could be ran better and more employee focus, your salary is based on what you negotiate when you first start working then you are stuck with that; there are no raises or promotions."
bad,There is no work life balance. Managers forcing to work more than 16 hours. No work culture. Managing 2 employees work in single employee. No break in between the Working hours. Less resources more pressure.
bad,"No checks and balances, and no 360 degree/management reviews. There are some groups that are really well managed but those are rare. Wish there was a way to use them as model groups. It could be possible if there was a 360 degree review."
bad,"Oracle does not value it's employees, and all of the talented/skilled employees are looking to or have already moved on to new companies. The management has no direction or vision of where the company is going. It gets more disorganized with every re-org that occurs."
bad,Reported to ten different managers of the course of employment.  Excellent products with good value prop. Negative customer perception challenging. Quality peers. Unrealistic quotas and questionable forecasting expectations.
bad,"Impossible to get any information. My department went through many managers, always changing, and all had their own ideas. It was impossible to do a project without a issue."
bad,"Upper management doesn't listen to the advice of it's skilled and SMEs about the environment or products."
bad,"I worked at Oracle for nearly 6 years.  I always said during that time that if I was required to work at HQ I would leave instantly.  The management and upper-management teams are self-serving and a friend network.  They have no interest in your career advancement or in your happiness as an employee.  Job tasks were all over the place and never followed a project plan.  I worked from home nearly the entire tenure and it was the easiest job I ever had.  Having said that, considering lower compensation and basic benefits, work-from-home is the ONLY benefit to working at Oracle.  Sr. Management is so clueless you can do your job in less than 4 hours a day if you wanted."
bad,Oracle appears to be a good place to work.   If you are part of the good old boy internal network you have an opportunity to make money and succeed. If you are not one of the guys the work place culture is brutal.
bad,"Low morale, tough culture.  Sales reps and pillars are pitted against each other.  Difficult internal systems to navigate, 70% of the job is to sell to Oracle."
bad,Worked for Oracle for 7 years. Long hours to meet schedules no raises. Management never seen except once a month at staff meeting. Upper management has no commitment to people.
bad,"Mostly Contractors do the work for Oracle. Usually, contractor utilizations are always maintained above 95% where as FTE utilization is not a priority."
bad,"Micro Management"
bad,"No increments and bonus, increasing work load and bossy leadership are few trade marks of Oracle "
bad,I would not recommend this place to someone who is looking at building their career. Poor Management who have no vision or direction. Poor Onboarding and no training to make you successful.
bad,"Poor management and stuffy office environment. Nice people but with too much micromanagement and poor visibility into the direction of management makes for a very unsatisfying experience. As with anything, it depends on the group. Unfortunately, the group I worked with included great people but very bad management."
bad,"Horrible managers, a*ss kissing culture. Managers trying to save their own skin. Favoritism and old waterfall methodology of software development. Release engineers holding others hostage in terms of when something can be integrated. A lot of cr*ap about licensing approvals all the way up to VP, and unnecessary writeups just for the sake of writeups to get approval to integrate open source/non open source components into solaris."
bad,"Responsible for the Southeast area covering Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo States.Huge presence in Municipalities, State Government, Local Authorities and Government Agencies as well as State companies, like BNDES, Furnas, CEMIG, CNEN, DETRAN, Eletronuclear etc."
bad,"Granted, not all of Oracle is this way, but the Consultant side, for me was this way: They hired me at an extremely low wage. Then I never received more than a 1 - 2% increase, always blamed on how badly the company was doing. My guess, however, is that the customer I was placed with didn't want to pay a lot so they negotiated with Oracle, but as the sole contractor, Oracle left me behind. The customers were extremely happy with me and I worked for some of them in the next job as systems engineer. Eventually I got so sick of my lack of raises and appreciation, I asked the customer if they would support me to become my own contractor. They did. They loved the work I did for them. So after I left, I started the company called ""Anastasys, LLC"" and continued to work for the customer."
bad,"Worst Management and high presuure in OA."
bad,"The environment was not stable different Managers making multiple decisions not sure of their business decisions and strategy, so much uncertainty with several employee lay offs and people leaving to other companies."
bad,Oracle acquired the company I worked for and I feel like they did it to ruin the company.  They knew nothing or cared about the culture or product they acquired.  There are 0 annual increases.  I would get a 4/4 annually on my review to only be told great work with no increases.  Managers cannot do anything for you as they have 0 control.  If you aren't part of the in crowd here forget about a promotion.
bad,"No raises for years and not much training."
bad,It is a difficult place to work because you have many overlapping pillars that may often compete with one another. Which is really detrimental to build sales relationships as one unified source.
bad,"Management was poor"
bad,"Oracle does not care at all.  There is no direction, this is a company slowly dying.  No path for advancement, no support from management, unknown budgets, hardware budget nonexistent, old and outdated internal systems.  Constant reorganization."
bad,"Its like a start up within a big company. While it provides you a lot of learning opportunities, its pretty chaotic with little process in place, has a lot of corporate politics and bureaucracies (mainly from folks coming from Amazon, Microsoft) . While I've learned a lot on IAAS, cloud, governance etc., management is pretty bad with lack of vision, leadership and very reactive in nature. It's mostly self-serve in nature for info (pull of info more than a push), it's also a very tough environment where the management expects a lot from everyone (almost to the tune of being unrealistic). Not a good 'work life balance place' environment."
bad,"Good  work life balance."
bad,My company was bought by Oracle and systematically dismantled over a period of 5 years. Was a hardware engineer in a software company. Probably a good place to be if you are in a software based job.
bad,"The following things are not good."
bad,"For every role in the department, there is someone cheaper and willing to work longer hours. You are considered a number on paper, and less a person. If you don't like it, management will remind you where the door is."
bad,Travel and consulting services and attend meetings with clients.  The hardest part of the job is travel coast to coast every week.  The most enjoyable part is meet different people in IT Industry.
bad,"Oracle is a giant that is swallowing up smaller competition at the drop of a hat, mostly to catch up on the Cloud rat race. Employees, at least in India, can tend to be neglected. Joining Oracle from an acquisition, you see the benefits you had in the previous org being wiped clean, and paltry ones provided by Oracle. Heavily manager dependent, if your manager is not  nice person, you can expect to have a sour experience."
bad,Cubicle environment seems to be modeled after the airlines (cram as many people as possible into a small space).  Very cliquish; favoritism by management
bad,"Racism. Picking younger people with less sales experience is the reason why the sales team will not succeed. "
bad,I worked in a division under the Financial Org under Cloud.  This turned out to be a bad move for our division to move into.  My Sr. Management left new management came in and created poor work culture and bad morale conditions to most US and Global based employees. Everything is a fire drill with change of direction happening on a regular basis which promotes morale issues within the ranks.  New management desired any new management to be based directly out of Pleasanton or Redwood shores.  I can only speak to this division.
bad,Strategy seems to change quarterly as Oracle continues to fall further and further behind in the cloud marketplace.  Inexperienced management leading inexperienced managers.  Only strategy that is executed flawlessly is expense reduction to the detriment of the employees.
bad,"Working in IT for Oracle in the Bay Area likely means you were acquired or have been there 20 years (or both).  New jobs are usually sourced in India or on the east coast where people are cheaper.  Advancement is unlikely unless someone retires (and then it's more likely they will eliminate the position and roll that team under an existing manager)."
bad,"good start out company to build your career, not the bets culture or management. Role is good for a year or less, opportunity to grow within sale space."
bad,Incomeptenza diffusa - arroganza manageriale - scarso spesso professionale ed umano del management
bad,If you have ever worked in a startup and enjoyed it then never apply for Oracle. It is a dead place. Never felt part of a team. Team members all work from different part of the world or country. I regretted wasting four years of my life at Oracle.
bad,"Oracle is a very political place with no reward for working hard. There's no career path, promotions or raises.  "
bad,"Job was never clearly defined to me until the last few months. Was moved to 3 different jobs in one year. Minimal training. Was laid off due to having least amount of experience in a company that doesnt have a ""go to"" training resource for you. Sometimes you can have a mentor if you meet up with someone who can help train you."
bad,"I worked for Oracle Hospitality formerly known as Micros acquired by Oracle in Columbia, MD. Not at all professional, and morale is horrible, company is in a transition phase. Oracle bought out Micros, so the culture of Micros still exist within the company. I believe Oracle is a great company, however the support for the Hospitality division is a calamity! Unless you're desperate, or just looking to break into the industry stay away!!!"
bad,I had low expectations going in and they were met.  Cut-throat management.  Was in CYA mode the entire time I worked there.  About as family-friendly as the Soviet Gulag.
bad,"Don't ever expect a raise. Don't ever expect a promotion.  Oracle will hire a new employee at $10k+ more than what you make rather than give you a raise. "
bad,"No real chance for advancement.  Longevity and loyalty are actually punished:  as more than one person told me, the only way to advance at Oracle is to leave the company and come back later at a higher level.  Very odd indeed."
bad,"The company has acquired many companies over the last 12 years so the culture is sort of a melting pot. Top management has been replacing experienced professionals with younger, less experienced, cheaper workers."
bad,"O ponto alto é o contato com altíssima tecnologia e com profissionais altamente capacitados."
bad,This is a very competitive environment that does offer a lot of upward mobility for sales reps that enjoy a high stress environment and the pressure of working long hours with tight deadlines.
bad,Não cometam o erro de trocar a sua empresa pela oracle. Ambiente frio. Sem RH. As pessoas parecem desconhecidas. Não há respeito.
bad,"Unfortunately, they view employees as they view ants. They really don't care much about a person working there. Pay is low and increases are non-existing regardless of how long you have worked there. Unless you are a new employee who they usually bring on board at very low rates (mainly Indian and Asian people). "
bad,I think my manager forgot I was even once of his employees. It was difficult to get resources for any deal. Very little customer information and insight
bad,"I came to Oracle truly excited for the potential opportunities that were presented to me. Very quickly realized though that those potential opportunities were just that ""potential- any chance of these opportunities becoming a reality is a very slim chance. "
bad,"Oracle was OK, my last manager and I didn't get along, personalities clashed I guess.  Quite honestly I enjoyed other companies that I was with better."
bad,"A lot of times we don't have much work to do. Lack of management and mentor ship for recent college graduate employees."
bad,"Oracle as a company seemed to have little regard for employees. This was demonstrated by allowing some employees to be overloaded while others seemed to have more 'free' time. Maybe it was just our division. Management seemed to want to make the decisions when in reality the decisions are best placed at the lowest levels (people closest to the action). Communication of goals was difficult and the appraisal system seemed unrealistic to me."
bad,Many challenges integrating the Micros organization into the Oracle environment.  Requires long hours and stamina to get through the work day but also to deliver on committments after hours.
bad,"It seems anybody will be given a management position when in desperate need.  I for one have the most laziest and probably the dumbest manager (and all of OD agrees).  If I had a good manager that would help me develop to advance my career, i'd be happy.  But thats not the case."
bad,The company does not give raises or bonuses routinely unless you are in sales.  There is a general lack of appreciation for good management skills as the company seems solely focused on improving last quarter's financial reports to its investors.
bad,Growth through acquisition so no real common culture.  Demanding in terms of performance.
bad,"A typical day at Oracle usually involves working around an overly-intense, poorly-managed schedule where products are designed within the least amount of time possible. I am not certain if this is the industry norm for the IT world, but it never yields a good product. The management of the Sun/Oracle division is ineffective and appears unable to utilize ""Lessons Learned"" from program to program."
bad,"I can't give a proper review because I work part-time. It's a nice modern company, but as I said, I can't give an overall review because I work there part-time."
bad,"fast-paced environment, Appraisal should happen more if environment is fast -paced, Organization restructure happens every year,  Learn on your own, Working in GCS team is getting loads of work."
bad,Es una empresa que basa sus beneficios en recaudación económica. No respeta ni a los clientes ni a los empleados. Pisa qualquier contrato o vinculo que tenga establecido con el fin de obtener mayores estrategias económicas de hecho surge un ERE cada dos por tres situando las actividades donde mayor ganancias haya ye incluso anuncia la despedida  de los empleados mediante un cheque en eventos organizados para ello y sin preaviso. Y sin el derecho de entrar en las oficinas a recoger sus pertenencias.
bad,I would prefer to not have to review this company as it was several years ago and I worked in a niche business unit.  It has changed substantially since I left.
bad,Very political and corrupt environment. Unfair decisions are taken by Management and HR bodies. Corrupt hiring system. No hike/bonus for many years. Corruption prevails everywhere in the system.
bad,"In 2017 Mark Hurd created an initiative to reduce the average salary but mandating to only hire millennials straight out of a select list of colleges. With that, the environment became more like a frat house. The casual Friday with a few drinks in the afternoon turned into abuse. Most are not interested in being in sales or IT and it is reflected in their work and the environment they create. "
bad,"The San Antonio office, 6th floor jobs, make you work some holidays & weekends, and overtime during quarter-end. This LOB does not care about life/work balance. It's all about them and their numbers."
bad,"Na"
bad,Prachtige kantooromgeving met onplezierige bedrijfscultuur waar mensen snel weer vertrekken. Jammer.
bad,Oracle was a good place to work but you were required to work all hours during end of quarters.  Any job their should be considered temporary as they try to send most functions to India
bad,Oracle was a great 0lace to work but no benefits when you were a temp and the pay was not very good and the chances of being hired on by the company were very slim.
bad,The culture of Oracle is terrible for women at least in the sales department. The sales department is all about numbers which is fine except there's a lot of luck involved.
bad,"Not all Line of Businesses are managed to the utmost."
bad,"During my time at oracle I was promoted within a year and then demoted within the same year as well as 100s of others employees with no warning. The culture became very toxic after the big changes and I believe Oracle was trying to force people out the door instead of spending the money on severance. Wouldn't recommend to a friend, the only good thing is the competitive pay, if you are lucky enough for them to actually pay you."
bad,"Bad call for any career conscious professional or beginner to pick this firm except if you're very highly paid or in very relevant job role for specific requirement. For 90% workforce (in general), there are no hikes, no employee growth road map, no relevant tools/tech which are current in the market, almost no innovative workforce left in India so the majority of people are below avg. which makes the ecosystem more saturated, dull and quickly monotonous"
bad,"There was a ""Boys club"" attitude. No support in learning the systems or product. poor reputation with the customer base do to high turnover. Also, depending on what territory or field rep you got (randomly?) would determine your success."
bad,"Like most large corporations, Oracle is great to get lost in, but at the expense of becoming lost.  Depending on your assignment, you'll have a process for everything and deviation is not tolerated. All managers differ, but the ones I've worked for show an excellent grasp of Theory X management and show little to no regard for any ideas that don't come from them.  The company will review salaries using a formal process that works at create equitable pay levels, rather than meritorious pay increases and only does this once ever few years with a very small potential increase (app. 3 times over the last 10 years, some of us were lucky to get 2% or less).  Vacation will be described to you as x days per year, but you will have to use 4 of them in the middle of the winter between Christmas and New Year, whether you want to or not.  If you want to be a cog in a big machine, this is the right place to be."
bad,It was not a real good experience once Oracle Acquired Sun Microsystems. I was thinking that Oracle will invest in Sun Hardware/Solaris. But they literally kiled it.
bad,"The learning opportunities were great with free Oracle University.  "
bad,"Good company but management is very poor, no HR policies whatever is decided by manager it is the rules for the company.I sometime found hard to get leaves to, no promotion since I joined the company, its been almost 4 years working here."
bad,"I took a role as an outside field rep. Before I accepted the offer, I wanted to see what my list of accounts would be. The list was full of some pretty good accounts, in terms of their revenue, number of employees, etc.; I did my homework so I took the job. Once I started calling into my accounts and actually identifying opportunities, I began getting calls from other field reps telling me that I was in their accounts. I assured them that this was not the case as these accounts were on my list. However at the end of the day, I lost all of my really good accounts and was told that they were mistakenly assigned to me."
bad,"You get the right territory, the right accounts and you are golden.  Otherwise, best of luck.  Company has no love for employees and management has no strategy other than to put the fear of losing your job, humiliation, or they think you should fear them.  That is the managerial strategy."
bad,"My experience at Oracle was not a positive one. Most managers seem to micromanage and do not value suggestions from team members. Some managers seem to have this master-slave mentality, which is part of the reason why they do not value team members and their suggestions. Also, in general, there does not seem to be any yearly salary increases. This may not be the case in all of Oracle, but unfortunately for myself, it was mine."
bad,"There is never any room for advancement. I have been with the company 15 years and have never received a pay increase, promotion, or career advancement."
bad,"Great place to work.  Offers great benefits, new and cutting edge technology and great networking opportunities. "
bad,"Mixed environment for college grads - good pay, but work you like a dog. Fun initial training program, but once you hit the sales floor your managerial guidance is a mixed bag; some good and some are bad. "
bad,"I arrive long before any other employees on my floor. I check emails looking for any requests for meetings with my manager. I manage two executive's calendars,arrange any travel plans, create expense reports, secure conference rooms and projectors, manage the supply of espresso beans for staff's espresso machine that I acquired for the team, and I'm the leader for the annual American Heart Association Heart Walk for our organization."
bad,Oracle CPQ Cloud customer support group do not appreciate their employees and drive them away. It's a revolving door which almost seems intentional to avoid any raises. Oracle does not get what retention means.
bad,Oracle was a tough environment.  There wasn't a sense of collaboration internally or team play.  Great product but needs more team development to go to the next level.
bad,"no advancement for customer success role. not enough help/training for new people. I had a MIS degree and ended up in a wrong role. "
bad,"Oracle has no vision of employee retention and building collaboration between sales departments.   It's everyone for themselves, including management.    Micromanagement of people and sales opportunities are overwhelming and stressful."
bad,"Travel is common for consultants as expected"
bad,"Lots of work, hours, pay. Travel, many personalities to work with. Nice campus. Good benefits. Not a lot of opportunity to advance. Boys club. Tough to get ahead."
bad,"Coming from HP and EMC, Oracle was a complete and brutal shock.  Senior Management, managed by negativity rather than encouragement, made a complete turn over of account team during the year I was there.  Sales Teams were pitted against each other with competing products resulting in back stabbing and character assassinations in front of customers."
bad,Very stressful and long hours. No possibility of advancement. No formal review. No bonus nor merit pay increase. No collaborative and teams work in a silo environment.
bad,Oracle's overlapping business solutions create unnecessary internal competition and struggles. Oracle's massive shift to cloud based offerings has minimized their focus on general purpose on premise system architectures.
bad,Believes in a churn/burn environment. Does not empower employees. Does not provide feedback. Does not provide counsel or reward good work. Cliquey culture with those who have been there for a long time.
bad,"Can be very stressful and changes constantly, low morale and  limited growth opportunities  Requires many hours of mandatory after hours every Quarter month."
bad,Your positon is only as good as your management. No raises. No advancement. No faith in company by any employees - nobody believes in the company from the inside.
bad,"The work practice is more like get the day through. And the next day is taken as it comes. "
bad,"Non existent work/life balance; company does not provide yearly increases (in fact i worked here for 11 years and received three total increases all of which were below 5 percent even though i exceeded my expectations for my role); very competitive environment where people often only worry about themselves and doing what they need to do to get ahead; company only views their employees as a number. Not a very warm and fuzzy kind of place to work for...would not even refer my worst enemy to work here."
bad,"great training in preparation for the assignments, demanding  yet rewarding career.  Nice to be with a company that is on the bleeding edge of development."
bad,Oracle's management does not care about their employees. The corporation makes you feel like you are expendable and can be fired at any time.
bad,"Inside sales is what it is: calling people all day trying to get them to buy products. Some people love it, some don't. I didn't. I also had a bad set of accounts that ultimately got disbanded later that year after I left. Your accounts really make the job: if they are good, you are set, if they are bad, you beat your head against a wall and nothing happens."
bad,"Day to Day;"
bad,Its a good company to work offering great exposure to new technologies and very decent salary. The hardest part is learning about various processes.
bad,Very bad company and very less salary. Hectic work. No work life balanace.
bad,Mesma opiniao a empresa Accenture.Mesmo tipo de trabalho.
bad,I have never seen a company treat its employees and its customers with such disdain. 
bad,"It is a process driven organization, with plenty of bureaucracy, in contrast, less innovation."
bad,"Despite efforts of local leadership and go-getters at the line level, the work culture is stifling.  Very little direction from e-level leadership and even less communication.  An employee should be proud of where they work and what they do."
bad,"Learning new features from the product is interesting and challenging."
bad,"Great work life balance for industry"
bad,"Benefits: As a large corporation, Oracle is able to provide great employee benefits and workplace flexibility (i.e. remote work). "
bad,"Oracle Corporation is an American multinational computer technology corporation headquartered in Redwood Shores, California. The company sells database software and technology, cloud engineered systems, and enterprise software products—particularly its own brands of database management systems"
bad,Terrible culture. Most people leave in a year after starting at Oracle. Management is micro managing and there is a constant battle between reps covering different products for client’s budget.
bad,"Great company for learning in 2006 . Free lunch and snacks limited . Good colleagues , good culture . Parties , outings , trainings , great exposure .."
bad,"Good Compensation, poor working environment. The Oracle Financial Services GBU has little in common with the core company. Culture still very much that of iFlex and likely you'll be discriminated against if you're not from iFlex's original country."
bad,Enjoy working in high pace work environment. Strive to work for the benefit of business maintaining high professional ethics and values of the company.
bad,"Poor pay. Management does not understand the operations of the job. NO room for advancement. They will not give you a title, job grade, or salary increase."
bad,"Poor management on All level"
bad,"I never had a problem with my direct manager or his manager, but any higher up than that, the company doesn't seem to care about the employees at all. I laid off my top performer because the selection for who was laid off was apparently random. A year and a half later, layoffs swept through my group again and I was one of those laid off."
bad,"Management doesn't really want your opinion, they want you to do as you are told.  Ability for some people to work remotely.  Good benefits.  Little chance of advancement.  Vacation (PTO) problematic."
bad,Their technology is okay so their employees don't have to be. Sort of a sink for high performers because the reliance on AI. Great job for people just looking for easy money but are okay with not being paid much. Management isn't great  and there is no way to give reviews nor feedback. A lot of politics and lies in the culture. They have more employees than clients. Everything is closely monitored and sequenced so be diligent with reporting. Tips: don't push the back button nor let a webpage go static.
bad,"Work is quite intensive. "
bad,I have never worked with a group of more unprofessional  leaders. They underpay the veterans all while accepting corporate tax deductions. I would not recommend unless a job is dearly needed
bad,"The best thing about working at Oracle was job work/life balance. As long as you got your work done, there weren't any quibbles about having to be in the office, reporting face to face with your manager or colleagues."
bad,Staffing changes are made without asking or consulting employees about the type of work they are interested in doing. Push to the cloud has been poorly executed.
bad,Over the last few years Oracle Support has been about pushing buttons to comply with KPIs rather than really support customers.  The EVP cares only about the bottom line.  NO ONE cares about the Oracle Support Employees.  It is ALL about revenue.
bad,Azienda molto competitiva internamente. Management non soddisfacente
bad,Clients in the market place have a negative perception of Oracle. You  start from a position of weakness on 70% of clients. You have multiple Oracle Sales reps in each account all competing for the same IT budget.
bad,The company is not exactly fun to work for and the senior management abuses the monopoly position of Oracle to further their own interests. It isn't a company that focuses on ethics.
bad,"Everything revolves around your manager, territory and timing of necessary purchases. Very difficult to work here when your manager is a thorn in your side."
bad,"work was ok, sometimes too much stretching for 16 hours. but a lot to learn. great team. not so much of politics. but i got back pain sitting and working"
bad,"Oracle will do what it needs to do to win business. It's not about offering the best solution for a customer but rather sell anything you can including selling solutions the customers Don't need."
bad,"I have worked at Oracle for 10 years, and my yearly compensation has decreased in the past 5. I have not had a raise in 10 years, and fringe benefits that were positioned as part of my compensation when I joined have been taken away.  The work life balance is EXCELLENT however. As in any company, the work load can be feast or famine. Some weeks it will be piled on, and after, there is always time to catch your breath. The people I work with are definitely the finest in the industry. However, the company continues to 'flatten' out the organizations, leaving few advancement opportunities."
bad,"I love my job at Oracle making my Customers successful and resolving their issues in a timely fashion. I am the customers' go to resource for ANY issues with Oracle products and the voice of the customer within Oracle."
bad,"oracle is a sales machine, they bring in sales reps like herds of cattle and keep only the folks that are lucky enough to get a good patch of land to work."
bad,"Oracle has okay benefits, a lot of Asian Indian people that Oracle favors.  They don't give pay raises/bonuses to workers.  Corporate direction is hit and miss.  Only perk, they do provide free drinks ""Water, flavored water, icetea and come soft drinks.""  Over all if you need a job and there's nowhere to work, you might select working at Oracle."
bad,There is no room for advancement as managers never leave as they have it made. Everyone is just trying to CYA.  Good starting pay and benefits no raises.  Training is non-existent but New products are expected to be supported. New work and procedures added all the time but never more pay. They used to allow work from home but have taken that away and now must go to the office even after 7 years of work from home.
bad,"Competitive work."
bad,"Very slow paced, a lot of bureaucracy, just to merge you code takes to go through several merge approvals."
bad,"After Oracle purchased Sun Microsystems I thought it would be a great opportunity for me and my co-workers, but after numerous lay offs and canceled projects my hopes for advancing my career and someday retiring from Oracle were gone."
bad,"If your manager and director are good, you'll love your job. If they're not, it will not go smoothly until you either transfer or quit. That's about it."
bad,"Pocas posibilidades de desarrollo profesional, no hay subidas de sueldo. Lo bueno: entorno de trabajo internacional"
bad,"The numbers are more important than people at Oracle.  Even if the numbers make no sense.   At Oracle mangers want you to be in the middle of the pack.  You are trouble if you are to good or to bad.  They don't want you to take the initiative as it may cause them to have to work.  To many American jobs went to overseas locations not because they are more technically proficient, but because it is cheaper.  Customer Service suffered because of it."
bad,I haven't found Oracle a great place to work. My stay at this company was very short. No work from home option. Management was not that approachable. Was a little hard for me to work here.
bad,"Be your manager's favourite else you dont expect anything from here.Joining salary will continue for years .Place to settle ,Stagnant growth.Secure Job"
bad,"Finally receive 10 (instead of 8) US holidays per year as of Fall 2016. There are very good healthcare options and some flexibility to work remotely a few days a week.  New college grads are given more incentives (salary, stock options and bonuses) than employees already working here.  Difficult to seek career opportunities to learn more industry-relevant technologies.  Huge gap between Execs and workers in salary, communication and respect."
bad,"If you're a recent college grad this is a good job to start building your resume career - especially for a career within sales. However, change is extremely constant which could get stressful. 2 year position max."
bad,"I never enjoyed a day working at Oracle. I came to know later that Oracle company culture depends from team to team and the mainly the culture is set by our manager and not even the group manager. "
bad,"The place is hiring lots of new salespeople, but the environment overall is depressing and 90's style. They do not use their own modern sales systems, takes ages to sell anything due to complicated internal red tape. Selling is not the hard part, Oracle is. Especially if you come from more modern organizations."
bad,"Oracle has a long way to go to establish itself on Cloud. Its slow. Working with higher management is very challenging. Due to employees in so many time-zones working on the same project, it takes time for information to flow and for people to get back to each other."
bad,"I wasn't employed here long enough, but the time I was there, I really stayed to myself. I was on a small temporary contract. I think that the management could have used some OD training and learn how to be a better team."
bad,"Great opportunity to work with cross-functional team members from marketing, sales and new product development to manufacturing. "
bad,I've found that Oracle really doesn't pay attention to what its employers' individual talents are. Not many opportunities for forward advancement or cost-of-living wage increases. Very rare merit increases.
bad,"This is no job life balance.  You can make good money, but you also have to wait for them to pay you correctly."
bad,"Plenty to learn."
bad,"Difficult company, would not recommend. No advancement, no increases and no recognition."
bad,"While Oracle itself is a good company, working there is not the best. Since it is so huge, each employee doesn't matter to the company as a whole, turnover rate is extremely high and that's just the start. All they care about are numbers and KPI's. While some competition within the workplace is good, this culture is very cold and not understanding of situational setbacks. If you don't perform, they'll just replace you"
bad,Getting a deal completed is next to impossible. Each acquisition introduces complexity. They have acquired 150+ companies and licensing of their products is difficult.
bad,"Oracle has relaxed kind of environment, and decision making capability is totally missing from top management level, as a result of that they are late comer in cloud technology and DevOps role."
bad,"This is a company that does not believe in merit increases, instead calling it a ""focal"" every five to ten years for a department where maybe a penny will be added to a handful of engineer's salary. Meanwhile they WILL work you to the limit you put before them. Be careful before volunteering your nights and weekends, you may never get them back. The people who stay long term eventually stop doing their jobs and pass it off to the new people, who get so burned out they leave within 3 years."
bad,"Software company bought a hardware company and ran it into the ground.Since they paid less than what Sun paid, raises were rare at best. Several RIFs wiped out the HW Development org."
bad,"In 9 years, two raises. One at 1.5%, the other 1%, but every year but 1, health care contribution went up."
bad,"A lot of management decisions made without knowing if they will work."
bad,"Oracle does not really care about the longevity of its employees. Poor payroll practices. Starting work week on Saturday and not having to pay you overtime if you had vacation, holiday, sick time during the 40 hr week."
bad,"Have enjoyed working at Oracle for five years, but with very few opportunities for advancement, it is time to look elsewhere.  Great for your first year out of college or if you're accepting a higher-paying position and intend to stay."
bad,"Oracle management is good but hike is not good"
bad,"Disorganized, crazy, wild, wild west; very political as far as territory assignment; I would not recommend to anyone I'm friends with; long, long hours when you have a sale coming in; no Thanksgiving or Memorial Day holidays as they're end of quarters"
bad,"In 2016 I was an incoming class of hired to be a business development consultant (BDC). On day 3 of training, myself along with 30 others were told our job roles had shifted and we were now customer success managers (CSM). This was not the role I applied for, nor was that the case for any others. The roles are extremely different, as are the perks, day-to-day, management, and culture. "
bad,Oracle is a company that attracts top talent.  They rely on the employee to develop themselves and manage their careers.  This never made sense to me as it's more costly to Oracle to do that.  The people working at Oracle are good people and highly capable.
bad,"1) Layoffs due to poor organizational planning and strategy"
bad,"Job includes continuous software development in Java/J2EE, Web services, GWT, Javascript, jQuery, Oracle database technologies. It is also expected to provide support and maintenance for production issues at existing customer systems."
bad,"Monotonous work schedule, too many accounts, competitive workplace. upper management is too focused on micromanaging. work culture differs depending on the location."
bad,"Do not work here unless you enjoy a stale working environment, lack of career advancement and an annual compensation that will decrease year over year."
bad,Great package and benefits. You will know immediately if it’s not for you. Location could be better but that’s not the fault of the company. Try it only if you are ready for a change and are willing to put in work
bad,Nothing more interesting to be at Oracle than the salary. They pay well! but the management aren't that much great as the name of the company - Oracle (at Saudi Arabia).
bad,"Oracle is a good company and by any measure has been successful, however it is not for everybody.  The sales culture is not collaborative and you can have up to twenty sales teams calling on an account due to the breadth of products, which is frustrating to customers and partners.  There is very little collaboration and there is a huge bureaucracy, which impacts agility and flexibility."
bad,"Good place to work at in terms of salary and bonus."
bad,"Average compensation and quality of work is not good."
bad,"What would be a great place to work is unfortunately marred by terrible management in the Finance departments.  Field and HQ are pit against each other to compete for work.  Most of the time spent on conference calls are trying to defend your work against others who are trying to take it from you. There was a constant tug-of-war in the use of management reporting applications, departments competed to see who were allowed certain levels of access versus those who weren't.  Departments cut out of report development reverted back to data dumps and spreadsheet use out of necessity."
bad,"Over all not a fun place to work. My group was good, but upper management is clueless on how to manage, and most importantly sell hardware. If you want to work at Oracle be very careful to pick the right group or you will be hating life."
bad,"Every day was a new challenge encountered, but that was the fun part. Learned the products inside and out investigating problems. My direct management was stellar, there isn't much interaction with management above who you report to though. Hardest part of the job was overcoming environmental issues and obtaining the hardware/software needed to perform your job successfully. Most enjoyable part was the team that I worked with - - great group of people...smart, innovative and always working as a team."
bad,"When interviewing with Oracle, they promised me a ton of opportunity to move to other positions within the company. This is most certainly not the case. You can only move up to an OD sales rep position and that's it. The entire organization as a whole is littered with inconsistencies. The person working right next to you in your same exact role can make $15,000+ more than you every quarter just based off of luck, no skills or handwork needed. I would NOT recommend working here. Management is also a joke. SDR management doesn't do a single thing the whole day and banks off of our work for their $25,000+ bonuses every quarter."
bad,"I was hired to work on security issues, but, instead, I fixed memory bugs in C code. The innovative culture of SUN was being replaced by the bureaucracy of Oracle."
bad,"A great place to place and learn new avenues and working here will make individuals to get more self-confidence and can survive anywhere. Gives us the opportunity to prove your capabilities but after a certain level, there is no growth path."
bad,"Company is Good , But internal Politics doesn,t allow for a day to concentrate to apply your mind. Culture is non Human. Peace of mind is not there for a person who want to perform activity."
bad,"Acquisitions are the mainstay and layoffs are a part of their business model. They buy new companies to ""innovate"", keep only the highest revenue streams and dump the rest, including all of the staff. You can work from home in many instances, but your pink slip is always held over your head and strikes without notice, with immediate termination."
bad,The job and company culture was great until the buy out.  There have not been any raises or promotions or the entire team.  Several team members have left the company and the positions have not been back filled making day to day tasks and work load difficult for the remaining team members.
bad,"Not a very employee friendly company."
bad,"Biggest issues with keeping Oracle from being that dream company is that they are always years late coming to the party.  ie The Cloud, also they could be the poster child for defining what is wrong with corporate compensation.  Spread the wealth down to the folks that actually do the work."
bad,"The executives and management of Oracle need to learn how to compensate their employees fairly. Some of your workers are struggling to make ends meet due to a lack of a raise in compensation. Some have gone 4 years without a single increase. No wonder why it's a revolving door. Also, stop paying new hires more than the more experienced employees. That is outright disgraceful."
bad,"Terrible culture. You're only a number to them. They think anyone can do your job so hit your numbers or leave. Co workers are great, everyone is around the same age and you're all in the same boat.  Management is totally disconnected and has no idea of the daily struggle of cold-calling people who have no interest in what you're selling."
bad,Advancement drags on forever and never pans out.  Company does not care about employees.  Stable work environment though and the pay is decent.
bad,"Management had no idea on how to deal with certain Director level managers who were creating a very undesirable workplace environment. I had to deal with someone like that who was constantly trying to undermine my efforts and make me look bad. My own manager elected to just ignore the problem and told me try to work around it. Then, I was asked to do a different job that was not in my career plan at all - I chose to leave and work for IBM."
bad,"Oracle is phasing out PS and attempting to replace with Oracle HCM Fusion.  My position was eliminated due to inability to secure bids.  Once customers reach 9.2, with the PUM process, future work is greatly reduced and almost not existent."
bad,Negative experience of working here. No new learning or career growth. Unhealthy team environment and a lot of useless mental pressure.
bad,"There are a broad set of opportunities across the company. The compensation and benefits are good. Great technical resources, but there is a lack of management courage."
bad,"Very lower bonus and a single digit increment paid biannually or triannually, Lot of scrap in the company. I would like to recommend to the company to remove the scrap and respect the experienced a bit more than the freshers."
bad,"Management was difficult, felt like different groups were at odds with each other.  In general, very competitive internally, which made it difficult to move things forward"
bad,This company does not respect its employees at all.  Upper management has no idea what direction to head in.  There are some great minds here that are being squeezed out by upper management bigotry and competing organizations.
bad,I learned a lot as this was my first career job out of college. The pay is low and raises are very few and far between. Environment can be stressful with work overload. Especially at end of quarter months.
bad,"It's not hard to hit the 6 digit salary, but you'll expected to put a lot of extra time... comes down to make less if you calculate how much you make per hour invested. The extra time is not at the client (40hrs at the client), but the preparation, self-training, etc."
bad,"Typical day at work a lot of work, but management takes care of employees by giving them a paid day off."
bad,"Corporate hired many people to fill an initiative.  After 2 months they changed the direction and asked many to move to other jobs whether or not they wished to do so.  Very disrespectful and rude about the whole process.  Field management, in my opinion practiced ""fear"" management.  Those of us with experience don't fear Oracle managers and will choose to leave."
bad,Upper management is a mess and full of micro-managers who care only about themselves. This is a great place to work if you don't desire to truly learn and grow.
bad,"I enjoyed my job at Oracle, but big company with high workload expectations and red tape."
bad,"As a salesperson at Oracle it's not unusual to use extortion tactics to get customers to pay more money so you can hit your quota."
bad,"A typical day at work involves ""smiling and dialing"" while management hounds you to meet your attainment.  I've learned close to nothing about sales.  We're treated as disposable employees.  "
bad,"Oracle workers are usually dedicated to their work and supportive of one another, and work life balance in many Oracle organizations is very very good."
bad,"They dont give salary hike for almost 2 years."
bad,"If you enjoy being pushed to sell complex SaaS solutions, with transactional speed expectations, in relationship sales, to companies who hate Oracle, this is the job for you. You'll find most of your account contacts are on the Do Not Call list. Quotas will be beyond attainment unless you get insanely lucky, and even if/when you do well, they'll promote externally. Enjoy."
bad,"Very Good work life balance."
bad,"They try to adjust to keep up, but are too bloated to be agile. Like an elephant that thinks it's a ballerina. Too much getting in its own way. Too much process."
bad,"I worked at Oracle full-time (More than 5 years)"
bad,Not for the faint of heart.  Systems don't work.  Sales processes are very complicated.  Compensation is great if you can make a sale.  But not worth the stress.
bad,"Good place to start off working. But you have to leave and come back to get the raise you deserve, and it can be highly disorganized. Upper level management doesn't align themselves to your goals very well."
bad,I received no training and everything felt unorganized which is partly due to being hired through an acquisition.  The environment was very stressful as all of my fellow coworkers were laid off except for me due to the relocation of finance department to San Antonio.
bad,"Oracle is a top down run company that focuses on the areas of the business that will generate the most revenue to influence the market/stock price. This is great for the top level executives, but makes it difficult for the lower level employees that are trying to find success at the company. There is a mantra you will hear constantly on the sales floor. Success at Oracle is defined as the three T's: Timing, Territory, and Talent. That means that if you're in the right territory at the right time you will be successful, regardless of how competent or good at sales you are. If you want to gamble your OTE opportunity on that mantra Oracle is the right place to be. The challenge is every year they reshuffle territories, and give all the work/opportunities you've cultivated to the new territory rep when they move you elsewhere (hence the importance on timing and territory). "
bad,"Good place to work, except they focused too much on numbers and less on the people creating those excellent numbers.  Lots of job cuts and hiring younger folks."
bad,Very inflexible management.  Departmental managers are either very hands off with little or no guidance or they are totally micro managing everything.  Upper management doesn't drive consistency in their managers creating conflict if you are in a support position.  Terrific co-workers.  Not all systems are user friendly or well defined.
bad,"If you want to remain as Oracle DBA, then Oracle is not the better place to work with. "
bad,"No hikes, no performance based growth."
bad,"There is a bad management. The experience is great. But there is no support and very little training is provided. "
bad,Lots of politics. It's hard to make decisions and move forward. Lack of advancement opportunities. There is no opportunity to move up. The company is very cheap on pay and benefits.
bad,"Buildings are great quality, atmosphere is designed to push you hard and get the most out of you.  Oracle aims for collaboration but struggles with having so many employees out of the office either at customer sites or working virtually."
bad,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. The office started to get crowded as the company grew."
bad,"Oracle is a pretty ok company, however being acquired by them is the absolute worst! MICROS never had good management however after being acquired it has gotten worst. In addition to, we now have the fear of potentially losing our jobs because of this. The environment un-easy and extremely stressful."
bad,"San antonio office is great.  Management is fantastic and treats employees well. Workload is too easy for some with experience they are hired for.  The compensation is way below business standard.  I was able to secure employment making 75 percent more than they paid.  I received four offers with other companies in a weeks time all offered compensation and benefits package that were so much better than Oracle.  If Oracle paid more, used personnel more wisely their company would definately be a better place to work at."
bad,"Overall, there is a negative attitude that the employee's have about the company. Oracle is only concerned with the bottom line and don't pay attention to their employees"
bad,"worked in the marketing dept in internet city in the marketing section as an internship for 2 months."
bad,"Work culture is good."
bad,Though not common in Oracle but in our team we have opportunities to explore and work on Several new tools and technologies. If a product is acquired then it will be sunset.
bad,"Work Life balance is good but salary is less than what market offers."
bad,Oracle has opportunity for those that are willing to take a risk.  There is also a culture clash going on from the old way of doing things to a the new cloud model
bad,"In terms of Global Finance Organization in which I am currently placed there is no career and salary growth, If you are kind of person who just want their job secured without any other expectation you can join this place other than that you will have to be smart enough to face management politics."
bad,"I was a Micros employee when Oracle acquired us. Call volume started to consistently decline and after 3-4 years, they eliminated my position. There wasn't any room for advancement or lateral movement even after doing the training suggested by management. The severance package was good though."
bad,"Overall, Oracle is a great place to dip your toe in the waters of corporate America.  Raises and promotions are hard to come by, however.  Get the name on your resume, pick up a few new skills, and move on."
bad,"I had four managers during my tenure at Oracle. My last manager was very good and managed strategically, well liked. Training was appropriate. Some days I was heads down and other times collaborative and working with others on a project."
bad,"I've work over six months straight with no rise,came to work on time ,work a lot of doubles and never miss a day and turn around to fire me because I look suspicious but never stole anything but being  in the wrong place just changing a radio battery on the walk-ie talk-ie But other guards were sleep but never lost their jobs::::::::ShameB on this company"
bad,"Working in oracle is best "
bad,"Maybe I'm a spoiled millennial, but this job felt the closest to prison I've ever experienced. Beige walls, cubicles, and a culture of 'who cares' makes this place feel like the dead end of a career I hadn't even started yet. Oracle is too big for its breaches, and when a company is this big, it can't care about its employees and its employees certainly didn't care about it."
bad,the days could be long but enjoyable. Great opportunity to learn the technology industry with a great leader. I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to work at Oracle.
bad,"Compartmentalized departments, "
bad,Growth is limited. Increments are rare or none. Ratings are not on performance but on company requirements.
bad,"Relaxed place to work."
bad,I enjoyed working for Oracle because it was monetaially beneficial
bad,Took the job because it was Oracle but learned Oracle has many acquisitions that just take the name. Customer support and service was unbelievably bad. Customers hated our products. It was extremely hard to sell.
bad,"There are some amazing people who work here and you can learn a lot from them. The benefits are great, but negotiate the best pay you can, because unless you reach the point of being a global technical lead, you will retire with that salary. "
bad,From a work standpoint there was no direction or leadership for an entry level employee. Lines of communication between people and departments were all over the place.
bad,"didn't have a manager my first 6 months, never had a defined territory, they did not give me access to the CRM until month 7. My hiring manager left the day I started."
bad,"Not worth the Oracle name on your resume."
bad,Um ambiente frio de competição acirrada dentro da própria empresa. Torna o ambiente desconfortável e pesado.
bad,"If you're looking for some place stable to punch the clock, this is your spot. If you're looking to be innovative and work with other go-getters, keep looking."
bad,The amount of turn over was just surprising. It seems like every month there was a wave of new people replacing those that had left. Not just regular employees but management positions as well.
bad,"Oracle is simply too big of a company to worry about each individual employee. Everything is self-service, and depending on which area of the company you are involved in advancement opportunities can be slim. That being said, because it is such a big company, different areas of the business may have a different experience than what I encounter on a daily basis."
bad,"Horrible experience.  Hired to do one job, ended up doing meaningless work, lots of reporting up. Not a great experience. A lot of doing what we use to do."
bad,"Our small company that produced the best application of its kind was bought out by Oracle. At first it was mostly good; our product was being taken in new and interesting directions, though they consistently refused to authorize any additional hiring for our project. Then they lost interest in our project and gutted the team of talented and dedicated engineers who had poured as much as 15+ years of effort into our product. The layoff was conducted in a very cold-blooded manner: We were sent an email to attend a ""meeting"" that was nothing more than a cold blooded executive lying about how much they appreciated our efforts before letting us go. Immediate managers were not officially allowed to notify employees about what was going down."
bad,I rate Oracle as an average company. Benefits are great.  The ability to work from home was a huge benefit. Working environment was relaxed in certain areas.  Facilities were top notch.
bad,"Oracle has a great training program that will get sales people ready to take on the job they are asked to do but be ready to be asked to make serious ethical compromises.  You can get by at Oracle doing literally nothing and some people thrive in this environment but in my experience it has lead to laziness and cynicism in the office.  Also, customers hate Oracle because they are being bombarded by 20 different sales people on a daily basis from different departments and we do some shady dealings including ""audits"" that can ruin an entire business.  "
bad,"My review of Oracle is very dated.  While I was there, things were moving very quickly.  Management did not always seem to be ahead of the game and client service suffered."
bad,"Self service company.  No I in team, and no concept of team at Oracle. Good pay, poor mgt, benefits are fading as with most companies.  Cloud cloud cloud cloud"
bad,"An top down company, employee communication needs to be much improved in order to be a good place to work for. I do not recommend this company to work for, if you have to, stay 2 years and move out and up in other hi tech companies."
bad,"Good Place for Offshore roles, Work from home, Work life balance, Not visible Appraisals. Increments are very low."
bad,"nothing much to learn as there is too much decentralization of work"
bad,"less compensation"
bad,"Ok company to work. You can work for an one year. No salary hikes every year. No growth .That a great place to work."
bad,"Oracle India Pvt. Ltd provides freedom to work, however at times the pressure created by management(sales) is unnecessary."
bad,People were smart and motivated about developing a second generation Cloud service. Management was often weak and/or inexperienced. There were many changes in priority/direction that had impact on the day-to-day work of everyone in OCI.
bad,"El crecimiento económico es muy dificil, no existe equilibrio responsabilidad sueldo."
bad,"- Lot's of job security, "
bad,"I work in a division that is focused on Software development for on prem and cloud. The company is designed to siloh it's organzations where communication between each is little to no communcation.  This leads to each organization creating a unique subculture of Oracle.  "
bad,"Poor customer support and business model as well as poor team attitude."
bad,"I joined Oracle right out of school. Learned a ton of things here and am grateful for the opportunity. Had 3 managers and my last one was my lead in the group. The lead is strict but very professional, knowledgable, and honest. He will say that a good job is good and a bad job is bad. Doesn't like to fool around. Great deal of experience and had a lot of experience and knowledge to gain from her 12+ years of experience at Oracle/Sun."
bad,"Management just hasn't figured out how to structure the company efficiently. For sales reps it's sink or swim. Also, no correlation to pay. You could do nothing and make a lot of money, and you could work hard and make nothing."
bad,"Hostile and isolated working environment in recent years, Managers are not responsive, career growth limited, better engineers are leaving. "
bad,"almost no raise, not a good company to work for, if you can find something else, the head level read data only no vision of technology,  its kind of loos management"
bad,"Oracle is a good company to work for. Average benefits and opportunity to growth at my LOB."
bad,"There are the usual problems with any job:"
good,OK to get experience but management and direction changes so often that there is no benefit in the long term. Need to keep changing role in order to keep job.
good,This place will suck the life out of you. It is full of bros. Make sure to brush on who did what in last nights game or you will have nothing to talk about. Yawn.
good,"As a fresher i have learnt a lot in this company."
good,"Manager keeps taking on more work for the group without getting any more help, only to have all the US jobs moved to India.  Over seas employees don't like training people in the US  unless they're forced to by management."
good,Daily extreme stress in regards to meeting target and forecasts. Heavy sales environment which causes imbalance between work and personal life. Extreme preasure
good,This company has no respect for your personal life or time off.  They believe they own you.  Also grossly under paid and under titled for what is being asked of you.
good,Driving around Oklahoma to different towns inspecting foreclosed homes.  Contacting customers in order for them to contact their mortgage lender.  On your own make your own hours.
good,"No interaction between top management and individual contributors. Groups work in silos, No career advancement and inadequate compensation. No team building efforts. No celebrations or social activities."
good,"Its a good place to work.. Can learn more , but no flexibility & long hours of working..Management doesn't care much about employees ."
good,"I have been at Oracle for quite some time.  Although the people and products are awesome, the culture lacks true leaders and careers stagnate."
good,"Being remote is a huge plus, loved new Clouds, however Oracle is to late to the game. Great and mart people to work with, but lack of vision and direction dragging it down."
good,Poor management and very less perks/hikes. Work culture is good with flexible timings. Less growth and promotions. No job security. Low compensation and other benefits.
good,"managers and upper management didn't have much of a clue, would celebrate someone from just being in the seat and not the people really closing deals."
good,Good place to work for certain types of people; success depends on group manager and the management chain above him or her. Newcomers are thrown into the fire without much support. CEOs focus on sales; marketing is orphaned.
good,"Some highly skilled and motivated employees"
good,"I am currently is a job where I do not have a chance to prove my skills and show my strengths in the scope of business. "
good,"Lead PeopleSoft HCM and Taleo Recruiting project"
good,"Top performers are treated very well. The rest are treated as interchangeable parts. If you come in and do your job, do not expect salary increases. Corporate culture tends to encourage zero-sum games, not win-win."
good,"Every group/division can be different in how they treat their employees, but I'd say overall there is very good atmosphere of trust and fairness. There is a strong focus on education, and they reimburse for outside classes taken (Up to 5k/year I think). Benefits are good, and I'd say quite competitive in the market. Good 401K matching (they'll contribute a max of 3% of your 6% or greater). Free drinks in the breakroom. Flexibility to work from home at times. (If you live 50+ miles away from an office you can work full-time from home...policy)."
good,"•	Currently working as a senior analyst in Global Finance Information center of Oracle India Pvt Ltd."
good,"Its fine to work for Oracle. It is a big company, but not the best employer"
good,What I loved most is the flexibility of production hours and the ability to work from home. They didn't use to micro manage your work or time off. Since that has changed
good,"Very hierarchical management policies and systems; very little information sharing among team members"
good,"oracle is great to have on your resume, but not a good company culture. If you're going to be in tech, you should try to find a different company with a more creative and innovative culture"
good,This job is quite demanding and challenging.  Travel is quite frequent and work hours are long.  Pay is good so depends what you're looking for. Management is tough.
good,"-Culture is horrible"
good,"It's too bad but it is really only management I have a problem with.  Oracle is a great place to work if you want to learn new things.  Like any IT environment, things are constantly changing, processes are being improved, etc.  so it is on you to keep up.  There are new, interesting challenges each day."
good,"From a high level, Oracle is a great place to work. "
good,A place to challenge you and allow you to work hard. Self service is taken out of proportion at some points. turnover is high in the stressful environment
good,"While at oracle, there were no positions that opened up for advancement and there were no raises, not even annual performance raises.  In order to get more money people would quit and then reapply for another position."
good,"Liked few of the things didn't like many. Theoretically Oracle should do better but apparently, they are not doing well in many fields, wish they would do better."
good,"This is an example of company comitted with grow. It is stressfull. You can learn a lot about market tendence or strategies, etc. However, if the numbers are not enouth, there is no clemence with the team."
good,"Company doesn't care about work life balance. HR is ineffective at investigating issues. Pay sucks. "
good,"Powerful brand, very hated by their customers for vendor lock-in, predatory pricing, and obfuscated bundled solution pricing.  Very distrusted by their customers."
good,"Company does not care to develop top talent and promotion is based on politics.  "
good,"With any job, there are good days and bad days, crunch times and down times, fun times and not-so-fun times. You get the idea. With Oracle being such a large company, there are areas where it's fun all the time, but even more areas where it's not."
good,"Managers actually bad mouth the company.  They give no feedback to employees, except once a year during the annual review."
good,"A well run company, but, the sales culture is a meat grinder.  No raises for reps during my tenure.  Operationally Oracle is very sound."
good,"O clima da empresa não é bom, os gestores estão a todo momento pressionando, ameaçando, não cumprem com o contrato de trabalho."
good,"I worked for this company as an inside sales rep for about 1.5 years."
good,"Great place from outside but internally equally messy. "
good,"Day starts around 6 AM with meetings with global teams and ends around 7 or 8 PM."
good,five face to face meetings per week
good,Good place to start career! Not a place for seasoned professionals as the salary and growth potential are limited.
good,"First, the good things: if you can find the right team it can be interesting work, and the benefits are great."
good,Challenging work environment and must be willing to work under pressure. Compensation is good and transport facilities are great. Also they pay good allowance
good,"In my opinion, Oracle is a reasonably good place to work but not really an employee-friendly company. "
good,"Is a great company to work for, the benefits are great. A typical work day would depend on if we were traveling or not. Then, we would be assigned projects and trainings to become certified."
good,"Competitive pay and great benefits, but this is all overshadowed by the FUD that permeates the whole company.  Oracle lays off so many people so often that your job is always at risk."
good,Traveled 50 weeks out of my last year with the company.  Products are innovative and amazing but management is cumbersome and slow-to move on trends or clients requests.
good,"Oracle gives you the opportunity to improve your entrepreneurial skills. Most activities are self driven and self motivated. The culture enables you to think fast, manage time efficiently and turn deals around quickly to meet set targets. The downside of above is there isn't as much focus on career advancement within the company. The most enjoyable part of the company is the relationships built with colleagues and customers. As far as benefits are concerned, Oracle has an excellent health insurance plan."
good,"Pros:"
good,Oracle is more like a Trader. We have many agent in the field who markets and present what our company has to offer then we have subcon who do the tailoring and printing.
good,Oracle just numbers you and do not care how much time you've devoted to them and will let you go at the drop of a hat. You could be there for twenty years and devoted your time to the company and they just don't care
good,"Utilization is the only thing that upper management cares about.  On full-time projects, I could only bill a set amount of hours that end up around 80% utilization.  This makes any advancement extremely difficult when at least 90% utilization and travel is required.  My previous manager had over 80 direct reports, so it was difficult to have one-on-one time to discuss anything.  It's been a long time since I felt like a priority or genuinely cared about.  All the people that used to advocate for my team are no longer with the company and have not been replaced (or even tried to be replaced).  We are told by upper management not to worry about issues like this, but that only makes me worry more.  There's so much disconnect and it is not recognized, we are just told to bill for project work, that's it."
good,"Oracle is in the midst of a major transition from the on-premise to cloud world.  Employees have an opportunity to help drive that change.  However, they do have to fight a considerable amount of inertia to do so.  If you're not careful, it's easy to get caught in an endless cycle of meetings that don't accomplish much at the expense of actually delivering work that has value to the company.  Salaries are abysmal, but benefits such as health insurance are superior.  Bonuses and payraises are non-existent."
good,Good Benefits but doesn't have any loyalty to look after women who have been there a long time when it comes to restructuring. You are on a winner if you are a young man with a cocky attitude.
good,Oracle’s compensation does not balance in accordance to the work volume or daily/quarterly expectations.  Work volume increased over 200% with no increase in yearly wages nor commission payments.  Our opportunities to increase our commissions  decreased  over the years until they changed our plan to a group goal.  They never increased out annual wages.
good,"The work could be interesting and many of the people are fabulous.  But, while I strongly believe in the software development process, at Oracle it is used to get in the way of development, instead of encourage higher quality software."
good,"Request the highest salary possible upon getting hired, because you’ll never get a raise. Be prepared  your quota will increase YoY and the OTE will remaine the same (lower commission payout)."
good,Lacks opportunities for advancement.  The Oracle business that I am associated with is Hardware and this part of the business has been stagnant for many years.  The products are low volume and un-inspriing.  There are very few opportunities for advancement and all of the senior management level positions have been filled by outside candidates.
good,Works ok but could be better. Oracle was a tough transition for us but the contractors were helpful and respectful. It was a change for our company who had been with the same ERP system for a number of years.
good,"Not the most exciting place to work. This big company is divided in many acquired firms that act very different, and depends what area you join is how your experience will be."
good,"Between dealing with Federal clients that don't know and constant re-orgs within Oracle, it's hard to know what exactly a typical day is within the company."
good,The coworkers are pretty cool and the Clients was always nice to me but no benefits and lack of pay wasn’t good enough for me any longer I feel as though I’m worth a lot more I bring over 10 years of security experience
good,"I learnt a lot from oracle especially team work. worked on various projects, on various teams. Managers are ok. Politics is high.compared to other MNCs it is ok. not great."
good,"While I enjoyed most of the teams I worked with, the efforts  and projects were doomed to fail.  The management vision, belief or theories were never allowed enough time through a restructure to see if the new idea even worked.  Before any success could be gauged, the process for training would change which made it virtually impossible to determine what worked and what didn't."
good,"Oracle is a large corporate environment that is known for not giving pay raises, decent benefits, or growth within the company."
good,Great place to work.
good,"Overworked and under appreciated. The culture is relaxed, but poor management and no room for advancement. Resources and promotions are allocated to recent college graduates."
good,"BAD"
good,"Your creativity is murdered since they dont understand technology."
good,Huge company. Lot's of red tape and no raises or bonuses for the entire group. Certain groups do better than others and our group (100's of people) hasn't had raises in years.
good,"Four months (end of quarter) out of the year of your life belong to Oracle. Work weeks are stressful during these months, and a lot of overtime work is required."
good,"The leadership with in the organization could be better versed at expressing information concerning their employees. With in all companies transition can bring about stressful situations. However, providing feedback, although limited, is better than receiving no information at all."
good,"Big company, moves slowly"
good,"Oracle is such a big company it really depends on your role as well as your manager.  But one thing is for sure, Oracle needs to do a better job of sharing customer data among internal teams.  Today, data is scattered across multiple applications and repositories and is often outdated or flat out incorrect.  This has caused major headaches for internal co-workers and unfortunately for customers as well."
good,"Oracle is a great company, they know how to position the products in the market and win."
good,"management out of touch with the employees, lack of training and help tool.  Lack of hands on training ........................................................"
good,Oracle is a great company when it comes to learning important facets of how to run an organization.  They not only teach out how to manage your territory but how to manage your team and to best leverage your resources.
good,"If you're able to navigate the company well, you can do great things here. Its very much about who you work for, how well you can blend, how much you can prove your self worth to advance."
good,"Management's stated goal of paying the least amount of money they can for the best engineers has been publicly stated.  They also assume any employee can be replaced with a cheaper one with no experience.  Employees are laid off with no warning.  You are expected to work harder for the same salary.  "
good,"robotic type of environment. employees do not enjoy Oracle, zero appreciation from employer, Oracle does not appreciate customers because the customers need them!! No raises, you probably will not work with or near your reporting manager. No analysis in making business decisions."
good,Good work-life balance but horrible benefits. Not too much work in the team and timings are pretty flexible. But hikes are rare and not on par with industry standards
good,Provided you have support & a clear vision from your higher-ups. The work life balance is ok. There are no perks & budgets are tight. On-site trips are scarce & not of much use to employees as there is no per diem allowance.
good,"Worked there as a developer, overall I found engineers to be motivated, conscientious and very smart.  At times though getting much needed resources, and getting through process / getting approvals in place was as efficient / fast as molasses in January. Management was about the most blatantly political that I have experienced"
good,Sales experience in a large corporation. It is a great jumping off point to begin a career in any vocation; the people and social selling skills are crucial to any profession.
good,Oracle is a huge multi-national organization with all of the good and bad things that come with such a company.  I was hired with some promises made but never kept so I left.
good,"While Oracle is a challenging place to work it is a phenomenal place to sharpen skills.  I learned more about sales leadership in my time at Oracle than at any other time in my career."
good,"There is much employee dissatisfaction and rarely any interest in the well being of employees. A good place to gain experience, but will be cheating yourself and your future if you remain"
good,"It's not about the company, it's about the management and your team. How are they willing to support you in term of training and management. The manager was not supporting us as a team, she would take the credit for upper management. "
good,"Yaşam kalitesi devamlı olarak düşüyor.Çalışma ortamı iyi olmasına rağmen, enflasyon olan bir ülkelede insanlar senelerce maaş zammı alamıyorlar."
good,Updater service Ind.Pvt Ltd it is the fastest growing company in our country it is providing all the facility services
good,Most enjoyable part of the job was working with experienced co-workers.
good,"#  Long work days with difference in timezones"
good,"It was nice working with oracle. Oracle is my first company and i learned lot of things here."
good,financial conditions in Greece has created very difficult working environment
good,Technically challenging and good comp/benefits. Great team work - allows acquired companies to have their own micro cultures.
good,"I worked at Oracle in two different position over the course of two and half years. I basically had two different experiences. My first position was the better of the two. Superior management made all the difference. The initial training is completely substandard here unless you luck into a mentor that's willing to train you further. They offer decent wages but raises rarely happen and there's substantial turnover due to outsourcing and constant temp replacement. Advancement is mainly about office politics and the people you know higher up on the chain. People are fairly nice but there's was a bit too much clique-like behavior for my taste and far too much gossip as well. There's a saying here that's delivered sarcastically that you will most assuredly hear when you first arrive and bump into the first of what will be many frustrations: ""Welcome to Oracle""."
good,This is a new company so they're trying to work out all the bugs. Equipment is fairly old but it holds up. The owner is a good fellow. The work was slow at first but I think it has since picked up.
good,I have been with the company for a long time and the recent changes are not necessarily aligned with my personal expectations or goals for my job. It is time to explore other opportunities outside the company.
good,"Unfortunately Leadership is very unsupportive and back stabbing, too many politics to be productive. Constant rotation/attrition of Sales personnel due to unrealistic forecast, territory and revenue goals."
good,Their style of managing employees is extremely dated. There is a lack of communication in decision making. Project Redwood is a joke. Their applications are trash.
good,Oracle people are great and the company often offers a good work / life balance. Compensation is below normal and the company is notorious for denying raises and bonuses.
good,"A huge company with a lot of offices in many countries, "
good,"Typical day at work troubleshooting customer support portal issues. Support portal support, user account support, registration support, contract access support,"
good,"The typical day at work is working with client issues to resolve problems."
good,"At least as far as CDO Operations team which I have been a part of is a concern, the place is ruined by Managers and their cheap politics. The sheer absence of monetary benefits in terms of hikes, promotions and recognition make the self-motivation wither-out quickly.  "
good,Great for when you're just out of college but get monotonous the longer you are here. The training are very good for learning but at some point become repetitive. Feels a bit like high school but on an adult level.
good,"Working in the Order to Cash department does not provide growth opportunities, department prefers to hire from the outside than promote within. There are no incentives given to employees for reaching their quarterly goals."
good,"Oracle still uses decades old tech stack for building its so called SaaS Applications. "
good,Word area was nice. No work from back office. I stared at blank monitor for 5+ hours. Recruiter said that I would get additional work but that was not the truth.
good,"Too big. Not for everybody. No Loyalty."
good,"Its a vibrant place to work with a good measure of experienced and first time working crowd that gel well."
good,Excellent place to work .. excellent benefits.. excellent employees.. free drinks.. flexible .. options on telecommuting.. super fun environment.. excellent service excellent staff excellent location
good,"The work place environment is pretty chilled out."
good,"Oracle India is a great technology company, in dev/QA many great minds work there (or atleast worked). There's flexibility at the workplace (depending on the reporting manager you work with) . "
good,"Typical work day consisted of reformatting laptops and palleting items for domestic and international shipping. "
good,Challenging environment.Day to day activities were making 50 calls andworking with field staff  then I was promoted to the field and worked with inside sales. Hardware division is suffering at Oracle and is a stressful environment. Young employees promoted based on college attended.
good,"Oracle is a great place to learn how to run a tech sales career. Everything is about the sale, so it's a great place to learn that side of the business. The experiences I had there have been super helpful, however, moving away from sales in-house is not so easy."
good,"Company culture needs a lot of work. Team morale is very low. Teams not hitting their numbers, especially on the SaaS side. Very high attrition rates and overall, cloud products not market ready. Internal processes are driving lots of internal conflict and frustration."
good,"I worked at Responsys before the Oracle buy out. The culture was fun, I got to learn a lot from my colleagues but once the buy out happened everything changed. There wasn't much in terms of growth opportunities unless you were best friends with management. There were rarely any new learning opportunities and everything was basically ""Figure it out"". Year after year of promised promotions or increases that never happened. I was sad to leave because I did make some friends there but my career was stagnant."
good,"Too many leaders have come and gone in the sales organization, all the way to the top of the division leader.  3 or 4 people in lead in 2-3 years, 4-5 US VPs of Sales in 2-3 years and on and one to Manager and ASM/Salesperson level.   Turnover has hurt the institutional knowledge.  Likely will be reorganized soon, (or maybe recently) into another division."
good,"It is an ok place to work. It is hard to transfer to different departments, no raises, no real advancement, unlimited sick time, to many people to actually make a difference. Hiring process takes an extremely long time."
good,"Oracle does not give pay increase. They automated their renewal process meanwhile telling employees not to worry about their jobs."
good,"Oracle is very dynamic organization which has really benefited me in many ways. The new technologies and the advancement of R&D are amazing. "
good,"Oracle is a great resume builder, but you definitely do not want to stay here more than a few years. There are a lot of tenured employees, and I am concerned for them. It is hard to get things done, laden with processes, virtually impossible to get promoted, zero chance of getting a raise. Oracle does not seem to care about it's employees. There are zero perks whatsoever outside of standard health benefits. Everyone has an ancient laptop that barely functions. The NYC offices are bleak. There's a reason Oracle is seen as a boring, antiquated database company, because it operates like one."
good,"I'm sure that a lot of enterprise sales organisations are similar, but the unrealistic, old-school and bullying mentality of the middle to senior management was a joke."
good,"Oracle is a large company composed of many recent and not so recent acquisitions.  As such, there is no one consistent company culture. This makes the company an exciting and challenging place to work, but it is not appropriate for those who value stability above experience ."
good,"The plat form is good ,to start your career.If you can work here  there will be no problem in any other company."
good,"Oracle is not a marketing leader; in fact, they aren't even really a fast-follower.  As such, it can be difficult to build a career here, particularly if you work in a vertical market unit, which receives very little love from corporate marketing."
good,"good company, employee friendly, attended much training and learned many things. enjoyable part of the job very fewer restrictions hardest part is working in night shift"
good,"Balance work/life,"
good,"The first years was good, I worked with bright fun people and felt my career was advancing.Life in the Oracle Fusion division was not rewarding. It was very stressful and I couldn't use my skills effectively. "
good,"Oracle reputation has always been great, I loved working with Oracle until I worked for Oracle. I've helped friends get into Oracle who no longer want to be my friend. Does that say something about Oracle!"
good,Frat boy culture and demanding management. Changed focus and managers frequently. Fast paced and disorganized. If you're right out of college it is a place to start. Great benefits package
good,"Oracle Corporation is an American multinational computer technology corporation, headquartered in Redwood Shores, California. The company specializes primarily in developing and marketing database software and technology, cloud engineered systems and enterprise software products — particularly its own brands of database management systems. In 2015, Oracle was the second-largest software maker by revenue, after Microsoft.[4]"
good,"Worked with every talented engineers. It required constantly learning new applications to perform excellent job. Oracle has very good Medical Health Insurance. "
good,"Exciting and engaging engineering environment, especially in the"
good,"Work pressure is more. personal life imbalance. no salary hike every year."
good,I loved my job and my manager. Most of the rest of the manager I reported to I personally wouldn't hire. Layoffs are common. Some groups are better than others.
good,Very stressful place to work. Not enough vacation time.  Management is sub-par.  Not a stable place to work.  No room for advancement within the department that you work in.
good,"They are generally pretty decent with good balance work life, decent salary but they do not reward loyalty, more money can be received else where. overal nice place to be though"
good,"Surprising number of inexperienced, ineffective first-line managers. Each group enforced different rules about norms such as working from home, core hours on premise.  Corporate strategy not clearly communicated or implemented. Forced acquired (diverse) business to adopt unresponsive, inflexible corporate systems."
good,"Hired onto Responsys before acquisition by Oracle. Once Oracle bought us out, the RSUs bonus was great. However, a lot of internal team tools, day-to-day operations, raises and promotions became too corporate and made it very hard to advance. Your voice seems to get lost and management was terrible. Over promising and under delivers - CONSTANTLY!"
good,Not the best place to grow your career. Lack of promotions. Salaries increase is limited. Technology outdated.  Depends on the group you are in. Manager's are lay back.
good,"From Oracle i learnt a lot, but i feel i can learn more from oracle in other organisations.I want the work should be standard as technically.So i need an opportunity outside of the oracle world with oracle technologies."
good,"Very hard to move up, even with excellent yearly reviews. The people are great, but not a strong workplace culture. I wish there were stronger leadership in management roles."
good,"Pros:"
good,There the management is going for products not for projects. They need to complete the work but they are not ready to pay to the employees. They are not ready to take new experienced employees to lead the team. There the management takes all the original certificates and will take a signed bond from us for 2 years excluding  3 months notice period.
good,Great company to work and gave an opportunity to scale my skills on SAAS offerings. It took lot of time to analyze the target market for the SAAS solutions.
good,"Great exposure. Multi Faceted role. "
good,"A company that has little interest in its people. No chance for advancement or for creativity. Very strict environment. A lot of talk and marketing, but very little in the way of delivery."
good,"They went cheaper and cheaper, so now, SPARC hardware is a far cry from was in the past. Then, just fire the senior engineer, to contract chaaper new people."
good,Collaboration is difficult among the different teams in the enterprise
good,Good benefits and flexibility as long as you start out with a solid salary.  You will not get a raise and you will never know how long you will stay even if you are a solid performer
good,The higher management is partial and prefers favouritism. No yearly increment so one should negotiate well at the time of hiring.
good,"Good company to start once carrer, you have wider expousure to learn , less oppurtunities to grow within the organisation"
good,"Start the day with running backlog report and load allocation for team."
good,Good time to work with my team. The team is very supportive and fun to work with. Too many processes created slowing down on work otherwise its good environment
good,Empresa com alto nivel de stress. dificuldade para manter equilibrio work and life.
good,"I have been at Oracle for almost  Years now. It is highly Production and Objective Oriented Organization. Not a fun place to work. But, there is a great opportunity to learn while working at Oracle."
good,"Too large, shark waters, consulting not well thought of within the organization.  Too high of turnover at the top of Consulting."
good,Being my first job in Ireland it was a very good company to work for if it didnt close down at that time i would still be working for them.Very good company to work for.
good,"Learned web services and feature designing,"
good,Very difficult to obtain salary increases/stock options/bonuses for working hard toward corporate goals.  Individuals are not valued unfortunately.  Oracle is so rigid in how they deal with customers that it is frustrating because I cannot feel as though I really make a difference as a customer advocate.
good,"We have more than 50 people team,We have coordinate with each other to fix the issue. Daily we are facing lot of issues on storage.Team work must be present in everywhere.So we have done a good job in oracle"
good,Oracle is an aggressive sales driven organization.  Employees are well compensated for achieving goals.
good,"- Territories that overlap"
good,"Managing, communicating and getting things done mark the most of the day with add-on's of Meetings and next assignments which needs to get ready"
good,"Only Oracle technologies are allowed. Management does not listen/understand the problems and likes to be in 1950 technology where ADF is the king"
good,"A rotina de trabalho é tranquila. Há um grande respeito entre as pessoas. O nível de satisfação também é alto, uma vez que a empresa investe muito em benefícios e ações de qualidade de vida no trabalho. O meu aprendizado nessa empresa foi mais limitado, tendo em vista que, na época, eu não tinha maturidade suficiente para idealizar um propósito de crescimento pessoal e profissional. Mesmo assim, pude aprender algumas coisas como manusear o programa Excel, por exemplo."
good,Expect to spend all your time on the road. No local contracts at that time.
good,"Work only when you want to...Great! lots of fun, employees not to friendly, but fans are great!. Management team are good. Meet a lot of pro ball players. Great as a second job."
good,From Quarter to Quarter; Bunch of Products yet to be integrated!!
good,"The immediate managers do care about their underlings, but once you climb a few steps on the ladder it's all about that profit margin. The tedious aspects of the job are expected for Project Management, but Oracle is big enough to be slow at a lot of things you wouldn't expect. Also - the people working in the field with customers are of course not compensated enough for their time and expertise. We lost people constantly to this."
good,"Can you say political?  You have to worry about internal issues far more than you have to worry about the actual competition.   Either people are trying to help, and create wins, or they are busy stabbing others in the back, vying for that next position.   When its working right, an amazing place to work.  But be careful of the political undertow.   And I've heard the culture is worse now than it was then."
good,"It seems like people at the top are fight for more power and in doing so have used the lower level employees as collateral, Upper management is more concerned with checking boxes than actually supporting its employees. The employees are nice and get along very well its mainly management which is the issue. Oracle seems to be trying to redefine its position in the SaaS application market, amazon has taken alot of the technology market share."
good,"When I was there, not much career growth or compensation updates. "
good,"Within the right role at Oracle you can find a great company culture and other people around you with great ambition to succeed. However, as with any big company there is a high chance of having a bad experience with management or peers. There is also frequent extreme organizational changes (I've seen 3 in 1.5 years) which do cause concerns for job security."
good,"I feel Oracle needs to compensate and value those who have tenner with the company.  Without this, they lose many of the finest people. I feel full time remote work should come back as well."
good,"The young engineers were fun to work with and my boss was a good guy. Ever since Oracle bought out Sun Microsystems, there seems to be some lingering resentment left over from the acquisition. This is especially true with the employees who were there before the acquisition."
good,"Pros:"
good,"Tech stack is really old and most of the work was sustainable engineering (maintenance of old and bulky software). Also, most of the support team is not at all co-operative."
good,"Promotion is tough. Hikes are slow and minimal. Flexibility is good. Oracle is slow to incorporating new technologies. They have a pool of customers who they support, who are already deep into using thier technologies."
good,Nice experience to work at Oracle. Though interview process was very time consuming. Whatever difficulty level and technology they asked in interview process is not present in the real work.
good,"I found my time at Oracle to be very stressful. The organization I was with was on a certain path for disaster, but the company does not seek to utilize the employees elsewhere. Getting up to speed with corporate systems and policies were self-service, which did not ensure proper knowledge of how to use the systems. That and always knowing that the next lay off might be the one that nabbed me."
good,"Great people, good company, competitive salary and benefits. I ended up there through the Sun Microsystems aquisition and they are ever so slowly winding that down to nothing. Getting long in the tooth..."
good,It's a good place to get technical background with good benefits but they do not give raises over the long haul. Your initial salary will be your long term salary regardless of your work quantity and quality.
good,"OK company, you must understand the organization and the expectation upon entry. No to do so will lead to disappointment over time. Access to educational resources is excellent."
good,The sales culture is unlike any that I've seen. They have multiple reps tied to each account and each one competes to get the client's budget. There were a lot of internal obstacles with selling to customers within Oracle.
good,"It's a well known fact that Admin Assistants at Oracle are paid less than industry average.  They are overlooked for raises year after year, but are the glue that holds a department together."
good,"It pays OK, just make sure your starting salary is something you like because there will be no pay raise at all no matter how many years you have been there, be ready to have very little vacation as they are known to give you vacation hours but will not approve them, there are not advancement for your career. Other than that it's just OK."
good,"Like all large organizations that I've been part of, my satisfaction at work has depended on both the team I've been on and the org's leadership. I'm on a great team."
good,"Self-service is key while working or getting anything done here."
good,"Oracle is a company where you drive your own destiny, sometimes. Change is a constant since Oracle's focus and mission and incentives directly drive behaviors. Sales teams are still behind the times and forces downward pressure on other teams to carry their objectives. Product base is diverse but needs maturing albeit progressing slowly in the right direction. Work life balance is somewhat non existent and heavy reliance on middle to individual contributors who are often neglected in promotions . High turnover rates in sales and architecture space so career advancements are difficult to come by. At Oracle you control your own destiny which is a pro and con. Management lacks core leadership skills (especially in sales) and transparency when it comes to hard questions or unknowns. However, great learning place and to drive innovation which at times gets you noticed if the timing is right."
good,"Oralce is a well recognised technology company, however for the sales person you will commonly be frustrated with internal politics and a culture of 'us vs them' with clients. Regularly clients have a negative perspective of Oracle due to previous negative experiences. "
good,"Multinacional agressiva, que recompensa aqueles que atingem os resultados desejados."
good,Things are getting better but not great compared to lot many other bay area companies. It still uses lot of proprietary technologies instead of open source but its getting there. Management is not that great but not all are equal.. some are awesome too
good,"Poor management"
good,"Tough environment but a good place to learn all the tricks of the trade here. Management style typically micromanagement, especially if you're slightly behind your number."
good,Company was great until Oracle bought it. This company is a powerhouse in the industry as long as you understand you are nothing more than a number. Soo sad.
good,"A empresa te dá boas condições de auto aprendizagem, no entanto a sua vida profissional, pelo menos na consultoria, consome todo o seu tempo, restando muito pouco tempo para atividades de desenvolvimento pessoal e lazer."
good,"Management has no clear idea of what to do in Cloud business, they keep acquiring companies and do not know what to do with them. Good work life balance."
good,The work life balance seems very sad at that place.  Management mostly are not bothered about the ESAT of the employees.  Work place culture is not very promoting.
good,"Hard to understand the lack of promotions, cost of living increases or raises when executives are still gaining massive bonuses.  Veterans opportunities, but, don't get your hopes up for working there if you are not in the top of your class and from a prestigious university.  They will work hard to get you in the door, once you are in, layoffs are real, so are pay freezes, hiring freezes and department restructuring.  Hard place to try and retire, unless you own the company."
good,"Good work life balance"
good,Oracle's sales organization is poorly structured; there are too many sales reps contacting the same accounts. Communication internally between sales teams can be politically-fueled and hostile when involving a shared account or deal cycle. Sales Reps are trained to hide their deals from the other Sales Reps to protect them from being monopolized.
good,The project I was in was not so good for work life balance. I appreciate the good salary and compensations. But that's not all life is all about. Project Managers should be more flexible when it comes to remote working.
good,"There is not much innovation. But with the constant new mergers, there is a chance to learn about new technologies. But most of the job is maintaining status quo. There is a lot of new college grad recruitment in lieu of experienced staff. "
good,"The company offers excellent training for every job available and as workplace culture, they offer all resources in order to help employees learn as much as possible. It is not easy to advance or to change position or department. Communication is slow especially on the approval matrix and rules are quite rigid for such a fast-paced work environment.Salary is non negotiable after becoming an employee. Management depends on the department and location of the office but being on time or having the proper attire has not ever been an issue. The company prefers to educate and train their own staff and tailor every employee to fit the job but mostly a new employee would depend on the colleagues to really be good and quickly be able to take over the job. Team spirit is very important but personal ambitions are a must if your goal is to climb the company ladder."
good,Good place to work with work life balance but Management should take care of employee benefits also so People can take intrest in their job and they can put extra effort also
good,"Land a good salary from the beginning because raise are low. Many  perks were stripped down since year 2000 like : stock option plan, Co rebates and pc purchase plans."
good,"I was working for a company that got bought out by Oracle. The transition period was awful, management was lost. We were on our own, very little support and training was provided, a bit of the ""sink or swim"" mentality."
good,"The onboarding process was a little confusing and could have been smoother. Communication from direct management was lacking at times. However, there was always a variety of projects to work on and contribute to. Unfortunately, feedback was not as frequent as one would hope. You essentially wear all hats from start to finish."
good,"Usual Corporate culture       "
good,"Slow paced and then fire drills out of nowhere. little to no training or mentor-ship."
good,"Not employee oriented, employees are disposable if company goals change. Oracle is a software company and killed the hardware part of the company because of poor leadership."
good,Esta empresa es líder global en su industria. Prefiero manifestarme sobre ella en un contexto deferente al de esta sección en INDEED.
good,Their management and work place culture is not good.  All manager are not kind of treating their co-workers. Managers yelled in the meeting and all saying bad words.
good,"Overall the company is a great opportunity as they have a great suite of products and strong brand recognition in the marketplace. The biggest issue is navigating internal politics and procedures as there are a myriad of forms, systems, legal docs, etc. that employees have to navigate in a self service fashion that can be exceedingly frustrating for new employees and for employees of companies they acquire (which is a lot),. This creates artificial barriers to success that slow down sales and create friction with clients."
good,"Large company allows lots of connections with people in different parts of the organization as well as throughout the world."
good,"J'ai beaucoup appris durant ces 12 années : autonomie, rigueur, méthode de travail"
good,"Not good, management sucks, they need to step up and be professional. Company is big but managers are not behaving in professional manner. They keep things secret."
good,"Oracle is fine as a stop gap employer but the company expects its workers to put it before family or anything else.  For someone who is young and ambitious, it's a good stepping stone but a difficult place to remain long-term."
good,"Cut throat environment for sales. If you went too far over goal, you were re-goaled after year-end. And making your annual goal was no guarantee of job security when layoffs happened."
good,I worked remote out of my house. We had your typical team calls once or twice a week. The team got together a few time quarter for QBR's and team building events in the Mid Atlantic and in the South East.
good,"Felt my immediate work group was not inclusive, was not particularly diverse and did not seem to desire to be diverse.  Could have been an isolated experience."
good,"Good Place to work. Limited Growth Prospects. No challenges in work as its a routine and regular work. Work life balance is there. Process is streamlined."
good,It was an interesting place to work.  A lot was expected of you.  However there were a lot of nice smart people working there.  The benefits were very good.
good,"Everyone is too busy working 2 - 3 others duties, unable to take any new training."
good,To much stress because of not enoup head counts in my group. Most of the job in our group in Financial Management System was moved to India and China. Working long hours here in US to conduct meetings with other groups in China and India.
good,"I'm really enjoy work for Oracle. Good benefits, health insurance. Very clear management directions. However, sometimes due to some business reasons Oracle RIFed engineers and sales..."
good,"It is a large process heavy organisation. The work culture is very boring with very little job security and growth prospects."
good,Excellent workplace. Slow learning curve for voracious learners. Good place to settle down. Work hours for a developer are pretty flexible. You will surely have a great time
good,"A very quiet reception job role with zero administration work. Mainly meet and greet of the clients. Plenty of benefits to chose from, the restaurants within the buildings have restaurants (although this does add up and become expensive). Friendly employees, 1 hour lunch breaks with 2x 15min tea breaks."
good,"Choose carefully which domain of Oracle you are joining and which team you will be joining."
good,there is very less work and no hike is there there are no appraisals good work life balance its like a govt job.do not expect too much from it if u want easy life then do it there is not much learning
good,"Of course Oracle is a big Company that so many people dream to work there, and yes I am one too. As for the management, it is more self-management. Workplace culture is good."
good,"consulting requires a lot of travel, no life work balance. no yearly pay increase.  There is a very good collaboration between employees, good team work.  not many growth opportunities. Company is focused more on sale versus technology"
good,Nothing to add about working at this company. They do not ever provide raises or treat employees as assets. Many of the people I worked with left the company and then came back to get a raise in pay.
good,"I started to 'Break Bad' while working here. So excited on the front-end but so limited when reality set in. I could not innovate, no one had any authority, duplication of efforts, just a real sour place to be. Since being laid off my family has started to notice that the real ""me"" is coming back to life and everyone who knows me is very happy I no longer work at Oracle. "
good,"Experiences at Oracle vary widely across the organization strictly based on what product you land up working on and your management chain."
good,"After being acquired by Oracle, many in our company were optimistic. Working for one of the largest IT companies in the world couldn't be all that bad. We thought we would gain tons of new clients. Unfortunately, after 3 years, new client prospects seemed to dry up, as did our work load."
good,"Oracle makes your feel like a woody, the forgotten toy, if you're not a shiny new developer.  Management and communication are lacking. Only pay increase in over 3 years was a bonus, based on the long hours I was putting in."
good,"Typical ASIC engineering job which involved design, verfication and physical design, Not particularly fun place to work at but typical old style silicon valley company,"
good,"Executive leadership recognizes the level of attrition and costs associated with the ""shift to the cloud"" and are trying to fix it.  Changing entrenched culture by hiring massive amounts of millennials has been painful to experience and the company is incurring a lot of tangible and intangible costs due to poor recruiting, communication, leadership and an enormous velocity of change.  I am a returning employee to Oracle and have not seen a merit increase since my return five years ago...a common occurrence across the company.   Humility, pay increases, overtly managing change and good leadership are important to me so I'm looking outside the company for my next position."
good,Good for recruiters if they want to learn end to end recruitment and earn good incentives. Fixed salary is very less and not much to expect on career advancement.
good,"Good company, good environment great company to start for a fresher good and productive environment overall.Clean and environment friendly good atmosphere"
good,"Depending on your department or Line of Business:"
good,"Experience and satisfaction of working here depends highly on the product line/group working for and the role you have."
good,"Oracle is a good company to work for. "
good,"On an average Oracle is a great company to start off your career with , loads of technology around and great minds"
good,"Typical day at work includes checking emails, sending emails, calling accounts, and connecting on LinkedIn with people you'd like to meet with. I learned how to work in a corporate setting, and communicating with people of all ages. My co-workers,"
good,"Oracle Corp. is a major IT vendor that got its start in relational databases ... This definition is part of our Essential Guide: Relational database ..Oracle Database is an object-relational database management system produced and marketed ..... Apart from the clearly defined database options, Oracle databases may include many semi-autonomous software sub-system."
good,"I am a resource mgmt professional with 12 years of experience, and looking for opportunities that will enhance growth and learning."
good,"The individual people are fun. A lot of politics and games involved.The day to day is a typical sales job. Cold calling, emails, linkedin, sales reports  and deal reviews."
good,"Good work life balance & good facilities given ! Young co-workers & lots of outings . Quarter end are hardest - Rest days are OK work , not too much."
good,"Oracle is well known and almost every large enterprise runs their database. The company is known for being very expensive, aggressive, and does not play well with others."
good,"Offerta molto ampia e competitiva, elevata competizione interna come consueto in aziende USA, self service company"
good,"Good place for freshers in terms of language specialist."
good,"I enjoy working at Oracle but I am not challenged. Because it is such a large company, new changes take place very slowly and Oracle hasn't adopted the modern-tech-company culture yet... looks like they never will. They are a slow, boring corporate machine."
good,"Short commute to the office at home"
good,"Management, Management practices, work culture, Monetary benefits is not up-to the expectations."
good,"average in terms of work culture."
good,"Since Oracle bought my previous employer, much of the opportunity for development has been cut back.  Programmers have new jobs to do with no training in how to do them."
good,Customer facing discovery calls and application demonstrations. Strategic account planning. Eloqua marketing campaigns.
good,"Meetings, rootcasue analysis of the issues, get issues resolved in time, present staus to executive management. "
good,Numbers driven and closures ASAP. hiring for north america india operations. Campus and job fairs. Decent and friendly workplace.
good,Love the retail part of the company. Love to work with different retailers face to face.  Coworkers are fun people to be around. Oracle is a good company to work for.
good,"A usual day at work for me includes coming in to office, having a quick meeting with my team to review the tasks of the day and workload pending in queue."
good,"Fun place to work,Monotonous reports,KRA are not reasonable"
good,Not the greatest company to work for. Management does not take care of there employees. Co-workers were great to work with.
good,I'm always be thankful to be given an opportunity to join Oracle Malaysia because it's being one of the largest IT company in world and it is once in a lifetime chance. I took up the role as Admin Executive in assisting General Manager of one of sales team within the company doing administration work. It was a contract basis job and one of the reason I left is because i would like to have a more secure job in future.
good,"Helped in stabilizing & streamlining new process – 1st Pilot Project in Oracle GFIC"
good,"Job work/life balance is ok, "
good,"Na"
good,"Oracle was described to me recently as more like a utility company than a tech company and that sums it up pretty well. There are bright, talented people who are working on innovative ideas, but they're not the majority."
good,good company to work for but Human resources Dept and Higher management can take better care for employees
good,"The best part of oracle is flexible work environment and working from anywhere. It does not mater from where you are working as long as the work is getting delivered."
good,From the time i started working every year i am getting high Rating(4) but there are not giving postion & salary.
good,Its a good company to work with as far as learning new things/skills are concern but at the same Oracle has been loosing its Ethic values which used to be its USP few years back.
good,"If you like working for a huge company that acquires smaller companies and dumps their workers, this will not be an issue. My smaller company was acquired by Oracle, and I survived 7 rounds of layoffs over the years because of ""economic downsizing"". Every day I woke up with a constant anxious feeling, wondering if I would have my job. Getting laid off by Oracle was the best thing that ever happened to me."
good,"Meetings, planning & presentations is a typical day at work"
good,"Oracle is so large that it depends on the line of business in which you find yourself employed. Some lines of business have a great balance between work life and home life, while others are full throttle all the time with no chance to feel as though you are getting anything accomplished unless you are working 60 hours per week."
good,"Oracle has some of the best people I've ever had the pleasure to work with, however, Oracle is a difficult place to navigate and there is definitely a difference between acquisition cultures and original Oracle. This is not a 'touchy feely' company and all key decisions happen at the GVP level (management with over 2000 employees). With that said love working at Oracle, no place is perfect, but the passion and drive or the people at Oracle in infectious."
good,"It is a good company to work for, it was my first full time corporate job. I are crossed trained in the different work areas of each facilities staff members jobs so that we will never miss a beat when one is out. We fully implemented working as a team."
good,"The workplace culture is fairly relaxed and flexible. Work from home supported. Ample opportunity to learn."
good,"Oracle is a behemoth company with all the benefits that usually come with it: excellent health, dental, vision, life and pet insurance, matching 401k, education assistance, parental leave, unlimited vacation time etc. Still, most of the people on my team moved on before their 2-year anniversary with the company, the majority to other companies. There was simply no where to go from this position and you'll learn what you can from the role within a year or two. As with most email development jobs, it can be monotonous without the ability to cross train or diversify your day-to-day and it was impossible to do that in Oracle's structure. There were no raises in the three years I worked there."
good,There was limited opportunity to learn from management and/or mentors. It's a fend-for-yourself type of work environment with little opportunity to move up the latter.
good,"Software work was interesting. People were great to work with. However, the division in which I worked was not growing and ultimately, much of the work was transferred overseas."
good,"Solid place to start your career if you value good pay and benefits, but the size of the company makes it difficult to foster effective management that encourages growth and support"
good,"Good place overall.  Until this year they provided no annual merit increases or bonus.  They expected you to negotiate a high salary initially, but they didn't tell you that.  I went four years without a raise.  Management very much depends on the team you are on, and the divisions DO NOT talk to each other."
good,"Great products and training.  Expectations is to exceed your quota which I did.  Hard to get a raise.  Some really smart and good people work there."
good,"Large multinational with a global controllers group (High level value added finance) team in Dublin looking after all areas of EMEA finance.  Many nationalities and may challenges to Finance from month end, statutory accounting to mergers and acquisitions"
good,I was allowed to work predominantly from home. When I was in the office or in for a team lunch the atmosphere was up-beat. The people were great. Compensation package was good.
good,"A good environment, I can give it 7 out of 10. The benefits are very good (Medical 100% covered for you, your spouse and 2 of your children - Gym)."
good,"Engineering team and low level management are all great people, but upper management does not care about workers. Don't even think of getting promoted, raises over the inflation rate are rare."
good,"Good work life balance,flexible working environment,you can work independently, couple of things which are not professional are :  Career growth  depends on some one else discretion and they were given as favors and not followed with  professional recognition."
good,"Inside sales is never great but the training program offered by Oracle was excellent. Two months learning the products, business management, and sales techniques applicable to the role."
good,"Being employed at Oracle is challenging.  With the move to the cloud, during the last two years, hundreds of employees were laid off (including consultants who were on billable on-premise implementations.)  "
good,Product manager has no voice about what the product should be.  It's a bottle up the organization.  New features are decided by engineers and a lot of time not what the customers want.
good,"a workplace with good infrastructure and but work is with no learning, no hikes and motivation. i prefer not to join oracle. they are working on very old generation tools and technologies."
good,Would be a great place to sell if operations had less say on sales territories. Also if managers and reps were allowed to cultivate their territories for longer than 12 months I believe this would drastically improve the sales velocity.
good,"Flexible and balance remote field sales environment.  Compensation is fair, but selling environment between organizations is cannibalistic and upward mobility is not existent depending on organization. Late to the cloud game has put the company in a defensive position."
good,"A nivel global todos reclaman lo mismo, el mismo sueldo por años y no te dejan crecer. Si presentas renuncia, aunque seas el mejor te abren la puerta en vez de querer mantenerte."
good,"Oracle would be a great place to work for new graduates, they get grilled and thrown to the lions to learn and pretty much fend for themselves. However, for experienced individuals, Oracle may not be the best place to work due to lack of advancement/promotions."
good,why we have to have a review? what's the point? it is ok but not a great place to growth. it is just a place to work and you may quite or they ask you to quite.
good,"Typical Day"
good,"Coordinating with clients and stakeholders analyze, validate business requirements and ensure the requirements are discussed with the appropriate team to implement the change in systems."
good,"Best technology resources and engineering vision"
good,Oracle Corporation has a good team atmosphere.  Team members are willing to assist you when required.   I believe some of the management is  in over their heads and incapable of helping you advance in you career
good,"If you want full time employment here apply for a permanent position, don't come in as a temp hoping to be converted.  Temporary employees are expendable and not give much consideration as part of the Oracle family.  I was loyal to a fault and was thrown out like trash."
good,I would say Oracle has good environment where we get to learn a lot digging deeper into the product. But the management does not seem to have the priority make the job simpler. They working day and night to complicate your job. Keep measuring against metrics which is complicates the attitude and work life of the engineer. Hope we get a leader that will see this comment and ask his reportees to look at ways to simplify work.
good,Good Company to work for if you agree on changing your responsibilities every year with doubling your working hours and lack of security.
good,"After 20 years of service, I was laid off.  My replacement was in India and I had trained him to take my place.  My manager was great and so was my co-workers."
good,Bei Oracle gibt es ganz viele super nette und hilfsbereite Kollegen.
good,"During my 21 years with the company, i learned a lot and earned respect from my colleague. Helping people with their issue is always my priority. I continue to expand my knowledge by communicating to different groups and learned from them. The company pushed us to take extra classes that helps us in our daily task."
good,"I worked at home a lot. I never met my final team at Oracle face to face. Too much time on conference calls. Management decided to adopt a ""policy"" of not giving raises or bonuses."
good,Typical IT shop. Little or no training or financial incentive. Consistent turnover. Overly budget conscious for a huge corporation. Short stay to gain particular software experience is recommended.
good,"Company’s strenght is the complete solution, but sales model does not support that mission.  Channel conflict creates confusion and lack of trust and collaboration"
good,"You will fall through the cracks. No one really cares about you. I went 6 months without a manager. Very hard to advance unless you get very lucky. Benefits were nice and you probably won't be overworked. Don't plan on staying long unless you get a great patch, a great product, or both."
good,You will learn a lot at Oracle and be exposed to many people and personalities which will help you grow.   Management in Canada was quite poor and career mobility is very limited.
good,"Excelente empresa, mi única inconformidad fue la cultura organizacional que obliga a vivir para trabajar."
good,"Worked at Oracle (2 years) as Customer Success Manager, which is a fancy industry term for Account Management.  "
good,"Oracle is a self service company. You have to drown or swim right from the start. The internal competition between the Red Stack is frustrating. "
good,"Oracle has a lot of great people and managers, but there is a disconnect within their sales org between the field and inside sales team.  If you don't mind having to watch your back at all times, it's the place for you.  "
good,"The buy companies and let go people; it is a trend."
good,Oracle is more concerned with the current bottom line than the quality of the product. Management is actively moving jobs offshore by laying off more experienced workers in the US and hiring offshore.
good,Disingenuous corporate drones.  Was not a very inspiring place to work.  A lot of pretentious and elitist employees.  Their products are sub par.  A lot of rude employees that are entitled.
good,"The hardest part of the job is constant changes in business process. Difficult to stay on track if the business process for specific LOB consistently changes. The most stress part of the job is during quarter end. Instead of quality, it appears the focus is also speed. I think at times it is difficult to do both diligently. In addition to the business processes, long hours, mandatory overtime to include weekends, and escalations to quickly release a contract, can cause burnout. Don't get me wrong, the company tries to improve, but sometimes doesn't always succeed.  I think certain people are overlooked for growth and opportunities. I believe managers have room for improvement especially managers who have never managed before."
good,The professionalism of the other reps and my manager at Oracle were impeccable. It is also a great place to learn true Enterprise Sales Skills. I learned a lot that will help advance my career.
good,"I really don't have much of a review to offer here.  My employment at Oracle ended many years ago, and I simply don't recall much now.  Sorry about that."
good,"Oracle tried to get their standards in Oracle India Pvt Ltd, Unfortunately operations departments failed to get the system into the company hence the total work condition is not good for a fresher to join and even lower level managers do not have an idea about organizational structure."
good,Oracle is good pay master but has high pressure jobs. Competition within the organization is high thus productivity and preformance is monitored minutely.
good,"Could work on projects for months compared to smaller companies . UX was very research focused, didn't see much visual design importance. Complex UI issues but approved solutions felt antiquated"
good,"company with good benefits, but.... very micro management, so much its hard to get anything done."
good,"Oracle is a great company... It offers stability but career advancement opportunities are limited..."
good,"no true account control, can be upward of 100+ sales reps calling into a single account, crm system lacks factual information because all of the reps protect their contacts and open opportunities."
good,"Good benefits that were subsidized (but not covered 100%)  by Oracle. Company culture does not make the customer experience a priority. Depending on your particular group, you may be able to work remotely. New ""unlimited vacation"" policy starting which is fine - IF you have a good manager and are good at managing your workload."
good,"Oracle as a company is good and fun to work at, unless you have managers who follow service based companies mentality and look forward to implement such culture here."
good,Benefits package for employees are average to low.  Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems back in 2010 so I never applied to Oracle directly and probably would not have applied on my own.
good,"o	Always acting in a professional manner and with absolute discretion."
good,"- good place to work if you're looking for a relaxed culture"
good,"High turnover.......................A lot of stress for the sales team. Extremely competitive and cut throat. If you have over 15 years experience in sales, you may do well."
good,"interesting work.. good work environment, poor management,highly competitive, flexible working hours, politics, lack of leadership from the top, poor treatment of employees"
good,"	Managing the Global Order Management in Order to Cash Ops for Cloud & License LOBs."
good,"Super large company, your just an number,I worked with very talented people but management is poor. Oracle left all of Sun's manages in place, Sun was self destructing why would you leave everything the same and expect different results?"
good,"Stressful work environment. "
good,"A typical working day starts from 9:30 and ends around 5:00. Occasionally have to work over time or during the weekend."
good,"Technology OK;"
good,"Oracle is a great place to get trained. Because of their full stack you will have the chance to work in application development, tech, cloud and hardware."
good,"Work Environment is good but there is no proper hikes and management is really bad. "
good,"Good work life balance, no advancement in career. The work environment is not too strict, you can balance it well with your free time. But there is no monetary benefit."
good,"Once upon a time, Oracle was not a bad place to work.  Times have changed, and the security in our position has all but evaporated.  Three years of layoffs and you find yourself wondering when the next shoe will drop."
good,"it is not stable. i think it is not a good choice to work for Oracle."
good,Everything is in your manager's hand. The Group of old timer managers will keep you out of everything. Not a place where you want to use your own head.
good,"Oracle has an excellent team of employees who are always willing to help.  People tend to put the greater good above their own needs.  When possible, the company tries to provide a good work/life balance.  "
good,"* Typical Day: Review backlog, attend scrum meetings, attend customer/partner meetings, align/nurture internal/external teams and stakeholders, review metrics/roadmap for product success, etc."
good,"Legacy IT company that's making the slow transition from being the serotypical traditional on-premise company to a young hip Cloud startup with a full offering of SaaS, PaaS & IaaS products.  "
good,"Some days the best job ever, other days the worst job ever. However, the glory days are long gone, now its just squeeze the base for what it can. God help anyone who is tasked with bringing in new logos"
good,"I was hired as a Technology Sales Manager, and quickly realized I had no viable territory, and that the vast majority of the other sales people on my team were not meeting their quota. I have no idea why they hired me, and I left."
good,"The salary is good for the effort you put in so work/life balance is really good, but the culture is tough since your performance doesn't depend entirely on you."
good,"I like this company but I had a bad experience with many changes in management and compensation. The company provides a ton of upside and career advancement but this was not a positive experience for me.  However, I would work there again."
good,Good work life balance......Slow growth rate.......bad politics......Less hike.....Senior Management interacts very less with employees
good,"A Oracle é uma multinacional de TI, de alto nível. Bastante exigente e de cultura forte."
good,"What you learned: "
good,"good in terms of job security, but management is typical. no work life balance."
good,"In general Oracle is still a decent company to work for, most of the people are still able to maintain a good work/life balance, but it is also group by group, I would say Engineering and Product Development at Software side are reasonable, HW and Ops is not very pleasant at this moment."
good,"It is manager oriented company, atlas the department/team I was working at, I have couple of good managers and the work place was fun and good and couple of managers who were unhappy all the time and nothing can be done about it, pay wise just forget the hike and all this company is bit rigid on this part there are people working on same salary for a decade and more, the benefits are good and other perks like OT for OT qualified workers etc is good and again depends entirely on the manager."
good,nice company to start for but no room for advancement. the politics are in-favored highly here. It takes a long time to hit quotas and everything depends on your territory. Management is very unrealistic.
good,"Oracle is good company to work with, it all depends all your lead for all your progress, you don't get a chance to speak or show your talents, achievement to higher management without your lead"
good,"--> Most of the days were busy and occupied"
good,except for better work life balance . nothing is great about this company to work for . compensation and recognition happens very rarely. i strongly feel this is not employee centric company
good,Work culture at Oracle is really nice. Employees are allowed to prioritize they work as per individuals schedule. Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop.
good,"Good career growth"
good,Oracle Offers a great place for Any induvidual to excel  and sharpen their skills It has one of the most matured managements . It probably  lacks in job stability
good,"Co-Workers and Job security is good @ Oracle. We can learn more like Reporting, People management, Training in Oracle."
good,"its been good experience with work, i came to know varies mindsets of colleagues , how to communicate with them, how to handle the individual depend upon situation for fulfilling the business needs."
good,"Ok work life balance."
good,It's a good company to begin your carrer with and lots can be learned here which will help us grow professionally.
good,"Good place for start ups. "
good,"Overall great work/life experience. We build all business from the scratch, there were no clients, no previous sales, nothing. Work involved lots of cold calling, constant focus on lead generation and finding new work opportunities - very interesting and challenging. Although the work atmosphere was very bad as well as very poor management, met many great professional people and learned a lot."
good,"1. Learning never ends."
good,"Developing new BI Leads from territory / non-named account segment in specified territory"
good,"Ok job, terrible pay, I learned how to evaluate problems and solve them. Boss were always cool but they knew how terrible pay was and how much job required people to do each day with standing for hours without snacks, in hot big clothes, in sun. I still did job whatever they asked. Enjoyable part of job was attending football/baseball/basketball games for free. But still couldn't watch them because job description."
good,"A lovely palce to work!"
good,"most of the employee stick to oracle due to NSA night shift allowance, which is 25% of your Net Sal."
good,"Work to manage any kind of work. learned application like Oracle."
good,"Can be challenging at times, but provides a solid career start and to have a Fortune 100 company on your resume."
good,I would have stayed longer if they would have provided a solid career path and more opportunities for career advancement. Work-life balance is the greatest plus
good,"Very little diversity and quite a bit large org with multi-layer management were the cons. Salary increases very little once started. "
good,"Working experience depends on the org you work for"
good,It is Good to work in Oracle. Flexibility time for work. Work Pressure as usual and we can learn  new things and get a lot of trianing and discount on certification
good,"Working at Oracle was Ok in terms of work life balance, day to day work activities. but in terms of Management i felt ignored many times as my queries was not answered on time."
good,"There is Good Scope to Learn more Devops and Oracle Cloud Infra."
good,"Direct managers have all been very flexible with personal time. They value giving their employees time off as well as a work from day per week. Financial compensation does not compete with market wages and it's very difficult to get a raise. In order to get a raise, it's almost imperative you move departments and the pay bumps are not substantial. When you start at Oracle negotiate a higher wage as it will be a longtime, if and when you receive your next raise."
good,I am satisfied with work life balance at Oracle. Mostly working for US Clients and team. Team in India is good. Techonological support is nice and good place to work
good,It all depends on hierarchy of leadership you are rolling up to. Oracle doesn't pay well. You won't see much changes in salary compensation even for a long span.
good,"We need to work in rotational shift due to which facing some health issues which is not comfortable for my work life balance."
good,"Oracle Corporation is an American multinational computer technology corporation headquartered in Redwood Shores, California. The company sells database software and technology, cloud engineered systems, and enterprise software products—"
good,Oracle has a high percentage of people working remotely which allows for great flexibility in your life.  Raises are often hard to come by so make sure you negotiate a good starting salary.  The culture really depends on the organization you work for.  I would say any organization except for OCI is a good one.  Don't work for OCI unless you can be in the Seattle or Oakland office.  Otherwise it is too clicky.
good,It is an excellent opportunity for those looking to get a start in sales. Tough work environment with long hours. Opportunity to make a large amount of money.
good,"You should know to work with different mindset people. Little dull mindset with management in India, ownership of most product lines are with other countries"
good,"Cada grupo es muy independiente y se pierde la identidad cultural de la empresa, poco respeto al path laboral y falta de estabilidad laboral."
good,I learned that I can not work at home all day. i was hired for a certain position and 2 weeks after I started the job my current boss that was building this division was fired.
good,Very well compensating sales job. Not a lot of training or career development. Quotas and sales goals are constantly increasing to unattainable numbers.
good,"massive organisation but totally self deluded that the only way is Oracle - painful redtape make getting orders quoted, processed and booked very tie consuming and awkward. Fabulous Campus in Reading and some brilliant products do not make up for the micromanagement."
good,"The company is large and split into multiple independent business units, so your experience will vary based upon which BU you work for."
good,"Great bunch of people but relentless focus on the numbers and reporting. Customer focus was less of a priority over delivering the revenue number, although with greater external competition, I think this has started to change."
good,"No typical day at work. Each workday is different. "
good,Management is very focused on getting the Gen 2 cloud running so the Oracle customer base can transition to OCI before those customers migrate to another cloud provider.
good,"Good place to work.  "
good,Great place to work.  Oracle is full of smart and motivated employees.  The ability to improve and gain exposure to good business process is available and transferrable.
good,"El café está incluído para todos (y el té, el mate, y las frutas) Los viernes se celebra y se desayuna gratis. Tu lugar de trabajo es aquel donde te sientas más cómodo ese día. Para bajar el estrés hay ping pong y metegol (también otras actividades como yoga, zumba, ...) La línea corporativa promueve la inclusión y la diversidad a todo dar. Las ideas siempre son bienvenidas. Tu lugar de trabajo lo escogés vos, ya sea en la oficina, en un café, un bar, en casa o en la juntada para el asado; para eso te pagan el internet de casa, te asignan un celular corporativo y una notebook. Las licencias son tu responsabilidad, mientras que cumplas con lo comprometido, te podés planificar a conveniencia y sin dramas. Sos libre (mientras cumplas). Aqui no hay horarios rigurosos y eso es bueno y es malo. Se supone que entras tipo 9hs y salís tipo 18hs. Cuando quieres tiempo, lo tienes. Cuando se necesita tu tiempo, lo tienen. Así que comenzás tipo 10...11hs... y terminás, bueno... vos sabrás cómo compensar tu tiempo y cuándo cerrar tu día. Por ahí un día arrancaste al mediodía desde casa porque recién te dejaron dormir a las 3 de la mañana, o arreglaste para juntarte a tus 20hs porque en el día tenés compromisos con tus pibes. Hay mucho para bajar el estrés porque cuando llega la ola, podés exigirte hasta más no poder, hasta el límite de dejarte sin vida social un buen tiempo, pero cuando baja la ola, podés pasar el día buscando algo productivo que hacer por cuenta propia para que no te gane la apatía. Te lo exigis vos (o te lo hacen exigirtelo vos mismo) Tanto la marea alta como la baja pueden"
good,Oracle is a great company if you get in one of the latest technology team such as Autonomous database or OCI. Otherwise a lot of legacy product teams which were acquired and they are not still fully integrated to oracle culture. the management is very slow on taking decisions and that makes it a slow pace company
good,"ok place to work. worked sun oracle for 22 years. oracle is different than sun, different culture. oracle cares about making money, not so much for the people."
good,"Although comp and the org messed about with my commission and bonus almost every comp check, it was truly a great first company to learn sales skills, where the company does invest in sales methodologies and training, the culture needs a huge revamp as it's very much still a ""men's club"" and needs a diversity shake up yesterday. Also, the company makes so much revenue, they should be comp'ing the sales reps and biz dev folks, the people doing the hard work in the trenches more bonuses and commission when milestones are hit. One quarter as a BDC, I was 343% attainment to my goal, and I only received a $2,300 bonus check because it was ""pool"" and ""org-based"" and the org didn't hit their overall number so my commission check suffered because of that. Tell me there is something inherently wrong there? Great resume builder and logo to have on your resume, and a lot of people ""boomerang"" there; leave and come back so they will finally increase your base pay. If you think you're going to get base salary merit increases, you're sorely mistaken."
good,"Regarding work wise, we can learn the product knowledge in depth with good debugging skills of an customer issue."
good,It was a good nice environment friendly co workers they were always helpful and willing to teach you things u didn't understand also the text residents were nice and caring they always fretted with smile om their faces
good,"I worked as a temp worker for the manufacturing floor of Oracle. There was plenty of opportunity to find ways to work beyond the job requirements, and develop more advance skills."
good,"Oracle is a good place to work but they still have to come a long way to meet other MNCs in terms of employee centric policies."
good,"Good team of workers, good learning experience. High expectation with high turnover rate. Different experience based on different teams.Traditional workplace culture in a high tech environment."
good,Oracle is a great employer for those seeking to establish a career in Enterprise B2B Software. I would recommend a position at Oracle to anyone that is either trying to break into the Tech space or cement a life-long career.
good,"Nice place to work. Flexible timings. Work-life balance is good. Good technologies. However, was treated rather badly when I had a medical problem and required a long leave. Had to leave the job because of the manager and HR."
good,New ideas are needed.  Business units need more collaboration from top down and more commitment from dependent teams.  New processes and frameworks needed.
good,Great products but an aggressive sales culture focused on dominating market first and foremost. Upper management promotes competition between different groups.
good,"Personal life will be peaceful but there are not much hikes. Amount of hike percentage is very less and now its taking more than 1.5 years to give hike."
good,"A typical day revolves around 6 to 7 Hours of work with challenging tasks and might require extra hours of brainstorming and discussion."
good,"The Management and the workplace culture was fine."
good,"Oracle is an established company in the valley that has maintained it's corporate culture throughout the  years."
good,"Was doing solid work and was provided great feedback on your work to improve. Was told there was endless opportunities for advancement, but unfortunately when Q3 and Q4 comes around, the company goes into a 'different direction' and re-orgs to meet shareholders and financial quotas. At the point, you are just a number and hope that you are not part of the axed list when you have devoted so much time and effort."
good,I had a good experience in learning new products. Travelling for product implementation around the world. Oracle was a place I learned technology and financial domain knowledge.
good,"Strategizing and Delivery"
good,"Large company that offers quality products, but focuses very heavily on risk mitigation / avoidance. Cutting through the red tape and getting things accomplished can be a bit of a tough task. Overall, a group of very smart people."
good,"Worked there twice over a twenty year period,  started out loving it but as the company grew became more and more dissatisfied with constant layoffs and work load of those left!"
good,"Nice place to work after having 10-15 years of experience. I would suggest freshers to either start with a startup instead of joining Oracle. Or, if getting a good package, make sure you leave soon as the tech stack is restricted to Oracle technologies/framework and the work culture here may make you lazy :P"
good,Most of the sales at Oracle Service Cloud were expansions from existing business. 60% - 80% of salespeople did not sell anything in a given quarter. Turnover of Management and Salespeople was astronomical. It was not a good culture and moral suffered.
good,I had an ok experience at Oracle. Limited exposure to management and there was a lot of confusion on internal policies. Culture was great. Working downtown was fun.
good,average work environment;  helpful co-workers; busy environment; time to learn new things; management was encouraging employees to give feedback and tried to improve their knowledge.
good,Very outdated in terms of technology. Work is not so agile. Always serving age old clients with age old softwares. Most of the employees are above 35yrs and most of them are lethargic.
good,"Make no mistake, Oracle employment is not for thin skinned folks.  Expectations are high and poor performance is the fastest way to free up your future.  That said, Oracle is fair about the opportunities available to prosper."
good,"Good Company to work. Good company to interact. People can switch to different teams and if they find that the new profile is not interesting, they can switch again."
good,"Good exposure to Oracle tools and technologies. Lot of politics."
good,"This is a great job coming straight out of college, with the performance bonuses and the other guaranteed bonuses your first year it's great. They pretty much accept anyone degree wise if you ""love"" sales. As for the Class of program if you don't meet your number, goodbye. Have a plan for paying your bills especially if you aren't from the area. If you want to move outside of the program to HR, Marketing, or ETC... good luck. Overall you work at a call center and if you have a bad territory, good luck! "
good,The transition to cloud is a muddle that is confusing and alienating almost everyone in the company. Avoid them unless/until the dust of this transition settles.
good,"The Oracle sales force functions as an unorganized gang of individual contributors. Oracle salespeople are not only hunters, farmers, of miners. They are also predators looking for a piece of other salespeoples' opportunities."
good,It is a large company. Your work experience will come depending on whom you report to and what division you work. In general I would recommend highly to work for Oracle.
good,"Mangers are not pro to the company , Very bad and micro managing the stuff. Not willing to listen to the people. Very difficult work if you challenge them."
good,Company has changed unfortunately and leadership does not stay intact with the company. Direction changes based on market competition and while Oracle is great there are great people.
good,"Great benefits, Top class gym, flexible working hours, opportunities for skill set improvement via training courses, ideal office location in peninsula"
good,"corporate culture is underwhelming. Tenure lasts 2-3 years tops. Great training programs which you can take on-site, on-line or in a credited facility"
good,"Good company to work in terms of work culture, life apart from work, campus. Coming to work, I would say depends on the team you are in. But it is definitely good for the employees who need good work life balance. Good benefits and hikes until now"
good,Overall Oracle was a good company to work. It gave me good technical exposure and experience of working on a product development in internet banking domain
good,Good place to work. Job security would be good if you are into development.  I'm working in fusion apps human capital management product(HCM) as a  Java developer.
good,Terrible middle management on top of first rate strategy.  A victim of their own culture but a decent workplace. I would not work there unless I needed the experience
good,"Oracle can provide great opportunity if you land in the right seat.  It's hit or miss.  For areas where customers are ready for cloud then you should be ok.  If not, you may struggle."
good,"Chat with customers through assisted online service interactions and"
good,"Empresa con liderazgo tecnologico apta para perfiles agresivos comercialmente, pero a la vez con un conocimiento de la Industria. "
good,Oracle corporation is overall company to work for. In my opinion legacy Oracle and legacy organization came over as Sun acquisition was overall toxic for Oracle success.
good,"This workplace is new to me, everything is start up with multiple nationalities. I learned to multi task and be keen to details since this company caters a lot of different accounts. Usual Australian culture. The hardest part of this job is that it is quite confusing at some time because a lot of tenured employees act like bosses who wants to have the last words. The most enjoyable is the working schedule because it is dayshift. By the way i am referring to Oracle CMS, not the other well know Oracle Company"
good,Oracle helped me get an inside view of class leading product development & domain perspectives.The career progression & Talent Mgmt. could be a lot better
good,"productive place but not much options to grow"
good,"Oracle is a good company, if you can fit in with the culture.  Because of the merger with Oracle and Sun Microsystems, there was a duplication of jobs and my job was eliminated.  Oracle works you hard."
good,"Worked with Oracle On Demand Command-Center team"
good,I was hired on assignment for 12 months through a staffing agency associated with Oracle. I completed my assignment in 11 months and was not offered a full-time permanent position.
good,"Haven't worked there in a long time.  I will say this.  If you work for Oracle, work on the software side - avoid consulting.  The margins in software (70%) vice consulting (5-15%) make it clear where the interests of Oracle lay."
good,Slow to change direction.  No pay raises.  Job security low.  Great exposure to technology.   Most of the leadership are easy to get along with.  Great benefits.
good,"structured work day"
good,Decent compensation - Weak Culture - Complicated Quote to Contract process. The overall experience is neutral. The hardest part is learning the backend process and protocol to complete an order.
good,There is no proper salary hike even if I am the top performer. Management does not bother about the needs of an employee. Hr department needs to be trained as they themselves are not aware of the process.
good,In Oracle if you don't have a good manager it's not a good environment to work in. As companies are purchased and integrated the human factor is over shadowed by the work rule 'People are Resources' and treated as such.   If you find a good manager who allows you to do your work and pulls the best of your abilities to the foreground you can have a rewarding position.
good,I work as a contractor at Oracle so I do not know much about the company benefits the worj week was 40 hours and the work was fast pace I enjoy my 1 year there great management.
good,"Big company who will take care of you, but cut you loose at a moments notice. Good benefits. Will train. But the second they ind someone to do your job for five cents cheaper...you're history."
good,"Great support system, everyone was interested in your success, strong processes to ensure consistent quality, customer always put first, great benefits."
good,"The scope of responsibility for anyone working at Oracle is generally broad.  Often times we were giventasks with little direction and thus were left to your own resources to accomplish the objective.  It was a great experience in terms of independently developing creative solutions, but was often times chaotic and frustrating navigating a giant bureaucracy."
good,Oracle is a nice place to work. Flexible work timings and work from home options are also available. As a brand it provides a big platform to explore new fields.
good,"Good place to work as long as you can afford it."
good,Strong company.  Everything is focused on the cloud.  There are a lot of pillars calling into the same account so you really have to act as one team to insure success.
good,"Oracle is a very large corporation, so be prepared for that. You will learn a lot -- and relatively quickly -- but must be independently driven to succeed."
good,"I learnt a lot at Oracle and I will be forever grateful, it is a sales school and a perfect start to a career in software sales in my opinion. The environment isn't too comforting however, I worked with great people but also some tough to deal with people. Hard work was a given, if you were not on top of your numbers every quarter you would not survive, and the numbers to reach are not a walk in the park either."
good,"Overall I enjoyed the work, people, and general environment. I found the management team to be very supportive of career growth and development. It is a great pace for people beginning their careers to gain valuable experience. "
good,Oracle was one of the coolest place to work in my opinion. We were working on the business intelligence product of Oracle. I felt that the organization lacks innovation and hence does lots of acquisitions.
good,"The company is a self-paced, everything that you need learns, you need to study alone. "
good,"Couldn’t get any more bland and boring... If you have seen Office Space, then you could likely collect checks from Oracle. The company has a great reputation in the valley, but that is fading by the day."
good,"I work with an excellent team of developers, but we are constantly short-staffed and overextended. The team supports each other very well, but there are a few specific tasks that can only be done by one or two people and they are constantly overbooked and that creates a bottleneck for everything else. Higher ups seem more interested in making new sales than the fact that we can't get the work done with the staff we have, and now it's starting to crumble."
good,"Good place,  Good work conditions, Good people, Good work life balance, good benefits, good employee engagement, good listening and looping employees in decisions"
good,"Gives you work-life balance most of the time. Sometimes I have worked late nights till 3 am when there is a demand. If manager is good, your work gets visibility to higher management. Along with good work, you need to be political to grow in this company."
good,"My manager was new to Sales Management.  "
good,"Every group/division can be different in how they treat their employees, but I'd say overall there is very good atmosphere of trust and fairness. There is a strong focus on education, and they reimburse for outside classes taken (Up to 5k/year I think). Benefits are good, and I'd say quite competitive in the market. Good 401K matching (they'll contribute a max of 3% of your 6% or greater)."
good,"With large corporations like this, it's hard to feel your contribution means anything. Management would occasionally say just about anything in meetings to entice someone to volunteer for some task even if the ""volunteer"" had no idea of the goals of the task. This caused noticeable stress and good potential for failure."
good,"Oracle is a company with one way loyalty - stock holders, not employees. There is no job security at all. I enjoyed my job and learned about many different industries."
good,"Lied to me about raise"
good,"I have had great career progression but unfortunately compensation is not competitive. Salary increases are minimal, bonus and stock is non-existent. Great place to keep you challenge and learning but living in the bay area, we really need to earn a decent salary to survive here. There's lots of work so be prepared to put in the hours."
good,Terrible pay but they take care of you. If you do the work and are reliable you can advance pretty quickly. Perks here and there but you have to put in the hours.
good,"Lot of opportunities to improve your skills on many technologies. If you are open to learn the latest technologies, you can try different products and add new skills."
good,"Oracle Management in Cloud applications support is very metrics driven.  Many of the metrics have no real bearing on providing good support, the drive is to minimize the time an SR is open and maximize the number of SRs closed a month."
good,"Work can be challenging."
good,Want to move hometown for some familt reason. I can negotiate salary for that also.joined oracle for some better opportunity but unfortunately some critical family issue arised so that need to move to hometown.in oracle i am playing a team lead role directly talking with customer.
good,"Oracle is a giant company composed of hundreds of smaller companies and divisions. If You are stuck with a product that is a hard sell (and many are) then you ARE STUCK.....if you can't make your number, you can't transfer or keep your job. "
good,"Overall the group I was in was really nice. I really liked my immediate manager but I can not say for sure about the top management.  They treated employees like dirt.  Overall benefits were ok, not excellent compared to competition and similar big companies."
good,Huge changes constantly happening.  Good work environment; challenging requirements.  Great flux of people occurs unexpectedly and seemingly often.  There seems to be incoming people from out of country to provide same support roles.
good,"Pre and post sales installation and support of the Oracle Database Software including site evaluation, installation and training across a number of customers across the South east region each customer having different budget and system requirements which I evalusted and advised on."
good,"Interns weren't introduced into the team much. It had very less interaction with the fellow colleagues. It was for a shorter stint, so hard to judge ."
good,"Quarterly and sometimes monthly RIF activity. Enter at your own risk. If you find yourself in a stable group, the work can be very rewarding and well compensated. This can switch at a simple decision."
good,Great at training their sales force. Very competitive and you are only as good as your current quarter sales #.  If you like a high pressure sales environment then this is the place for you!
good,"Opportunity to do good work, but a very demanding environment with endless deadlines. Technology tools are complicated. Great focus on minor deficiencies in performance and little recognition of many successes."
good,Oracle just want to hire low paying job people and have gotten rid of experience people that you need if you are going to convenience a customer to place their IT into cloud technology.
good,"fast paced work environment"
good,Highly results-oriented. I would recommend Oracle to people who would like to take on complete responsibility and ownership of their assignment and anything needed by the environment.
good,"was on the pre-sales side consulting side.  lots of changes, resulting in little work.  Left to self-training nearly all the time.  difficult to progress in role without opps to work on."
good,"There are 2 orgs in Oracle corp, Mark hard and TK. There is no hike or good salaries for Mar hard org since the years, for TK group has hike every years. "
good,"A lot of challenges and opportunities. Excellent exposure to Solaris, Linux and virtualization. Plus, highly available storage and appliances for ZFS, NFS and databases."
good,At one time Oracle corporation was a good company to work for.  Then it became very political and then started have trouble with management.   I liked the Oracle products and that is why I spent so much time at Oracle.
good,"The job security is low , management can be better . But the people you work with are smart and hardworking . They enjoy the work which makes working with them fun"
good,Its a company where an employee can sustain for long term. Its not as employee friendly as other companies. Compensation of employees is less as compared to outsize market but job is relatively secure.
good,Oracle is getting rid of their experienced highly paid sales force and moving to a model where all sales is handled by centralized hubs. Very dangerous place to be right now if you are in the field.
good,"A lot of great people, great benefits, brand recognition, global, leader in HR Technology space. Good technology, products and Cloud offering.Great sales organization with a very dynamic mindset to stay relevant to customer requirements. High adaptability is a secret to success at Oracle. It's possible to find pockets of innovation & start up culture across sales to build valuable experience & grow your network."
good,"Multi-tasking is a necessary skill for daily tasks. Learning experience every day.  Always working towards the next best tool, business process, or product offering.  Main focus is selling a complete solution to customers."
good,Management really needs to think about their execution of the strategy before hiring a lot of folks and then lay them off. I hope they can get that streamlined soon.
good,"good work life balance."
good,Oracle introduced the enterprise web development exposure in me. It offered a good work life balance with flexible work from home option and numerous ways to improve skills.
good,A fast paced company which is pivoting to the cloud. If you are a cloud architect then this would be the place to be. There are many changing happening to focus on the cloud.
good,Oracle is a great place to work right out of college. They have a program specific for recent college grads. The pay is great and you get to travel for training
good,Lots of procedures and process to follow especially in a production infrastructure.  Can work with a lot of different teams in your position.  I've been satisfied with my different management.
good,Great training program. Great people you will be working alongside. A lot of room for growth. Everything takes time. You will not receive a promotion overnight.
good,Oracle has lots of layoffs and acquisitions but a great company to work for when there is Job security. I learned a lot about sales and the tech industry while working for Oracle.
good,"Oracle is okay if you don't care if you are rewarded for doing an exceptional job.  Oracle bought Sun Microsystems supposedly for their hardware and systems expertise.  Then, they fired all the Sun Sales People.  No wonder the remaining Oracle Sales force couldn't sell hardware."
good,"fun work place! but benefits are not good!"
good,"Oracle was a great place to work and learn about the software industry.  Oracle has a very interesting sales driven culture from senior management on down to field sales and lower level inside sales people as well.  Like most sales positions, you will be treated well as long as you hit your quota numbers."
good,Basic large corporation environment. Benefits and salary very good but personal job satisfaction is lacking. Interesting projects are micromanaged too much by too many people.
good,"For the sales development representative role, it is clear that Oracle treats its employees as worker ants merely employed to put up numbers. No real chance at career progression. Executive leaderships pulls the company in a thousand different ways, confusing us ants and contributing to turnover."
good,"Dies war der Anfang einer tollen Karriere, bei der ich die Möglichkeit hatte, mit vielen Menschen aus vielen Ländern und Kulturkreisen zusammen arbeiten konnte"
good,"Wenn man die amerikanische Arbeits-""Kultur"" mag, kann man in diesem Unternehmen sehr erfolgreich sein"
good,"Day to Day normal working enviroment."
good,"Not a good place to start a career. There are'nt many good projects available and hence limited learning opportunities."
good,"Good Work Life Balance."
good,"Slow career and financial growth."
good,Okay benefits with individual space to work.  Great management. Need to improve on other perks like hikes and raises. Nice place to retire permanently.
good,"Flexible working hours, good cafeteria and gym room facilities, "
good,"-Good benefits although salary and raises are relatively meager"
good,Es una cultura muy individualista pero se aprende montones. La autonomía hace gente recursiva.
good,"Work day is pretty busy in my current role."
good,"Overall rating   3"
good,Basically after they gave us an offer and we began to work there they changed significant metrics and things we were compensated on to make it more difficult for us to get paid. They make you feel undervalued as an employee.
good,"work place is fine, but very unsecure since company plan to"
good,"Good co-workers, lots of opportunity. Strong benefits and pay is good.I have been at the same career level for 10 years and there is no place for me to advance to. I am lucky to work for a manager who cares about his team and I enjoy my job."
good,"One of the great companies to start carrier with, I have enjoyed everyday of my carrier in oracle and never had any complaints. Only issues company is not great on compensation part."
good,"Oracle provided me with a lot of amazing resources and opportunities. At the same time, the culture is a bit stale and management didn't seem to care much about our success."
good,"Its a place you go to for a good work life balance. However, if someone is looking to work in a challenging and high growth environment - this is not a place for him/her."
good,"Flexible Hours, learning curve a bit slow , Fully structured organisation, co-workers are good. The most enjoyable part of the job is to work which you like it."
good,"terrible management,"
good,"The company has grown a lot in San Antonio.  This has resulted in a lot of people with little experience getting hired on at higher wages than those with experience.  Employees that have worked here for two years, are paid less than a brand new, newly hired college grad.  The competition for growth, promotion, or annual raise is fierce.  The company has been in San Antonio for over 3 years and has yet to provide a cost of living increase to any employees."
good,tipikus multinacionális cég-  megfelelő munkakörülményekkel és jutattásokkal
good,"Overall, I like the people at Oracle very much.  Hard working and a good sense of humor.  Not so sure about some of senior management, most were good, but some seem to be into a world of there own and not based in reality."
good,"Oracle it's a great place to work and learn new skills using the latest software technology. There are times when you could be overwhelmed by the tasks and deadlines of the projects. The management is not always supportive but overall I had a great experience. It's hard to advance in the company, no career growth opportunities."
good,Opportunity to work with bigger team and more challenging problems. Team is supportive and talented. Lots of room for improvement is process but not complex to understand.
good,Good Workplace.I was able to work from home eight to five. Good working relationship with all my co-workers and customers. Working with international teams.
good,Great people. Well respected by clients. Wonderful experience with Team Oracle and Sean Tucker. Subject matter experts are great. Good growing experience
good,Very difficult to navigate company and promotions are far and few between. I've had a rough time trying to get a promotion so that is why i am looking elsewhere.
good,"Oracle is a very difficult place to work.  I had 3 regional managers in less than 2 years.  Too much turnover.  Management is needed to navigate the Oracle sales process.  Many sales reps talk about how they almost hate to sell something because the paperwork and approval process within Oracle is so difficult.  Oracle prides itself on being a self service organization, unfortunately the information that you need isn't always easy to find.  "
good,"Employee friendly , very good management. Can have good work-life balance. The only problem is lack of more opportunities to explore and no hikes"
good,Number of online training classes to learn about Oracle products. Compensation and career growth depend on the team you are in.
good,"Lots of turnover with little job security. When on projects, it's a great place to work but you never want to end up on the bench."
good,"Work environment is very nice, no work pressure, job security is there but the management of the organisation i work with is not so good, and top of every thing salary is too bad for tenure employees, no hike, no bonus and no support from management for that."
good,"I worked as a contract worker. I liked working there for a couple of reasons. One, it was located only 15mins from were I lived and it is a huge sprawling location and they had a gourmet chef on premises who cooked amazing meals."
good,"Good Working environment."
good,I have been working at Oracle full-time (More than a year) as OBIEE/OBIA developer. It's perfect place to learn new things.
good,"Oracle acquired MICROS 10/2014 was only with them for 13 months they found our (my) department/division redundant 11/2015 and eliminated the warehouse in its entirety."
good,"It's a typical 9 to 5 job."
good,"It is a good company to get retire, no appreciation for performance."
good,"The work is Productive & interactive with sales."
good,Tiempo insuficiente para que me valoren dentro de la empresa.
good,environnement qui permet l'autonomie mais un peu frustrant car activités trop silonéés
good,"Work 9:00 - 6:00. Relaxing. No cubes. Too open. Distracting. Could work from home better, but recent change.... Great manager, great co-workers.. Would be better if allowed to work from home.. Everything we do is tracked, so managers could see we are working... Would be great for environment and the world.."
good,"It is an easy place to work and your employment is pretty secure. I am not sure what else to say.  I am bored, but like the money."
good,"Working Culture is very open"
good,There is so much learning. It provides a good platform to start with. Complete product based company.flexible working hours
good,"Analytical and technology leader who rapidly determines business needs and presents clear, actionable strategies to improve IT"
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company.  They have great benefits.  Most of the teams are amazing to work with.  Everyone works hard, and plays hard."
good,"Buena empresa salvo la globalización."
good,"Alpha group was a good place to start my career, very supportive location. small group of people were creating a wonderful team work together to achieve the personal and organization goals an objectives."
good,Oracle provides a very good business experience growing Cloud Services and growing a new product category within a very large Oracle organization with HCM Cloud.
good,Good company and good people. The organization should improve with the new management now in place. Decent amount of politics and success in the role is heavily dependent on other people and luck. Learn to play the game and you are likely to do well.
good,"The job slided to me by my friend."
good,"Pros: "
good,nice place to work and also good management and recognition from manager from time to time.have got fun at work as well  by setting up outing from time and again.
good,Overall I had a enjoyable experience and felt the management was good however the ability to not be brought on full time was challenging.  I remained a contractor for years.
good,"The company is very good to it's share holders and executives.  Opportunities for growth exist, but can be elusive. Oracle is a very large company, and it is very easy to get lost as a resource."
good,"Uma excelente empresa com muita visibilidade no mercado o que abre muitas portas junto aos clientes."
good,"Working at Oracle has ramped me up into a full application sales representative in no time. Everyone who works here knows that we operate in dog years (1 year at Oracle is like 7 years at another company.) For this reason, you are in a high paced learning environment and need results fast."
good,"I have improved my technical and follow-up skills."
good,I have learned a lot in the past 2 1/2 years hear at Oracle. You have to work hard and adapt to change at a drop of a hat. You also have the opportunity to make a lot of money.
good,"Oracle gave me a good corporate career because I was joined as a fresher and improved my self, how to be in corporate world."
good,One of the largest players in the tech industry and great place to build required skills.
good,Prospecting and sales cycle management are the name of the game.   This role teaches you how to be professionally persistent and how to navigate objections. The hardest part of the job is dealing with internal approval processes. The most enjoyable part is the people and the culture.
good,"challenging consulting projects."
good,"Great place to retire and please go to oracle after min 10 years experience. You will understand why I am saying this after you join,"
good,"Oracle has been a great place to work over the past 4 years. A typical day at work includes answering customer inquiries via phone/email, reviewing offer transactions, providing new hire on boarding material, running reports, and collaborating on projects, to name a few. My colleagues are across the country, making my office culture very independent. I work with an amazing team, everyone is extremely knowledgable. The hardest part about my job is the lack of personal interaction due to the grand scale of the company and the flexibility to work from home. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to assist people in a timely manner and providing information for them to be able to navigate through the self-service culture of Oracle."
good,"okay. nice environment to work in"
good,Oracle is an ok place to work. It does give you that balance in life. Co-workers are great to work with. The hardest part of the job is not able to work from home. But that's ok because it's very flexible in all other areas
good,Oracle has got a great work culture with a good working environment.Just that shifts are not on rotational Basis & secondly Post graduates & Graduates treated as Equal
good,Oracle is a very flexible work environment that allows employees to work from anywhere in the world. There is a rich resource of user experience methodology and experienced staff to learn from and to collaborate with on a variety of enterprise project. The main drawback is the lack of competitive salary and any annual salary increases.
good,my job is on rotational shifts where i can enjoy mmy work and do it at ease.
good,"Work Life Balance and Friendly people"
good,"Great company, young sales teams. Strong potential for advancement. Commission is quarterly."
good,"Advancement and career path are mapped out for employees."
good,"High turnover in consulting due to travel."
good,"Management really nice, and good atmosphere in company. Typical day is doing audit prep work, completing and approving recs."
good,Interacting with Customer and Oracle Field Engineeers make me understand the job well and concentratge towards their SLA and service satisfaction.
good,"Fun place to work, good culture, large scale infrastructure environment. Good coworkers and lot of learnings."
good,"Worked here for a whole year and still had no idea what I did since management can't seem to get their act together. I had 4 different bosses in a year, and was moved around twice to different practices. "
good,"Great place to work.  Depending upon the manager you report to, it is rewarding and challenging."
good,"There were a lot of great things working for Oracle, we had access to free pop, we had access to Ping-Pong tables and other games in a large break room."
good,"•Research related support for sales representatives of Oracle Managed Cloud Services"
good,"extra curricular activities"
good,"- Daily Reporting of Backlog in terms of Revenue Reconciliation"
good,"okay"
good,demanding job requiring you to manage both internal and external relationships.  Sales driven with high expectations for over achievement.  Great compensation if you are willing to put the time in.
good,"Work Life Balance is excellent"
good,"Senior HR/Recruiting Coordinator 								  "
good,"Coding by using skills like Core Java , J2EE , JSF , Facelets, Hibernate , Spring ."
good,"Oracle was an interesting workplace, with constant new tasks and responsibilities, each day was like working in a new position"
good,Great learning experience and multicultural environment
good,"- It is a very typical Organization in terms of work"
good,Company with great culture and place to work with.I found best breed of talent pool in this company.
good,"Gostei muito de trabalhar como recepcionista."
good,I always liked working with my customers and the challenge of troubleshooting /repairing of hardware or software.
good,it was fun all the way meeting people with different tacit knowledge.The biggest challenge i faced was not with work load but with the point of views of the individual when group of people work in the teams towards common objective which i got used to in the long run .
good,Good company for career advancement..! Good for learning and honing skills.
good,"- Typical Day at work:"
good,"Successfully transitioned pilot project which have ramped up to 42 seats consisting 3 LOB’s. Receivables management, Revenue recognition and Credit analysis. Resolved supplier queries regarding payments over e-mail and other network tools. Provided effective on-the-job training to new entrants and ensured robustness of continuity process."
good,"wart polecenia, zapewnia odpowiedni pakiet socjalny, stwarza możliwości awansu"
good,"Good work, not much pressure,no much scope of learning.good co- workers, very helpful."
good,"i learnt erp and oracle applications,"
good,"My role as as a part of the Complex Booking Team starts with performing Quality Checks on the Complex/High Value transactions."
good,"•	Responsibilities included preparing journal entries and reconciling general ledger, accounts payable, accounts receivable, preparing financial statements, preparing and submitting quarterly sales taxes and payroll taxes, bank statement review, monthly cash reconciliation, preparing P&L reports, general accounting tasks, and spreadsheet analysis in Excel"
good,"A typical day at work would be to prospect by pounding the phones. Setting up appointments with technical support and find out what a customer is looking for."
good,"I was not enjoying the type of work given to me."
good,Oracle Is an MNC where any one can have a good work environment and one can know the corporate culture. But as per my experience company do not have a gaurantee of giving a permanent position to a contract Employee.
good,It's all about sales at Oracle.  Quality suffers.  The most important thing is that the products ship on time.  
good,Standard corporation that provides a great work life balance.
good,"First of all dont think of this as the real oracle compnay. This is some local company (retek) that oracle bought a few years ago so there is really nothing about oracle and more just about that company - which is nothing much to write about."
good,"good  company for beginner "
good,Good company with intelligent employees who are dedicated to the organization. Would be nice if it was more employee friendly.
good,Good Management
good,"A friendly and supportive team, you can approach anyone at any point of the day with your biggest doubts and they will have time for you. At the same time they give you complete freedom to work independently. Also somewhat flexible timings."
good,"I was responsible for the day to day management of international projects ensuring the forecasts for the projects were accurate and up to date. Reporting into the PM Cluster on project progress and addressing any issues that arise from the deployments. Required to work autonomously at times but other times to be part of the larger group and the One Red Team from Oracle. I have learnt different skills to managing projects and to adapt to the ever changing requirements from clients. Only time 'management' would get involved in what I was doing was when queries were above my pay grade. Other than that, I was left to get on and do the work. The hardest part of what I did was to navigate the ever expanding self service portal of Oracle. It has been challenging finding the right person to connect to and build relationships. I have been successful in building meaningful relationships with my clients and senior management in Oracle. What I enjoyed most of my position was the feeling when a plan came together. Months of planning and working comes together in a far corner of the world and the client is happy ! Project successfully deployed and we did it in budget and time ..."
good,Good working place and i have worked here for more than 8 years
good,"Friendly co-workers, plenty of opportunity to learn, friendly atmosphere"
good,Oracle processes were not easily adapted to hardware requirements.
good,"The experience I have gained here has challenged me and allowed me to continue to learn and explore. It has also helped me to understand the environment of a large corporation. I enjoy my co-workers and learn something new from them everyday. Since we are scattered across the country, its challenging to not have hands-on training, which is the hardest part of my job. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to know my customers, being their support contact, and researching their needs."
good,"Good work life balance but it is difficult to advance within the company. Salary, bonus and stock are minimal if not zero."
good,Pro's:
good,Got laid off 7 months after they bought out Sun Microsystems
good,Growing company however processes not in place
good,"A typical day is not the same as the previous day. Managers travel 70% of the time, and employee must be independent and self-starter. Employee must be proactive and able to make decisions with best interests of organization in mind. Accustomed to working in a virtual environment; dotted-line managers office outside of Dallas Metroplex. Excellent communication skills required to ensure nothing ""slips through the cracks""."
good,Best of breed networking products. Definite separation of cultures between French owned company and US strategy.
good,"Oracle remains one of the top rated companies in the US, providing up to date software applications worldwide"
good,"Lot of learning, You would get a first hand exposure on the technologies."
good,"the pay is decent don't get me wrong but there is no future there. get in, get the experience, then take it somewhere you'll be better compensated and more appreciated"
good,"Oracle provides good work life balance with occasional remote working option and flexible work hours."
good,"Good place to work if you are a fast learner and want to learn technical things.But, forget about salary growth.Good Work lie balance. Can also work from home. No time bonds at work."
good,"I would say it depends on the team that you get into depends on your life a Oracle. Some of the Products in Oracle are very stressful and you don't even have the work life balance that you would prefer Oracle for.For Entry level i would never say this as a right place to work. People at Oracle are friendly. If you get into the right team you have all the things that you want work life balance, self learning options"
good,"It's a great place to work, good work culture and friendly people. The most enjoyable part of the job is that there are many growth opportunities that allow one to learn and advance on their own pace. The food offered in cafe is freshly delivered from farm to the table, well made daily. The workout gym is fully equipped with basketball, and volleyball courts, swimming pool, sauna and steam rooms, along with daily workout classes. I really enjoy working there."
good,Difficult work enviornnent. Lack of support from development team. Pay is good. But you lose time with family due to excess workload. Lack of resource. Management does not have techniccal expertise to provide assistance.
good,"Very rewarding environment for years, undergoing a lot of change recently with a move to more agile development.  This drives culture change, changes in how we work, and challenges a lot of the traditional roles.  I've had tremendous opportunity at Oracle and have learned a lot.  The team I manage and my virtual global peers are some of the smartest people I have ever met.  I very much enjoy the people and the opportunity provided.  The past 1-2 years has been heavily focused on agile transformation providing new skills and opportunities to many in the organization!"
good,"I liked the role of being a consultant who usually provides recommendation to the client and implements the stuff. "
good,"Good to work if your project vs your higher management is stable.people will help you if required. Team building activities are good no hikes can be expected ,No dress code"
good,"In general the management had trouble motivating the teams due to the lack of communication.  The lack of transparency lead to a lack of trust. "
good,"Oracle has a very young culture and is a great place to work if you know how to manage your time and be productive as an individual. Management is lacking and you will most likely have people above you that you never meet in person, but if you are a self starter and know how to get the job done, then this is the place to be."
good,"Enjoyed working for the first pre-sales manager I interviewed with and was hired by. However, after six months, I, along with several others, were moved to another pre-sales manager's team.  This guy was not a mentor or coach, micromanaged. Good thing was that Oracle had their (usual) RFI experience and on June 1 2017, I was let go."
good,"Good company."
good,"I was in a moderately sized company acquired by Oracle. The transition to becoming Oracle-ized was slow, but as we were plugged into the Oracle machine we lost our autonomy and had less latitude to behave in an entrepreneurial manner."
good,"As a telecommuter had work life balance. Working at Oracle has opportunity to enroll at Oracle University for latest classes and acquire latest skills.  However, employee pay and benefits were not at all good. Also, no chance for promotions or growth in North America as more hiring done in Mexico and India in last 15 years."
good,Work from home option is available depending on the manager. Not much scope on learning new technologies. Hike is not there on most years. Good place to work for two years or so.
good,The most interesting about Oracle is what you learn about yourself. The company provide significant challenge that can make you build new skills or improve existing
good,It is a good company to work for. Think of going the extra mile and you will succeed. It is a fast-paced company so you need to be one step ahead in order to grow professionally.
good,"Overall a very good work experience, flexible work timings. Good work-life balance. Good working culture and best place to work. But if you are looking for salary hikes this is not the place."
good,"While there are many causes for complaint, Oracle is fairly average for the industry in terms of companies you can work for. Certainly not the best, but you can do a lot worse than work for Oracle. Compensation is OK, as are the benefits."
good,"However, I was laid off from Oracle. Enjoyed the people I worked with but there was never enough to do despite requests to management. Pay has been stagnant for years. No new challenges. I never had to work over 40 hours per week or weekends. Glad I was laid off. I probably wouldn't have left otherwise because of the benefits and I was paid pretty well."
good,"Oracle is a very large organization with multiple layers of management. It can be a very difficult place to advance if you are not used to dealing with the impersonal management of a large company. The individual managers were great to work with, but the upper management layers tend to interfere with good career development."
good,Channel Conflict is a mess; partners are consistently pushed out of registered deals by direct deeply discounted projects in order to meet quarterly sales targets
good,"Working remote and for management across the country,  you really don't get exposure to management and therefore opportunities for advancement are severely limited.  Loved the job itself - developing relationships with customers, resolving their issues and traveling to customer sites - great autonomy/control over methods and ideas to improve efficiency. Super management and co-workers  - authentic and very supportive team effort when needed to resolve issues!"
good,"Work life balance"
good,"It is very tough to promote as there are few open reqs.  All are filled from low cost head count.  They post the jobs, but that is for legal requirement. Most are filled from India or Mexico."
good,"Like most jobs, your management will determine your enjoyment of it. I thoroughly enjoyed my first few years, because my management was outstanding and shielded employees from poor forecasting games by upper management and let the professionals do their jobs.  Once my first few managers had been fired even though they were making their numbers, it became a place I no longer enjoyed working even though the money was good. I would make my number but the overall division would not, yet the senior management was never changed. If the entire team is doing poorly, usually it is the coach that is fired.  I was blessed with many years of good earnings and did not live above my means, so I opted to retire in 2015 instead of watch the rest of the ship sink. It was sad to see such a great potential workplace so poorly managed. I certainly hope the rest of Oracle was managed better."
good,"Stable job, good opportunities. But I have not got a raise in four years. "
good,"Very rewarding working with some of the largest commercial and Public sector organizations in the world, We helped organizations run more effectively and efficiently."
good,"The job is great for college graduates to learn how the corporate world works, but things are very disorganized and there are unrealistic expectations set for sales representatives after the first promotion.  Constant changes (I've had 7 different ""direct report"" managers in 14 months, and turnover is very high."
good,"In Cloud Technical Support, if you are in in FL, MA, CO, or CA, you cannot work for Oracle due to their 'support centers' policy. Management beyond my immediate superior was solely metrics based and I never spoke to my manager's superior once in the 7 years we were on his team. Workplace culture was good and we collaborated closely with other internal teams and worked remotely for eight years. Better support from upper management would have helped greatly, but it seemed they were more focused on finding ways of removing legacy employees not working in the 'support center' cities. I did learn a lot on the job, but that was mainly due to the close support of the employees immediately around me that came into Oracle via acquisition the same time I did. Due to our reduced Support Request volume toward the end of my tenure at Oracle (as we were end of life-ing a product line), there were no raises for 3 years, but, overall the compensation was good."
good,"My salary has actually decreased since I first started with them, but I do enjoy the work/life balance and the benefits."
good,"no raises always excuses"
good,"Highly sales driven organization.  If your career is not in direct sales, there are better options than Oracle in this region.  Overall, good company and culture."
good,Oracle has an excellent culture of working remote.  Good pay and benefits with an excellent work life balance.  Reorgs are a constant part of life there.
good,"Company went through organizational changes and had a bad experience at the company. Too much burocracy. "
good,"The company provides you the information, training and tools to be productive and create your own career. Nevertheless, there is no an specific path or at least a template to follow. If you have a good manager, you can develop an interesting career, otherwise, you would be lost"
good,"People are friendly there at Oracle.  And the gym at HQ is pretty nice."
good,"It wasn’t that great. Oracle work environment had a lot of perks though. I wouldn’t recommend their sales program for recent graduates. They put a lot of stress on the reps, in my opinion. No means for true advancement if you start in Oracle Direct and don’t exceed quota each quarter."
good,Good for campus hires to start their career on less stress mode. Work culture and dress code is casual and let's it's employees feel stressed out even though the work load is more.
good,"If you are applying for a role in Finance, you might be interviewed for one role, offered another role as per you offer letter and by the time you land, you might become a part of a completely different team. Internal Exchange of Resources is very common within shops managed by Directors who report to one Senior Director. Once you start, you will be designated with your role and responsibilities and a month's hands on training will be provided by aligning you a buddy. Once you have taken over, you will be expected to do the given job for months and years, unless either of you or management come up with an urge to change your role and responsibilities as you may seek some growth in the organization or there is a change in process. Laid back work culture. You will be given a laptop. You just have to come to office, do the given work, do whatever you want for remaining of the time, clock 9 hours and leave. Appraisal process appears to be there only for the sake of doing it and documentation. No growth/No Promotion/No Increment/No Bonus promised by the Management even if you ask. Once in a 3 months RnR would be organized for team building and motivation among people. In my personal experience, the team I worked with people were too much obsessed for usage or against non-usage of local language forgetting the fact that they are working for an MNC where they will have people from all caste, culture and religion working with them and it is not necessary for anyone who has just arrived and started in the city to speak any other language apart from English (that is considered to be a"
good,"Good work environment with flexibility , but it depends on manager."
good,"This is an decent company to work with. Everything about the company can be rated as ""Average"". Although the Brand is huge but the culture, compensation, management etc. depends upon the department you work for in the company."
good,"Se trabaja bajo mucha presion y debes cumplir tus metas a toda costa, a la empresa no le interesa tu vida personal"
good,You can find good work life balance here. But Career growth and Financial growth are very slow. Overall Transition to the cloud so far has been successful and needs some rejigs.
good,"Oracle is a very large, diverse company with many organizations.   Whether you like it will depend on your goals and corporate cultural preferences.  Oracle is very process driven and self reliant in learning and problem resolution.    In my role I love to work with my accounts directly, understand their issues and work to a mutual satisfaction for both entities.  However, the role is very administrative and much time is spent on searching for assistance online and through forums and self help sites, which can be very time consuming.   First line managers are helpful and willing to engage.  Peers are also eager to assist and brainstorm if necessary.   In my role annual goals are capped and difficult to exceed."
good,"As far as salary and commission oracle does a great job, culture and management sometimes have several issues. Oracle is a big brand and you will find work no matter where you go after some time with oracle"
good,"Good benefits provided to employee but with limited growth opportunities. Immediate management is supportive, but over time the salary falls below industry standards for similar role."
good,"Kind of micro management. However, it could depend on which which group you are at.  If you think of the balancing between work and life then this is one of the issues."
good,"Oracle grows through acquisition and customer service. I personally could not align with the culture.  They paid well and used most of the products they sell.  Their software is very good, but is pricey."
good,I worked in the presales consulting area with Oracle and loved educating customer of the benefits of Oracle products.  Very collaborative work environment.  Workforce tended to be very confident in what the company could offer.
good,"There are opportunities at Oracle to learn and grow.  But like most large companies some organizations are not as promising for potential career growth or learning.  The organization I was in is like that and while management tried to take corrective actions to improve moral and the overall culture, the bottomline is making money for the company and its shareholders is and will always be the priority."
good,It's extremely stressful as there is so much incoming volume and not enough analysts to do the work.  It creates a setup to fail environment.  Almost impossible to complete any training as there is no time.
good,"Pretty straight forward first time job. Honestly its pretty boring, I don't plan on staying longer than a year. There are no raises or opportunity for advancement. This is a good starter job."
good,Great place to start...don't expect to stay here forever though. You will need to move elsewhere eventually. Fast-paced and highly competitive culture.
good,It is a fast paced competitive environment that is money and numbers driven.  The pay in comparison to other similar companies and similar positions is average if not sub par.
good,"your asked to write your own review/self assessment."
good,Great place to work and to sharpen the skills. Work Life balance is fully maintained. Management is okay. I have learned many new technologies. I enjoy working here.
good,"Cad Group. Worked with engineers. Nice campus. Typical day, scheduled meetings, arranged travel, order supplies, maintained spreadsheet for tracking laptops."
good,"Salary was very low, otherwise wish to work with Oracle again. Low salaries, no hikes, no monetary benefits, no recognition or awards."
good,"Atuei pela Oracle duas vezes, em ambas tive contato com muitas pessoas da empresa e pude aprender novas formas de trabalho. A empresa é dinâmica, esta sempre mudando e se atualizando."
good,A typical day at work would be making 60 calls a day and sending email campaigns to customers for upcoming Oracle Events and Virtual classrooms. The goal is to get at least 5 interactions and to book meetings with clients for a discovery call which would include yourself and your solutions consultant. I learned how to work better in a fast paced environment and continue to educate myself on the industry that  I was prospecting in. I also learned how  to navigate through Oracle's internal systems and CRM tools to prospect.The hardest part of the job was cold calling and getting clients to pick up so you can book meetings. The most enjoyable part was closing a deal after a full 3-6month sales cycle. The work culture needed some improvement but they do host competitive bi-weekly challenges that got us excited about booking the most meetings and sending out quotes
good,"Good place to work. Need to pull your own career and work hard, the options are endless and the opportunities are amazing. Its just that you should analyze and decide what to choose from the bunch."
good,It is what you make of it. I enjoyed the company but I knew I wasn't a good fit for my role. It does have a relaxed atmosphere and the work wasn't too difficult.
good,Oracle can provide you access to new technology and fun opportunities.  It can also be very cut-throat and what have you done for me lately.  In sales your are expected to work long hours to stay up with new offerings and are often travelling.  I enjoyed it enough to work there twice.
good,I know very talented people need to wait for 2 years for promotion. I also know people just don't a fair job got promoted only because he is there long enough. It is discouraging.
good,"Good environment to explore our ability, support from management to execute ideas. Team members are encouraging and forthcoming. The environment helps in flexible timings considering the employee needs also."
good,"Oracle is a worldwide organization that is predominantly interested in cloud applications. They purchased my former employer and almost immediately began shutting down departments. They are not interested in physical products. If you work for a physical manufacturer, they will shutter your facility and keep the non-tangible parts that can be put into the cloud."
good,Good compensation for the amount of work you put in. It is hard to do a career change within the company as you will find it hard to apply to other pillars.
good,It was pretty much  your average workplace. The fellow employees were the best. It was never clear to me where the management was driving the company.
good,Legacy Company that only cares about the bottom-line.  Constant restructuring for cloud means the best people aren't selected for the best jobs. Very political and the Tech Software group gets all the power
good,A big company where you can get lost in the shuffle.Some Managers are brought in from outside who don't know the structure of Oracle so that can be hard as they can't adjust to the environment.
good,"It is a good place for good work life balance and slow pace. But few people have passion there. Besides, the management is poor, they care less about their employee."
good,"Great introduction to core technology sales. Competitive environment in a large cooperation might not be for everyone. Very dependent on individual effort, no hands are held."
good,Oracle is a good stepping stone in the IT world. Our company was acquired by Oracle so the work culture and vibe changed drastically. The best thing about this company is the benefits.
good,Oracle is a great company but suffers from many of the negative side affects of being such a large company. Employees seem like a number and everything takes a long time to get done.
good,"Overall Oracle was a great place to work and had great benefits.  The culture and management has changed in the past few years, no raise in 3 years and no feeling of being a part of a team and camaraderie."
good,"Started at Oracle as a Sr. Business Analyst/PM  from an acquisition. The first two-three years is a blur, worked on special projects. Learn mainly how to maximize my skillset in Oracle. Last two years, role change with more expectations with no pay increase. I had not received an increase since the acquisition, but  title changes occurred."
good,exposure to big company and APAC culture which which different from my previous two Org culture. More exposure on financial analysis and sales quota setting.
good,"Work life balance is very good..."
good,"Great place to improve your resume, gain some experience and expose yourself to enterprise software. Not a good place for advancement or market value for your skillset."
good,"In support there is a desire to provide excellent customer support from the top, however there are so many metrics and as a manager having 15 direct reports it can be difficult to spend adequate time managing your staff and helping them grow while also managing your own career plan."
good,Mi evaluación con respecto a la empresa es muy estable a nivel laboral pero remuneración no es buena.
good,Life at Oracle Health Science has always been very busy.  Best part of the job was that I got the opportunity to work on some of the latest technology and advanced applications.   Hardest part of the job was that planning was missing from the many projects.
good,"Very difficult to move up. People get promoted when they aren't eligible, a lot of politics. Must have a manager who is well connected in order to have the best shot."
good,"Oracle has been the best among industries in terms of work life balance and workplace culture."
good,"Very good brand and gives you ample of learning opportunities,"
good,"At this company, there is almost no communication coming out of higher management. It seems like directors and managers are surprised often by strategic decisions."
good,"Nice flexibility but no growth area"
good,"Most departments are fairly flexible when it comes to working from home or providing flexible work schedule. Great place to work if you have a family, not so great if you want to build your career."
good,"I was at Oracle for almost 8 years in Professional Services. Benefits were great, salary was average. Pipeline for consulting shrank every year I was there. I think Sales or Product Management are better areas that Professional Services."
good,Depends on the employee how much they are willing to push themselves. Oracle Hardware (CAD) does have a good work life balance. Ok company to work for
good,"Very slow work environment, some people don't know what they needs to do and their duties, job security is not great. Work is not clear for assignation and favorism happen to close employee to manager"
good,"I learned alot in this role, mainly how large companies operate and how sales quotas at a low level can create some very shady practices."
good,"Oracle provides excellent salary and benefits, but job security is always in doubt.   Oracle has many divisions and little overall direction.  Oracle has been shifting most of its focus to the cloud with some recent success"
good,This required a lot of travel so if you do not like traveling this could be a problem.  There is not much office interaction and management is usually remote.
good,"Though there is no significant work pressure but still the work environment is very dull."
good,"Company provides a lot of support for training, but upward mobility is limited unless you have a supportive manager. Patches are inconsistent. High turnover."
good,"One of the best companies to work."
good,"Good culture, easy life, manageable process, One can easily adjust with the process, facilities provided in the company is good overall."
good,"Good work life balance. Hierarchical management. So what ever your manager says, you have to say Yes other wise quit."
good,"Good culture.  Lack of team activities."
good,"Need some work on employee accommodations when they are going thru life difficulties."
good,"I joined straight out of college and dove headfirst into something I had no experience with. The team was welcoming, friendly, patient, and eager to increase efficiency and productivity through collaboration with many different teams all over the world. My division was filled with talented individuals but lacked a sense of community. Upper management had difficulty controlling timelines of complex processes leading to many unforeseen issues, delays, and wasted energy on perceived priorities. "
good,"The company culture is miserable. I got myself through a year because the pay is really great for the relatively low amount of work- but they constantly change policies last minute which have substantial impact on your life, yet are treated as insignificant."
good,"A pesar de ser una buena empresa, son las personas las que van dejando huella en cuanto al manejo, en cuanto a la dirección.  Oracle Colombia no esta pasando por su mejor momento en lo que a estos dos aspectos se refiere."
good,Good amount of experience in Telecom Billing as business analyst and functional consultant. Had chance to interact with various stakeholders for requirement managemnt and solution designing.
good,Oracle policies are not contractors friendly.Suddenly one day they can tell you that there is no project work from tomorrow.
good,"I work for some wonderful people, but the cost cutting measures that have taken place have people feeling not so secure."
good,"My normal day at work begins at 7am.  I review emails and review the Executive's calendar and make adjustments as needed."
good,"There was a mismatch between the job as it was presented in the interview, and the job as I was expected to perform it on day one. This mismatch eventually led us to part ways... on my exit interview, I recommended that the interview process include a sample task."
good,"Cutthroat sales floor where some win and some lose. Not much support from management, high pressure. Overall great place to start as a college grad, not a place I would recommend building a career."
good,"Fun work place with support management."
good,The company is Okay to work for but you do not learn too much and I would not recommend this company for freshers. Also compensation is not too great.
good,But internally it is too much divided in many segments and you will learn only one part of the product and will never get opportunity to learn entire product. If you work in support then no work from home and you are expected to be on desk and accept all customer call in your 8 hours duration. Development guys are lazy and makes to many mistakes which makes Oracle products buggy. But still in terms of salary and benefits they pay above average as long as you do not stay very long.
good,Good to work.                                                                                   Good job/work life balance and good company to retire with but less Compensation/Benefits in comparison to other major companies.
good,Work Life Balance is good. Compensation and Growth can be more motivating. Appraisal need to be more regular and effective.
good,"Great benefits"
good,It really depends on who you know.  I find that managers are not open to discussing objectives and will do whatever they want no matter the cost to the employees moral.
good,"cool team members , Bad Management "
good,"I have been working on Exadata, Exalogic, SPARC Super cluster end to end support like incidents, change and problem management."
good,a good company to start with and very friendly environment but no monetary benifits
good,"Oracle is nice company to start the career as a fresher.It has been more than 3 years for working in this company but never felt that I have completed the tenure of 3yrs, such a friendly environment is in oracle."
good,Lack of communication of long term plans and strategy and how it affects individual groups.  Great pay and flexible hours and ability to work remotely.
good,"Well, there are lot of things to write about the work i do everyday. Below are few."
good,"Working environment is awesome "
good,Multicultural environment with opportunities to develop technical and leadership skills.
good,"Positive environment, but very demanding quota's.  Opportunity to make a lot of money and advance your career"
good,I am willing to learn new things at work and want to have challenging works with learning curve.
good,Flexibility and work life balance are the greatest benefits of working at oracle.
good,Excellent work life balance but not many growth opportunities
good,"Amazing Company with good work culture to work in, I had awesome time working with Oracle."
good,"Its fun and lively environment."
good,"Globe Enterprises is consultancy basses work place i was grate experience in that place"
good,Great people to work with. It's up to you to find the work-life balance. Top heavy. Hard to get good promotions and raises in a timely manner.
good,"I never received any type of on-boarding experience. I don't know who to go to for things and what resources are available to me. But I get paid well for an intern, I can work my own hours, and access to the gym is wonderful."
good,"With every passing day, I learn more about the RightNow product."
good,Very comfortable work environment with opportunities to work on a wide range of latest technologies.
good,"My typical day at work would involve creating and executing my Sales Campaigns, getting in touch either with existing Oracle Customers or new prospects, creating awareness about our products and generating/managing my pipeline."
good,Oracle offers excellent benefits and an inclusive culture. They are very big on helping the community that you live and work in.
good,"To be quick about it, Oracle is a massive and successful organization. Larry Ellison's personality and character trickles down to every crevice of the company. If you are motivated by 1) Money 2) Recognition and 3) Money, this might be the best place for you. For me, I'm motivated by satisfying customers, solving new problems, and overcoming difficult challenges. If you're looking for the work itself to be rewarding instead of simply the reward, I would not recommend Oracle to you."
good,"Best place to learn Oracle products"
good,"Company is very relaxed. Very little to learn. A day at work can usually be very slow, with not much work to do, especially during low times in the sales cycle."
good,"Not a employee friendly company. A very bad pay master.Career growth is very very slow."
good,"If you are looking for a dynamic workplace that innovates at the speed of light, please stay away from Oracle. It's a clunky, process driven, documentation-obsessed place where people would rather have you spend weeks in putting together documents, than doing something innovative or useful. All your great ideas will be dismissed, with the sentiment that ""Let's just focus on what we are asked to do"". "
good,"Its good to work there with friendly management team and collegues."
good,Its a good place to work with good work life balance and flexibility. Family time is abundant once you join here.  Growth is a little slow. Good place overall
good,"Great company, but hard to advance. Big Changes recently.  Cross team collaboration is difficult.  Compensation models do not effectively enable broader solution selling."
good,Great if you want a large company with little culture. Poorly organized with constant change and little direction. Still adjusting to changing programs and has no real plan for the future.
good,"Working at Oracle was a good experience. I was able to maintain work-family balance. My management was good. However, the growth opportunities are not many.  Also, the compensation is not at par with rest of the companies in the bay area."
good,"Some times you have lot of work and at other times you are completely free. Its an average place for learning and earning."
good,"We had to produce content very rapidly and at times it was very difficult. No SMEs available or willing to help get content produced. It would be nice to have a plan in place of who does what, when, and what the deadline is."
good,"Worked for more than 7 years. It was nice and enjoyed working init. The good thing about the company is work-life balance, team members, company culture, Medical insurance."
good,"The company is fine. They have a strong product, but as all major corporations go, there is more bureaucracy then anyone would want to admit. Pay is menial and will never go up as the bottom line for the stakeholders need to go up. If you are happy with a salary that won't move and your position will rarely change, this is the place for you."
good,This was a great job for a while.  They did allow work from home for support engineers which was nice.  Ultimately they laid many of us off and outsourced much of their technical support to South America.
good,"Oracle is a giant that moves at slow pace , lagging behind other tech companies on the Tech adoption, career advancement and benefits. But it certainly a place to work for , if one is looking for good work life balance with out much of career aspirations."
good,"Positive sales culture.  Little regard for the staff and their employment growth. "
good,Oracle was a good place to learn and grow my technology skills.   Oracle is a leader in relational database technologies and has many strong employees there.
good,"Work life balance, good exposure to development. Very open environment. Design and development ideas are considered irrespective of number of years of experience."
good,I was located at Bangalore office when i was working with Oracle. Team culture was very disconnected with the culture at USA office. Teams are working in isolation. Only senior leadership knows the dependencies across different products. Lack of team building activities.
good,"Oracle definitely values smart hard working people.  However, sometimes it is the technical people promoted to the highest ranks and they don't give sufficient independent decision making to their subordinates."
good,"Great products and great people really enjoyed my time there however, as Oracle pivots to the Cloud there are many challenges to be overcome and it will take a lot of hard work and a number of years to achieve the vision"
good,Great organization for entry level commercial professionals.   A lot of information to learn.  The most challenging issues revolve around contracts and due dilligence.
good,"Oracle places a strong emphasis to promote from within. However, organizational politics and lack of transparency make it hard to want to stay. It's a great place to start a career, not great long term."
good,"Good solutions for Supply Chain Management. "
good,Mixed culture driven by acquisitions.   Mixed management quality as well.  Oracle can be a place to thrive if you are in an division with good management.
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo pero sueldos bajos con bajo porcentaje en aumentos anuales.
good,"Dia a dia na equipe de BDCs é tranquilo, porém pega fogo nas equipes de vendas com pressao exagerada. Aprendi muito sobre vendas na empresa, tive bons treinamentos e o nome Oracle agrega muito no currículo, sem contar que BDC é pago um salário acima da média do mercado, porém não tive oportunidade para crescimento mesmo sendo o 2o em resultado de uma equipe de 10 pessoas. Há muitos nessa posição que ficam por 2, 3 ou até 4 anos sem promoção. "
good,"I did learn how to write SOWs and work with the finances behind SOW execution.  Management at the time was undergoing a transition, so that was a mixed experience."
good,"After acquisition there are some change, related to culture and benefits. Though Oracle is big brand but if compared to Aconex, it seems laking lot of things which are important for a heathy workplace."
good,"The corporate culture depends on which side of Oracle one works in: Oracle Corporate is a dinosaur and operates as if it is the 1990s, while Oracle Cloud is run like a modern company, at a fast pace with a good amount of dynamism."
good,"The team I was part of was acquired as part of Sun Microsystems, and was not typical of the rest of Oracle. We had fun, while it lasted: relaxed and creative. Worked with teams around the country and in Europe."
good,"Oracle India needs a revamp. Most of the projects are legacy and nothing new comes here to IDC. Even if it comes, the amount of work very very minute and negligible."
good,Ambiente competitivo y muy poca estabilidad laboral.
good,"Great legacy technology. Good front line managers. Still formulating and executing on future strategy. Great breadth of technology offerings on premise, Cloud still growing."
good,"Worked on several projects for the team, from working in sustaining to researching bugs to root cause. Learned to utilize GIT and Gradle. Used Unix shell scripting to ensure delivery of Engineered System OS delivery. Also used scripting knowledge to help add OLAP engine to Automation tools. "
good,Great and exciting technology but the business side of consulting may not be suitable for people who are mainly technically focused.  Sometimes feel forced to sell products and services.
good,"As a company Oracle seems to lack a culture. I struggled to help customers with support issues with little to no training on the Oracle products; they don't even have a training program setup for support engineers in most departments. The idea is to just show up and guess your way through things. Oracle will press for quick resolution and customer satisfaction, however, the do not understand what needs to be done to achieve those goals. They monitor stats which are faked by engineers to avoid being confronted by leadership. All and all, if you want a stable job that pays okay and has not real purpose, then this is the place for you."
good,"I was very happy with my work situation until it ended suddenly with little notice.  An Oracle re-org eliminated my position and I wasn't allowed to check other internal jobs for transfer.  Found out around 0900 and had to be out of the building by close of business."
good,"We can able to manage both Job work and Life balance."
good,"I like the technology but not the management."
good,They have the best work life balance. You can work from home which is added advantage. I had to work on same project and which got a bit monotonous. it was overall good.
good,Typical day is good. Management is good. Workplace culture is good. Love my job. Hardest part of my  job is noe. No more review than this. Work is overall good
good,"Excellence is not recognized. "
good,Classic workplace set on the typical oracle building. Equipped with all facilities. Flexible work hours and allowed to take as many breaks as required.
good,A typical day involved prioritizing customer issues and new projects that were being worked on. I dealt a lot with international customers providing me a good global exposure. I learned how extensive and detailed the framework of an ERP software needs to be. The most enjoyable part of the job was problem solving especially when dealing with production issues. The workplace culture enabled me to balance my work and life outside of it.
good,"Good Engineering work, full of challenge. Even though execution was"
good,Business atmosphere in which you need to make sure you are working on products that are deemed in the future of Oracle. Talented and personable people to work with.
good,"The work life balance is great. Management is average at best. Lots of egos and often a ""frat"" culture, lacking professionalism................................................."
good,"Attend review meetings for multiple supported Engineering teams addressing project schedules and obstacles for Engineers and Designers."
good,I had the chance to work in multiple technologies and interact with multiple customers.  Work-life balance is very good and my management is able to handle schedule changes easily.
good,"Hard work, challenging. fair workplace, with good benefits. the company has a positive and progressive atmosphere. They expect a lot of their employees."
good,"At times the place is relaxed and slow-paced, and at times it is fast-paced and can get a bit stressed.  It is not expected that you work all day and night, or even over the weekend.  Work from home is great, and not frowned upon as long as you don't abuse it."
good,"Great place to have a good work life balance, But no Job security nor career growth."
good,"Very flexible to maintain work life balance. "
good,Overall a good place to work; Productive and Fun workplace; Flexible work culture; Salary/Benefits below average. Lot of scope to learn new things. Great e libraries available.
good,"Lots of great things and lots of bad things. "
good,"Hard onboarding when join this company, poor training, the management looks like have not clear ideas about managing conflicts with employees, the quarter end is not easy for a lot of procedure that can be improved, good part of the employees is very friendly and helpfully."
good,"Constant fear of getting fired, when you are giving your best. No yearly raises and bonuses. Some stock options, sometimes. relaxed work environment. Management don't know how to make decisions, almost looks like hire and fire!"
good,"nice company with good onsite opportunity , lot of benefits and perks. good location. salary package is less, timing is very long in most of the projects"
good,"Miejsce pracy, w którym masz dostęp do najnowszych technologii."
good,"We enable our products for cloud infrastructure. which means that we need to interact with different teams but since General Availability date is constant, we strive hard as a team to make things happen. Apart from this am leading team who is driving the shift from SDLC process to Agile. All our traditional process and tools are getting upgraded to new aged technologies."
good,"Job is stable and work is good."
good,"Les plus :"
good,Oportunidade de trabalhar com outras culturas de outros países e aprender a utilizar o network de forma efetiva na difusão de conhecimento e na múltiplas formas de organizar o trabalho. Mudança constante nas prioridades e assuntos a serem resolvidos dispendendo uma constante motivação pelo conhecimento.
good,"The work isn't bad, basic cold calling and setting up meetings for a sales rep to close. My main issue is management. It feels like the company would rather hire 500 new college hires and allow them to find other work after one year than focus on maintain the employees they already have."
good,"Had to validate and book orders"
good,"Overall, decent company to work for when it comes to compensation for recent grads. However the way that numbers and pipeline are set up, they are realistically unattainable but people ""stretch"" actually pipeline to obtain these unrealistic numbers.  Other people who can't ""stretch"" are put under pressure to attain these numbers. Bonuses aren't fair the way they are set up but you deal with it."
good,Oracle are a good company to owork for and provide good benefits and salary. There is good management and storng knowledge in many fields of expertise.
good,"As much as I enjoyed my time in Oracle thanks to their work environment, pay hikes were a real pain. One paltry hike in four years says a lot. Also, two promotions with no monetary benefits was also disappointing."
good,"Teaching gets you in touched with different people and different businesses which makes it exciting. However, its a hit and miss. Companies don't always come to Oracle for training when there are more convenient ones outside."
good,Good for freshers to learn.You should be proactive towards work to learn otherwise will face challenges.Be careful at every step of work and colleagues.
good,"Great people, great technology but management does not value people that has been around for a long time. Good working environment and culture."
good,I enjoy working here as it provides immense resources to develop the skills. Would be perfect place to work if they can compensate well. Good facilities like Ergonomics.
good,"You'll have scope to learn and implement new technologies."
good,Work is challenging due to the different issues presented by the various products.  My technical skill set has grown because of the different application I have to learn and support.
good,"Interesting job, nice people, great work-life balance. "
good,"It is a self-service company, that is facing a huge business transformation. It is a very dynamic environment."
good,developind reports using oracle OBIEE and APEX was a wonderful experience.I had an opportunity to work under a  mentored and learned a lot about oracle products.
good,"Its good working environment. "
good,"Oracle is a great company to begin a career in tech sales.  However, compensation is relatively low compared to other industry standards and the commission structure is complex making it difficult to track commissions."
good,"Met and made good friends in the organization. Had good and supportive managers. There were training programs available for the employees which are a good initiative for improving one's work. Moreover, the culture of team offsite for team bonding is good and important to understand each other and work well in the team."
good,"Oracle is a large company whose focus is on growth, not employees."
good,The best thing I like about Oracle is flexible working and good work life balance. The senior management is great they are wonderful leaders
good,Great direct management team - good work life balance. Teleworking full time. Excellent and supportive co-workers and managers.
good,"- Productive with effective communication skills and strong analytical skills."
good,"Corporate Work culture"
good,"Oracle es una compañía con buenos beneficios para sus empleados lo cual te hace sentir satisfecho y te deja concentrarte mas en los objetivos del negocio. Las personas que trabajan allí en general son muy profesionales y se maneja un esquema de oficina abierta a todos los niveles de la organización incluyendo el presidente de la compañía."
good,The company Oracle acquired had poor management and very inefficient for a software company. Oracle's shadow has helped.
good,Work is little chilled out. But learning is slow. Average Pay.
good,"As much as the work itself is enjoyable and varied, the possibilities to grow within the company is quite limited."
good,"un dia tipico de trabajo fue recibir los casos pendientes por el equipo en India para trabajarlos durante el día, ademas de informarme de los inconvenientes y desarrollos pendientes en ese turno."
good,Interaction and good opportunities to explore new fields for enhancing knowledge
good,"A typical day at Oracle is making 40 to 50 calls a day to generate new business. Something that I've learned from Oracle is that in sales. in order to sustain valuable working business relationships we must first take care of the customer and not worry about the amount of a deal size.My Co-worker are great, we are all around the same age, it's refreshing to meet such young individuals from different backgrounds and time zones across the United States, all get together and maintain a professionalism and drive that most people our age do not exhibit. Although Oracle is a great company to be apart of,there are a few not so great parts about my job. One difficult attribute of my job is patience. As we all know while working in sales it is very important to have patience during sales cycles.On the other hand, Oracle does have a wonderful culture of business professionals who are eagerly waiting to teach and develop you as a technical sales consultant."
good,"Tell us about:"
good,"Oracle is a one of the reputed company in the world."
good,"They only focus about work, nothing else.  No other social activities, or any outing, maybe because most of the team are speared out and works from home.  Working environment is very isolated. But my boss want me to be ON-SITE...yes oh wait.. what??"
good,Have flexibility to expand your job profile to other geographies of the world.
good,I love my job and the new challenges every now and then. This keeps me motivated to do something more each and every day.
good,"Oracle Consulting provides expert consultants."
good,"Ok place to work. Besides health benefits, not very employee friendly. Very few tools for managers to reward employees"
good,"I am responsible for the sales of company core products for the Health, Universities and Public Sector"
good,Lateral transfer from partner company General Dynamics. Worked with Oracle less then 1 year and then laid off.
good,It shows
good,"Fun place to work. Benefits are great, different choices for medical/dental/vision plans. Great paternity and maternity leave policies. All good until you are laid of, due to org restructuring even you are the best player it the team"
good,"Oracle is a good company to work for if you enjoy working for a large corporation.  There is room for advancement and continued education, certifications, etc."
good,In oracle it all depends on your bonding with your manager. Work life balance is good. Job Security is there. Salary is average but better than any service based company.
good,"Good Job Work/Life Balance"
good,Productive and work-life balance. Overall the experience was good. Learning curves were not that great but yes for 1-3 years of experience candidate could be manageable.
good,"Oracle is a good place to start your career, but the career growth is extremely slow. You have to be really motivated to learn on your own and move ahead."
good,Oracle is a great place to work if you value consistency in your life. Management is very helpful and field reps are very knowledgeable. Products lead the industry.
good,"Dias com picos de trabalho"
good,"It's very good to work at oracle given you enter into the correct team."
good,"Good Work life balance."
good,"I found out quickly sales was not for me, so my experience was not great. However, the culture is somewhat laid back and benefits are good. If you are committed to making cold calls day in and day out, then the job is worth it. If not, take another job."
good,working in Oracle for last 5 years. Life is good at Oracle. Flexible timing and work from home is available. But visibility is less for appraisal and increment.
good,Started with little knowledge of how a pcb board was designed and ended up being one of the people responsible for all processor boards and test fixtures.
good,"Job looks good on your resume. Pays well but you earn it working above and beyond. "
good,"My typical day includes calls to different departments within my 25 assigned accounts. followup calls, customer visits and  product meetings. I have learned that the largest company doesn't always do things in the most efficient manner. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with my long term customers. The hardest part is changing customers every year."
good,"Project Manager for Business Intelligence Database implementation and training of client employees.  Fast paced, had to hit the ground running.  Moved from one job to another with no training or assignment consultation.  Assignments were world wide and enjoyable."
good,"For me, I worked with a great team and was isolated from other company activities. The immediate management was hands off and allowed us to perform our duties with minimal interaction."
good,Definitely a good place to work directly out of school but can be very stressful. A lot of this job depends on what territories you're given and there can be quite a bit of inequality between people.
good,Worked for 17+ years. Fantastic benefits. Great work-life balance. A bit hierarchical. Career upside potential quite limited. Middle management can get bloated.
good,Oracle has great work life balance but after sometime you won't get much chalenging work or will get a chance to learn something new. Everythign you have to learn on your own.
good,"Oracle has good products and if you are working on the ""right"" product, you will be compensated nicely."
good,"Oracle was very good to work at, for a while - however senior management made too many changes that have forced top talent to leave as of recent.  Oversaturated territories coupled with cut throat ""forecasting"" rules have been a major cause for this."
good,Oracle is a good company to work for and I had a great deal of exposure to various federal clients. The location is good and provided a good network of people.
good,paid well but alot of the ability to succeed relies on other people. Mangement was okay for me but I know that isn't the case for most. Forward movement is on you.
good,"Constantly improving software, lot's of support for customers."
good,"I've been working with many brilliant people in Oracle. Sometimes, the sparks during meetings and discussion can really get people excited. However, the direction the company is going and the way the management is handling the direction are just not that promising. If there is little hope, I'd rather stay with good life-work balance, great benefits and interesting people."
good,Because  of flexible timings work isgood.Learn new technology .But the salary hike is minimal.Good team and much more to learn from peers.Overall there is work life balance
good,"Fun workplace. Lots of different kinds of work and learning. Workculture is great. Salary is not comparatively high. Anytime loved this place learning new technologies. Environment is amiable. Management gives lots of challenges new projects, new technologies"
good,I loved working with folks at Oracle. The benefits were great. Oracle has a lot of great resources. however they do a very poor job on working with them to plan and build their careers within the company.
good,"what policy benefits you get, what kind of life you have, its all dependent on your managers. for instance while the company permits WFH, many of the managers do not. "
good,"Oracle is a big company, so learning and developing here is self-driven. On the sales engineering side you are solving some great problems and have some good tools at your disposal to do so with. Definitely have to watch out for work-life balance as it can demand a lot of time. You also have to do a lot of self-promotion and managing upwards. Management can be a toss-up (some are really good and others not so - true of most places)"
good,"Involved in FP&A activities viz."
good,"Oracle is a company you should be joining at the time of retiring and definitely not at the start of your career. That said, there are few teams, only a handful where you can expect to get better work."
good,Too many competing forces for the same products. Lack of clarity for growth. Products are shifting and growth can be fully dependent upon the product group that you are in.
good,"Very Cool Environment,"
good,"Great atmosphere at work working together as a team. "
good,"I learned a lot about Cloud, how to improve cloud launches, how to improve performance testing."
good,"Great work life balance and this will make you lazy. good place for lazy people and who likes to retire peacefully .Snail pace growth, bad hikes . please dont expect hike in minimum of 3 years no matter how well you work. although its not the complete oracle. The above comments are for Oracle University line of business."
good,A typical day at work is dealing with different request from different teams. You learn how to prioritize in tasks. Team Management great.
good,"Good work life balance but bad employee benefits . The cloud transformation has been confusing so far and the management is confused on which direction to go,"
good,"Flexible timings is the key thing here. You are also allowed to work from home. Amazing place to work, except a bit problem in management."
good,Its fun to work here. But I work for Night shift. Also the process is getting automated. This is the main reason for change.
good,"If you aren't adaptable, this probably isn't a job for you. Your entire work environment can vary from day to day if you haven't been permanently placed. The management office can be a little tedious, but the workers are awesome."
good,"no career improvement here! If you got in a good team that uses some buzz word technology, you are good to stay. Otherwise, avoid this place"
good,"It is world Top-2 software development company. My current role is :   IT Principal Consultant, Enterprise Operations. Fun place to work and will get opportunity to move any other interested projects."
good,"•	Transition of Global customer agreements process "
good,"Work at Oracle Pvt Ltd is a greta place to excel in one's career."
good,"It is great place to work when it comes to team mates, but when it comes to management worst. They dont utilize the resources well"
good,"I have been enjoying working with oracle. I learned Oracle ADF, SOA and JAVA here from scratch. Here co-workers are very friendly in nature. Management do not care to maintain valuable resources. I have been working on oracle adf , soa and java from starting. I typical day at work was when I did not know SOA and they gave me webservice project but I learned SOA and now I can proudly say I know Oracle SOA."
good,"A 8 to 4 work culture, with lots of brain storming and creative learning every day with every new project."
good,"Territories are very small and management does not have the discretion to balance."
good,Good scope to learn ..Flexible working hours .Employee friendly.
good,"The company is good for experienced people, as it has a good work Environment and the Management gives opportunity to all deserving people. But it comes to remuneration part, there is no hike nor bonus, nor any revision of salary after promotion"
good,This company is good. There is is a good work life balance and above average payout. Overall one should stay in this company for long time.
good,Good workplace with a great work/life balance. Everyone at work has a pleasant attitude and is generally great to work with.
good,"Work day 8-5"
good,"good place to work , good management ,lots of things to learn "
good,Good and friendly work culture. Huge scope for professional development. good management. friendly an supportive co-workers
good,cool and cooperative environment where one can adjust easily and learn a lot from its peers.
good,Oracle is a good company to work with due to job security and good work environment.
good,Requires work related travel trips. Multiple client exposure.
good,"Overall its ok to work here. Good for work life balance, slow in pay hike , good for learning new tech. Many internal job opening which can be accesible easily and you can switch job internally."
good,"i learned a lot about being a machinist, discipline an hard work helped me learn other machines. this job also help me learn how to handle uncomfortable situations, problem solving, an machine maintenance"
good,"Productive and Fun work place with ping pong tables , a good gym , and with indoor games."
good,It was OK until they laid me off.  Very brutal with how they handled manpower situations. Expected 12 hours days and only paid for 6 hours. Ok if your just getting into the business and want to learn but experience counted for nothing with the company.
good,"Good work-life balance. Many people call it the ""Retirement company"". A lot depends on management and which organization though. If the work is laid back then t's pretty much dead and not much scope to grow and improve. "
good,"I would recomend to people interested in sales, if not this is not the right place for you. Culture can seem a little like college. Great place for training however."
good,"I made many friends on my sales team and had plenty of good times working in the office, it was a great way to start my Solutions sale experience, would tell anyone who is starting off in corporate sales that this is the place to do it."
good,"Excelente empresa para se trabalhar, porém depende muito da área que irá atuar a forma de remuneração é tão atrativa que você vicia em ganhar muito dinheiro."
good,"Good company to settle down, if you are not expect regular salary hikes and growth in your career."
good,"People are great to work with, management is great.  The problem is that Oracle doesn't give pay increases, probably only to management, and I'm not in management.  Also, workload is quite severe, more than 60 horus per week.  Benefits are great."
good,"You do your job, you get paid. "
good,"I really dont want to write much review."
good,"If I had the opportunity I would go back to work for Oracle America!"
good,Fun place to work with great work life balance but salary hike is not up to the mark. If you want a great work life balance with great salary join here
good,I have found the work environment conducive to growth in the field and working with customers was a great experience.  PMO was involved in providing guidance and training.  Typically we were responsible for multiple installation projects or 1 large software deployment project or projects involving multiple deliverable's offering a wide variety of challenges.  Managed customer calls offered autonomy and opportunity to interact and build relationships that offered new project opportunities.
good,"I work to resolve customer issues via the Service Request Process. I troubleshoot, and replicate the problem. If problem is found, I file a product defect. I will advise my customer when the fixes are available. I document the SR process and create KM to help the engineers in the organization. "
good,No one really cares if you are good at finishing up the given assignments on time. You will be highly recognised for the work you do and also will be provided with all the benefits you deserve
good,"As an ex-Sun Microsystems employee, Oracle doesn't treat us not as good as people who work in software divisions in compensation, raise or bonus. Company is also slowing moving away from old SPARC processors and servers. Concentrating on Cloud computing against Amazon and Microsoft could be a tough challenge."
good,"Oracle is the place where you can get a great start as a fresher."
good,"My learning never stops but will like to lead a team always. Freedom at work is what I like and its an open atmosphere"
good,Being a new project I guess it was hard for everybody but in the same time we all grew as a family. A big lesson for everybody was that the only thing that remains the same is change.
good,"Most Comfort zone to work and have fun at the same time."
good,Good work culture but more of process managment rather than people managemet. The percentage of a salary hike is very low even if the the performace rating is very good.
good,Oracle is a great first job out of college- I've learned a ton about the technology industry especially being in the heart of the tech bubble in Silicon Valley.
good,Nice balanced work life balance with good pay package.. Good company to retire from if you want to lead a peaceful life. Be ready for regular layoffs every 6 months..
good,"Wonderful work environment, flexible and great place to learn"
good,"Good working environment..."
good,"Pros - "
good,"Im proud to be part of Oracle.The work-culture at oracle is commendable.The most enjoyable part of my job is ownership,freedom  that I get while working.The management is open to new ideas & motivate people to implement it."
good,"The Management, People are very supportive."
good,"I enjoyed working in my previous job, learning different progams made my job easy. I enjoy challenges and working within a team."
good,Lots of learning on different business protocols. Quarter ends are really challenging and also enjoyable but sometimes it is difficult to maintain the balance between professional and personal life. 
good,"Very good work environment that offered numerous amenities like onsite gym, postal, dry cleaning, restaurants, etc."
good,It good's place to work if you want to balance your personal and professional growth. Reason if you are looking for long term career in that case you will have to forget about your career growth as per market standard. Also it is manager managed organization no role of HR in term of employee growth and appraisal assessment. So if you are not very close to your manager then you will have to compromise in your career growth. Also Management believe in taking fresh minds rather than promoting to existing employees. Learning opportunity is infinite but you can't use those skills in real time. Co-workers are very co-operative .
good,"Fun place to work,friendly co workers"
good,"ogni giorno imparo nuove cose, non solo al posto di lavoro ma da per tutto. come in oracle c'era il contratto, e fattura che dovevo verificare che bisonava essere preciso, analizzare i gli informazione, uno sbaglio e l'entita perde una somma di soldi. e quindi perforza uno deve tenere gli occhi aperti. allora per la mia vita quelloche ho imparato è essere preciso."
good,"Great health plans, work-life balance, ping pong table, cafe etc. Colleagues are good and approachable and friendly. However, the overall culture is a bit strict and shy."
good,"1) Flexible working hours"
good,"Oracle is a great job if it's your first job. There is a lot of autonomy and you essentially make your own schedule day to day. Internal tools and processes are difficult and slow due to the size of the company and their insisting that we use only Oracle software internally. There is a lot of administrative work that we have to do that takes away from time we could spend prospecting/working on actual deals. Overall, I've felt that the job has taught me basic selling skills but that there is a lack of teaching from the manager/director level. Either you have a manager that is a ""super rep"" and works all of your deals for you or you have a manager that isn't well suited to lead, teach or develop sales reps. It's hard to find a great manager."
good,I have liked the work at Oracle but since I have got into a comfortable zone I want to break the jinx and move ahead. Salary has been another concern since I am looking at getting paid well
good,"I haven't received a raise with Oracle yet. I am a legacy employee, who was told that things would be different with Oracle. I seen some changes as far as the office is concerned, but not as far as compensation."
good,"I had a very good experience at Oracle. I enjoyed my time over there."
good,A typical day at work was vary laid back. The culture there was very friendly. Management was nice and very easy to get along with. The most enjoyable part of the job is when they would have cookouts during the spring and summer months.
good,"I wishs ome changes in process and culture, but nothing drastic. We even benefitted from the college recruiting program. Compensation for sales and benefits. Great customers. 401k and stock very good. Great products, development and support organization. Wonderful headquarters"
good,"Great first job"
good,Great place to work. I enjoy my time there and would suggest it to someone looking to start their career in sales. You can learn how to prospect for your career.
good,"As a Senior System Administrator my job was fast paced and busy. I worked alone at my site, and was the only onsite person there for local Computer support. My management was great and even though they were remote, they did not need to micro manage me. We had weekly meetings with my manager and team. Everyone in my office was friendly. The hardest part of my job was trying to help everyone within the my work hours, and frequently helped people at night if they had issues after hours and were unable to work. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I completed a project on time or when I was able to resolve a troublesome issue."
good,Oracle Retail is a LOB that has plenty of opportunities for innovation and ideas. The training and support provided the peers and the management makes you feel motivated.
good,"Takes good care of its employees. Pay and benefits are superb. Many opportunities to advance. Managers are, on the whole, receptive and involved in their teams' success without micromanaging. Services being sold are top-of-the-line. However, success is partially dictated by being able to navigate the complex corporate structure. As a business development employee, my quota was partially based on which leads my sales counterpart would approve, which, in turn, were based on what the higher-ups approved. At times, this made for unnecessary competition. This structure may have changed since my departure, however. This is an ever-changing company, and the best employees adapt quickly."
good,"Compensation wise it is a great company for NCGs to start a career.Great talents and great management in our group. I really like to work here."
good,"Basically it depends upon the team you are in, but the overall work culture of this company is excellent and definitely a good place to work in the only drawback being the hikes, as there are rarely any hikes and promotions."
good,It is very good for Retirement.But it is not good for initial stage.Month end times you will feel pressure.Remaining Days you won't feel Pressure.Scope of Learning is not Much.
good,Slow at Increments and Promotions. Overtime allowances are good and so is the work-life balance. Strong brand name that helps in your career. My manager was pretty cool at granting leaves and generous with performance ratings. Just had to manage work properly and they wont bug you.
good,"Lot of scope to learn."
good,"Oracle is good company to work with with excellent work life balance. It has good liberal policies."
good,"It is fun working at Oracle, but at my office in particular, if you are looking for job advancement expect a two year wait. Kind of like an extension of college."
good,"Oracle is a very, very large company and it can be tough to navigate at times.  The internal tools and systems change often and it seems there is not always an alignment within the company for using a CRM, marketing tools, sales tools, etc. "
good,If you want to settle down oracle is best but if you are looking for money better look somewhere else cause here hike is very rare . No new skills will be added to your skill set
good,"Lo mejor es la gente que trabaja ahí. La organización funciona bien, pero los sueldos se mantienen iguales durante mucho tiempo."
good,"Employee oriented culture, Flexible hours, Good learning and development, Voice is heard by top management, Sometimes laid back in some decision making"
good,"Very good company, No pressure, Good management. Flexibility"
good,"Being a part of  Development Team in Oracle for a Enterprise product in  AppsOrg which is almost four decade old tech stack the Refactoring and Enhancing to a new tech stack is the Oracle strategy  . With this focus on , a new release  with latest features in J2EE specifically using  framework like Strut2/MVC  and Spring with Hibernate/Toplink , Facelet with JSF 2.0 , Web2  standard are list of new upliftment to this product."
good,i hav leant many things here in oracle and how to b a part of a organization and
good,If all you want is relaxation and job security you can join here. The company just buys startups and gets their customers. They didn't come up with a new product by themselves for many years. They are still using obsolete technologies because people are using their products.
good,"Secure job with too good life and work balance, but Monetary growth is less"
good,Oracle is great place to work for the benefits and the unique amazing people who you will work with. The only downfall is that fact that I have only seen just a couple raises from people I have worked with in roughly 3 years.
good,"Overall its good place to work. Flexible work hours, very nice work environment."
good,"Working at Oracle/Taleo I have learned the HR tracking applications.   Within this application, I am supporting existing clients, consultants with basic configuration questions and bug related issues.   Working on this application requires indepth troubleshooting skills, patience, excellent customer service skills."
good,"Depending in which line of business you are in the life in Oracle can be totally different. "
good,"IT is dry and processes are long. If you don't mind that, this is a great place to work. Really good training (sometimes too much). "
good,"It was great experience working for oracle, it was challenging in initial days but once got used to process started getting into reporting, preparing dashboard reports."
good,"you get so much assistance on a daily basis that grooms you and develops you as a person,i have been given initiative to do what is best for the team,my manager allows me to express myself and gives me the best support to achieve great results,my co-workers are a great team to work with, it gets tough when my technician is not available and i have to deal with a technical issues. i love this job,you feel in control and that boosts one's self esteem."
good,i am very happy in oracle a typical day at work
good,Amazing infrastructure.
good,"I worked under constant threats from Sales who saw Contracts as a hurdle to their quarterly sales quota.  Either I approved a bad deal (Sales never involved Contracts until a week before quarter end) or, Corporate was upset because we approved a deal that ended up being bad for the company.  I never felt like anyone had my back, except for my manager, who was in the same position as me."
good,Was an excellent place to work but has changed due to a mismanaged transformation effort at Oracle Consulting. Work/life balance has turned for the worst.
good,"Just work nothing but work , no fun no bonuses no cash insentives etc... just do work heads down .                              thats  all I say , Management is not interested in growth"
good,"Oracle india is a different company as compared to other parts of Oracle I've worked at.Very very hierarchical & worst management."
good,"I traveled all over North America, so my office was an airplane and meetings were somewhere in North Americal several times a weeks."
good,Was on contract basis. i have not satisfied with the way oracle treat the employees. some of my colleagues also left because of no salary hike as well as on contract basis.
good,"Oracle provides you with all the tools and documentation to learn new technologies and stay ahead. Working at Oracle, one definitely need to have a god-father to go up in the ladder at this Organization as there is no proper appraisal process at Oracle to get promotions based on true merit."
good,"Uma otima empresa, localização otima. Ambiente competitivo, cultura self service, beneficios otimos."
good,As a fresher was very new to the IT world but my DBA team made it so easy and most memorable out of all. Made good friends who are also my guide in my professional journey. Thank you guys again for the support.
good,"Good working environment working with some very talented people, which is the best part of the job. There is a constant turnover of new things happening. Change is the only constant. Good chances to move around but a very hire and fire culture in which whole departments can suddenly be moved abroad and closed down. People are not really considered in Oracle, they are considered only as a resource (HR is know as the ""Human Capital' department. Also, there are never any pay rises, ever, not even cost of living rises. What you start on is what you remain on unless you get promoted or move to a new job, which can be tough. Learning is self-driven for the most part but access to online media and training is freely available but you need to want it."
good,"goo place to settle with a best package"
good,"Fine place to work, but being laid off without warning always leaves a bad taste."
good,The job was a short contracted event coordinator position for two events happening in my home town. This was an amazing opportunity to boost my resume and network with people. The expectation was very clear from the get go- the hours are long and the work ethic needs to be high. Overall great opportunity and I love talking about it to this day.
good,"Good benefit package, flexible working hours. Not much career growth, Inferior work culture. Very poor work ethics. HR is a joke."
good,"Internal processes and systems cumbersome to manage, and lack control of accounts and deal cycles due to field sales rep. Compensation has changed several times and never received bump in pay due to tenure or performance."
good,The quarterly schedule makes for a very busy end of almost every quarter. The only thing worse is an end of quarter when things are not busy. Expectations for production can be unrealistic.
good,Enjoyed my colleagues and management when based out of the Northern VA office in Reston. The Denver tech center experience brought about starkly different management that tended towards micromanagement yet with little communication.
good,Making the numbers was priority number one.  Departments were segmented and everyone was overworked. It was difficult to navigate the HR systems and difficult to know who to contact for help or information.
good,"you need to have a very hard skin and be able to maintain a high level of self-motivation.  Job, pay and training advancements are rare and employees below the top three are completely replaceable parts. Employees at all levels enter and leave the company completely without internal notice or mention."
good,A typical day would be to prospect and cold call future prospects.
good,"Best place to learn Oracle products"
good,Oracle is really very nice place to work with friendly  culture and facilities are very good but there is no growth and salary increment though you are critical resource and doing your best.
good,Working at Oracle has been very Competitive. You learn a lot. During my stint of 5 years there I have travelled a lot and have worked with more than 200 customers.
good,Management was cool and nice. So was it all bad but physical labor at the end of the day is always hard. But i did enjoy it and I learned a lot. Like anywhere else you just keep working hard no matter what.
good,"No job security in Oracle Cloud. Too many recent firings."
good,"Tipca giornata: lettura e presa in carico delle mail,  controllo fatture e revenue e invio ai colleghi indiani dei template per la fatturazione"
good,Good pay. Management is well trained to help you succeed. However with the size of the company there are lots of redundancies and it can be hard to see the impact you are making with your efforts.
good,"For a short term, very good place to work."
good,"Oracle is a fine place to work. However, there is very little upward movement and it's a game of random chance on being promoted. If you get the luck of the draw and have a highly complex deal with lots of people involved, you'll likely get promoted. If you're able to keep your head down and do your work while going under the radar, you will likely not get noticed."
good,Worked in Oracle as a Team leader. Had great learnings and some of the core challenges were managing work life balance particularly during quarter close and year ends. They were really tough. Overall Good place to work if you are outside LFYS.
good,"Good company to work for with decent benefits and pay but always have the threat of a layoff looming over you."
good,"Good place to work, opportunities to learn multiple technical fields as Oracle offers huge hardware - software stack. Not competitive in compensation compared to other bay area companies."
good,Company is good to work for. The work environment is excellent and compensation benefits are good. The job security is minimum although depends in which departmental organization one is working.
good,"Oracle is a great company to put on your resume. Came into the program through a transitional program for college students. Subsequently, the pay was not where it needs to be. Management is weak and with the ever changing direction of the company, internal workflows are constantly changing as well. AMAZING benefits"
good,"Large company with many different teams working on many aspects of database, hardware, and software development. Some ability to move around internally, but career development is left up to you."
good,Some managers are good and some are terrible. You can do well if you have the right one. I recommend doing your research on what the territory is you'll be working.
good,Oracle makes a great product but the culture can be tough for new employees. There are great people there but the company culture keeps folks on edge.
good,"I learned a lot working at Oracle."
good,Great place to work depending on your manager. I've been with Oracle for 19 years and overall it is a great place to work.  I have worked in support development and in sales
good,Las promociones no significan mas salario. El ambiente carece de seriedad
good,Constant turnover with both management and the sales floor.  Internal processes can be the most difficult part of this job.
good,"Just working on Assigned Task."
good,"This can be a difficult place to be depending on the product set and territory you cover. If you are lucky you might find yourself with a territory that is ready to embrace Oracle technology, if not it can be like pushing a boulder up a mountain, only to see it roll back down the other side."
good,I worked for Oracle for 12 years. The support of your direct manager means success or failure. There criteria for success is the short term goal even if you have the opportunity to work across departments.
good,"Good Work Life Balanace . But they lack working on new technologies."
good,"Possui um ambiente ótimo para trabalhar mas tem uma cultura de competição muito forte entre os funcionários que muitas vezes causa estresse, por outro lado isso também gera resultados para a empresa !"
good,"Wonderful team.  Good work/ life balance. Good benefits, onsite gym, onsite cafeteria. Challenging to move outside of the position you were hired for.  Raises are few and far between."
good,"Es una empresa donde solo importa el Revenue, todo lo demás es maquillaje."
good,"Typical behavioral/personality type questions such as: Tell me about yourself, tell me about a time when you disagreed with your manager...what did you do? If you are offered a job, be sure to negotiate for as high a salary as possible. Oracle is notorious for not giving raises...even with promotions. I did not get a single raise the entire time I worked there (6 years this time around and 3 years previously)."
good,"Oracle was OK to work for."
good,"I like working at Oracle and being able to work remotely is definitely an advantage as it gives me flexibility on where and when.  Everyone's experience is going to be mostly impacted by their direct management and this is definitely the case for myself.  While some internal groups have opportunities for growth, the group that I am in is stagnant because the VP doesn't value his team other than a means to an end."
good,"Support department, not too enjoyable because of too many restrictions. For example, could not take vacation when desired, needed to consult with manager before planning."
good,"My day consists of working with my customer base and working through the system issues. What I have learned in my position I learned on my own and through speaking with my team. There wasn't any formal training when we first began in the department. The management does not truly understand the riggers of the position since they do not do what we do everyday. The expectation is unrealistic sometimes given the issues we face on a daily basis. Procedures change regularly which makes it hard to give the kind of service our client base deserves. This makes the job more difficult than it needs to be. The best part of the job is going to the office and collaborating with my team. They are a great group of people and work very hard, everyday, to meet the goals that are put on us."
good,"Oracle creates his growth with acquisitions more than with new customers. "
good,"Good company to work for.  Flexible schedule, good benefits acceptable salary.  Mostly friendly if not nice, colleagues.  Provides free 'healthy' drinks, ping pong and billards."
good,"Good experience"
good,You work to fight for business within customers while keeping other Oracle reps away.  The culture promotes this and I'm pretty sure this is done intentionally.
good,If you worked hard and were in a great territory with a good product you could make a lot of money and advancements were plentiful. The inverse was also true.
good,"Weekly travel to job sites, well controlled project progress, not much room for true innovation. Enjoyed the variety of customers and focus on ability to focus on domain expertise in projects exclusively."
good,"Nice place to work at"
good,"Oracle is a good company to work for with respect to access to Oracle University (OU) courses and when it comes to taking time off.  However don't expect to get a raise.  If a raise is given it is generally such a small percentage that it qualifies as better than nothing but it won't make a difference with or without it.  Good managers are few and far between most are simply mouth pieces for upper management, with very little daily interaction with those they are supervising.  I will end with a good note, My direct managers have been very good about not micro managing.  They allow me to do my job and simply provide the necessary requirements and expectations."
good,"Work is hectic during Quarter ends"
good,Great company to work for.  As an African- American male who has worked in primarily white male dominated industries I loved the diversity that exists at Oracle!
good,"Fast paced. I worked remotely, so it's difficult to feel assimilated in terms of culture.  Most of my interactions with the various internal teams was extremely positive and everyone if dedicated to doing well.  Really smart people!"
good,I started as a pot washer kitchen assistance but due to the rush in the kitchen and my qwick eye to details and qwick learning I was promoted to coming chef and helped prep and prepare food from hand made burgers  freshly mare currys ect your typical  chain food restaurant food.
good,Oracle India Management sucks. They can do much better in cloud domain. The local leadership is visionless. They can achieve much more with the talent and offerings they have
good,"Work in a high intensity environment supporting data warehouse support t.o include multitenant , parallel execution, materialized views, heat map, olap and performance"
good,"Bad management. Good work life balance. No growth unless you switch jobs. Compensation is good. Recently seems to be caught up in Cloud Frenzy, trying to catch up."
good,"The employees at Oracle are great, many will continue to be lifetime friends.  I worked for SUN/Oracle for 18 years before being laid off, I wasn't surprised by the layoff, company made a directional change that made my job obsolete.  My manager at Oracle will continue to be a good friend of mine."
good,You work at various sites that are mostly high end apartments. Can be good or bad depending on building management. Most supervisors are nice and courteous. Sometimes can lack communication. Most residents are nice.
good,Beginning to lose ground to other cloud vendors. Mgmt structure old fashioned. Amazing place to potentially make alot of money.
good,"Oracle is a big American company."
good,"Oracle so far has been a great place to work.  Such a wealth of knowledge available at your fingertips.  I have enjoyed the ""true"" open door policy of all that work there.  There is a peer environment, not higher up versus worker mentality.  However, there is a lack of appreciation merit wise.  It is very difficult to increase your income once you are in."
good,"Empresa inovadora, propicia a estrutura e remuneração adequada para realização dos trabalhos."
good,"The job was challenging and rewarding. Unfortunately, management was more active in resolving customer complaints that in managing people and careers."

good,Had a great experience working for them. Typical day at work consists of using useless spread sheets to track your deal cycles.
good,Constantly changing atmosphere.  Too much outsourcing is done.
good,"In general the day is very good and the co-workers are great.  We are a problem solving group that works hard to complete a task, doing so as a group at times.  Currently however there is no job movement and I would like to move into something with more of a challenge."

good,It was nice working in Oracle. People are very supportive and helpful. There is so much of learning in Oracle. All the managers are friendly and supportive
good,Worked with a lot of great people. Company culture however left much to be desired. Great company to learn in by facing many challenges both from the complex internal bureaucracy to the complex sales situations in the field. I believe being able to navigate this backdrop successfully has given me the tools for future challenges.
good,Excellent opportunities to work in new technologies across the globe. There is very good work life balance. Trabel opportunities are plenty. Work can be done remotely or from office. If you enjoy learning new technology then the hardest part of the job will not be an issue. Organisation supports the cause of women
good,This company does not micro manage.  You are given a little bit of training in the beginning but after that you are to learn the career on your own with the help of online resources along with help from teammates.  You are given work and required to get it done in an appropriate amount of time.
good,A workplace offering lots of exposure to all pillars of Oracle Business. Working face to face with customers identifying their concerns and providing first class assistance.
good,"Oracle is a huge company. I can only speak to my division.  It seems that Oracle doesn't have a single identity. Its identity and culture is driven by individuals in leadership positions. One leader in one area may create a great culture, while another leader in another area may create a horrible culture.  There are both excellent managers/leaders and there are terrible managers/leaders. If you're lucky to get into the right part of the organization, you can look forward to an excellent experience. "
good,Broad portfolio of software and services which provides a breadth of capabilities and opportunities.  Global presence with teams widely distributed.  Empowering culture.
good,"* A typical day was to come in check emails, check notifications for outages, work on tickets for the team, meetings and status updates.  this made up about 50% of my time.  The other spent reviewing/remediation of audits for SOC2, PCI, and HIPAA compliancy across the entire GBUCS environment, project work which typically consisted of scripting automation solutions, POCs for new product evaluations and lastly infrastructure  build-outs for new datacenters."
good,"People have high energy and are very action-oriented, willing to put lots of effort to deliver results, but culture may involve too much workplace politics, with an orientation to focus on short-term results."
good,"V. Good Place to work if you like to be in a sales organization."

good,"like most of the Big corporation, work life at oracle is challenging and fast paced. We have continually changing deliverables and we get to learn tons of new technologies. It is fun."
good,Great healthcare benefits. Can stagnate for years without promotions. Too many people to compete. VPs are not competent. They want to make management happy even though product might suffer.
good,Experience in each department will be different. Management lets you take autonomy of your work. Business pressures are part of the game in most tech industries these days.
good,"Oracle technology is great to work with. Good to have these skills on your resume. Even though it entered late into the public cloud domain, the breadth and depth of the services offered are incredible!"
good,"Good company to work for but bad management failed to recognize and promote the employees to the next level. Pay is below the market value. No other additional benefits compensation - RSU, bonus."
good,The company requires seasoned employees who will be able to deal with fast-paced work environment. Employees mostly work from home which cut down a lot of commuting time.
good,"No mide tiempo personal versus laboral, orientada a resultados y sumamente politica"
good,"Enjoy working for Oracle and while not perfect, glad to be with a well-branded tech company.  Health benefits are great.  Expect many changes with the company and to just roll with it!"

good,"1.We follow agile,We have daily standup meeting and followed by code development."
good,"Oracle is a good place if you can find the right niche or, more importantly the right manager.  I cannot stress that more if you have a lousy manager you will find yourself in a dead end."
good,Empresa em transformação quanto a carreira e trato com funcionários.
good,"Culture is cool, but growth and exposure is very limited and it mainly depends on which team you are a member of. Also technology vary a lot from team to team."
good,"Great place to work and grow. A typical day at Oracle is working with your internal teams in strategizing a solution based on client needs.  Developing a plan to implement.  Bring to a close.  "
good,"managers are not management trained but they are senior technical guys who got promoted so this causes problems but the technical guys are also well empowered "
good,"The daily working environment at oracle is quite professional with the chance of daily learning and sharing knowledge with colleagues."
good,There are good and bad things at most companies and Oracle is no exception. The flexibility is great and so is the option to work from home. But this keeps you siloed and out of the loop on things. Communication is the biggest problem. Most of the non-sales people have no idea what's going on. The pay is below market in most places.
good,"My day starts with collaborating amongst Team members, setting goals and timelines for a productive and competitive environment. I have mentored and learned to improvise every day. The most enjoyable part of the job is success metrics when desired results are achieved and career pathing towards team mates."
good,I have enjoyed working for Oracle and taking part in many of their wonderful training programs.  At Oracle we are often given the opportunity to collaborate with peers and managers.
good,"Oracle is a good place to develop and practice new skills. There are opportunities if you are willing to seek them out. Has a diverse and eclectic culture, which is good."

good,"Investem em capacitação, trabalham bastante o orgulho de se trabalhar lá. O escritório do Rio é pequeno, e não há muita perspectiva de promoção dos funcionários"
good,"Oracle is a huge company with lots of opportunity for growth and collaborating with other lines of business. Unfortunately, it is an old company and so you have the typical ""old"" frame of mind. They are trying to change this though, with regular employee workshops or innovation and creating ways to do business. It is improving, but in some areas, such as gender equality in the workplace, it has a long way to go."
good,"Work culture is bit different here as the complete control is in managers hand, he will only play minimal role. But good projects less dot net related."
good,"Work was busy and challenging but very enjoyable. "

good,Oracle is an average company to work for.  It is like being the plumbers wife.  They didn't allow us training unless it was for a client.  The pay was mediocre but the benefits were very good.  I had a great manager that made my time there very good.

good,Sun division used to be an excellent place. to work good work lide balance and excellent people to work with..some divisions in Oracle are nice as well..do your research
good,"Working at Oracle in San Antonio has many benefits if you are fresh out of college.  Oracle's diverse culture assists others in developing skills he or she may not have in their previous roles.  The management team is responsible for the growth of employees.   The hardest part of the job has to revolve around the hours worked during quarter closes.    The most enjoyable part of this job is working with the people around the globe and if able, enjoying their culture abroad."
good,"Management is unable to provide a clear path forward for their employees.  Also, Oracle has over hired for certain roles leaving some people with little work."
good,"typical day at work would be to go through the critical issues to be addressed on priority , discuss with manager if any discussion points are needed and jump on to the tasks ."
good,"Class Of Program is designed to have a high turn over rate - only those really interested in Sales continue the career path. "
good,Unless you have a degree in IT you will get stuck in a rut. I've worked for the company for almost 2 years and no type of real advancement available. I personally do not see myself growing in this company.
good,"Oracle is a great company to begin your career.  As a seasoned sales professional,  I felt limited in career growth.  A very slow paced job.  Not a lot of direction from an upper management perspective.  there was a lot of dysfunction when it came to account management.  Way to many Oracle employees calling into same accounts.  Very cut throat.  No teamwork."
good,"Empresa com foco em vendas. Áreas adjuntas não são valorizadas. Negocie bem seu salário antes de entrar, dificuldades de promoção."
good,A normal day envolves talking to existing and new clients about their present and future IT strategy

good,"Member of the Advanced Customer Services (ACS) team, providing technical assistance with: software installations, upgrades, high availability solutions, patching, performance troubleshooting, internal errors, on site or remote."
good,"Working for Oracle for 8 years was good experience for me.  It is a multicultural environment where you can speak your mind freely.  Your opinions and suggestions matter.  Employee welfare is always valuable to management. We ensure our people are fed and compensated well during extended hours.  As a manager, I ensure my people enjoy little perks of good snacks and meals.  Little rewards count and help in boosting productivity and a positive atmosphere. Our people look forward to meetings as there is always something interesting to look forward to.  Typically workload increases during the quarter ends and year end but our people do not fret, they are well supported in all aspects.  When multimillion dollar contracts are involved, that becomes a challenge, however, I saw a sense of fulfillment in my people after accomplishing the same.  The elements of the contract creation and factors around it always carry valuable lessons and experiences that make it worthwhile for them.  Overall, my previous company was one great one and I value every experience I gained from that."
good,"Great company to work for, Awesome people with awesome products. Learn a lot working for such a big company. Fun culture and good management. Would work for Oracle again."

good,Essential to know key Oracle personnel to execute your role (s). Obtain highest compensation package at time of hire. Oracle does not give annual raises.
good,"Working at Oracle Corporation is interesting. A typical day can go one of 2 ways. Either you are wearing a headset with your face in your computer because you are training all day constantly or if your are a customer facing traveling person, you may be traveling out of town to work with your customers. As a customer facing technical person being in front of the customer is the best part of the job. This is why we are in this business to help solve customer challenges and/or problems. I work from home and only go into the offices if I have customers coming in or I have a meeting. The best part of my job has been working with my customers, supporting the Sales Reps, the ability to work from home and working with my team."
good,"Horario libre. "
good,This position to me felt as if I was just a number and was looking for hitting KPI metrics only. There wasn't a true feel or culture surrounding work.

good,"Can seemingly get lost in the mix sometimes, but overall, it's a great company with great opportunity and great benefits.  Only downfall is that it sometimes can feel like a lottery with how territories are cut up."
good,"This was a great place to work, the environment is friendly, fun, and positive. It is filled with friendly people who are willing to help you out when you need and are always down for a little fun during an after work hours."
good,"The day's work is planned before the start of the day along with priorities"
good,"·	Provide direction to sales organization prior to contracts being concluded & ensuring that revenue is recognized in accordance with Corporate and SEC standards."

good,Working with Oracle means traveling to destinations all over North America. Meeting many people with diverse backgrounds and languages means there's always something new to learn.
good,Unfortunately at Oracle you are a very small cog in a very large machine and 100% replaceable.  That doesn't mean that they do much firing but it gives you almost zero room to negotiate anything and they usually pay less than their competitors.  There's always an opening here because there's always such high turnover.

Oracle created a team to perform as an SME support for the SC teams, I did not take the chance to go to the team when I had a chance. I chose to stay on project and complete it. It proved to be a mistake the timing was unique we rarely missed goals and my manager had too many SC the numbers needed to make sense. I had no direct clients in a sales organization and the SC teams started coming up to speed, I was transitioning to the expert team yet did not succeed in time. Nor did I have a relationship with the team leaders."
good,"The best part is the ease to retrieve and analyse information from Oracle's CRM."
good,But at local level have seen elements of management creeped in who indeed are creepy and hence the complete 5 star company gets affected.
good,My Co-Workers were very supportive. We can expect good hikes also in this company. But the only problem is if you are working in client location then you have to change client places frequently.
good,"Oracle France is a good place to work, with skilled and experienced people. "
good,"Great company to work with, encouraging managerial staff, work-friendly ambience. Worked at Oracle as a DBA for 4 years"
good,"Oracle foi meu segundo lar, aprendi muito,e praticamente toda minha experiência foi construida lá. Obtive a oportunidade de trabalhar em vários setores, e com isso obtive uma visão ampla do funcionamento dos processos internos e externos. Trabalhar para a área de Vendas foi muito gratificante, pois foi onde desenvolvi as competências que melhor me definem hoje, comprometimento, senso de urgência e agilidade nos os processos internos e externos. Oracle possue uma cultura mais flexivel, em relação ao horário de entrada e saída de funcionários, desde que você cumpra sua metas não vêem problemas e entrar mais cedo e sair mais tarde. Isso realmente é um diferencial."
good,"Sometimes we would have a meeting when the shift started if there were changes or big news, mostly we would just come in go to station and either continue working on the rack that was started by the previous shift, or get the work orders and start prepping the station for the next rack. Prepping included gathering materials and scanning consumables, as well as some wire harness prep."

good,"- Apesar de tudo gostei de trabalhar na empresa, ela tem muitos benefícios e o comissionamento é muito bom."
good,Working as an Assistant Manager with OFSS BPO since October 2009. Have also transitioned a 12 FTE process from U.S.A (client site) in June 2012
good,"Not many challenges, not enough authority given to the Managers. Its a little disappointing to sit there and not do enough since there are not many opportunities."
good,Very good organisation to work. I have worked for around 2.5 years 
good,"It was a god experience as i was totally unaware of the Retail Industry, we were given training on how exactly the Retail Industry works and what are the functionalities that Oracle provides to Retailers through their products.Also it was mine first Industrial experience , so we got an experience to work in large team n and to complete our work on deadlines with project deliverables to be delivered on time."
good,"A mmi opinión se requiere d eunmentor cuando se inciia en la organización de OPeraciones. No hay un equilibrio entre cargas de trabajo en puestos sencillos (baja carga de trabajao) vs. complejos (resultados sobrecardagos)"

good,Good company to work with providing flexibility in work area to create an equilibrium between work and life
good,"Its owner has a great long term vision, and is building up a strong and very dynamic company, which can become #1 very soon, so it is really nice to be part of the team; but is it really demanding and for its dynamism you can feel your job is never sure."
good,"Fueled demand, generated leads, and filled pipeline with new business opportunities through concentrated outbound calling within mid-market segment. Formulated and deployed marketing strategies and sales campaigns to achieve sales and revenue objectives."
good,"Work life balance is ok at Oracle. Compensation is not par with market rate.. Job security is not great nowadays, job culture is ok. There is not much opportunities to grow...."
good,The company was flourishing at the time i worked there and the people motivated and dedicated. Oracle at the time was a weel known and respected security company in Rustenburg dealing with client contracts acroos all spectrum in the securitu industry.
good,"If you don't worry about the salary, this is the company for you. There is no much work pressure. I being in finance field faced pressure only during Quarter ends. Otherwise a good company to work in. Honestly if the company paid well to its employees nobody would quit the company."
good,"My own manager was a stellar a person. I liked to work here, nice and super talented colleagues. Work-life balance was excellent, travel and remote work worked well together."
good,"Exige extrema dedicação, disponibilidade, 24x7, bons benefícios , home office."
good,"Oracle provides a challenging workplace that offers many opportunities to grow and advance."
good,"Lots of support, good technical knowledge and training. Lots of opportunities for growth, but one has to seek them out, all via self serve (even your long service awards) Big brand, however there is some animosity with the customer base in some instances. "
good,Oracle is a solid company not much room for growth but you can make good money with them. They are flexible with your schedule and have a lot of sites and positions to see where you fit
good,"I learned alot about databases at Oracle. Althought it is a large company, there are pockets of teams that do great work and have an impact. Most people were willing to take the time to work with you."
good,"A good work life balance with not exciting compensation , increment not associated with promotion , everything depends on managers discretion."
good,"Decent place to work with stable jobs. Decent salaries and offices."
good,"We can enjoy our job here and Work life balance is good.        "
good,"Leader in innovative technologies"
good,I learned a lot about sale working to Oracle. Sales drive the company over everything else. Training opportunities are huge and benefits package are good as well.
good,Real strong sales culture - product suite and range of customers is very wide - Lots of resources but can be slow when implementing changes. Good benefits
good,"Ottimo trampolino di lancio, ma non tornerei."
good,"Time spent on quality work is moderate due to project requirement and management challenges."
good,"Tough corporate environment, but great products and services.  Resources and support could have been much better.  As an global corporation, it was surprisingly difficult to find information."
good,"It is a good company - Good Culture, and lot to learn from the solutions also lot of different industry to work with. My experience in Healthcare, Bio was very valuable."
good,"Good company with a diverse group of people to work with. Call Center environment with 24/7, operations for customer support.  Training is provided as well."
good,"I enjoyed working for Oracle and would do it again if I had the  Opportunity .I was employed by Oracle for eight years before I was laid off."
good,"I requested for remote work (telecommuting) due to my sick child and Oracle allowed me to do so without any issues. Nice place to work, but with a lot of restrictions."
good,"I work in APAC shift which saves my traffic hours, making me spend more time doing productive work. The organization is focused more on Self-Learning which adds a feather to one's skill."
good,"The work life balance was good, but there were no chance of being promoted.  Good performance reviews were never taken into consideration.  Other departments were not like ours, though."
good,its a good place to work. It wont be a bad decision but again i was in team that was fun unsure about others. Do take others opinion before joining the company
good,Company has grown and lost agility. Too much internal politics. Internal administrative processes are making it difficult to attend business and challenge competition.
good,Trying to get you to select enterprise software like you would a candy from a vending machine. Salespeople are disposed of after a year of trying to attain an impossible quota.
good,"Great for individual work styles."
good,Oracle in Columbia Maryland is a great entry level job. The hours are fine and there is a strong introduction to the IT world. The benefits are great and the working environment is not bad either. The only downfall is upper management not caring about the product or the support offered. Many bad decisions made that negatively effect employees ability to support and the support the customer receives. Very little to no room to grow in any meaningful way.
good,Oracle is a great place to learn how to build professional relationships with customers and coworkers in a dynamic environment with the technology indistry.
good,Una muy buena empresa para trabajar y para aprender. Dependía 100% del equipo de trabajo tu  felicidad laboral
good,"good but salary is very less and work life can be balanced and also good MNC culture is maintained "
good,"Like any fast paced business Oracle offers high achievers many rewards.  Work hard; play hard...succeed.  On the flip side, if you want to be home with your family every night and shut work off this is not the company for you."
good,"culture: in general, people respect each other."
good,I have been with Oracle for sometime now and it has been great. The one aspect I feel is the only downside is that they promise opportunity and ways to grow but it will take years for the opportunity to come. Better to leave and come back for a raise or promotion.
good,Overall I worked from my home and traveled to various customer sites (once parts were shipped to me) in the central Florida area to repair or install Oracle (formerly Sun) servers.
good,"Good workspace and you have various options to explore technology but no salary increment, no appropriate appraisal , you have to wait long for salary increment"
good,great team to work and build the technical expertise. lots of team building activities are conducted which helps in both personal and professional development.
good,"Nice place to work"
good,"Day to day request from ISV'S"
good,"I would recommend this employer. Working here is pretty good and they had free soda / coffee. We also had work activities with the team like seeing Starwars movies, and bowling."
good,My jobs at Oracle changed a lot.  Oracle bought our company and it forced us to all have to change jobs as our job was phased out.  The last position I had was also phased out.
good,A good place to work. Nice people and a lot to learn. very competitive. could be better by paying a bit more. My manager was really good and understanding.
good,Managing a queue of service requests. Analyzing data and troubleshooting various issues with Oracle Products. Corresponding with Oracle customers to discuss action plans.
good,"It's a big, global company. So expect big company thinking. Oracle is also risk adverse, so anticipate high levels of security and red tape. There is less functional flexibility than what you may find at other, smaller companies."
good,"I started as a BDC - lead generation.  That was great!  Great boss, great culture, great pay and benefits considering the position, etc."
good,The major benefit of working in Oracle is to have the opportunity to work with and learn from amazingly talented and intelligent people. Being a large organization with presence all over the world it also gives the chance to explore various career growth options
good,"Its a great environment and I was lucky to have worked with the smartest, hard working, innovative, most dedicated, encouraging and supportive team. I miss working with Oracle!"
good,"Some folks go many years without a raise or cost of living adjustment at Oracle."
good,"As someone who was fresh out of college, I learned and experienced more than I clould have hoped for during my time at Oracle. I was privileged to work with people who were from all over the world, Oracle encouraged diversity in the workplace. "
good,"Working here I learned what it takes to make an enterprise level product.  The level or design, testing, and coding made this a very interesting place to work.  I participated in design meetings , trained employees, ordered equipment, designed the team lab environment, and aided others in day to day activities."
good,"I really do enjoy working here but as with anything in life, change is a constant.  The support renewals role (SSR) is effectively being replaced with a customer success manager (CSM) role with a subset of of SSRs coming over for this.  In other cases CSMs are starting to do the job of the SRR and thus the blending of these roles has become apparent.  Many of the mid-market and low value renewals have been put back into a call center model in low cost areas where labor is cheap making SSRs in high cost areas endangered animals if so to speak.  My focus has always been partnering with customers and forming strategic partnerships with key members there which is not commiserate with the Oracle model going forward in my geographic area."
good,"This is one of the hardest jobs you will ever have.  However, it will give you tougher skin, an aptitude for success, and the ability to accept change."
good,"flexibility work env.. focus to complete your task and job on time."
good,"I enjoyed working at Oracle with our local and India teams, everyone is committed and do their best to be successful and make their customers successful."
good,"Great place to start off working in Tech. I started this job after graduating USC and loved that I got to meet so many like minded people. Easy way to make friends. "
good,"Relaxed, easy-going workplace. Deadlines were easy to meet and the work was easy to do. The only downside is that they were strict on providing benefits to employees."
good,"Learned about consulting projects and M&A."
good,"Typical day at work..Slow"
good,"Oracle as a whole provides a wide variety of opportunities and growth potential spread across the various areas within company, including the abundance of in-house training that is available."
good,Overall positive experiences and great opportunity for advancement in the early years.  Room for advancement became more difficult over time and last few years no pay increases or bonuses.
good,"Oracle was a great job coming out of college, but even after repeated quarters of overachieving I was still micromanaged. Attainment goals were changed even the last week of the current quarter. Great benefits and atmosphere, but management is a hit or miss. Not much career advancement. Really just luck if you get a nice patch or not, which is randomized at the beginning of next fiscal year normally. Depending on your manager, your worst contributor may not be terminated regardless of effort and the rest of the team is expected to make up the slack."
good,Good company to work for. Great commissions for the sales roles. Sales pressure exists. Very dynamic organization. Will recommend for any sales role in Oracle.
good,"Good in forward thinking, Very active and dynamic to adapt to market demands. Very focused on delivery and to adapt to customer direction. Flexible and quick in making business driven decisions."
good,"Each day at work was relaxed yet challenging and the work was consistent. My team was always helpful and also allowed me introduce my own solutions and ideas. I learned additional skills such as Java, web services, and Agile. I also leaned tools such as Eclipse IDE, SourceTree, SCM Manager, Jenkins, and SQL Developer. My manager was friendly and respectful and was a pleasure to work for. The workplace culture was quiet yet very collaborative. Most people I worked with were friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was understanding clearly what was needed for advancement. In addition, there were some changes in the past year or so that caused a frequent change in focus. As a result it was hard to build any kind of momentum. The most enjoyable part of the job was the freedom to seek, invent, or create your own solutions to improve the quality of the product as well as the software testing process."
good,I worked at Oracle for about 5 years and found it challenging but rewarding.  Great people to work with.  At times it could be difficult to navigate such a large company.
good,"The workplace culture is kind of mixed and varied, since so many companies have been acquired and ppl bring their culture with them. "
good,"Salary doesnt grow at all with Industry..Even after 5 - 6 years your salary doesnt grow by 50 % from where you started, you can at times get promoted with out a salary hike"
good,"Pros"
good,"Best place to work, best place to settle."
good,"I have no much issues with Oracle , everything is going great except for the hike . its been 2 years and am still working 10 hours a day for the same salary . which is why i am looking out for a new job with a decent hike ."
good,Sink or swim corporate culture works for self-starters. Intelligent people and great health benefits. Flexible work culture is great. Effectiveness of senior management depends on what group you're in.
good,"Part of Patching team"
good,"good Company to work .great experience working with OEM to build your carrier."
good,Hard work; stressful; learned to manage multiple duties/activities at the same time; management was overall good.  Fun company activities were scheduled throughout the year.
good,"I came to Oracle through the Sun Microsystem acquisition.  I loved working at Oracle, but my division has experienced cut backs and therefore my position was eliminated."
good,You have to be out for yourself. There are a lot of resources but not a lot of guidance or mentorship. Tons of changes without a standardized way of rolling them out.
good,"Good Company to work with and Good work life balance."
good,"good company with nice initial pkg but no increments for next 2 years or min increments  if any ."
good,"work timings were good"
good,Good place for work-life balance.Good work culture.Well managed work and team.Every day we have challenges from customer to solve technical issues.Most enjoyable part is working on customer issue with team.
good,"Well, the name says it all.. ORACLE. It has a great team spirit with technology advancements. You get to work with the brightest minds around. But you need to be performing from the word go."
good,Enjoyed the variety and challenge of working out in the field providing support for several different customer data centers. The job was technically challenging and provided a sense of satisfaction when successfully resolving customer issues while on site.
good,"Lots of fun people, and there's a general camaraderie at work that makes you happy to come in. That being said, a lot of people are at Oracle to just coast, and possibly work on their sides businesses or ""side hustles."" If you work really hard, be prepared to work with people who don't. It can be frustrating."
good,"Envirnment & good culture. Adaptable and lot to learn . Specific and New Technologies used as per the market needs. work to latest Technologies , Latest testing tools"
good,"Variety of backgrounds among colleagues keep things churning with new ideas and perspectives. Although stereo-typically considered a big old boring company, it's definitely taken a turn for the better."
good,"Bon salaire de base, bonnes commissions mais votre succès dépend beaucoup de votre directeur."
good,"Oracle places much emphasis on short-term stock performance, which manifests itself in reduced investment post-acquisition and a laser focus on lowering costs. "
good,"Learned a lot about e-commerce domain, Lead activities, Manage team, Cloud, Linux and many other technologies. Learned about many oracle softwares, life cycle and mainly sustenance model."
good,"Day in office starts with reviewing the to-do-list, prioritizing the tasks as required. Conducting team huddle to address previous day grievances/ learnings and update team with any new process changes, discussing the expectation for the day. Monitoring the work allocation , address if any escalations by contacting respective stake holder via phone, email or chat and bring the issue to the closure."
good,Good place to work. Very good work culture.  Flexible timing.  Got very good opportunity to learn more project processes and closely worked with the customer's end users.
good,"Typically, I would answer between 5 to 10 calls per day dealing with a variety of issues dealing with a software under the acquired company Micros, which services the food and beverage/hospitality industry."
good,"Coming to work, enjoying much. Get chance to learn DB related stuff and provisioning the new envs, and the hardest part of the job is more politics and not get chance to grow"
good,"This job requires a strong work ethic, hours standing in the sun, and communicating with people. The coworkers are all very close and fun. It is commission based pay."
good,Oracle est de mon point de vue une multinationale qui a une technologie formidable mais ne sait pas l'adapter aux besoins de ses clients et encore moins la vendre. Chez Oracle on se moque de ses clients et on chouchoute ses actionnaires...
good,Oracle is well established company with lot of technical and business depth and a stable place to work at. The company is in a process of going through change in order to respond to the changes in the industry.
good,"Great work/life balance. "
good,The job culture is good. The growth in the job/finance opportunities is not good. The person who wants good work-life balance can join this group.
good,To enhance my skill-set by working in a challenging and competitive environment while at the same time contributing to the growth & progress of the organization and to put in best efforts towards mutual growth.
good,In my years at Oracle I learned a great deal. My daily responsibilities included but were not limited to securing timely renewals of software support from customers. Educating customers on business practices and contractual obligations. My direct manager was very supportive and helpful if needed. Working with co-workers to solve issues was highly encouraged. The most challenging and most rewarding part of the job are finding ways to increase revenue while keeping the customer happy.
good,"Ambiente saudável, benefícios bons, bom contato pessoal."
good,"A day at work includes meeting,training,learning, analyzing and fixing. Management is good in planning, organizing, leading and controlling"
good,The company was always trying to find ways to eliminate Field Service.  Wanted to have customer do hardware replacement but charge for full service.
good,"Oracle is a busy company that is constantly changing and developing software or applications. In Oracle you don't always have a manager in your own country so you are left to take manage yourself and to gain your own results but with support if you need it "
good,"I have been working at Oracle Chile for four and a half years and I believe the salary is good and I also have many benefits, but as I'm moving to Berlin I have to quite so basically that's the reason because I'm leaving this job."
good,"As a senior member technical staff, I have learnt a great deal of technologies. Its sure a fun place to work at. A great work life balance is the highlight of the company"
good,You will be pushed here personally and professionally by coworkers and clients but it will help you grow.  The environment is strongly competitive which is highly motivating
good,Oracle has a great culture. You will be challenged to work hard and to achieve at a high level.  This could burn some people out.
good,"It's a good and stable company to work for, but it's hard to get career advancement. I want to grow my skill and advance to next level, I guess it's also depend on which department that you work for."
good,"Indeed a good company I worked with have learnt lot of sales experience in selling renawals globally over phone."
good,"Consulting is a very up and down as far as hours worked.  When you are assigned a project you are away from your family and the hours are very long.  The team you work with you become friends and family while you are working together.  I met some very good people while being a consultant."
good,Great company with an amazing and committed work force. My job position as a consultant requires extensive travel but there is great exposure to implement our products in multiple industries.
good,"The job is fairly simple, great work environment, relaxed atmosphere. Biggest complaint is lack of upward mobility and incentive to push yourself"
good,"Job Work/Life Balance i  current post is very poor."
good,"The company work culture is great, but they have to seriously think about the hike and remuneration for the marketing operation employees as a part of motivation."
good,overall its a good experience working with oracle. the work culture is good. they are very flexible .
good,I get to work with some of the smartest subject matter experts in the hardware and software industry.

good,"1) very professional "
good,"- Work cultures vary with divisions within the company."
good,"I enjoyed every bit of my work."
good,I have learnt lots of new things at Oracle as due to the fast pace my role was always changing and expanding.  The hardest part of the job is that it is very hard to switch off in the evening and at weekends as there is usually some task that needs to be done.
good,"Mostly slow-paced job with instances of hectic work pace. Interact with multiple departments, and learn a lot about companies and importance of software in businesses."

good,"Oracle is a fair place to work at. It is what you make out of it, like most sales potion. Company has great benefits! I enjoyed the people, they come from corporate back rounds. For younger workers it is a great place to learn from veterans in the industry."
good,Oracle is a great place to do good satisfactory and challenging work. The culture is great. However the compensation is way below the market. The longer you stay the more you will lag behind as compared to your peers in the same role at other companies.
good,Working in oracle is a great experience. Work pressure is less and you can enjoy with ur family along with work. Management helps you in all situations.
good,"Fast moving in the ever changing world of cloud, slightly lagging behind the market leaders so there can be staffing. culls from time to time if costs need to be cut. Salary and benefit generally pretty good."

good,The NetSuite organization inside Oracle is a really great place to start a career. There is a lot of opportunity to learn in the analyst development program and to grow as a professional services consultant.
good,"For new hires the pay is good and benefits are excellent.  If part of sales once you are brought in don’t expect any increases in pay.  Immediate management is excellent, options to move to other groups is available."
good,There were lots of smart database people at Oracle.  The company is going through a transition and some areas are being reduced. Many lifers there.  They need some new ideas.
good,Need to work hard and find your own way - but you can make an amazing life within the walls of Oracle.  Culture can be tough to navigate.  Can be a bit of of old guard network - but if you work hard you can push through.
good,I don't believe I'll find land another job as sweet as Oracle. I would've loved to have retired from there when my time comes and I'd go back in a heartbeat.
good,"Sales for the Applications org can be difficult: tough competition, complex internal processes, and demanding management. That said, if you work had and maintain discipline/focus, it can be very rewarding."
good,"I am working in Oracle India Pvt Ltd as Senior Tech Support engr  for the last 13 years in the  field of  Solaris and currently in the  DevOps env  for the  internal projects.I work in shifts covering all 3 regions AMER , EMEA and Asia Pacific supporting all types of customers catering to their needs."
good,"Fast pace, competitive company to work for. Plenty of learning opportunities. Good management,fair compensation. Company is all in on next gen Cloud computing."
good,"Very good overall work/life balance. Perhaps too many meetings and a bit too much management overhead, but generally people are very easy to work with."
good,"Oracle is a sales based company, so naturally it is very performance driven.  Sales targets are expected to be hit quarterly, and are often raised yearly to drive performance."
good,"Good company........................."
good,They are really big on promoting a team environment. With the contractor to FTE ratio they try to include the contractors in on most activities provided by Oracle to make them feel like part of the team as well.
good,"The best thing about Oracle is the great work-life balance. There is a lot to learn there. Development is happening on the latest technologies, so you get the chance to work and learn at the same time."
good,It's nice to work and learn here for an initial career with nice friendly and hi-fi office environment but with minimal compensation and nearly zero yearly growth in the financial operation wing of the Oracle.
good,"Great work  enviroment , support from management, however raises are near impossible. You should consider carefully how much you are willing to work for before agreeing to salary because raises are very small if any."
good,"competitive salary, company invests in her empoyees. diffucult to get promoted"
good,"Managers are friendly , no work pressure,no deadlines , but we won't get hikes and promotions easily , we have depend on our managers to get promoted."
good,"Flexible, open communication, honest , trustworthy, friendly, great environment, free parking, onsite restaurants, free shuttle bus service to station. Coffee shops, great location with river side walks."
good,"Oracle is and was a great company."
good,"Work life balance is good as we get sufficient work from homes. But management is too bad and hikes are not every year. Cloud is not doing that great. Looking for a flexible work, go for it. Looking for a career, don't go for it."
good,Company appears to have lost its way as the database component of its business finally shows some weakness.  Its cloud strategy is reflective of its former business strategy and leaves something to be desired from leadership.  There have recently been a significant number of layoffs and there will likely be more unless there are some fundamental changes to the company
good,New projects yearly until I was moved to maintenance as no new projects were announced. Workplace culture- fun and there are many benefits as long as you search. Gym and basketball court available at campus I worked at.
good,Oracle is a great place to work and a lot of opportunity to learn every day.So many things going on and I appreciate working here. I would recommend people working for Oracle.
good,From my perspective had a very dynamic team. It was usually a challenge to investigate the production issues and mimic the scenario in the test environment. You get strong in LP algorithm. I always appreciate working in Oracle APPS.
good,"Would recommend for those fresh out of School or Professionals in the field. Depending on level of entry very different daily tasks across Bus Dev, Inside, & Outside sales. "
good,"deploying and troubleshooting database with Solaris and various other Oracle technologies such as Enterprise manager, migration utilities etc. bridging gap via interoperability feature matrix between database and Solaris"
good,Nice company to work for a lot of advantages and if you have the good skills then you can grow accordingly.A proper and good support from manager helps you to grow quickly.
good,"Oracle is a great company but a little behind the times when it comes to technology.  With Oracle being one the larger technology companies, it's resources for sales teams to efficiently and effectively manage and/or run their books of business.  CRM tools are horrible, but are being improved with Oracle's Customer Connect tool."
good,Bom local para trabalhar. Empresa apenas pensa em vendas e não atualiza seus funcionários
good,"I was with ATG, a leading eCommerce company purchased by Oracle. "
good,"Very complex work environment with many organizations, business units.  The best part of the job is the people.  I learned a lot of great skills at this job and had some fun along the way as well.  The hardest part of the job is management especially the new management."
good,Oracle has good products which you will enjoy working on and there's plenty to learn at job including latest technology. Only downside is lot of influx of work without upgrade in management. Many of lower and middle management personnel are not really capable of people management and require training and mentoring to ensure they don't ruin a great company.
good,Oracle is a great company however the company needs to take better care of the employees; not just the clients. Management team has no power regarding raises. There is often a low level of morale due to the lack of financial rewards.
good,"Great place to work, challenging, new ideas, new customer, new problems new solutions.  Every day is a new day for better career, growth.  ever day there is new thing to learn all the way up to shifting mind set as the technology as always evolving."
good,A collection of great technical people who are able to assist you if you need help with Oracle products and/or services. Does not promote from within. Keep on hiring new VPs who stays for 4-8 QTRs and disappears with golden parachute.
good,"Was with Oracle for quite some time and was able to work from home, so if you are able to manage your - work/life balance it is really beneficial.  I had a great Manager and team, but once my manager left, my job was in jeopardy and was laid off.  HR and upper management was not able to assist in securing another position."
good,A good place to work. Always busy. Well treated at the company. Company is very dynamic and has loads of learning opportunities. Role diversification for the employee is limited
good,The business week was usually a fast paces environment with multiple projects going at once.  For the self starter this is a great place to work as there is a lot of self initiative needed to break into the system.
good,Start and end hours were pretty well respected.  Any overtime had to be approved in advance by management in the applications support call center. Typically issues were more efficiently handed off to another engineer in another country or the client would simply elect to wait until the next business day.
good,huge organisation with opportunities for all. Currently re-inventing itself as a cloud service provider and this is crucial for future success. Software much stronger than Systems line up.
good,Oracle is a fantastic place to work. Their culture is second to none and they really take care of their employees. If you are in sales just be sure to be selling a solution that is selling well for the company and the market.
good,The culture is the best you can get for graduating right after college. There are many training sessions and resources for you to be prepared for the job. My biggest complaint is that the management at this company is horrendous.
good,"Oracle provides enough structure to allow people to succeed while at the same time providing autonomy. While a tech company in name, it is run much more like a traditional company than a true SV company."
good,"Great comp and Brand Name, but toxic culture with little management can do to change due to the size of the organization. Cloud growth strategy is dicey and lack of buy in by employees in the field doesn't phase upper management"
good,"I enjoyed my days at work due to working with a great team of people, I done a variation of work covering all aspects of credit control so therefore it allowed my days to be different."
good,My prior years at Oracle were rewarding.  I structured my day and followed my routine with much intervention by my boss or other entities at Oracle.  What I missed  at times was lack of interaction with fellow colleagues.
good,"Oracle is a good company to work for. It helps employees grow and learn. Overall good culture, good flexibility, good team and good environment. I would recommend anyone to work for the company"
good,"There is not typical workday at the managed services side of Oracle. A day can focus strictly on Customer Success of an existing customer, can get involved in the regulations of GDPR or assist a customer in planning a new solution to increase eCommerce revenue. If you are into bringing teams together, herding the cats in order to drive a better solution for the customer and be well compensated for the effort."
good,"I was apart of comple cabling. I worked closely with technicians and responsible for installing, cabling, and repairing cloud servers. I worked with USB cables, cat 5 cables, fiber cables, and infiniband cables."
good,"I enjoyed working there and was well compensated."
good,"In retrospect, I probably should have stayed here. "
good,Sales oriented environment.  Periodic management changes.  Good technology.  Some talented people.  Seems to have change of personnel on regular business.
good,"overall had a good experience working at Oracle. flexibility with working remotely, good internal self service tools. limited career advancements as very hierarchical. career advancement limited if not located in HQ"
good,"Good:Great organization to work with, unless you are working on an acquisition.  Flexible WFO options."
good,"Its a very fun and productive workplace with very approachable and the best of the people. The team I am in are the best of all. However, sometimes you have to move on and not get stuck at where you are too comfortable and experience and explore more and learn new things in life."
good,"good to learn about sales, particularity coming out of college "
good,"Empresa multinacional estruturada, cheia de oportunidades e que me ensinou a trabalhar sobre alta pressão e resiliência."
good,Oracle is a good place to work.  They are always profitable and they ask that you give everything that you can to your position to make the company successful.
good,"Great Company to work for, great work life balance, good compensation, good collaborative environment, smart people, flexible timing, and good benefits."
good,"Good place to work, most people are accountable and work hard, climate is fast-paced and can be demanding. Important to stay current in your discipline or function to be successful."
good,Working at Oracle is interesting.  All of the work is done by 60% of the people.  The other 40% don't do anything and no one seems to care!  The work from home culture leaves a lot of roles without any kind of governance.
good,"I really liked what I did, one of a few people in the world with my skill set, was paid well, but they killed the product line I worked on, and I made 3x what the people working on the cloud based product in my role made."
good,"I have been with Oracle for over 17 years, and it's a great company to work at.  I have had the pleasure to interact with very smart and brilliant colleagues during my time at Oracle, which made the journey enjoyable and fruitful.  The times at Oracle will always be memorable experiences which I can carry forward."
good,"It was a fine job. Good pay, Flexible time. Not a lot of group gatherings because we worked remotely. Until they deployed my entire engineering team to Romania."
good,This division where I worked in was developing different server chip architectures and enterprise class server components along with Oracle Applications. It had a very good learning curve and I found the experience working here fruitful
good,"very slow paced and relaxed environment. difficult to find purpose and motivation. lots of flexibility regarding hours and locations. reasonable pay for ICs, on the generous side for Directors and above."
good,"Wonderful place to work. Have multiple options to work for."
good,"Great place to learn about sales and technology and how to navigate a complex corporate environment. To do well at Oracle one has to learn to collaborate, compromise and problem solve."
good,"Good place to learn technology sales. Great peers, poor management. You become manager not because you can manage but because somehow you met your sales quota. Lot of internal politics and fights."
good,"healthcare, coworkers and environment are great but the pay is low in comparison to similar position in the technology market. advancement is also difficult."
good,It was good company but short lived for me. I did move from one department to the other but they were very open to my request to transfer and treated me and trained me just as well
good,The server industry is dying and oracle is not doing any better at competing with AWS and any other competitor.   Huge RIFs recently.  Expect to continue.
good,"I likely learned more in this position than any other. The work was enjoyable required a good bit of travel. I most enjoyed working with the the sales teams and our clients. "
good,"I enjoy working at Oracle. It is highly professional and forward thinking. Additionally the collaborative environment makes for projects to run smoothly."
good,"Working from home is possible depending on your manager.  Good benefits including medical, dental and vision.  They have ping pong table and nice cafes here and there through the campus."
good,Great opportunity to learn technology in many areas such as integration and cloud services.  Numerous opportunities to delve into technology in a variety of industries.
good,"A very good work place with a flexible timings."
good,it is a food place to work. We are getting opportunity to learn things....  All people are very cooperative and helps when need comes. Also company has very good working culture.
good,"Very good place to work."
good,"I have been in the same group for some years, the team members work together very well. Everyone has positive attitude and willing to help each other to make sure that the job is done."
good,Joined at early stages of my career and learned a lot here. Design standards and software guidelines. A must company to work for once in a career development
good,Oracle acquired our company and proceeded to dismantle it piece by piece.  The managers manage the work and not the people.  The benefits are good but there is a clear lack of leadership training and promotion opportunities.
good,"workplace culture is very good in oracle."
good,Company with strong working ethics. As an Intern I was able to learn quite a few important and useful skills such as website desiging and how is the market operating in terms of marketing.
good,"It is a very nice working environment.  The work is challenging at times but you do have great support from your team to get it through.  If you like to exercise, there is a good size gym located right inside the campus that you can use any time."
good,Oracle provides a good foundation for learning and advancement. They work as a good stepping stone to move on to bigger projects and a more rewarding career.
good,Oracle is a good company.  The pace is fast and employees need to be able to adapt to changing priorities.  It was not always clear what performance expectations were...but that's a manager specific issue..
good,Manage projects with deliverables and milestone dates. Adhoc duties when assigned. Weekly management updates with data charts and written summary. Mandatory attendance on weekly conference calls where verbal input would be a requirement.
good,"laid off within a year, and I hadn't done anything wrong... was just the wrong time i guess.    "
good,"Everything depends on your manager. I had a great one so things worked out very well for me, except that my manager's manager's manager was too much of a politician and not very helpful."
good,"Oracle is the best place I've ever worked! I say this because I'm challenged each day, motivated to do my best and feel supported by my management team. It's a joy coming to work each day"
good,"Oracle is expanding in cloud. "
good,"Good life/work balance in my area."
good,"Oracle staat bekend om haar successen binnen de database. Oracle is een sales gedreven, Amerikaanse club waarin je heel veel enthousiaste en gedreven mensen gaat ontmoeten. Oracle is een hele professionele club waar je absoluut wil werken."
good,"Overall a good place to work, with many sites dispersed around the United States and world.  However, hardware appears to be a declining business, therefore, future growth opportunities likely lie outside of hardware engineering."
good,"A Nice place to work. Depending on the group you are in (of course). Oracle used to be known as a not so great company in terms of work culture in the early 2010's. However, that has changed a lot and the company is much more professional and is a good place to work."
good,"On Assignment: Schedule mirrors client workforce.  Work your day and then have another couple of hours based on the consulting team review, generally once a week."
good,"Have been working at Vienna, VA office for almost a year. It has been rewarding experience. Knowledgeable co workers and great team work. One of the best places to work in Washington D.C."
good,"Fosters a great learning environment with a lot of good opportunities to grow one's career. There is a strong work-life balance. The company is going through a monumental transition and that can be managed better. They are looking to the future but stuck in past practices. Management should do a better job in communicating its intent and vision. "
good,"Oracle is a great place work with good benefits, salary, commission structure with vacation package etc. They are a bit late to the cloud/ saas and trying to catch up with leaders like Salesforce, AWS etc."
good,"Working in the pre sales arena building complex customer focused models.  Worked with a wide range of verticals including CPG, Retail, Oil & Gase.  Enjoyed the work / life balance as a virtual solutions consultant."
good,"Working at Oracle I learned that things are never the same and you should always try to learn new things and exceed at what you do. It doesn't matter if what goes inside the company is bad, but customers expect a certain quality that should not be affected by internal situations."
good,"Oracle has a fast paced, competitive atmosphere. There are opportunities to make good money if you get into the right territory and pillar. If you are not in either, it is a challenge and upper management can be difficult. Overall, it's a good company to work for but be prepared for eb's and flow's."
good,"Qtrly Outing,good work place,work cluture,good place to learn."
good,"Oracle is an excellent company to have on your resume. However, the company is constantly shifting its market focus and this can lead to job security issues."
good,We had the opportunity to work from home when our executives were on travel and still be as productive as we could while being able to attend to family needs.
good,"Over the last two years, we have experienced tumultuous change as if our company was operated as a startup, which in fact wouldn't be far off since the organization is comprised of 6 different companies. With that being said, no one in my management is still at the company which spells trouble for the future of the organization."
good,"Good place to work."
good,"Oracle es una empresa que exige lo mejor de cada uno de sus empleados,  es completamente enfocado a resultados pero tambien se preocupa por capacitar a su fuera comercial tanto a sales representatives como managers en las mejores practicas de ventas y negociacion, haciendo que sea base para lograr sus resultados."
good,"except management all was good. Its a good company to start your career with as a fresher."
good,Here management is very professional. The approach to work & process improvement is world class. Salary increment is all in manager's hand & there is no transparency in bonus.
good,"Pros:"
good,Excellent work place for learning oracle technologies and to work with energetic and enthusiasm people who all are stick to work ethics and protocols.
good,"I enjoyed my time in Oracle, The work life balance is excellent and also the work culture."
good,"Overall my experience is great so far; just missing some work-life balance no linked to company business."
good,"Apart from Salary revisions and benefits, its a great place to work. Ample space to learn and grow and great work life balance."
good,It is a productive workplace and a good environment in order to build a successful career. Our management helps us to improve our skills and to have more opportunities in the company.
good,Working in this company you can enjoy flexible working hours. Though the salary is not very high you can have a good work/life balance. The managers in my teams are all very nice.
good,"My time here has been wonderful. Good people, good work and up untill recently it was just that. Sadly things happened in upper management and here I am"
good,Great work and nice work life balance. Started my career here and its been a great learning for last 5 years. Hope people make the best use of oracle in terms of learning and growing
good,Working at Oracle has proven to be an exciting place to work for me. I have been able to learn a great deal about facilities management as well as IT support. I have been led by strong management throughout my career. The workplace culture is great. Very family oriented. I have the privilege of working with outstanding talent everyday.
good,"Overall good atmosphere of team work and fairness, many self-service tools to help employee self management and be productive and self-improve. good benefits such as 401k match and medical insurance co-insurance match etc."
good,"Great place to work with incredibly intelligent, dedicated people at all levels from administrators to executives. A well run company that pays very close attention to the bottom line."
good,"You must adapt and manage yourself every single issue in this company, fix your problem quickly. Is a highly self service Company oriented to results so you must quantify as much as you can every single aspect of job"
good,"No growth carrear wise and also monetary benefits. You will not get a substantial raise ever, unless you leave then get rehired on (they will not match offers, better to leave)"
good,"I encourage anyone with experience that Oracle is seeking to apply. This company has a great work,life balance and is a great place to work."
good,"Fast moving and can be an enjoyable place to work. At times can be very political, but can also avoid a lot of the politics if in the more technical roles. Lots of managers have been promoted above their level of competency."
good,"Un ambiente che consiglio, anche se non tutte le Divisioni sono innovative e stimolanti, ovvero proiettate verso l'innovazione"
good,"work life balance is good in finance division. lot of learning involved. Co-workers, manager are supportive. Management is okay. good place to work."
good,I have been at the same career level for 10 years and there is no place for me to advance to. I am lucky to work for a manager who cares about his team and I enjoy my job.
good,"Uma empresa extremamente competitiva, mas com excelentes benefícios e bons salários se comparado aos oferecidos pelo mercado atualmente."
good,"This job was great to work at and learn but unfortunately I did not foresee much room for growth. My co-workers were always willing to lend a hand and so was the business manager. Sadly, many people would leave the company after a few years due to little opportunities in career advancement and compensation."
good,Nice people. Good place to worsk. Home office. Lots of opportunities. Low/medium salary (not updated as it should be).
good,"Friendly enviornment at workplace. You get more work-life balance, its like fun and work at your workplace with your colleagues. Apart from work, you get good social network with your co-workers and in other team members."
good,"Being a massive company, of course there is going to be a ton of red tape to go through for any sort of change.  However, being so large, if you want to stay within the organization it is rather easy to cast a wide net in many different fields of work."
good,Great place to work  was there for almost 10 years.  Was brought over from an Acquisition.  Stayed with company and moved up quickly from a regional role to a global role.  Was demanding at times but well worth it.  Processed approvals for all potential payments and made sure transaction were in compliance with company policy and processing business requirements
good,Great work life balance and supportive management. Good medical benefits. Work from home facility. Good work culture.
good,"This is the company where you have chance to be as how you want to be, if you greater career aspirations you can exhibit your capability and get recognised as long as the Manager under you is good at identifying and recognising. "
good,"I enjoyed working for Oracle and with everyone I met."
good,"Working at Oracle was good for a longtime and it was a great place to work. The hours were flexible and are now changing.  The culture is changing and more of our jobs are moving overseas. Work load was not bad but that is changing as the workforce is be reduced and the workload is increasing. Co-works are great we were like a family. It was nice to have teams work together. The hardest part of the job was working with the management. They tend to micromanage to much. Plus, just being pushed all the time when there was no reason for the push. Plus always adding to process to make it hard and hard to work with our customers. Nothing was streamed lined. It took to long to get things approved and processed."
good,"Cool Work Place and Productive Environment."
good,"good work / life balance.  Great co workers, comp is good, political advancement is possible but need to hustle and network"
good,It is a pleasure to work in oracle. Its policies are really good for the employers. we really enjoy work culture in Oracle
good,"Good work culture"
good,Se trabaja fuerte pero se ven resultados y apoyo.  Poca estabilidad laboral.
good,"I would have expected more dynamism within the company. Great benefits. No so great salary. Hard to make a career path. Willing to train. Focused in Sales, no so much in the rest of the company"
good,System need to setup properly. Fun to work as there are lot employee engagement programs. Co-workers and ream members are very friendly.
good,The place is great to deliver. One of the best performances from my side gave me the best returns from the company. All awards are based on pure performance and no nominations.
good,"1.one of the biggest IT company in the world."
good,"I have loved working for oracle because it is a large company with a wide range of products and many job opportunities."
good,"Anything can happen in Oracle. You're the master of your own progression. If you want ahead, you can, but you will have to work for it. Oracle have a very serious work culture, and the colleagues are very serious about the job, which is a really good motivation."
good,Oracle provides a challenging and fast paced environment. One of the best parts of working at Oracle is that the technology is always on the leading edge.
good,"Eran turno de seguido.Buen ambiente y buen compañerismo,también mucho estres pero bueno es una cosa normal que en la hostelería se trabaje con estrés en momentos de bulla"
good,"Great work culture and excellent learning platform for beginners."
good,Great Place to work with. Good work-life balance but not good hikes. Very flexible environment to work with. Upper management is little biased about the old and new employees.
good,"There is not such thing as a typical day. Its either a quiet day or many requests at one time. This can also change at any given time so you have to be conscience of how you manage your time. "
good,"After going to the gym, sort out my emails, check what work the engineers have completed. Sort out any holiday requests and Shift Rota for the engineers and contact them if needed and book any meeting rooms. I have learnt to be more patient, dealing with any situation as it arises, how to be more organized using my time better, and being more understanding. My managers that I deal with on a daily bases are great, we have a great relationship, and get along very well so I have no issues what so ever. My co-workers are my 14 engineers we all get on well a bit challenging but that part of the job. The hardest part of my job is dealing with conflicts when they arise. But the most enjoyable part is when all conflicts are dealt with and my tasks for the day have been accomplished."
good,To be filled out later once more information becomes available within day to day work. To be filled out later once more information becomes available within the day to day work.

good,Best place to learn and grow in the industry. Best brand to work and good exposure. Best products in market and grow and learn.

good,"With the opportunity to work from home or in an office, Oracle provides wonderful flexibility as well as chances to travel."
good,I have spent my entire career - 26 years - at oracle. It is a visionary company and a leader and driver in its industry. Career growth and employee development are key at Oracle.
good,"I enjoy working with the folks at the office, all are quite friendly.  The work was typically straightforward Linux sysadmin work."
good,"Company review:"
good,"- A lot of Action"
good,"Challenging technical position at times.  The best days included installing software, reproducing issues and working with development towards a solution.  Co workers are some of the most intelligent, driven individuals I have met.  oracle is lucky to be able to retain such talent.  Hardest part of the job is lack of support from management to assist finding the time to provide quality work and quality solutions for ALL customers."
good,"Challenging Environment as it was upgrade to latest version of Oracle 12.2.3."
good,"Oracle is a great place to enter into the IT corporate world. You learn so much about the industry and what it takes to make it in this type of environment. There are several positions that require little to no knowledge of anything technical (i.e., processors, servers, how the cloud works, etc.). Everyone works together to help achieve the goals of the group. Management is there to make sure you have the support you need and everyone you work with is very professional. The downside is the quarter close approach to business. Every end of quarter is very taxing and allows little time for a personal life. You are pretty much tied to your desk/laptop/smart device for four months out of the year. The job can be very rewarding if you are looking for a job in the corporate world. It just depends on what your goals are and what you are willing to invest to order to achieve your goals."
good,"Flexible work schedule, opportunities to telecommute.  Work with many different departments to finalize deals.  The job is cyclical, so there is down time."
good,"Large company, aggressive culture, significant resources"
good,"Be prepared to be asked to deliver revenue.  Somewhat of a sales job. Oh and its all about being popular, like high school, so be sure that you are or guess what no promotions or raises."
good,This company has good work culture and allows a good work life balance.
good,Empresa de alto liderazgo y muy enfocada al logro. Las metas son claras desde el principio del Quarter y se vive cada segundo para lograr la meta en equipo.
good,"It was an ok place too work. Please do not press me for more information. I wish too keep any further comments private. Pleas respect my right too say nothing more."
good,"Culture has changed somewhat over the years from a very personal and committed management structure to a more technological, impersonal management structure. Everything is automated and its extremely difficult to contact anyone in the management chain and even more difficult if you have an HR problem. Its a real shame. A lot of the changes have come with growth by acquisition."
good,I have good experience in oracle India pvt ltd i have learned lot of new things
good,i have learned so many things in this company.we r worked under contract base as a efferent vendors.

good,"Its very nice to work in Oracle ,people are very friendly and learning excel work is very nice ."
good,"Due to corporate structure and inflexibility, a large number of former Sun customers left Oracle and eventually took their revenue with them resulting in a need for reduction in force."
good,I have learnt lot of things which helped to my professional growth and personal growth. Its really worth to work In Oracle.Management is very supportive at any situation.Work culture is also good.
good,"Typical day can be flexed around personal needs, but expect very full work days sometimes as much as 50-60 hours per week."
good,"I am very mixed about my experience at Oracle. I made some very good money there, but then I also experienced some horrendous 'corporate America' type 'abuse' and being treated like a number rather than a name (by upper management)."
good,"Great colleagues - smart and knowledgeable about the technology and applications. Due to the diversity in the company, it's sometimes hard to figure out how to get into other areas or try other challenges outside your immediate area. Entrepeneurial spirit for a large company with the advantages of a large company. Performance is reviewed on a regular basis."
good,Oracle is a fantastic place to start a carrer as they give a complete and collective knowledge and trainning to enhance the advance level skill requirement for the work. One can gain a vast knowledge and trainnings through internal ERP courses and OTD trainnings to develop corporate skills.
good,"* Smart, friendly colleagues"
good,"Oracle is a very large corporation, with corporate politics as with any comparable company. Our already established culture made it seem less corporate, and a fun place to work."
good,"I have great respect for the Oracle my first organisation where I improved myself very much. I skilled my self in all possible fields including my process, Language skill and so on.."
good,"I joined Oracle when they were looking for someone with Avaya Telephone experience for their Call Center."
good,"Oracle is like an empire and once experienced there is highly dependent on a specific organization/team. "
good,Salaire motivant mais aucune possibilite d'evolution sur le bassin Toulousain
good,A lot depends on which team you're on as there have been many acquisitions so there are a lot of subcultures.  Being a Director there is perfect because you're senior enough to be respected but not senior enough to be a chopping block candidate.
good,"I enjoy coming to work because I work with good people. We work hard at what we do. We get good benefits, and paid fairly for the jobs we do. I would recommend this workplace to friends."
good,yoğun stresli bir tempo ve aynı zamanda başarma duygusunun yaşandığı şirket
good,"It is very constructive, insightful, learning work enviroment at oracle. You will learn, implement, execute each project on a collaborative way. Further individual contributions are well apprecated at the rith forum."
good,Great place to work however it is challenging to understand the long term roadmap/strategy. I do believe it is getting better however in many cases even the most senior leaders are in the dark.
good,working at oracle had its ups and downs. i want to believe that they were more ups and downs. a relaxed culture with goals set ahead. this company is new to texas.
good,Good place with work/life balance. Legacy IT products might prove to be a dampener for engineers wishing to work on latest technologies. There are talented people in the organization who can help you better yourself
good,"Oracle is evolving to be a cloud company with solutions that are slowly falling in line with what enterprises expect. The company however comes with a 4 decade cultural baggage that is often more difficult to change than starting afresh. Atleast in the pre-sales space, the work life balance is quite easily manageable however the company could do with a more strategic approach towards attaining sales goals."
good,"Oracle was a great place to work, but is plagued with layoffs. It is a great place to be and a good moral. It was a job I truly enjoyed going to every single day! The level of flexibility was great for those with kids and so on."
good,Oracle helped me a lot with my personal growth. The company's management and culture enabled me to make decisions for the product and gain real-time experience with software development.
good,Not a bad place to work but the internal politics control everything. If you aren't in the in crowd its difficult to move up. Nice facilities and most of the people are great to work with.
good,Good workplsace with lot of flexibility. Adheres too much to internal stack that limits flexibility for developers. Employees are knowledgeable and helpful.
good,"Great opportunity to grow in the modern technology world. Great education and growth opportunities. Good work-life balance and good perks overall. "
good,Very good work life balance... offlate there has been instability in few verticals which has lead to layoffs followed by attritions and things are still not stable.
good,"learned so many things in Java and Linux technologies. got a good experience in customer management and product development."
good,"Favorable work environment.  Culture typical of large organizations, a bit bureaucratic.   Role offered many challenges which allowed for learning and development."
good,Great company to work for. They offer great benefits and really look after their staff. Progression can be tough at time give the volume of staff in the EMEA Hub
good,I worked in real estate and facilities and while it was a nice job it was rather boring and not challenging. I believe that other parts or teams would have a very different opinion.
good,"There were great things about Oracle, and some that were not so great.  They had a strong training program that really took new hires outside their comfort zone and promoted strong team building activities. My manager was great...let us work independently, protected us from upper management whims, etc. But my territory was not adequate for the quota and other reps had grandfathered accounts that sucked the revenue out.  I knew I would not hit the number and left after one year.  Had they fixed the territory or the quota, I would still be there."
good,Workplace culture is inclusive and energetic.  The management continually strives to advance employee skills and encourages career development.  I continued to develop skills related to report analysis and public speaking through employee groups and committees.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the cooperative and team approach to company goals and objectives.
good,Great place to work to be on the cutting edge of technology. Working closely with CEO and CIO's to plan a future roadmap for their IT environment was rewarding and interesting.
good,"Great benefits, unlimited resources. "
good,"- Good pay and benefits"
good,"Oracle ha sido una excelente experiencia. Donde el acercamiento con los clientes, las herramientas que brinda la empresa y el buscar un bien común es visible siempre."
good,"Oracle has the combination of technologies and products from more than 100 acquisitions.  The number of product groups and technology divisions is large, and the opportunities for learning are great."
good,Overall Good working in Oracle past 2 years good work life balance good to recommend to others and friends. Love to work with oracle if i get an oppurtunity
good,"Oracle offers great work/life balance, flexibility (WFH), and learning opportunity."
good,"Overall, my employment with Oracle was great. I loved working there! My ratings are high, except for Job Security, because my position was sent to another country and my group helped train our own replacements without knowing it."
good,"Oracle is forever in flux. Very strong company that is striving to be dominant in the Cloud business. Senior leadership has a great vision however has lost touch with the people and their needs that drive the day to day business. There has been a lot of turnover as a result. Once they stabilize, it will again be a great company to work for but for the next year or two, be cautious!"
good,"In most cases sales goals and numbers are key, not that way with all of Oracle. Some good managers, some bad. Some managers with good interview skills to get the role, they just do not have the skills to perform well in the role. Several managers have great ideas on what needs to be done without any idea on how to get it done."
good,"I worked at Oracle from 2010 to 2018 in customer support.  Financially a very well run company but a bit more large corporate (political) culture than I was used to.  Sales and support know their software very well as many people I worked with had been there a long time.  Big changes going on there include transition to a cloud company (not progressing as well as AWS, MS, Google) and (I sense) an effort to get younger, ie. lay off older workers (like me) and hire younger people.  Saw that trend when visiting other offices and looking at the information provided to me when I was layed off."
good,Enjoyed my time with Oracle!  They provide a good work life balance while keeping Oracle interest. Oracle provides remote work to employees which has proving to help focus.
good,"I loved the operations at Oracle and the learning experience is incredible. "
good,"When I speak for Oracle, I speak for the Shared Services Center (SSC) in San Antonio, Texas, and not Oracle as a whole. The physical environment is very clean and inviting; the cubicles are not closed off or restricting. People are relatively friendly, and the work is relatively straight-forward."
good,"Oracle is huge so much of your work life depends on your manager and team and the rules set for it. I had a good work/life balance, flexible hours, ability to work from home because I had a manager that valued those things."
good,"I worked on a new project, while I was with the company. The transition for the newly acquired company was still on going, while I was there. "
good,"Engineers are motivated and pushed to the limits. A typical day at work starts with prioritized items to tackle, customer issues to look at and internal works"
good,"Oracle is a great company to work for.  The people are great, the technology is bleeding edge and compensation is great. The biggest drawback is the expectation to work as many hours as required to complete the job requirements, which tend to average 60 hours per week."
good,"Productive and good working place.Nice friendly atmosphere, co operative colleagues,competitive environment to work. Peaceful atmosphere, Management is also good."
good,Oracle is huge IT company that has been growing so fast and so there are many opportunities to be part of that company. I personally joined the Sales team for Middleware and Business intelligence. They Salaries are ok however I have bee told in some other developed countries the pay better but the culture is not that good they do not care about employees careers and the C- Levels encourage the whole company to threaten employees all the time about losing their jobs if they do not accomplish the sales quota.
good,"Management is great, teammates are motivated, but some of the enterprise problems do exist. Great learning opportunities - at least one Oracle sponsored event/tech meet-up per month for you to learn and build your connection."
good,"Learned so much at Oracle.  Fantastic experience to work with some of the brightest people in the TECH industry.  Their products are top notch and they teach you things that you can't learn anywhere else but Oracle.  Oracle is unique in where they really are doing something that nobody else can do.  Delivering the full stack under one roof.  Applications, Middleware, Database, OS, Virtual Machine, Servers, and Storage.  All our products are engineered to work together, so our customers will always have the advantage of better performance when running an Oracle on Oracle solution together."
good,"typical day at work, you're on your feet running about as theres always something to be doing which i think is great. the hardest part of the job is being able to dodge in and out of customers."
good,"I spent 10 years with Oracle Retail and enjoyed my position throughout.  I found the management team very easy to work with and always attempt to position their consultants for success.  I was offered many opportunities for growth at Oracle, and enjoyed all projects for which I was assigned."
good,"Nice place to start career. Looking for more challenging work to learn a lot, where I can grow in much faster way. Can handle high work pressure. Want to build awesome career."
good,"Good working culture.Cool work life balance.Based on GBU everything revolves,hikes and all."
good,"I have been enjoying my time at Oracle. I came up through the Business Development Program out of College and was promoted to an Applications Sales Representative Role. Their is opportunity to make money in sales and for potential career advancement."
good,"A good coy to strat with and to know better on involvements of corporate culture."
good,Large Company with plenty opportunities.  Plenty of training available on-demand.  Getting in person training my be a bit more difficult though.  Good work environment.
good,"Overall, Oracle is not a bad place to work. You get some training in the beginning to get you hit the ground up and running then you're mostly on your own. You learn on the job with minimal supervision/mentorship. It is usually very busy everyday during 8 hour shifts. You are volunteered to work on call shifts to make extra money."
good,"Oracle is very ambitious company with goals of winning and achieving all objectives - revenue, market share, product excellence, at all costs. Winning is everything. Nothing else is matter. Takes no prisoners and no excuses. It was a fun company to work for while trying to achieve the dominant market share. As it grew bigger, the focus become only on revenue and margin."
good,"A good place to work... a good life balance... Culture not well defined."
good,"I enjoyed working at Oracle, being the center of the tech industry. I had many opportunities to learn, and I was always surrounded by talented people."
good,"Excellent place to learn the trades, with good healthy team environment. Open culture for career changes. Has fair compensation but should review and improve"
good,Good Culture and informal environment.  Resources are expected to be accountable for their deliverables without following strict structure. Learning Scope.
good,"Overall a good workplace, Company is generally employee friendly and provides all the resources required to do their job."
good,It was pretty good for a warehouse job if that is what you are into. good benefits and pay. decent sized break room with tv. management was good when I was there.
good,"Good work-life balance.Good salary. Great management and good staff to work with. Good behaviour of personnel and staff, good ambience and good work location."
good,The company is organized well and has a good workplace culture. The managers are helpful and informative. I was given a full education on pipefitting and HVAC in a very short period of time. They are honest and respectable and I would recommend them to anyone seeking employment or needing HVAC work.
good,Cuenta con muchos beneficios extra legales para los empleados
good,"Good Technology Company to work for in the career beginning."
good,"Good place to work for. Managers are very understandable with the employees. Managers are very open and discuss and issue you might have come across. Does not matter if the issue is work related or personal, they willing to work with you to over any issue that affect your work ability."
good,Oracle é uma ótima empresa. Mas algumas areas não são tão amigaveis.
good,"I appreciate the job because they give you opportunity to work with all types of people from different law enforcement backgrounds. Also, if you are willing to work they will ensure that you receive all the over time you can handle. However, it takes way too long for a person to advance due to the family culture. Meaning, my sister works there so i will get my cousin in there and his brother or sister in there making it hard for someone else that works there to advance after putting in a lot of long hours and hard work.Especially, if they're qualified for the position."
good,"Good company to work for.  Good cloud vision and room for advancement.  Difficult to get raises as it is Oracle's culture to not give internal raises.  Overall, a solid company with solid products"
good,Its very nice company to stay for a long term where you can get lots of opportunity to learn technologies. Best place to manager you work life balance.
good,"Leuk bedrijf. Fijn om voor te werken. "
good,"The industry of how HCM Cloud industry works helping companies in maintaining cash flows and reducing cost was a learning experience. The workplace culture and life balance was the most enjoyable part of the job with flexibility to work from remote location was easy."
good,"Oracle has a very open culture and zealous ranges of products and technology which you need a life time to learn. Some of legacy products such as DB, Middleware tools are excellently done that for its size it has had very few maintenance issues and scales well to the future requirement. "
good,"Empresa con una cultura enfocada al logro de objetivos, trabajo bajo presion. Poca estabilidad laboral pero posibilidades de ascenso rapido."
good,targets were met. Deadlines were explained. Working witha good team to meet and achieve these goals. Good benefits and package at al ltimes for the staff.
good,"Awesome company to work for with great benefits.  Sick and PTO is available starting day 1. Great atmosphere and people to work with, There is very little room for growth and raises."
good,i learned more about computers and internet and how the process of building a rack takes place the culture is fun they have lots of on sites wich i never have done ever and very family friendly
good,"Oracle is a great place to work for. Peers and Managers are very supportive. Flexibility, Work-life balance. Great HealthCare, 401k. "
good,"A professional environment to work at. Lots of industry veterans you can learn a lot from. Work life balance is what you make of it, the work environment supports professional timings and there is no need and not much incentive for employees to go above and beyond."
good,"I was a remote employee and as it turns out, that model doesn't work for someone that's looking to move up... With that said, Oracle did have a lot of benefits including discounts. Too many to take advantage of in my opinion."
good,"ambiente laboral bueno, beneficios promedio del mercado de empresas americanas."
good,"The work day is flexible and well balanced. I learned to work autonomously and with minimal interaction from corporate. The hardest part of the job for me was the lack of Corporate strategy fed down the line to employees. The most enjoyable part of the job, was the flexibility to work anywhere."
good,"We joined Oracle as part of an acquisition. Overall it has been fine, there is a lack of communication from our leadership team to the individual contributors about the direction of the company. It's still good to great, but it used to be awesome."
good,"flexible work hours, work from home opportunity, Oracle University has an abundant number of learning paths, there is a very good collaborative atmosphere between engineering and quality Engineering."
good,"I love working at Oracle.  The company culture is great.  If you work in development they treat you really well. The work life balance is great.  You rarely work weekends, and if you are salaried you get unlimited paid vacation."
good,"Enjoyed working in a multi-cultural environment, very structured and organized in policies, easy processes for new-hires. Not as competitive in salaries as other corporations though."
good,"Not too bad, but if you're someone seeking challenges you'd be better off looking somewhere else. You can spend several months or years doing the exact same thing."
good,Fast paced work environment with significant technical and managerial challenges.  Excellent caliber of people capable of addressing the continuous issues that arose.  The most difficult part of the job was delivering bad news to customers regarding their systems support issues.  Most enjoyable part was successfully resolving customer's issues and working with the most professional team at Oracle.
good,The great team work and supportive. very hard work to do .and very far to go .oracle is very best company towork very cooperative staff all will work together
good,"The work place culture is very good, as per any multinational company. There were continuous learning curve in this organisation. All the individuals are encouraged to enhance their skill set at all point of time to grow in the career path of their professional life."

good,Great place to build your career and grow. Learnt a lot of lessons and happy to be part of the organisation . Fun and work both are balanced. Miss my old days ..
good,"Oracle checks all the boxes for making this a great place to learn, network and meet new people; falls short when it comes to territory planning. Sales Operations needs to do a complete refresh to make it fair and equitable for all,"
good,"Account Managers that know their solutions are really great to work with.  Junior Account Managers are there to make a quick $$, but later learn, they have to know the solution before trying to sell it."
good,"Oracle is definitely very much driven by management unlike Sun Microsystems, which seemed much more engineering driven.  Not much changed in my day to day life when Oracle bought Sun, but the environment and atmosphere was definitely different."
good,"This company take care the employees so the employees care about the company."
good,"Exciting, fast paced, stressful. Good benefits, very flexible working. Lots of opportunities to move, but not necessarily to advance career. Gain a lot of skills and training."
good,"At Oracle, as with many large companies, changes occur frequently to fit business needs. Restructuring and movement is to be expected and job roles are fluid, at times, and job security is questionable."
good,"Ability to move into other positions and work for both commercial and public sector clients.  "
good,"Open culture, Typically there is no fixed timings of work, Learned a lot but utility of the training is minimal or depends on the project where it can be implemented,"
good,It was nice working with Oracle. I learned a lot in 2.2years. They provide good training which is needed to the process and every often there will be update session if any process changes. There was daily team meeting to discuss about issues faced by Analyst in daily basis.
good,"Solid portfolio of products and solutions. "
good,"Usually work starts at 9:30, and there could be some meeting in the morning or afternoon, and after the meeting, there is the time for coding. One-on-one with my manager is a routine for very week."
good,"Worked as intern, the recruitment agency was a pain to work with but everyone at the company was great. Low pay since it was an internship . I would definitely go back and work full time provided the pay was better,"

good,"I loved working here for the following reasons"
good,Had some excellent managers that helped me achieve my potential on very diverse work assignments. I was able to work from home when I needed to and there were opportunities to get exercise during the work day. Thanks Oracle!
good,"Oracle is a well established corporation and a leader in the area of information technology products.  It is very well known for its database and cloud/fusion products, and offers a variety of different job roles in many different technology areas in both software and hardware products.  Since it is a global company, you work with remote teams, and there is always someone working on your project around the clock.  One should expect to be engaged in some capacity in all hours of days, nights and weekends."
good,"It 's okay job but dead end job, no where to advance. I love people I work with, family like .... very long drive from my home to job site and hopefully find the job near where I live."

good,"I am glad to tell that I have worked in the oracle company but I wanted to move into IT field so I wanted to change the job."
good,"For the most of the departments and offices of Oracle, it was Fun and great place to work but the one the I worked at was very laid back, less pay, less incentive etc."
good,"The company is too good and the work culture is very supportive and adaptable. The initial pay is very good however no hike or incentives are provided, the liberty for the employees is very good which encourage the employees to work with cool mind."
good,Oracle is a good company to work for and they are heading in the cloud direction at a furious pace. Good benefits. Good training opportunities. Good collaborative environment.
good,I have been able to expand my knowledge while being at Oracle.  I was able to move around some to be able to broaden my experiences and to learn more about what Oracle does.  I have been able to work from home for the last 10years so it has helped my work time tremendously.  My compute into work was between 45 min - 1 1/2 hours each way.  I am able to work more hours from home and be available to my team if needed.
good,"Oracle evolved over the last four decades under the vision of its chairman, Larry Ellison. His forward thinking abilities and passion to be an industry leader led Oracle to be a pioneer in the industry, be it client/server, internet apps, converged infra and NOW Public Cloud!"
good,"Good benefits and company culture. Salary could be higher compared to other big tech companies."
good,Good work life- Balance if your product is selling. If your product is not the market leader and not selling expect layoffs. Management is demanding and some managers are hands off and only calls when forecasts are due.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo y una excelente formación para el desempeño en el trabajo."
good,"Though the company is into a lot of domains, the cloud technology is still not upto speed with the rest of the industry.  So, keeping up with the technologies of the rest of the industry remains a challenge. However, the work culture is by and large good."
good,Lots of cold calling and emailing. Can be exciting at times. Work culture varies depending on office. Good work life balance. Requires consistency and determination.
good,"Oracle is a very competitive environment.  However, you will have ample opportunity to learn and grow. Salary, benefits and PTO are average. Overall a great place to work but can be stressful as any sales position will be. I would recommend Oracle to my friends."
good,Fast Paced Fun Place to work. Work life balance. 401k is 3%.Good Medical and Dental coverage. Paid vacation. Time off. Good management. ESPP plan is good.

good,"Over all I enjoyed my job and the freedoms it provided. The work was challenging. I worked with great knowledgeable people. Since Oracles acquisition of MICROS Systems. Policies changed causing a loss of customers in my local area."
good,Great company to work for with excellent benefits and compensation package.  Great internal learning structure and reach back for knowledge and growth.
good,Enjoyed working with Oracle and taking the next gen technology products to SME's across the territory. With Oracle venturing into SMS space for the first time with the pilot sales team has its own advantages and dis-advantages. I looked at the advantages and created my own GTM strategy to take Oracle Cloud (IaaS and PaaS) to SME's in my territory. Hardest part of the job is lack of partner network and presence in the SME space unlike the enterprise segment. Poor channels presence and complicated process in deal approvals piles up additional workload on the sales representative and it becomes difficult to manage the time.
good,"Beautiful campus and a very zen office, great colleagues, opportunities to work across departments, all very intelligent, highly driven people. Learned so much during these internships."
good,It's great place to work . Work pressure is more compared to other companies . Very good work culture . No micro management. Very good company to settle.

good,"Good place to work, good work environment and opportunity to lean new things every day."
good,I really enjoyed working with the team at Oracle.  I did not enjoy working for Oracle itself because Tekelec (the company bought by Oracle) was all about the people and customer service and Oracle is to conerned about the stock market and margin.  At Tekelec we found that if you take care of the customer....the customer will take care of you by continuing to do business with you which will increase the margin/profit.
good,"It's a Good company from Job work/life balance. There's a race to deliver, that compromise quality."
good,"One of the best companies to start your career, I had got opportunity to learn and explore more in my job profile."

good,"Great benefits, very demanding work place. Typical IT high tech culture, some opportunity if you have current cutting edge skills. More software focused then hardware as you would expect from a database company."
good,Everybody respects you when coming from Oracle. You have full credibility. You can progress but need to fight for what you want. Products are great and training extensive.
good,"Oracle is a huge company with a huge backing of top tier solutions. Great company to get your foot in the door for technology sales. However, internal candidates get the short end of the stick when it comes to raises and promotions. Be aware if you are looking for quick advancement because you will feel small. Work life balance is great, many paid holidays, lots of happy hours and potlucks. "
good,"Good place to work in. Co workers are good and helpful and environment is open and congenial. One owns their work, it self driven."
good,"If you're looking for technical exposure, Oracle is the company to work for. It has multiple challenging projects, and the compensation is good. However, a raise is not given every year - this is an issue which must be addressed."
good,"Covered most roles in the organisation from strategic consultant, strategic sales and support through to senior management, and external non executive work"
good,Good place to advance career. Upper management not very clear on goals. Middle management does not carry the ambitions forward.
good,"If you get there on time and stay the full work day and get your work done you will NOT be micromanaged by most managers."
good,"It was a great learning experience working for Oracle. Moreover, it's a fun place to be in as the employees are assigned to work on new and challenging opportunities frequently."
good,"To work in a firm with a professional work driven environment where I can utilize and apply my knowledge, skills which would enable me as a fresh graduate to grow while fulfilling organizational goals."
good,"Cold Call into account as an account manager.  Must build rapport with all lines of businesses and drive meetings which lead to sales.  Although it can be challenging at times, success on the job and co workers makes everything worthwhile"
good,"During the early hours you will find me prioritize to communicate with the clients, meeting with team for half hour and organizing the team schedules around the client’s priorities and the rest of my day goes on with the meeting or any training and schedule the other half of the day with in and out Queries."
good,"Good Management and work life balance, Not much great on yearly focal.Good for retirement company"
good,"Prior to the reorganisation of the Customer Support structure, Oracle Customer Support was an enjoyable environment where collaboration and team spirit was, generally speaking, natural as breathing."
good,Good work life balance. But from the growth prospective there are limitations and the structure is rigid. Work ethics are good
good,Enjoyed working but vision to support partners are not there. Made hasty decision to eliminate all Sales Consultant in Channel organization. This creates doubts in Partner in how to conduct business with Oracle.
good,I manage a team of seasoned professionals that work in the Oracle Database world and now we are helping customers migrate their on Premise software to the cloud.. Help is constructing Architectural plans for their refresh of both hardware and software and new projects.   Working with Large Fortune 500 companies from Financials to Retail to CPG.

good,Big company with many opportunities to advance and learn.  Management is spread out across many time zones so meetings and work schedules can be a hassle.

good,"Multinational company, professional environment, good job security."
good,"While working at Oracle I've learned how to build constructive and meaningful relationships with team members, how to manage conflict and use influencing skills to interface and support multiple disciplines to meet aggressive schedules and resolve issues. In addition to these I have been successful at overcoming obstacles with appropriate and creative solutions. I have lead various cross-fuctional teams on technical deep dives in determining  root cause and driving successful corrective action. I feel very certain that the knowledge and skills obtained at Oracle has better prepared me to take on any new opportunity."

good,"Very rewarding work experience. Plenty of learning opportunities, great colleagues and excellent business model."
good,"Very large company. Management has constantly shifted throughout my stay. I have had a hard time proving my value with my team spread out throughout the country. I find it difficult to move up in position. Role constantly changing with changes in upper management. Most recent change was from expert operations analysts to a more generalist role. It feels as though staying I would be moving somewhat backwards."

good,Oracle is a great place to work as the people are great and so are the benefits.  The one thing that could be better is the pay.  Keeping the employees at market value is something that could be worked on.  Other than that I think it is a great company.
good,"Good place to work"

Software centric company learning how to provide hardware support and stellar customer service; different set of rules when troubleshooting and supporting physical hardware, onsite with customer or remote technical support.

Daily tasks include generating leads, making 40-100 outbound calls a day, utilizing Costigan and Sandler's Sales Training to penetrate accounts within your territory. Co-workers are all fresh college graduates. Free sodas, cube life."
good,"- Good work life balance"
good,"Very friendly and professional work environment"
good,"Its a very good company for freshers. You will learn many new stuffs in the first 2 or 3 years, after that learning almost stagnates. If your career growth is good, you can stick on."
good,I worked at Oracle full-time for less than a year. Great experience and I learned a lot. One negative was the massive internal company politics.
good,A very dull environment with no enthusiasm amongst people around you. Everyone minds their own business and the management is least bothered about a cohesive working environment. The hardest part of the job is no recognition and no bigger picture of growth. The good part is timings are reasonable.
good,"The Best thing about oracle is the work - life balance. No work pressure at all."

good,"Quotas are tough to hit, but fair.  Nothing is easy at Oracle, you determine how much you make by how hard you work.  What are you doing for me today?  They do not allow you to rest on your laurels after closing a big deal.  First goal is to reach quota, then to get into accelerators."
good,I have a great management team and feel valued but limited growth opportunities.  But I know this is not the case in all the departments.  I learned a lot at Oracle.
good,"All you do is prospect, and you live the sadness that comes with that, but I still genuinely look forward to coming in to work every day. My coworkers are dynamic, interesting, young, well-educated people who help each other advance and are ambitious themselves. We help eachother in the job, and help eachother strive to get out of the job. Love coming into Oracle, and working here was the best decision I could have made post-grad."

good,"Oracle is an good organization which help to grow your skills and more opportunities "
good,"Recruiting efforts needs more focus in Diversity. An increase in perks (free meals, sponsored events, and increase in transportation or remote work options) will make the company more competitive for potential candidates"
good,"Excellent work life balance, may be the best in this regard. Lay offs common. Internal promotions hard. Great benefits and learning opportunities. Excellent as an early career"

good,I love working at Oracle.  There is an abundance of opportunities depending on the field.  My manager in particular is great!  The hardest part about the job is the level of stress and work/life balance.
good,Oracle is a good place to settle down as it offers lot of flexibility . Oracle will always provide an opportunity to learn new technologies in CLoud Platform
good,"Great place to work. Opportunities abound, to the point where it's hard to know where they all are and how to use them. Fighting through the layers to get something accomplished can be tiring, though."
good,The work was challenging from a technology perspective. Oracle moved to the Cloud late in the game and hence there was an urgency to 'catch up' to the competition
good,"Nice workplace to work you can balance personal and work time."
good,"International culture"
good,Oracle India is a great organisation to work with. Management here is very good. Ample opportunities avaialble for learning. Flexible working hours are a blessing.
good,"A challenging, competitive yet supportive organization that has provided me years of work satisfaction.   I originally was with Sun Microsystems prior to the purchase by Oracle."
good,"Productive and fun workplace...good place to work ,management is encouraging and work life balance..learning is immense..in a nutshell great company to work"
good,A Oracle é uma empresa que da orgulho de trabalhar.
good,"Oracle is very large and very driven in business. It is easy for employees to feel lost and to fight for survival anyhow they deem fit; uncontrolled, this introduces decay into the system. Overall, Oracle is a good place to be if you can overlook the politics of building an empire. Mostly good to employees. More attention needs to be paid to customer success for Oracle to continue to thrive."
good,"Good for learning and experience. Good work life balance and opportunities to explore. Presales exposure has been good."
good,"Great place  to work,learn.frequent sessions happen to improve employee knowledge, "
good,"Everyday was a challenge.  Oracle strives to be the best at everything it does and expects a lot out of their employees.  I learned a lot in 6 years, and the only negative was many decisions are made at the exec level with little input from other leaders"
good,"It was pleasure working in Oracle, it will be good to go back and work in the same company. I was part of GFIC division in Bangalore and worked with multiple teams."
good,Highly competitive environment with knowledgable resources made work both fun and productive. I used to look forward to work with new challenges every day.
good,"Great work, however management and key staff accountabilities can be unclear on given projects. Highly siloed work groups can be a challenge to navigate."
good,"Job Work/Life Balance is okay"
good,"Oracle has flexible working hrs, My day at oracle start at 9:30 AM and i lead couple of SCRUM's and track Cloud Configuration Manager Application development."
good,Great place for build your career. Good workplace corporate culture and streamlined practices are being applied throughout your work. Well balanced work and life environment.
good,"Even though many days you need to work more than 13 hours, still, you can balance and manage your work and life. Weekends are mostly free. Learned to take ownership and drive yourself. How you work will fetch recognition by your management."
good,"Oracle is the leader in relational database technology and in SaaS (software as a service) cloud technology. It faces tough competition in the cloud in IaaS and PaaS."
good,"Great trainings, good manager, some places have more productive meetings, multi-cultural environment, great space and location, demanding support environment, many customer and service requests"
good,No comment.  I do not have any comments at this time. I currently work for Oracle and it is a very nice environment to work in.  I work from home 100% and that cannot be beat.
good,"I worked in an entry-level sales role at Oracle.  It serves its purpose as a first job out of college.  For most of the quarter it is a low stress environment and you spend all of your time with other recent college graduates.  There is a ping-pong table and there are team outings.  The work is easy, but it's not pleasant.  You really have to enjoy the grind to love this job.  The environment is made better by the people, but there are many negatives.  The sales culture can be extremely obnoxious.  There are also really good and really bad territories and teams.  Your commission for at least your first year is largely determined at random depending on where you're placed, and many of the other salespeople cheat their metrics.  Because you're compensated against your peers, it leads to a toxic and often resentful work environment.  While the team managers are mostly great, upper management is awful.  They make drastic changes to everything multiple times per year.  One quarter your metrics will be impossible, the next it will be attainable in two weeks.  A great place to start a career, but most employees don't stay more than two or three years."
good,"Oracle's culture is good, per the industry standards, and it is critical to get in at a good salary.  The downside is that there are a multitude of minions responsible for very focused deliverables.  My experience was that there was not enough work to satisfy reasonable production expectations.  Of course, layoffs occurred frequently, but never with direct managerial inputs, ie: haphazard and almost always beyond the point they should have happened."
good,"Good, well maintained office. Good canteen, "
good,Oracle was a great starter company. They have great benefits. There is great management and being able to work from home made the workplace culture enjoyable.
good,You won't feel pressure in work. Flexible in work hours. Managers understand the requirements of an employee. Good place to grow technically and work balance.
good,Good learning experience. you get good exposure to technology and is given enough room for additional growth as well. It is a fast paced environment as well.
good,Very good organization. Nice place to work. You are given a free hand to take decision and allowing responsibility and deliver solutions and product which are of very high quality.
good,"Good work life Balance, but salary hike and promotions are very rare. "
good,"Very flexible work culture. I had a very good  time working here learning best processes in the industry and good work standards."
good,I enjoyed working for BRM. I learnt team work. The most enjoybale part was work and fun were together happening. The hardest part of the work was to switching among multiple projects.
good,"Enjoyed working and learned a lot. Developed and owned the APIs of Territory Management."
good,"Amazing company to work for. However, Oracle lacks keeping up with the inflation of the economy. If they want to retain top employees then this needs to be fixed."
good,"Oracle's sales group has a well-earned reputation as a work-hard, play-hard environment.  It's intense and there is a huge spectrum of first-line managers, the best to the worst.  Your territory can make or break you, but you have options to move around the company. One career-planning note: your salary does not keep pace with your value in the market."
good,"I had great time with Oracle."
good,"Great company, but not best compensation.  Cloud offering behind in marketplace.  Managers were starting to micro-manage deals as small as $25k on a $2M number"
good,The company was OK. I only worked there 3 months after the acquisition of Acme Packet. The work was the same as Acme. Failure analysis. The manufacturing of the product was being phased out. Nothing negative to say about ORACLE.
good,"Oracle as a company is a very good company due to its various global business units. There is plenty of options and opportunities to work across different business sectors which the company focuses on. Ideally the main area is dealing with software and there is so much one can learn. There is plenty of opportunities to improve your role within the business you work and courses that you can apply for to help you progress in you career. Oracle University provides various opportunities to learn new skills to further enhance your abilities in your position."
good,"Emerging technologies are disrupting old paradigms and unleashing new opportunities. Oracle has embedded innovative technologies in every aspect of our cloud, enabling companies to reimagine their businesses, processes, and experiences."
good,It's a challenging job that can be equally frustrating and rewarding depending on the day. You're expected to be fully knowledgeable on day one even if you are unfamiliar with the product. You have to teach yourself just about everything but that's a skill that if you can master will take you far.
good,"The work environment here is young and professional with a continuous training mindset. Many recent college student start their career here and Oracle makes a great investment in trying to ramp up us as sales professionals. The work life balance seems to be optimal. The new office Austin hub is beautiful. There is a lot of cold calling and prospecting that is necessary to hit your quota and resources are always available to help us out. There are so many, it's tough to keep up. Quotas are attainable but all dependent on territory. The main part where I think Oracle can improve is enabling us to employees to pursue career aspirations, especially when it comes to a different line of business."
good,"A typical day of work for technical support engineers at Oracle involved reviewing customer issues and updating customers regarding their issues. Initially, we had more autonomy in working at home, but then upper management made us work at the office and we were tracked by strict metrics in logging in and working on customers' tickets. All in all, I had a good direct manager that promoted learning so I took a lot of courses to improve my skill set.  The hardest part about this job was dealing with cranky customers and managing a huge queue of tickets. The workplace environment was good since co-workers were willing to help you resolve complex issues."
good,I worked with an international team testing social media applications.  On the US side we were the QA leads writing the test cases and maintaining the test suite while working in an agile environment.  We would generally then pass the test cases off to the offshore teams to automate in daily and weekly runs.  Management was great.  The only downside was because the offshore team covered automation the US team was not trained on writing the automation themselves and it could feel somewhat disconnected at times.
good,"Upwardly mobile but difficult to do horizontal moves or changes to sales territory."
good,Freedom for the employee. Good visibility and recognition for the employees. Good work culture. Compensation need to be improved. Healthy out of office environment.
good,"Good place to work with good benefits, I worked with a great team of people."
good,Productive and fun workplace.   Remote working available.   Plenty of computer equipment and ergonomic equipment available for those that would request.
good,"Flexible working hours and able to keep own schedule, being able to work remote.  Global culture and atmosphere. Learned to be adaptive to the changes and organization."
good,"Work day for a support engineer will consist of sorting your emails and contacting your customers where you will need to prioritize your responsibilities for the day ahead, so your not clashing with your meeting. "
good,"Work life balance and good people to work."
good,Good place to work. Lots of opportunity to grow and shift.  Travel.  Remote work available in some positions .  Mgmt is metric focused.  Large push on driving upward career growth.
good,Oracle is a place with lots of smart people. One needs to pay attention to do well there. But it is possible to succeed and thrive. I left there in good standing and now wish I had not left there as grass in not always greener at other places.
good,"- Sales consultants are highly valued"
good,"Worked almost 10 years ago, had to put something since the comments are not optional, I don't think my review would be relevant any more given it was long ago..."
good,"Work is cool... No pressure, and work culture is great. If you feel like having a work-life balance, join Oracle."
good,"Excellent work life balance."
good,Great opportunity to make a good living.
good,*Complete Sales function*CEO of my Territory*Excellent Management*Great Work Culture*Many Owners of Account(Hard but manageable)*Dynamic & progressive
good,"A good Company to work with. "
good,"I enjoyed working at Oracle earlier in my career, over the past months things have gotten slow and  things have changed a tab bit. The pay structure is not competing with its rivals as far as competitive balance i feel we are a tad bit under paid. Management is cool as long as you come to work and do your work. Nothing extra to enlighten the atmosphere but its quiet and peaceful. You learn penalty as long as you're willing to learn, Oracle allows you to teach yourself what you want to learn. The people are great and there is no non-sense or drama."
good,"The policies are employee friendly thought I can't say the same about monitory benefits. Although you get other perks, Salary hike is not satisfactory."
good,"Pros"
good,"Knowledgeable place to work and enhancing accounting and time management skills."
good,"Worked at a startup that was acquired by Oracle. The culture remained mostly intact after the acquisition, and corporate stayed for the most part out of our hair."
good,"Good company.  Very interesting work. Values it's engineers.  Culture and policies, benefits, practices are more about Oracle then employees, but that's not bad, it's just the way it is."
good,Oracle Philippines have a fun and relaxing work environment. Work and life is balanced. Benefits/Health care is above par compared with other companies.
good,"Diversiteit aan mensen, oplossingen en mogelijkheden die je scherp houden bij het uitvoeren van je rol. Bedrijfscultuur is open."
good,"Working at Oracle means a few things, a high paced and intense atmosphere, you must be flexible and open to change, and ever evolving - the company uses its own products in house which means you will deal wit constant chnage and innovation."
good,"Had a great 12 years in CRM.      Nice work culture with employees from many nations.  "
good,"If you are lucky, you get to work on latest technology like cloud."
good,"Oracle is still a good company because it is always change to adapt the world. It was a database giant, but now it is becoming a could giant. I believe Oracle will be successful in the future."
good,"A nice technology company. Lots of opportunities to learn and grow.  "
good,"Able to work on leading edge semiconductor technologies."
good,"Company has a lot to offer and if you work hard you are rewarded.  My manager was one of the best I'd ever had.  I was, however, laid off due to a reorganization after performing at the top of my team.  Job security is not great, but it isn't anywhere really.  If you have an opportunity to get in as a sales rep, it can be one of the most rewarding jobs, financially and advancement-wise, of your career.  It also looks pretty good on your resume!"
good,Interesting product. Technically challenging. Loved working on technology and security/encryption area. Got the chance to work on the product through its evolution from on-premise into cloud days.
good,"When I worked at Oracle, things were popping all the time--I worked in and within sales and the IT department and was always involved in customer advocacy and event planning."
good,"Its a roll of the dice.  You live and die by your patch."
good,Great company to work for. Great management that prepares their employees and team to be proactive and know how to respond to change by demonstrating flexibility and working effectively in ambiguous situations.
good,"MetaSolv was purchased by Oracle and the people I used to work with are no longer there. MetaSolv didn't keep up with the advancing technology and was extremely slow at making any decisions. They had a niche; but, the market changed and they didn't."
good,"Good company to work. You will get lot of opportunities to learn new and challenging work."
good,"Had a great time working and learning at Oracle."
good,"Its a great company to work with if you are a experienced person and thinking of getting settled up as there is stress free environment,no pressure,everything goes smoothly.The managers in dev have great technical knowledge and manages everything very well.The hike and perks are less."
good,Oracle is a very good MNC .  It gives is a friendly nature company with fully work life balance.   Gives lots of Flexibility.   The hardest part of the job is the minimal hikes year on year.
good,Just a normal desk job and making sure the hotels was occupied. I really didnt have to deal with people in here because i did overnight. But other then that it was grat job
good,It is a nice place to work. There is a good scope for the knowledge to grow. Challenging work. there is good felxibility like the work life balance. You will feel very happy working here.
good,"Good place to work at."
good,Oracle is a good company to work. I joined there as fresher and got many opportunities to learn new things and also improved my skills. It was fun working there as colleagues was supportive there.
good,"Well run company, but if they are trying to balance the books they may do it with your position.     I liked working there and was sorry to go.   I would go back if I could."
good,"There are lots of opportunities to move to different groups. The benefits are great , and work life balance is alright.  The management is good . The company wants to develop their own technologies and eat their own dog food, which is a mixed bag."
good,"I have worked for Oracle for over 17 years.  I worked in training for about 12 years and PreSales for 5."
good,Very good work life balance but career growth stops after some time.  We get to use mostly Oracle Technologies so start feeling like a frog in a pond.
good,"Good company for the starters, place to explore and gain more knowledge in different process. as a friendly environment and good job culture which makes the employees to feel very comfortable."
good,Work life balance is good. Salary and benefits need to be negotiated at the time of joining for best benefits. A good company but may get stagnated after a while.
good,Enjoyable position and if you get the right territory the deals are limitless. Bonuses coincide with that. Management is out of touch for the most part but its still a great place to work if you dedicate yourself to grinding everyday.
good,"This is place to learn and deliver your skill. "
good,Work timings are flexible at Oracle and emplyees are also provided Work from home options which helps in maintaining a good work life balance. But career growth can be slow.
good,Working experience is good .  Full employee satisfaction. And good facilities provided by the company. There some free of cost facilities like Transportation is very helpful for the employee.
good,It is a great place to work with loads to learn apart from the fact that there is no monetary growth for the first couple of years and the management is not up to the mark.
good,"Work life balance is awesome, beyond compare. The management is also very helpful. Oracle adds as a great brand name to your resume. You learn a lot of new things and technology"
good,It was great working for Oracle. Be its global presence or the depth of its ERP functionality it is simply mind blowing. Oracle provides a great work life balance.
good,"As a first job, I really enjoyed working with a company like oracle. Great people and amazing workplace. Learnt a lot of new things like Management Reporting, Hosting the meetings globally and etc.,"
good,"That was the initial days where I had to be on training, need to note down the each and everything. That was challenging for me being a fresher. It is a great learning experience in Oracle and I have never seen such a work environment. Management is good and transparent towards all. The work culture extremely awesome. I did feel some of the activities especially during quarter end was challenging and tough. I enjoyed in each and everything while learning new things."
good,"Not much challenging work on a daily basis but there are ample opprtunities to grow within the company"
good,"Pros"
good,"Great work life balance, manager driven, less yearly hikes and late promotions, no bonus for many years. Though Oracle is doing good at some business units, the overall loss will be shared across all business units"
good,Good opportunities and work/life balance. Lots of change which leads to loss in focus and frustration and there is a lot of needless hierarchy. There are some great solutions and products however and the company is in a healthy place
good,"-	Highly revenue focused"
good,Awesome place to work with open culture and nice office environment. Lot of investments in technology which is good and make the company in better position with competitors.
good,"Oracle is an excellent company if you are interested in working on enterprise software. It has an array of products from server/storage to database to middleware to business applications. Now, Oracle has been pivoting to cloud everywhere."
good,At a company level this is the best in terms of technology and growth. It depends on which function / department you are working in. But overall its a good company to work for.
good,"Good place to work but only compensation is concerned."

good,"Oracle is one of those companies where you can learn a lot about working for a huge corporation. There always opportunities and change occurring but unfortunately sometimes that change only occurs at a certain level. The work to life balance is an interesting ebb and flow of intense stress and care free weeks depending on your group and point in the quarter. Though the company is always changing and growing its hard to sometimes bring certain processes current as many folks have the mentality of well thats just how its done at Oracle. The fact that the company is acquiring smaller ones left and right usually leads to new comers adopting that mentality quickly so as to not be left behind in the wakes of an acquisition. But they are very generous with their benefits such as constantly cycling PTO and unlimited sick days (at your managers discretion). Unfortunately compensation is difficult due to the stringencies in raises. Its hard to feel confidant when your company makes excuses to not have a focal period to discuss raises but then spouts record profits at the end of a quarter. But the people are amazing, every single person I've had the pleasure to work with is brilliant and dependable in valuable ways. The level of expertise everyone brings to the table easily shows why this company is able to keep growing at the pace it does. A major downside though is that the company doesn't try and do more for its workers in its satellite offices. At headquarters the perks are overwhelming but if you work from any of their other offices around the world and they mostly just give you free"

This is not based on performance.  I have exceeded expectations every year during my review and have never received an increase.  My Director warned me of this fact prior to coming on board.  I knew what I was getting into, but thought there may be opportunities for advancement as I usually enter a position with the goal of impacting the business for 2 years and then move to the next level or project.  This is the reason I am looking outside Oracle.  If there were opportunities and pay increases I would definitely stay."

good,"While Oracle has been a great place to work at, changes within the organization of our department has caused disappointment and confusion. The benefits are phenomenal, my manager is great, and I couldn't ask for a team that is more willing to help and collaborate. We all learn with and from each other and the available resources are abundant. The only complaint I have is the inability to follow through with promises made for a promotion schedule. This was caused by a rapid change in executive management and laying off many of the managers for not meeting goals that were set well outside of their normal expectations. Hopefully, as the business unit grows, the changes will catch up and level out."
good,"It was an honor to work for Oracle. I gained experience as an Executive Assistant in a DataBase Industry. A typical day at Oracle as an Executive Assistant come with more than just admin duties, you also make tactical decisions and handle projects with deadlines, The management was a little uptight but flexible at the same time since I was depended upon, Yoy have to understand that your VP is also under pressure. The culture is versatile. The most challenging part of my job was to handle many tasks at the same time in a certain time limit to assist my team but thats normal, this is what makes you a super executive. Its when you are given unexpected tasks and you have to be flexible to get it done when needed so, The most enjoyable part was building relationships with my coworkers and gaining experience learning new ideas and methods,"
