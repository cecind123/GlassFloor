rating,review
bad,"This job care' s nothing about its workers,  only numbers.  The number they give you when your hired is your jump suit number!!!! Maybe things will get better in the future for the guys that still work here!!"
bad,"This company is the worst managed one that I have ever worked for.  Ran by a hedge fund that knows nothing about the railroad industry, only how to squeeze out as much money as possible out of a company.  No consideration for the future of the company, or the industry.  Layoffs and facility closings happen as often as the stock price changes.  The pay is decent but the job is not secure.  I wouldn't recommend taking a job with this company at all. I have witnessed employees be furloughed before they even report to work the first day."
bad,"At CSX Railroad you are completely replaceable and the management will let you know that daily. Longest hours of any industry around, no days off, no set schedule. You will work on call as their slave, God forbid you try to live your life away from the phone."
bad,Terrible place to work not worth the money. You feel like they own you and they kind of do. All they know is intimidation tactics to make you stay in line.
bad,"Very poorly run"
bad,"Don't work here If you plan to have a life outside the railroad.  This corporation treats all it's employees as merely a number even in management. Uphill slow, downhill fast, tonnage first and safety last."
bad,Don't do this to yourself.  This job is a career killer with no opportunities for advancement.  You will go here and work yourself to death and then they will spit you out.
bad,"Cut throat lay offs management has no clue dangerous "
bad,For myself it was terrible. I was moved along as a means to an end for them it felt like. I remember being excited about having a union to protect me but that never happen.
bad,"Would not recommend. Railroad retirement is held at a high regard at the cost of compromising your quality of life.  It's a culture of surviving,  not thriving. They cling to the past and never look outside of the box."
bad,Dying industry with absolutely no loyalty.... union has no leg to stand on..bad attitudes run rampant! Trainmasters are puppets out to fire employees.
bad,Company only cares about stock holders.  Employees are disposable.  Management is paid to try and find ways to terminate you from your job.  You will not have anytime with family.
bad,on rainy days you couldnt see out of side mirrors or windows. in the snow you kept getting stuck. managements were not professional.. the equimpment was old and dirty half the time didnt work
bad,"Looks like a pig stye in the break room. Always looking to fire you for anything and they break safety rules to get you caught in breaking rules, total shot show"
bad,It just a hard place to work and you can't trust know one. It s one those places where one has be against everyone to survive it's a toxic place to work
bad,"poor management,they are always trying to fire you for no apparent reason.do not want to give you the tools to do your job.they have the worst management i have ever seen."
bad,they are not human  awful do not care about your family . or you they try to fire you for there mistakes . they lie cheat and don't pay you for work you do . they break hippa laws
bad,Expect to work 60 + hours a week with little to no family time no matter what position you are in. The job involves covering people who call out last second and leave you stuck working a 16 hour shift.
bad,"it is a really good people work there work hard, you can learn a lot and if  you keep your eye and hears open you can become a better person and worker."
bad,"Awesome co-workers (those who remain). "
bad,"A lot of hard work for little pay and you are constantly being yelled at by the boss, while he does no work.  I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"Started out as a great place to work but with new management on board, there is absolutely no work life balance and more stress is placed on front line managers to perform with no incentive or benefit. The expectation is to do more with less else lose your job."
bad,No stock options as was offered to me in my interview.  No job briefings.  A lot of nepotism and favoritism.  Work is unfair.  Management is unfair.  Pay is unfair.
bad,"Decent pay and benefits, but NOT WORTH IT! "
bad,"I have never worked at a job where management blatantly mistreats its employees and the corporate headquarters turns a blind eye.  There is a culture of employee retaliation and hostility.  We work in scorching heat with no air conditioning, most of our equipment is inoperable, and there is a manager who continually brutalizes and intimidates employees and is constantly promoted.  It is a modern slave, sweat shop and I am surprised that this company has not been sued out of business.  I hate to be so negative but one day I am afraid that there will be an instance of workplace violence because of the harsh and unfair work conditions."
bad,"Once the caller call you for work, you have only have 2 hours to get to the job no matter what you are going."
bad,This place is so disgusting. Everything about this company is fraudulent. They make their management fill out positive reviews to try and even out their actual reputation.
bad,This Company do not care for workers wellness; is all about shareholders only. Your opinion is not welcome in this company unless is for saving money to shareholders.
bad,A very toxic environment. The new management team has a Philosophy to cut people to the absolute minimum translating to long hours and overworked employees.
bad,"You don’t know from one day to the next if you’ll have a job or not, relocation is a must if you want to last due to constant job cuts.  managers try to bust you and pull you out of service. Decent pay but hours are on call and you will not have time for anything else."
bad,From the time I started I was forced to either be laid off or go where the work is training on my own time paying for my own lodging. You might get paid right and sometimes not. If you was paid wrong they take it from your pay. If the union tells you to put a claim for driving allowance or something they deny the claim and still don’t get paid. They are always O-testing for rules compliance rules always change daily. There training is terrible it’s sink or swim. They used to say if you don’t know ask be safe but they have cut so many jobs and laid so many people off they don’t have anyone around to ask questions. They pay isn’t bad but most other class one railroads pay a bit more. Called all hours of the night and day no off days. No marking off for sickness or anything else or you get an attendance problem forcing you to be fired
bad,"If you are looking to work a lot for just a little n get taxed like crazy, this is the place for you. The only industry where they try to fire you everyday and you have to have job protection insurance. I was an engineer and a local chairman."
bad,Toxic environment. Zero home life. Personnel shortage and missed deadlines are blame is placed on the employees. You will be cheated out of pay that have been agreed upon in Union contract. Do not work here.
bad,If you enjoy not having a life out side of work then CSX is the place for you.  Oh and don't forget that even though you are making great money you will only bring home 49% of your check to due the multiple and various taxes and dues they automatically deduct.
bad,"The Job and union that represents it have gotten worse year by year. The insurance became bad enough we had to switch to wife’s. Each year the job took more of your time with limitations on vacation, cutting jobs, and working you more. The worst part is you aren’t allowed to follow your faith there. I was written up for having a bible with me. Horrible culture with even worse ethical value."
bad,"No matter what goes wrong, the management always tries to find fault in the crew before investigating further. Very stressful and horrible hours. Compared to other class 1 railroads, CSX pays the least. You are constantly having fight for claims to be paid"
bad,They start firing you once you are hired. Trainmasters will do anything they can to save your job. they will lie on T&E employees to save THEMSELFS FOR THE BAD from their bad decisions.
bad,"Working hours to long most days. Always under threat of being fired, literally! Management is always under pressure to fire employees. Culture is safety oriented but highly stressful. Long times away from home. no work life balance at all. No holidays or weekends off ever. Always fighting to make sure you get paid correctly. The hardest part of this job is always being away from home. The most enjoyable part of this job to me is when i get off of work and come home."
bad,Csx attitude toward there employs are if u don't like it Mc Donalds is hiring. Per  bird dog...mow dept. The management style is hire new employees  if the don't do what I say.
bad,"If your single and don't mind working in all types of weather on every day of the year, fighting on a bi-weekly time scale with management and union to get paid properly, getting suspended/fired for simple rules violations and living on the road/in a hotel 80% of the time then sign up."
bad,"There is absolutely no job security with this employer.  With the addition of a new CEO and the layoff of over 1,500 employees I would advise that prospective new employees seek employee with a company that offers more security and better treatment of their employees.  The overall morale at work is very grim, and in the last 20 years this scenario has occurred several other times.  Employees are release with very little to no warning. You will work long hours with very little reward, because the only thing that matters are shareholder dollars."
bad,"Two Words.... Ignorant Hicks."
bad,"Work is very fast paced. If you have family and you want to spend time with them, then don't work here. If you have morals and values this is not the place for you. I worked Intermodal. I hear it's better on the transportation side. Do not work Intermodal!!!"
bad,"You're on call 24/7. You work on your off days. Most people are stuck in the hotel every other night for 30+ hours. You can have no personal life at this job. "
bad,The company does not care about it's employees anymore. They take a hard line on doing whatever the upper management decides at the cost of the employees. This environment promotes a back stabbing dishonest environment among the employees fighting to get a good review so they can get a pay bonus at the end of the year.
bad,Job security and work life balance is non existent. Do yourself a favor and steer clear unless you enjoy not having a personal stake in your family or not knowing if you have a secure future.
bad,"Workers are only treated as numbers, with no understanding of personal or health issues. Managers rule by fear and intimidation. Every year I have worked for CSX I have made less money."
bad,"Worse atmosphere that you could possibly work in. You miss every holiday with your family. Management is constantly threatening workers. If you're sick and call in it takes 6 months to get it off of your record, even with a doctor's excuse."
bad,"The work is not hard . The hours are so long and not regular, it creates a lot of stress. I had a very bad experience with the stress. It almost caused me to lose my family,my wife, and my ability to ever function again. The biggest thing you can say about how negative a job it is,  you do not get to go to church, go on family outings or have a set time to be with your family.    I beg you not to try. Do not put your life in the csx rr.Hands. I did and it cost me a lot.    Do not through your and your familys life away.   They are to valuable."
bad,"Pay is good, you have absolutely no life. On call 24/7 365 its very hard to get off work. The mgmt is constantly trying to fire you. It is a union job but the union does nothing. It seems to be a dream job but do the research it is a horrible company to work for."
bad,"The corporate culture is the good ole boys network, almost as if they were stuck back in the 1950”s. Sure there are some good people to work with there, but they are rare. Most people there are the most miserable pukes you’d ever want to work with. Management is always trying to fire you for anything. They won’t give you any vacation time, they make you call off sick, and then you are subject to their disciplinary policy when you do. They wrote me up for taking 2 days off to mourn my wife’s dead father. They wrote me up again for being off a day when my daughter had a sudden seizure and was in the ER. Awful place to work. STAY AWAY."
bad,"Been an employee for 7 yrs and it is progressively becoming more stressful, unorganized, and not a place to have a career. Great benefits ok salary but awful management"
bad,Sucks you’re just a number management sucks they try to fire you every day for something stupid wouldn’t recommend anyone working for such a poorly managed place
bad,"Its a trap, spend 6mo to a 1yr qualifying just to constantly threat of being fired. You have no life and your on call 6days a week 24/7. Management doesnt care"
bad,Was great company now management is a struggle to deal with. Not notified of policy changes and are just looking for reasons to get you in trouble.  Good Benefits and pay
bad,The only good thing about this place is meeting alot of good guys from all different backgrounds who gave up their dreams and military careers to have their throat cut at CSX. They have VETS being hired on that have issues with PTSD and guys coming home from the middle east just to work in an environment where they still have to fight to keep their jobs. CSX uses these guys against each other to fire each other. This place is a terrible place to work. Find another company to work for!
bad,"Do not start a career with csx or any other railroad. Underapid in terms of overall hours given to the company, and very weak unions & contracts! Work anywhere else but csx!"
bad,"The job activities were enjoyable but co workers and management were awful, no personalities or common sense needed to work there. Degrees were highly promoted wil disregard to the hard workers that actually did the work."
bad,"No work life balance. Always on call. You only get 24 hours off a week. You are able to choose a day based on seniority, but just because you choose that day it doesn't mean you will get it. You could be stuck rotting in a hotel. Its impossible to schedule vacation days. Not very good job security since they are going through a restructure and cutting jobs."
bad,It was good until they gutted the company. Last year they started laying everyone off. Now it’s a shell of what it used to be and practically destroyed Cumberland.
bad,Horribly run from a employee view.  Management will blatantly lie about service metrics to get the operating ratio within their projections.  The securities and exchange commission will be investigating soon enough.
bad,"It was a great company until about two years ago. now its nothing but cutthroat. Poor management and lack of communication. There only out for the shareholders. Closing or cutting entire workforces at every facility, not meeting demand of customers."
bad,"There is something better, keep looking.  Was a good company at one time, that has all changed.  Many angry people waiting on retirement.  I heard managers tell workers ""If you want a friend here--bring one with you"". Very negative atmosphere."
bad,Do not work here hired then fired or furloughed. Finally called back after 3 years after they ruined everything. Poor management and leadership running it into the ground.
bad,"Place is a joke, management is out to fire you. The pay is decent. Union is a joke. Work is completely unstable, chances of being furloughed the first year 100%."
bad,"dont work here, your just a number & they treat you like it.  Just a body for them to fill a crew & you're disposable to them.  No one seems to like their job"
bad,Losing volume and making money by cutting people and assets.  Do not care about customers or employees.  Typical company run by a hedge fund.  Will soon run out of areas to cut and maintain operations.
bad,"between the quick to fire management practices and the recent relaxation of safety rules it is clear the company only cares about profits, safety and customers do not register on the list of concerns at all."
bad,You worked 12-17 hrs a day 5-7 days a week with the superintendents cursing at you and saying demeaning things. The work crews were great to work with and enjoyed the work but the upper management were poor leaders and treated everyone terrible.
bad,"Poor management decisions tearing apart a railroad to increase profit "
bad,"Everyone was out for themselves.And jumed ship."
bad,Forced unsafe working conditions and unethical management. Solid 12 plus hour days followed by long hours away from home. Do not report injuries or unsafe working conditions.
bad,"This company used to be a decent place to work but over the years it has slowly become more stressful and less gratifying, when the new CEO took over the place totally went downhill and furloughs began"
bad,"The management culture is broken. Awful work environment. Antagonistic and hostile environment between labor and management, and among management. Cronyism is the rule, and competence is forgotten."
bad,"While the pay is decent, and the benefits are good.  They do not make up for the rest of the company.   CSX is ran on fear.   They are out to fire you the day after they hire you.  Management will lie to make themselves look good.    They could care less what happens to the employees."
bad,Company has been downsizing for the last several years. Mass layoffs prior to arrival of new CEO.  It is expected further job cuts will occur when the new CEO arrives.
bad,"CSX is not what it used to be. The environment is tense and employees are on edge. More than 4,500 people have been furloughed or laid off over the last 18 months or so. Work-life balance is non-existent and you are expected to be available 24/7. There is no security at the company and I would strongly urge anyone interested in this company to think twice before joining. The pay is good, but definitely not worth all the stress and headache. The company is very military-style culturally and new ideas and ways of thinking are not tolerated. The mission statement says the company is ""progressive"" but it is far from that. "
bad,travel is exciting while meetitng different people with different personality the hardest part of this job is its very stressful unfortunately there is no room for advancement i rarely see co-workers i enjoy up and down different highways
bad,"this particular skill set is just not in my vocabulary. This job requires a lot of long days with no pay at all, unless you sell a car."
bad,"Management is always looking to fire the union labor."
bad,not a friendly company to work for. weird hours never knowing your schedule ahead of time. computer system used is old dos system never upgraded.
bad,Run while you can  if hired by this company you will have to sell your soul to then to be employed  management will fired you before they help you do your job  there is more to life than this paycheck worked there for 7yrs on call 24/7 worked off days sacrifice my life for this place only to be fired for a minor mistake  the union does nothing for you other than take 120 a month dues  scumbag outfit
bad,"They suspend me because they said I took a pic in the terminal, to me 3 years working good whitout any traffick violation and doing the right things should be fine until the day I ask them for my unpaid moves, that day I did a violation lol"
bad,management tells you they want you to be safe and then tell you to brake all the rules if it befits them and if you do they fire you for doing it ..never know when going to work or coming home ..rule changes daily so the can fire you
bad,"Worked for CSX as a Trackman and a Conductor over 22 years. The work was physical but I never saw anyone that couldn't handle it.  Railroad life is 24/7.  Yes the pay is great and the benefits are very good. The retirement is second to none.  The toxic culture of management makes it unbearable, especially since the hedge fund take over.  Employees are treated as total  trash and have no recourse. Unions are useless to intercede.  Want to confirm my take on things? Research Hunter Harrison and what he did to the CN and CP railroads. He's dead and gone but his underlings are running things.  If you hire on, put your head in the sand and just say Yes sir! Right away sir! There's a better life outside of CSX!!"
bad,Horrible place to work if you want any sort of home life. On call 24/7 and have 2 hrs to get to the yard once your phone rings. Managers goal is to fire you bc they know you are replaceable. If you call off sick WITH a doctors note you still get points for attendance. They preach safety but order you to do things they’re unsafe if it means you get the job done faster and if you don’t do it then they will fire you
bad,"I worked at CSX for over 20 years and the only positive thing I can say is that the rate of pay is decent and so are the benefits. Management was poor, rude and turned a blind eye to lazy employees that didn’t work. Because it is a union job, you get paid for showing up whether you work or spend all hours pretending to work. I would recommend this place to nobody!"
bad,"Just a number to management,  been there 7 years and furloughed 6 times NO SECURITY. Underpaid for what you do and deal with and who you deal with. Always worried about getting fired or furloughed at the drop of a hat."
bad,Crew callers very disrespectful they don’t know our union agreements . Union reps say they’re going to dispute and do it at their lesuire. Trainmasters hide places and spy so they can write you up so they dnt get fired and it looks like their doing good things. Railroad basically hires you to basically fire you so make sure you have great job insurance for the time they give you off if no waiver is signed. The turnover rate in this field is horrible you never know how long you will be on furlough as well. No one wants to work weekends so the displacement board is always full. Your first 5yrs or more you will be on call rather it’s yard work or road work. They will tell you to enter a claim the company has violated and then the field team(trainmasters) will deny it like they didn’t say put the claim in.
bad,"Great benefits and a decent salary, but terrible home life and management treats employees horrible. Unfair and biased for the company, no matter how hard you work"
bad,This job is not good at all bad hours. Never     home at all poor management they will train you for years and try too fire you all the time for anything it's not a good company they treat there employee like bad.
bad,I would never recommend anyone other than someone that was single and intended to remain that way to work here. You have no family life and no life period.
bad,Workin for this company was horrible never recommend it to anyone who actually wants a life and not to live on standby and waiting for a random call to take a train
bad,Don't eat your seed corn. Loved working here until management changes in 2017 carved all the meat out to focus on short-term gains. The operational structure isn't there.
bad,Very uncomfortable work environment.   Job description varied from interview to 1st day of work.   Not a team working relationship.   Position is heavy geared for data entry workers.
bad,"CSX appears to be a good company to work for. However, every few years they purge their employees by the 100s just to increase company profits. They care nothing about American workers and their families. The last purge was 2017-2018 and over 3 thousand CSX employees lost their jobs all to raise stock prices. "
bad,If you want to work in an environment where you are consistently worried about headcount reductions then this is the place for you.  No position is safe at any time.  The corporate culture is divisive and ethically challenged.  When everyone is always watching their backs wondering when they are going to have their job cut it is impossible to keep focused on objectives at hand.  The worst corporate culture I have ever been involved with.  The number of lives and careers ruined by incompetent management is astounding.  They will also provide poor references keeping you from obtaining work in the field with other Railroads.
bad,"While pay and benefits are decent, the inefficiency of the company is very stressful and the overall way of life is diminished because of the unpredictable schedule.  This is not a family oriented company and hinders it's employees from having any stability in their employment."
bad,"Management is ALWAYS trying to fire you, DAILY! You are treated worse than a dog and more like modern day slavery. I would not recommend anyone to work here."
bad,A typical day on the railroad can last anywhere from 8-16 hours depending on whether you are working in the yard or working on the road. Hardest part of the job is not seeing your family very much.
bad,This company has ruined me. They let you in the door to work and let you get a taste of money. Not long after that they lay you off with no regard to you're financial status and no word on when or if you will be called back. After months of waiting for a call back they give you 3 days notice and if u can't make it you forfeit senioroty.
bad,"Use to be a good place to work. Need to change the company logo from ""It starts with the customer"" to It starts with the stock holder"".Constantly breaking the contracts with the union employees. No accountability, they are judge, jury, and executioner."
bad,Not a good place to work management hunts you for the smallest mistake or sets you up with lies in order to try and make you loose your job.  Does not care about it's employees at all
bad,Unless railroading is something in your blood or it is an absolute life long dream run don't walk away run away. from the first hiring interview I went through to the end of my time there they lied through there teeth to sugar coat the job. Time off is a joke you are expected to be on call 24/7-365 you can request off as much as you want but getting the request approved is the trick if something happens on the railroad you are expected to be there no questions asked within minutes. And that is wether or not you are on vacation. There motto is family first unless the railroad needs ya then forget about the family the railroad is the only family you need
bad,stay away i gave away so much of my life and they showed us how much they appreciated our efforts by shutting our terminal down.  worked the max out of us with limited pay and no appreciation
bad,"Railroading is a cut throat business.  If you are married, you will get a divorce.  If you are single, this might be the industry for you.  Very little chance for advancement."
bad,"CSX is an awful place to work.  The management is tyrannical, there is no room for advancement, and the company is actively letting their local business die.  Thus, there is no work.  There is too much emphasis on infinite details, and non on customer service of human resources."
bad,Horrible ignorant bosses who lack the vision and motivation to run a terminal and keep morale high among the crews.  New CEO is killing jobs inside and out of the company and all the upper level management care about is stock prices and protecting the shareholders not the employees who have made this company somewhat worthwhile.
bad,"Employees are not the center of the company's value, it is the share holders who desire higher profits, but at the expense of the employees and customers"
bad,"Great pay , horrible management top to bottom. Always looking for a way to fire you ,the day they hire you. New CEO is a lunatic that only cares about one thing ,and it's not the employee, it's the stock price !!"
bad,"CSX has a history of a strong culture based on core values of safety first; customer focus throughout all departments and achieving results ethically.   With the advent of new leadership selected by Wall Street, the company is transitioning from a long term focused, sustainable and value added platform for earnings to an immediate  move to implement a low-cost-provider strategy.  The transition will be challenging for employees, until a balance status quo is achieved.  The attributes that made CSX a great place to work will be be sacrificed to achieve a low cost operation."
bad,I would go back just to show management I am up to challenge. I was sick and lost job over it. I am now well and would love to show them just how wrong they were to let me go.
bad,This place is terrible! The pay and benefits are nice but they will hide in the weeds or wherever to try to fire you from the day you start until the day you leave.
bad,"Overall unless you already eat sleep and breath the rail road i don""t recommend it they take wanting more from less to the absolute max and then wonder why it takes more time to complete projects"
bad,CSX has been cutting jobs for a number of years.  individuals very troubled about any existing job security.  This atmosphere will last through the next CEO.
bad,"DO NOT GO TO WORK FOR CSX!!!"
bad,"Overall the pay is good, stress level is very high. no family life, there are very few minorities in management considering the fact that CSX is a fortune 500 company. Morale amongst employees are low."
bad,"People are great, engineers and conductors, management is archaic"
bad,"If you are single and can afford to be out of work from time to time this job is for you. If not, you may want to find something else."
bad,The hours and quality of life at CSX are horrendous.  Every corporation must focus on being lean and efficient but CSX has taken this idea to the extreme.  Morale in both the union and management ranks is abysmal.  The constantly deteriorating morale is directly attributable to CSX's lack of concern for its employees.  In an attempt to lower the operating ratio and increase profitability basic  resources are increasingly becoming more scarce but the expectations and goals remain the same.  CSX does not respect or value its most important resource - its human resource.
bad,"A  typical day with CSX is in one word terrible. The actual job itself isn't the problem, if you like being outside and doing semi- physical work its not bad. The problem is with management and coworkers. First we will start with everyone you come in contact with is  paranoid that management is "" watching you"" and that you shouldn't trust anyone. Management on the other hand bashes coworkers and places the blame on everyone else besides themselves. Lets talk about training. You will constantly keep asking for a schedule that you will get hours before you will be expected to be at work. Once you're at a yard and assigned to a crew thats it you will just keep hearing about things that have nothing to do with the actual work and more of ""Management is watching you"" and  tired stories from the ""glory days of railroading"". you will be part of the union which is a complete joke and waste of your money because if you do something wrong while in training or before a 90 day period after training they will do nothing fort you. All in all wasn't the job for me or any reasonable thinking competent human being."
bad,"You work on Trains, you fix basic mechanical issues such as brake pads and changing the oil. You do the work of not only a machinist but of a utility worker, pipe fitter, and electrician. Remember transportation is important and most often its their word over yours, so get those trains out on time! Following FRA rules is a big must. Your often sent out to the locomotive which could be a few minutes away to several hours away, especially in the instance of a wreck because its your job to clear that wreak and deem the train in working order. Mistakes are not allowed, and often offenses that will cost you your job."
bad,They furlough you every to every other year for long periods of time causing you to seek employment else where till they call you back just to furlough you again later down the line.
bad,The intermodal division suffers from very inept management . managers /supervisors have no previous railroad experience.which in turn becomes a major problem in dealing with day to day railroad activities plus employees. also theres a good ole boy mentality. no minorities in management positions . not being home is not such a big deal because if you want a career in railroading not being around your family comes with the territory.
bad,"Do not expect and sort of work/life balance. Policies are harsh and the mentality of management is that they own you. Avoid at all costs"
bad,"You can work or live, not both. 2 hours call time and could be on a train for 24 hrs before being taxied back to terminal. Good money, no home life at all."
bad,Bums life with good pay.  Hostile environment and back stabbing employees. Do not recommend this company.  Not all apples bad just enough to spoil the whole bunch.
bad,"You will be paid well, but you will live at work and be treated subhuman if you work in transportation. Say goodbye to relationships and to any social life."
bad,They do not provide a good quality of life and your really just a number.They aren't concerned with your health and wellness and just not the job it used to be.
bad,"This was the worst experience of my life.  I would never recommend working for CSX to anyone.  Although the compensation was nice, the atmosphere was not.  It does not matter how much you are paid if everyday you are threatened with being fired, managers following you around trying to write you up for little things.  I wouldn't let my DOG work for CSX!!!!"
bad,"If you like not having a life , being on call everyday , being shorted in pay , having a union in the companies pocket , not knowing if you have a job when you leave that day , lies , backstabbing , no ethics , no morals , then this is the job for you !!!!! Never knew what life was for the past 15 years , until last March !!!! I thought I would do this for 40 more years ! Nothing is good about this company , run if they try to hire you , but they won't because they would rather work current employees to death !!!"
bad,"csx was a great company to work for before the hedge fund come in now employees are treated like scrape metal, employees have no trust or respect for management and management use fear and intimidation to bully employees, moral is the worst of any place I have every worked and there is no sign of improvement, safety is no longer a concern only operational ratio matters at any cost"
bad,It was a great job untill a new CEO took over. Now you get told daily about getting furloughed or fired. It's all about making the stock go up with no regard for anyone
bad,"Management does not listen to logical arguments when presented to them, they are always firing employees although the company is making a lot of money. The put UNNECESSARY STRESS on employees making everyone UNHAPPY."
bad,"CSX is the only place I've ever worked where the managers seemed to hate their employees and delight in doing everything they could to get rid of them. Constant pressure, absolutely no appreciation for anything, undertrained or untrained managers who didn't understand what your job is, and a 5-inch thick book of rules that mostly contradicted one another. Workplace morale that made you hate going to work  every day."
bad,"Used to be the best job security available, not anymore with corporate greed. Your job is never safe. Don't leave a good job for this place. You are a number, not a human being."
bad,Stressful and very poorly managed company. Lots of drama and never ending travel away from your family. Compensation and healthcare is good but must like to live out of a bag and a hotel.
bad,"Hire exceptional talent and put them to work on mundane tasks.  The company's culture is outdated. If younger employees are not groomed, a great deal of knowledge will continue to be lost as baby boomers retire."
bad,"Cuts to the work force and the amount of work to be done has made it impossible to accomplish production goals, Safety standards are down until something happens and then the entire work group is punished. Management has created a unsafe work place,"
bad,"10-14 hour shift"
bad,"On call 24-7. Which means that you can not plain anything. 1 day off a week but you may not start your day off till 2 days after. Soooo no life. The company fights to not pay the employee, and always looks to find a way to fire you."
bad,Needs to be shut down or sold. This company cares for nothing or no one except their own pockets. Stay away! I've been laid off twice and have had things repossessed in the middle of it. Families augur and this time right before Christmas. They have no heart.
bad,The company has gone downhill very quickly. I am happy that I took the early buyout. The overall morale is horrible and management is only adding fuel to the fire.
bad,"Great group of people to work with, not including management. Management will look for any reason to fire you, very sneaky. Also, management will straight up lie to your face, I didn't believe it when I first heard it. But after working there I can tell you, ITS THE TRUTH! Good pay, no thanks to CSX, the only reason we get paid so well is due to the Union. With that said, the company will still look for any reason to not pay you what you've earned."
bad,CSX is a railroad that is continuously trying to streamline their operation. Their approach these days is do more with less. Jobs are constantly being cut throughout their entire system. CSX fully holds contractual employees accountable for everything and it is a constant management vs contractual employees. The work life balance is non-existent. CSX is not a good fit for someone that is not willing to have inconsistent days off and a home life.
bad,"Warren Buffet said it best a few years ago when he audited CSX for purchase. ""If I wanted to buy a company run by clowns I would buy ringling brothers circus"" . The management of this company is operating in a fashion that leads one to believe they are running it into the ground, by way of squeezing every dime of profit by cutting jobs and ridding themselves of customers that don't fit into their cost benefit ratio. They have literally 20lbs of rule books that you must have on you and know. That would not be a problem if it weren't for the fact that many of the rules are contradicting or written so vaguely that they are different from one manager to the next. Thus, giving all managers the resources to legitimately fire everyone for doing their job the way another manager told them to do it. They do not want you to get the work done they do not take care of their customers, employees, equipment, rail or buildings. They have a strict divide between the management and labor that isn't or can't be taught in any school of management. The labor in most cases cares more about getting the work done more than the management does. "
bad,"Not worth the training not worth the wait to go to training and certainly not worth my time anymore. There is nothing more to say. I' have been prompted by this automatic program to say more but there simply isn't anything good to say. Can you survive off of $21,000 when you make it 2 months at a time and then nothing for 2-3 months ?"
bad,"treat employees as disposable property."
bad,"I gave them 35years 24/7 when I hurt my back they attacked me personally and made me look like a villain. Do Not Trust Management . They say they care about you and safety is first, But you better get the job DONE!  I have had two back surgery and still can not function . My live is done!"
bad,I hired with this company as a freight conductor in 2006. I got layd off through the holiday season that year with no pay. I got forced 1000 miles away from my family for one year. Had to go or face losing my job. I have been layd off 6 months out of the year every year since 06. I lose my family insurance every single year. I've only made vacation 1 year. No paid time off. Remember this is a 24/7 job. You have to take off for things. You better have an emergency room excuse or they will suspend and eventually terminate you for attendance. Drs visits are not excused. They have dirty tactics such as hiding behind buildings and getting in groups of 10 to 15 managers to come out in the field and try to intimidate you. They advertise management jobs and give to the newer unseasoned employees. The results are an incompetent manager who provides nothing on the way of results. They will promise the world and not deliver. If you have a job now making at least 23000 per year id stay away.
bad,"Deferred maintenance in every aspect of railroading."
bad,"Pay and benefits are great.  Culture is terrible.  Always employees versus management.  No job security other than what is provided by the union.  As one of the top people in the 7 layers of management before reaching executives said ""Your paycheck is your reward.""  Don't expect anything more than that."
bad,"Loved my job as a railroder but from the day I started the talk was lay off. CSX continues to give lines to other Railroals furloughing employees. "
bad,Don’t bother unless you want to be laid off more than you work.  The management is mostly incompetent.  The company doesn’t see employees as people just steeping stones to their bank account balance.
bad,"Beware, restructuring on a constant basis, history showed stability. With hedge fund takeover and headhunter Harrison dead and gone stability might come back, 10 years in before furlough, tranfered 3 hours away from home to a location where only 2 of 20 employees were from location. Union representation is just a payroll deduction, pretty much in the company's pocket to keep their jobs. Most new Management have no railroad experience, college grads, shops can run themselves, management input slows progress but employees blamed. Loved the work, co workers, but management and unions a joke. Was a lead man, I showed an hour early and set shop up before management had a say so, saved us a lot of extra.moves and time. Still talk to old co-workers, they still don't believe they are secure and environment worse. Good experience to move on to Short line or class 1."
bad,Terrible company work for no family ethic you're not treated as an employer treated as a number after you get hired all they do is try to fire you would not recommend working for this company
bad,I would not go back to them myself. Maybe as a young man I would stick it out. Between the union taking money from me and doing nothing in return. The company jacking employees around. The only thing they want is engines gone. They don’t care about the employees nor their family.
bad,"Enjoyed the work. Found work challenging. Learned technical skills, operating skills involving rr shipments, learned how to interact effectively with all levels of personnel and customers involved with freight damage and freight prevention. Worked for some very good managers, some adequate managers and some terrible managers. Culture was very stressful due to continual downsizing of management personnel and then union personnel. At times found training on job that you had to bump to was either very poor due to mentor attitude or very inadequate. The hardest part of the job was the environment of stress and strain created by the continual downsizing and its secretiveness. Many of my co-workers were friendly, personable, professional and always willing to help. These coworkers are the ones I miss most since I lost my job."
bad,You are expected to work 7 days a week sometimes 18-20 hours a day.  Company culture is stuck in the past with leaders not open to outside the box thinking.
bad,"I think it's disgusting they lay off houndreds of people, left families wonder if they are going to be homeless or not and a month later hiring for the same positions they let go. Crazy"
bad,Was a good place to work until precision railroading took over worst concept ever customer service sucks now. Management is weak. Employees are all scared for there job not a positive environment to work in
bad,"The management is completely incompetent of the work performed. There's controversy between the managers and workers everyday. The work schedule's terrible, and believe me, they do not care. There's new employees coming and going all the time out there."
bad,"Working on call 50+ hours per week. 1-2 days off every two weeks. Spend more time out of town and in hotels than you will at home. No job security, can and will be laid off at any point and time. You're  just a number in their system. Only good thing is the retirement and benefits."
bad,Racially divided...there is a obvious difference between the way black workers are treated in Augusta ga location... I turned in three white guys for making a hangman noose and presenting it to me and 6 months later a was fired for a bunch of lies that their friends told on me... All white guys
bad,The benefits are good but you are always having to think if you are going to have a job the next day because of cuts that corporate was pushing.
bad,Poorly managed.  Upper management only cares about themselves.  No security there anymore.  They don't care about their employees.
bad,No  life. Good benefits and pay.  Company doesn't care for you. Your just a number to them. Work is pretty easy but politics are bad there. managers will charge you if it helps them. No back bones in management.
bad,"The points system and you are forced to work mandatory. No option."
bad,"CSX used to be a great place to work until company management changed. Now with massive layoffs, and top-down managerial harassment makes CSX not an enjoyable workplace."
bad,"Upper management is the worst ever, they will fire you for the smallest infraction you can be a 10 plus year employee with no incidents & the first one you commit no matter how small or major you're fired"
bad,"The recent change in management at CSX has the morale of all employees at an all time low. the stress of basic, day to day activities is almost too much to bear. the work isnt bad. safety is a top priority, but not because they care, but because they dont want to pay up. if they can find a way to cut costs, theyll do it. including send you to the house."
bad,"Great Place to work  but layoff every year up too 7 months at a time "
bad,the job is a great job. the work is interesting and fun. management is horrible. they look for reasons to fire people. all the head guys are worried about is making a dollar
bad,"Great money and benefits,  but very poor management. Even though the union is great to protect the employees,  it makes railroad employees very spoiled and lazy. "
bad,Good job for someone with no family's. It's lucrative. Safety sensitive. Long hours. You can move up to management if you desire. Traveling is a must.
bad,The working environment at csx was toxic and very backstabby. The diversity metrics were out of line in the department I worked in. I would not recommend this employer at all.
bad,"I love my job but I was forced out of my job due to corporate greed. "
bad,One of the best companies I have ever worked.  Great people to work with.  I also love the technology that we implemented.  Very successful railroad company.
bad,"Would be fine place to work if they didn't lay off so much.  They are negligent in their hiring.  I was hired and then spent most of 2 years laid off before I left for another job.  They completely hired a whole group of people at another terminal and then had to tell them that they didn't have jobs after they had left their old job.  The new CEO at CSX really has things in a bad mess.  It is not a place I would recommend to go right now, if they are even hiring."
bad,I worked with some Fine men and enjoyed troubleshooting locomotives. Unfortunately CSX was taken over by a hedge fund manager and the cutting of jobs were their number 1 priority
bad,"The management is the worst. Know matter how much you do, they want more. Company is never satisfied. You will never get off at you assigned time. Worst job ever."
bad,"CSX has been secure job up until the CEO changed if you have the right connections you'll do well. At the moment the future of the company is unknown with extreme cuts to the workforce. The work is hard, but you learn to appreciate it. Overall, it's a good company with many risk, and attitudes. The dynamic is changing more into performance driven instead of quality performance."
bad,When I started at CSX 10 years ago it was the greatest place to work but the last couple of years have been the worst.  They have been taken over by a hedge fund
bad,I would not recommend working here. The new CEO has ruined the moral of all the employees and simply only cares about profit for the share holders. When something goes wrong he always points the finger at the employees.
bad,It was a great company and it went down hill when the hedge fund took over and it doesn’t look like it will recover anytime soon. You use to have a future there not anymore
bad,hire you to fire you...got hired and was put out of work a couple months later.. your consulate gone and money doesn't compensate the time your away from family
bad,"Dangerous work , many petty employees to contend with. Been understaffed for at least 2 years constant overtime. Management are a group of convicted liars and are very sneaky. Overall I would say it is a fairly hostile work environment."
bad,like I said in the title easy to make money here but a tough way to make a living. No time for your family and always on the toad. Your expected to follow easy rules and expected to break them when needed to
bad,The company wastes money continually sending people to atlanta for training because after training you work for a few months before getting furloughed and very few people with any dignity or responsibility's return. At least that is how it went for about 30 guys i knew when i was working there.
bad,Very cut throat environment....only as good as your boss allows...held back from advancement by bosses to make there job easier. Great place minus the politics
bad,"Can’t say anymore! Horrible place to work period, stressful, management is always into of you, long hours, horrible y pay, Benifits are the only things keeping me around"
bad,Company is not employee friendly placing more emphasis on the almighty dollar than its employees. It used to be a good place to work till the last 2 CEO's took it over. Now it is a shell of its former self destined to be dismantled and ran into the ground.
bad,"Drill out rail cars and place them on specific tracks, pull and spot rail cars at customer sidings."
bad,The job has become so cutthroat that it is enjoyable to work for. The job cutting and cost cutting measures have become so extreme that every day you’re constantly on edge if your position is next
bad,"never know when going to or coming home from work, managers never stay, constant threat of getting fired, outside all the time, impossible to get time off"
bad,Long working hours 12 and 16 hours shifts. Employees are expected to work 16 hours shifts at moment notice and keep production steady.   Management lacks forward thinking which creates an environment of low morale amongst employees.
bad,You came in check your paperwork and got what you needed then headed to your train. I learned how to conductor and engineer. The management was out to fire you. It was pretty relaxed once you got out on the road. The job was the culture. Finding time with the family. The pay
bad,Dispatcher will shame you when you call off or try to get you to work on holidays. Good job for someone with no education and does not care to be away from home. CSX could not care less about you or your family.
bad,New CEO is selling off company. Very difficult life style. Good retirement if you make it that far. New CEO has closed several rail yards just to please investors.
bad,"Field Location- little if any interaction with superior. Long days, 24x7 including holidays and weekends. Culture has changed with new CEO. 1000 managers cut in March. Another 1000 coming next year, Most are unaware if they will have a job in the near future."
bad,"This is a great job for the individual who never wants a wife or a family. Once hired you will be expected to work on your rest the rest of your life, spending more time in motels than your own bed."
bad,Expect long hours and no time with your family. The rail life is very different sometimes spending 3 days away and 12 hours home. Pays well but there is no extra time for life. They want everything you got!
bad,"Use to be a good company, not anymore. Does not care about the employees. Management wants to move up and does not care who they will walk over. A lot of good employees have left."
bad,"Little to no life balance and disappointing culture. Day to day life was stressful, as everyone was taking on multiple roles from job cuts. Benefits are okay"
bad,I used to love working at CSX until it was taken over by new management.  I felt as if they stopped caring about their customers and employees.  I would not recommend taking a job there.
bad,"This use to be a wonderful and secure place to work but now they don't care who actually knows the job, more worried about the bottom line. Integrity is no longer a goal."
bad,"Bad place to work. Managers will always find a way to write you up, and that's because they're told to from there bosses. Which is sad. Culture here at CSX is horrible."
bad,No matter what you do it’s never enough . Gone 10 days away from family. Never the same shift time. No paid sick days . Family life doesn’t matter or exists on the railroad
bad,"great company for investors, terrible for employees. But not any different from most companies. Sad that a company can actually hate their own employees."
bad,"Management position were rewarded to those who had no management training or background.  Ethics violations were ignored.  My last two years at the company were a case study on how wonderful companies begin to fail."
bad,"My mom always said, if you can't say anything nice don't say anything at all. One good thing that came from my time at CFW was meeting some great people who I still talk to weekly."
bad,"Drilling out specific cars from specific tracks, pulling and spotting customers."
bad,"At the end with new CEO, there were seven EAP managers.  Three jobs eliminated, leaving four.  Next, another three eliminated, leaving one.  That person left at the end of 3/18 leaving none and looking at 800 service.  Not certain of direction of EAP."
bad,"CSX does not care about its transportation employees, We work in all kinds of environmental conditions, for up to 12 hours a day, We have a job that isn't suitable for most, although i am thankful to have a job in this economy, the bottom line is always the number one priority. In my almost 5 years of experience with this company, they have implied that I am not keeping the shareholders best interest in mind. The schedule for a line of road Freight Conductor is highly unpredictable, there is no regard for the employees health, family, or general well being, yet the expectations of their transportation employees are unquestionably high! e.g. I have to available for a 2 hour call 24/7, 365 days a year, or I am not a considered a good employee."
bad,"Used to be a fun place to work.  Under new CEO moral and life style have gone down.  Company talks a good game but does not care about its employees.  Benefits are average, however the cost of health ins. is very reasonable.  Don't plan on seeing your family much if you work here."
bad,Front line managers are expected to work at least 12 hours a day. Off days are very rare and vacations are commonly cut short or taken aways with no reimbursement. Very poor communication when implementing changes.
bad,The company is clearing being set up to be merged with another major railroad.  Nearly everyone I know who remains spends the early part of their morning wondering if they should visit their desk due to the fact HR is likely boxing up their items.
bad,"Pay is great, no job security. I've been with the company for three years, I've been furloughed twice and have only work 10 months, maybe 11 months. I was forced to a different terminal three hours away from my home and original terminal. So now I have to relocate without my family because I can't take a chance and move them when there is no guaranty of being furloughed. There is no time for anything else besides working for the company. Employees with more years and seniority have been furloughed above me and young employees are being furloughed under me, so I'm waiting for to get furloughed again."
bad,"No supervision, very unorganized, very unprofessional. Co-workers are not team players. The hardest part of working with PTI is staying awake on third shift."
bad,"The work and peers are fine, but the management culture is toxic since the PSR program was enacted.  If you are willing to stay at the bottom of the seniority list and move from city to city, you will have a job.  Otherwise plan on being furloughed every few years."
bad,"Too dangerous for the money. "
bad,"they don't care about their employees , only stock holder, will fire you for breathing wrong. they took what use to be a great job and turned it into a terrible place to work."
bad,I've worked for 3 railroads and this is the worst one by far. The pay is TERRIBLE!!! CSX pays 10s of thousands of dollars less than other railroads. No life at all...you work basically every day.
bad,"A typical day at CSX was sometimes working 8 hours and often forced to work16 hours. Management monitored your breaks and sometimes cut them short, the workplace culture went down, low morale when the new CEO took over, the most enjoyable part of the job was working with your co-workers. No family/life balance. Management only thought of themselves. Lack of employees safety and well-being was taken into consideration."
bad,the money is good but the life sucks.  live by the phone 24 7 and the managers that have never done the job but tell you how to do it are book smart but life dumb.
bad,You work on call and when you are called to work most of the time you area away from your family for 2 days at a time lucky to be home for more than 20 hrs. Management is consistently looking for a reason to fire you or get you in trouble. The pay is good and the retirement and benefits are nice but depending on the person might not be worth the hassle.
bad,CSXT provides you with a constant threat of losing your job. Firing at CSX was common place. It is a hostile work environment. CSXT's employment is the equivalent of modern day slavery and they treat you as such.
bad,"When I was finally able to get into CSX, I was elated.  The benefits were awesome as well as the compensation.   However, shortly after my employment started I was very unhappy.  The biggest reason for this was poor management in my department.  They had their favorites and it was well known.  It was impossible to leave the department.  It seemed as if management would block me every step of the way.  Finally, there was a big layoff and I was actually hoping to be part of the layoff.  That's pretty sad but explains how unhappy I was there.  I did end up getting laid off and I've been happier ever since."
bad,On call 24/7. Must report to work rested and ready to go. Must be on your A game everyday safety is very important. A little miss hap can turn into a real big accident.  Yiu are responsible for your own safety and also the publics. It's a must to be sharp every day.
bad,CSX has a vested interested in getting all the work that they can get out of you before you get to you 5 year mark. They will try to build a case against you over time so they can get rid of you before your vested.
bad,On call 24/6 and holidays. One day Guaranteed  off. 10 hours rest before they could call you back in. Constantly looking over your shoulder. Only good  thing is benefits.
bad,"The work at CSX is fun.  Some days are worse than others (weather and work load) but if you enjoy working outside and being around heavy equipment, then you'll have a good time.  I wouldn't recommend working for this company at the moment.  It's not the powerhouse it once was.  Lay offs are almost a guarantee, upper management at the corporate level shows little interest in taking care of those actually moving freight.  One week you may have a job, and the next you find out you're laid off for 9 months."
bad,The railroad is not a place to work for someone that has a family. You're constantly away from them. Hours are on call. Lay offs happen too often. There's no job security
bad,"CSX  has become the laughing stock of the railroad industry with the appointment of its new CEO."
bad,"CSX is a strong company, however, recent leadership is focused on cutting cost. Leadership generally doesn't value the work that you complete, and the work/ life balance is non existent."
bad,Fast pace have to follow rules and understand rule books learn hundreds miles rail road name of signals mileposts sidings be able to work under pressure stay away from family for days on end work full 12 hrs shifts in all weather work holidays
bad,this company offers good pay and benefits but you dont know if you will have a job next week with no heads up from management.
bad,"Awful work and life balance in the field/transportation which is only slightly acceptable due to great pay, but that feeling quickly disappears and you simply hope they relocate you to another location and increase your pay before you get tired of 24/7 on call or 10+ days on 2 off,"
bad,"The company has to much upper management,I really enjoyed my co-workers."
bad,"I had spent years trying to get into the railroad. When I finally got in, it is hard to leave due to the benefits and pay. That is the only good part about the railroad. They could careless about you as a person, or about your family. Best advice, if you get into the railroad, keep your head down and mouth shut."
bad,The quality of life is zero. Management are always looking to fire you. The stockholder shares are the most important thing instead of the customer. They work you like a dog and threaten you if you dont do what your told even if it is against rules or unsafe.
bad,"i very much enjoy my craft but working for CSX these last 11 years have not been great. Numerous layoffs, on call 24/7 7 days week, management always firing people even when investigations prove no one at fault-always putting blame on someone. No union support. the lowest work moral i have ever experience."
bad,They changed CEO and they became a lean and mean firing machine. They threatened their employees with job loss if they made any mistakes or did not answer questions that might be directed to them from the CEO or Upper Mgmt.
bad,"Ok to work for if you want no work life balance. If you want to move up its pretty easy, just excel at your job and blow the peoples egos above you up and you will fit in."
bad,The job itself is great and the union workers are great as well. The upper management treats their workers awful and are not qualified at their positions. The culture between management and track workers is not a positive one. One almost feels like they look down on track workers and constantly want to take people out of service. Good pay if you are willing to work but home life will suffer because of stress caused by management.
bad,"Long days."
bad,"If they hire you, be prepared to be laid off. Repeatedly...while the people who call trains beg them to rehire people because freight isn't moving. Management will always pick each other and looking good over your safety and the truth."
bad,Good pay and benefits if you are willing to sacrifice everything.  Managers are mostly horrible who have no idea of real work in the field.  Find a better job.
bad,You are there to work. That's all the company cares about. The balance between work and real life is bad. You are not valued for hard work and sacrifice. The payroll department is always cheating you.
bad,"typical day get on a phone conferance at 0600 that would last about 40 mins. after that check your work plan for the day.  brief your guys, get them safety supplies.  once they're out the door answer emails, check you defects, catch up on computer work.  "
bad,"CSX used to be a great place to work, but no longer. The pressure has become impossible to bear since the takeover of the hedge-fund backed management to make the railroad profitable. They are trying to force the Agile development process into every aspect of the business, even areas where it makes no sense, such as support. It is tense and very uncomfortable every day."
bad,I would not ever recommend this employer to anyone. Especially with a family. On call Six days a week. Once you get a call you have to report within two hours.
bad,I have learned a great bit from the railroad.  Great pay and benefits are not everything in life.  How a well managed and not so well managed company look.  Really enjoyed the brotherhood.
bad,"Work was easy and the pay is great. "
bad,"The job you do is simple enough. Look over work reports and see what the track looks like where you are going. Talk to the engineer and get on the train and go. "
bad,"Not worth the money to miss your family that much, extremely cut throat environment, Constant harassment, you will never have a real life, the railroad will come first or you will have no job"
bad,This company does not value its employees...even those with over 20 -30 years of experience and service.  Concern is not given about the employees safety or their families.  Moral is extremely low.
bad,"It's a company that takes and takes and takes and gives nothing back, it's the type of place that will reward you for one week for something done and then punish you the next for the exact same thing.  There is people in charge who have absolutely no knowledge of what's being done, and therefore there is no accountability held towards things done inaccurately, and they cut cut cut and expect more and more out of people while trying their best to tear you down and replace your job."
bad,The company works its way to finding ways to hang you out to dry. They work to fire you the moment you mark up as a conductor. The only benefit was the pay and health.
bad,"CSX is a great place to work if you are in any other department besides transportation, the people who actually move the freight. This department is 100% unionized and every craft has a different union, which are constantly at odds with management. The result is a terribly dysfunctional transportation system with multiple delays, outdated technology, unsafe working conditions, and an environment of fear and intimidation with no job security. If you work for csx, stay out of transportation."
bad,"Executives say they want to improve employee satisfaction, but the company is too profitable to make them willing to change."
bad,"Great pay, great benefits, otherwise good luck  You are constantly scrutinized. Frequently assigned to impossible tasks in the time frame allowed. If anything goes wrong they seek to blame the employee not an equipment failure."
bad,"Takes a while to get sent to training,  after your hired. 3 weeks training in Atlanta ($600 per week before taxes). Travel, food and lodging provided. 3 to 4 months of OJT(on the job training) at $600 per week before taxes. After all the training, currently $2450(80% of full conductors pay the first year. Get 5% raise each year until you get to 100%) per 2 weeks guaranteed, can easily make more depending on the extra board roster. At risk of being played off without warning for about 10 to 15 years. Say goodbye to a regular work schedule, holidays and weekends."
bad,"It's not for everyone but neither is physics. We could say it's a lot like riding a bike with training wheels but someone forgot to put on the handlebars. Overall it was fun"
bad,"The job: It is very straight forward and easy. Days are long and working in all weather conditions will take a toll on you physically. Work stays at work and is not stressful; however, a lot of time will be spent working by being called in early, staying late, working holidays, and weekends. Average hours worked per week was consistently 52-64 hours. As a new employee the only holiday you will be off is Christmas Day. Management tries their best but they are being squeezed to do the work as efficiently as possible."
bad,The guys you work with mostly good guys...Road Master that just got promoted..in Cincy...liar..back stabber...did i say liar!! No people skills but CSX likes that i guess..plays favorites for sure...money is good...Ins was pretty good but getting more costly...union...what union? But they take their money every TIME...
bad,Schedule was all over the place and paste of work was very slow manager had no idea what he was doing.Did pay to train for welding and benefits were offered
bad,"If you’re single it’s a great job, once you have kids say goodbye to them. You will their birthday, holidays, and enjoy a nice hotel dinner on Christmas."
bad,Upper management is out of touch of what resources are needed to run a safe and efficient operation.  Lack of man power for both management and union employees caused most employees to feel overwhelmed and stressed out.
bad,Working 3rd shift with weekdays off was not something that I would call a career goal. The newer employees were treated disrespectful and were expected to bow down to more senior employees who had no ambition to due the required work. The managers on the night shift really had not received enough training and would often run the new employees into the ground while others often would sit and chat in the office. The culture was not what I would have expected from such a large company.
bad,The current culture is one of fear and distrust of everyone and everything.  Poor senior leadership with tons of redundancy in everyday activities.  They are more concerned with paperwork and reports than with railroading.
bad,Learned the dynamics of railroad systems and their complying territories rules and regulations. Hardest part was learning all the signals verbatim. Not a very physical job but had to be very witty. enjoyed traveling and staying in hotel.
bad,"Enjoyed working there until the hostile takeover and was shown the door.  I am sure the new regime will get the shareholders what they want, but for the rest of the people left...good luck."
bad,"With a newly appointed CEO, over 1000 management personnel were involuntarily separated from the company.  The severance package offered to those who were affected by the actions was unacceptable."
bad,It is like any other large corporation. There is not much of a relationship with your supervision. Good pay and benefits but no clear career progression path.
bad,A typical work day consist on leaving your family for a day or two to stay out of town for work.I learn how to operate a train using a remote control safely to complete the work given.The management time is out to take your job from you instead of helping you to comply and complete you assignment given.The hardsest part is to wake up any hours of the day or night to leave your family. Te most enjoyable part of the job is when everybody works safe no one gets hurt and the company cooks out.
bad,"Search for your own reviews on glass door, or look up reviews on another site. Many can be found by doing a simple google search."
bad,Used to be a great company to work  but has turned greedy and no longer is concerned with its employees or their safety. Great pay and a great retirement but that's all your getting
bad,"terrible hours no schedule, people are always angry and disgrunteled"
bad,1A typical day at work consists of getting a 2hr call time before having to report to a train.Then I am giving my train orders for that day to take the train from point A to point B. A days work can last between 8-14hrs. While being at CSX I have acquired knowledge on how to drive a train and building a train. While on duty you work with one other co-worker. The hardest part of the job is always being on call 24hr after service hours are up. The most enjoyable part of this job is being able to drive a 15 thousand ton machine.
bad,Hired on as a Freight Conductor and was told plenty of work. Within 30 minutes of marking up on completion on training was furloughed with expected call back date of over a year.
bad,my typical day at csx was stressful & dangerous.there were very few experienced workers who were willing to help you or encourage you learn your job or work safely; because they did not want you there;and so it seemed that many were happy to see you fai;with a greater support system and environment my stay would have been more enjoyable.
bad,Job pays well but quality of life will suffer. Most assignments require being away from home and working extremely long hours. The benefits and retirement are very rewarding.
bad,"You have good and bad in any job. CSX as with all class 1 RR it's a seniority thing. If you can hold a job that's normal you have it made. If you have low seniority plan on being bumped around a lot and not having much of a life for a while. "
bad,First place that I have worked that spends tons of money to train you then constantly tries to fire you..  They keep cutting off shop and letting equipment run till it drops.
bad,Good for a single person who loves travel and being away from home. Not a good job if you have a family or love to have any kind of schedule.  Money is good but they pay you for the inconvenience.
bad,"used to be an ideal place for a career good pay, good benefits. now jobs are on the line everyday and it has very unsafe practices and nobody cares if you do the right thing or not just get the job done is all that matter just to make upper management look good and they will be happy."
bad,"Treats customers and employees as a means to an end. Would rather eliminate job positions and force the workload on remaining employees."
bad,"Good benefits for you and family.  Tough work schedules, no home life.  Management tends to make themselves look good while throwing employees under the bus."
bad,It was not the nicest place to work with so many long time rail roaders who operated the company like it was still in the 1960's.  It was hard to advance as a woman.  I had the best manager though.
bad,Run as far away as you can young people. Horrible environment to work in right now as people continue to get cut and those who are still there walking on eggshells.  Was a great company just a year ago.
bad,"The industry as a whole is interesting work. The corporate culture at CSX fosters low morale and thus, low productivity..............................."
bad,While it's understandable that the new leadership wants to show results to their shareholders the cost to over 1000 jobs and the major shift in culture away from a reasonable work life balance has made CSX a very unstable employer.
bad,On call 24/7 and its railroad life then family.  railroad comes first. your family will have a good life with out you most of the time. cant really plan for nothing
bad,"I actually didn't hate my time with the company. Had some nice co-workers and the job was actually fun. Management and the CEO on the other hand were terrible. They preach safety out here but will turn a blind eye to it until it effects production. They give you a rule book the size of a phone book and you are expected to memorize them all. Yeah like that's possible especially when you have a rule revision every week! Kiss your social life goodbye. Everything is based around seniority so you'll basically be on call for the foreseeable future. Then the worst part is this is a billion dollar company that wants to nickel and dime you. Paychecks would regularly be short and claims would regularly be denied for work you had done. I've also never seen a company spend so much money training a person just to fire them on a whim. The company has lost touch with what makes it work and that's the employees. I'd recommend this job to a younger person as it has great pay and no education necessary, but for someone with an established family it would be hard since you basically wouldn't see them."
bad,A good company to work for but there is no job security.  Working on call is difficult when it comes to planning your life.  Management is helpful at times.
bad,"Long days"
bad,"overall good company, but doesn't pay very well. 8 hour days, good training program"
bad,If you like giving job everything and some. Then you should have no problem with railroad. 
bad,"It’s going down hill. Use to be a gold standard job. But it’s getting worse and worse ! Mangament spend more time spying on you trying to write you up then to help u "
bad,Work all the time. Never enough family time. Sleeping in motels. Work nights weekends holidays. Strict Attendance policy. Your just a number. Management is cutt throat. Whatever it takes to move up.
bad,Some days you spend 16 hours walking tracks that are over a mile long. You walk theses tracks in all weather conditions. You are forced to continue moving. When you are not grounding you are in a truck that want you to reach a certain quota of boxes pulled. This means constant movement for all 16 hours.
bad,"Could be a decent place to work, but you are not treated like human being by a large part of management with a few exceptions. This mindset comes directly from corporate whereas nothing is put before the money-including customers, personal and company integrity, safety, quality of equipment, work conditions for employees, quality of life, and life itself. Not worth working there, even for the money. This is a union job, but don't be fooled; they are compromised and you will receive hardly any benefit from the union even though you pay them every month."
bad,Very big disconnect with headquarters and how the railroad is run. Many senior level people have shown that they really dont care about their people.
bad,"A typical work day starts when your telephone ring at anytime of the day, You cannot plan your life because you don't know when you will be going to work."
bad,Great company to.work for gave me alot of opportunities and furthered menin life they have good pay and benefits but expect to work long hours and not have a steady schedual
bad,"I explained above. Managment is very corrupt. They will bend the rules including your own safety if it benefits them, and will turn right around and throw u directly under the bus"
bad,its the only job i ever had that tries to fire you from day one. being on call 24/7 is not safe at all. you never know when to sleep and when not too.you stay tired all the time  some managers will try to help while others will not give you the time of day.
bad,"co workers are great, mngt is cutthroat, work life balance unbalanced, no room for error. buy red board insurance, dont trust the union, and the company can do whatever it wants."
bad,"While there is work it is good. Good pay, enough time off to spend with family, but work is not guaranteed. They lay off out of nowhere and for reasons unknown. They send managers out with the intent of firing people for rules that are governed by interpretation that could and have changed after the employee is fired. The work is not hard, the money is good. If the company paid the employees what they were due ex: not paying claims that blatantly violate employee contracts because they know it takes years for it to go to an arbitrator to be paid; then it would be less stressful."
bad,"The job is good and the pay is great.  One problem is that your home life is pretty much gone.  I knew this going into it, so I knew what to expect. I'm just giving a heads up to people that are very family oriented.  This job isn't for you.  The biggest problem is job security.  You never know when you may be furloughed or when you may get called back.  They hire a ridiculous number of people and then end up laying them all off.  I have a year and a half and can't hold a job now.  I've been furloughed 3 times.  Now is not the time to join the railroad.  Aside from that it's an awesome job.  If I were able to hold a position and feel comfortable in it, I would definitely recommend it as a place to work.  Again, it's just not something to look into due to the current economic conditions."
bad,"Poor social/family life no work schedule on call 24/7. Very strict in rules, takes forever to build seniority and they lay off a lot. Would not recommend."
bad,"was a good career to have and then company has taken turn for the worse.  Due to lack of poor upper management trickling down to the floor managers, it created a hostile environment"
bad,What had been a great company was attacked and taken over by a hedge fund with a hired gun.  Result was a company that only cares about bottom line and stock appreciation for large shareholders.
bad,"Was a great job, cutting edge of technology, safety was first, good co-workers, and good benefits. Worked as a journeyman electrician for 15 1/2 on 3rd shift injury free my whole career. Troubleshooting broken down locomotives with schematic prints and multi-meter and electrical tools was my primary job. After repairs were made engine was taken outside and qualified and sent to the ready field for service."
bad,"New hires will have an extremely hard time holding a job. It's an OK gig, but very hard at first. You have to put your time in."
bad,long hours. you will have no work life balance. on call 24/7 in a stressful environment Forced to work sick/ on holidays. Never get to sleep ever again
bad,"worked their 12.6 years. loved the job and people. the last 2 years a new manager came in and it became so hostile that 7 lower managers quit. in the last 6 months the pressure being put on craft employees forced some to quit. taking jobs with less pay, benefits and little to no retirement. a large percentage of the work force was then laid off. would go back?"
good,"Worked there for 16 years, spent 8 of those as an ""on call"" extra board employee. No real chance for advancement. Benefits and pay were good. Management not that great."
good,"Typical work day includes looking over your shoulder every step you take, because management is literally hiding in bushes waiting to fire you for a bogus rule violation. Every two weeks you have to review your statement of earnings to see how much money the company steals from you. Then, spend a year or two hoping an arbitrator sides with you so that you can receive the pay that you earned/deserved. It's an everyday fight between company/employee/union. Very stressful job with terrible Moral."
good,"CSX used to be a much better company to work for, it has taken a recent turn for the worst.  Upper management does not care about the rank and file employees who are in my opinion making the company record profits."
good,Single man's environment. Railroad lifestyle is definitely a strain on family. Would not recommend to someone who doesn't like being gone 60% of the time.
good,"Although the job did show me how to manage a multi-million dollar operation, I did so on my own. No one was there when you needed them and then they blamed you if something went wrong."
good,"CSX is an overall good place to work. The change in leadership has negatively impacted the culture and employee satisfaction. Significant layoffs, do more with less management, no real concern for safety and diversity as there had been in years past. Good old boy politics at an all time high."
good,This company makes high demands on its employees and their families. Time at home is limited. It is a all or nothing job. Pay does not quite cover the hostile treatment of employees and threats of suspensions or terminations for infractions.
good,Fired for using  earned  sicktime. These people have no idea who you are or any concern about you or your family.. stay clear............. ..      ................
good,"24 hrs on call, 22 hrs totally off per week.  Not much of a lifestyle. Good pay and benefits, fun job if you enjoy outside work. Hundreds of rules to follow with management watching every move you make."
good,It trains you well for the position. Gives you hands on training with learning the job. Downside is that you have a high risk of getting laid off from the position. good union benefits though.
good,CSX is not the railroad your father worked for. The culture has taken a turn for the worse.   Its profits over everything as if he company was not making money.  I have been here for 7 years and I'm looking for the exit.  I just can't take the work life balance and the unreal expectations.    I go work for less money and be happy with my life
good,Management is more concerned with short term.  They do not value their people.  Work life balance is not considered for employees and is hard to have both and feel good about either.
good,hard hours and no advancement possible. No work life balance and no personal or sick time. a culture of laziness. work outside in all conditions and work all holidays
good,Not a good life style. You will have a nonexistent social and family life. Management is inexperienced in the field and clueless to daily operations
good,"Responsible for Troubleshooting brakes, brake beams, control rods, brake shoes and making sure piston travels are correct so that the cars on the train carrying supplies can leave out of the terminal 100% inspected and completed by making the proper adjustments to ensure our customer products are being properly cared for."
good,It is possible to make 100k per year. On call 24/7 which makes it difficult to maintain a healthy work life balance. Raises are below inflation. Job is physically easy to do.
good,"From the time you clock in your on CSX time , grab your PPE and your back out the door until lunch time . Thirty minutes to eat and back out the door you go again until it's time to clock out and go home . Intermodal is ruthless dam supervisors or ops managers are constantly flocking and sneaking around , you've got to watch your self like having extra eyes in the back of your head they want to catch you doing something . I don't trust them or the system ."
good,It is ok to work here if you have no family and want to make a lot of money great. But you will be in training for a couple of months and they think you should be able to run and engine and do a conductors job all at the same time.
good,csx is a good place to work the demand for employees to be 100 percent perfect and that the  job and hours 12 + most days is physically demanding  and no set days off can be stressful but if you stay focused on saftey you will balance the weight and appreciate the job and the benefits it offer
good,"The job was good. Benefits were good and most of the people were good. The work was hard and, at times, stressful. Working in the elements was also taxing at times. Especially with very high-heat in the summer months, low temperatures and freezing rain in the winter. Not conducive to family life."
good,"Not recommended at this point in time company in upheaval currently. Management not given a direction to follow, no leadership in present day. Employees are being charged for rule violations for the most minor infractions."
good,"Uses very old technologies, does not welcome for new technologies which makes work easier, rigid structure.                           "
good,CSX is transforming and struggling with a new operational philosophy.  CSX is not currently providing a consistent service product for their customers which makes for a very difficult work environment.
good,"One of the most interesting jobs I have ever worked, The job itself was a lot of fun but the trainmasters seemed like they were out to fire guys and not help educate guys."
good,Very good compensation. Management is literally out to fire you. On-call at least six days a week. Often stay over in hotels.
good,its a good job but be prepared for a lopsided work life balance.  Pay is good but must be able to adapt to the lifestyle. Management really has no clue what is going on.
good,"This particular job take you form your Family, great atmosphere"
good,Management had little to no sympathy and looked for anything they could to write you up because they had to have so many rule failures or fire so many employees each month. I love working there after becoming so acclimated to the life style but with the down turn in the economy it looks as though i may never have a position there in the foreseeable future unless i choose to move my family several hours away from a place i have called home for 35 years.
good,"Corporate culture has been eroded, career paths road blocked blocked, and the corporation stripped down in anticipation of sale for premium. Employees are no longer an assets, but instead though of as liabilities."
good,There are lots of Lay-offs right now and few jobs worth getting because the new CEO wants to cut the work forces by another 1300 people. Management is lacking in every aspect and will fire you for any reason. My advice seek something more stable with better hours.
good,Maybe ok for some but for me it was stressful not knowing when u would be called to go to work.. Denied most of your union agreed upon $$. Can’t plan anything. Work all holidays. RR is 24/7!!
good,"If you value your family life and your time at home, then this is not the job for you. Especially as a Conductor or Engineer. You WILL miss anniversaries, birthdays and holidays. This is the lowest paid class I railroad and it shows. What they pay is not worth what you will sacrifice. You are nothing more than a number and not a person in their eyes. The only thing that makes this job tolerable is knowing that if you make this a life long career that your retirement will be decent."
good,"Top brass only worried about profits not safety. They want more trains, Bigger trains, Under powered trains. They want to push people over the limit to push profit for stock holders."
good,"Typical day is long but interesting , you have to retain a lot of information, managers are all useless, these people could not run a train around a Christmas tree."
good,Work is conducted in all weather conditions. The railroad operates 24 hours a day 365 days a year.  Must be able to report to work within 2 hours of receiving a phone call.
good,Well paying company and when your not furloughed it's a great job. In my 3 years of working for csx I believe it would provide for a good life for your family.
good,"Was a great company to work for, but with the new CEO, it will not be. They offer exelent benefits. It requires long hours, with minimum days off. Not alot of appriecation from managment."
good,Work required to be on call 24 hours a day. Never knew if you would be able to hold a spot on a board long enough to work throughout the week. Management at times can be tough but fair.
good,"Between an insane amount of ""special projects"" in addition to your regular duties and its aggressive office politics, it is a difficult place to work. If you can navigate political landmines and manage to get on the good side of someone important, there is opportunity to be successful. If you like to genuinely work hard and be rewarded for the work you do, this is not the right place for you."
good,the company was all about the numbers .no respect for employees tried to fire people as soon as they were hired.cut most of the weekend jobs so most people were off during the week
good,"Trained for 7 months then laid off.  Good job, just ran poorly.  You have to not care about where you live and be ok with not having a good family life."
good,"Csx is a class 1 railroad.  They have a large network of rail running through out most states east of the Mississippi.  Well paying jobs, but job security is a risk.  The risk of firing due to company culture...a book of rules with more pages than IRS tax codes.  CSX and most railroad preach safety, but only care about moving freight and getting the job done.   They will push you until you get hurt and then blame you for the injury and threaten you with your job.  Unfortunately, with the railroads dumping money in the back pocket of politicians pocket, safety for the railroad employee is the least important, as long as the general public are safe.  Long career of doubt and unsure of job security...terrible amount time away from your family. Better life style in the military.  Back stabbing is heavy and daily!    Your life will be forever changed!  I work for competing railroad and belive me, it's all the same."
good,The best part about the job is your co-workers.  Hardest part about the job you will miss out on about 90 percent of your kids or wife's /Husbands life. Management with CSX will try to fire you as they are pushed to charge employee's. I enjoy my job just looking for a new place to call home with my son.
good,"Always on call you never know when you will be called, for the first several years you will be on an extra board (if your not laid off) with other conductors taking ""turns"" when you clock out you go to the bottom of the list and work your way to the top of the list to get called, sometimes you will be 10 times out and be called just like that and others you can be 1 or first out and wait all day to be called."
good,"You can make good money working here. You will not have time with your family or to enjoy it, you will be treated as if you're not worth it, and you may have to fight to receive it. There is a lot of instability in this company right now and it's obvious the hedge fund is looking to make a profit, gut the company, and leave."
good,"I enjoyed the work, but hated the schedule. Be prepared to not be able to plan anything ahead. Your family and/or significant others will have to have the right personality to live with your schedule."
good,Unreliable. Furloughed after 2 years. Had to move on to provide for my family. Would only suggest to single people who can be away from their family majority of the year and enjoy long shifts.
good,"Great pay and benefits, that's about it. Be prepared to work on call 12 hours a day, 6 days a week with one off day. This is a seniority based job, so the above schedule is common for your first 5 years."
good,"Great pay if you can keep your job. I was furloughed 3 times, once with 5 years of seniority. The rail industry is very volatile, cut-throat, and has a good ol boy system which even if your a part of, in the end seniority is all you have."
good,"On call 24/7. Have 2 to 3 hrs to report when called. Typical day, receive orders snd instructions for the day, perform ssfety checks and brake test on locomotives and train cars. Disassemble snd assemble train according to work orders. Comply with all fra and csx regulations. Receive permissions and signal indicationto proceed with train to destination. Conduct train trip by complying with all speed restrictions, work athorities, and signals. After reaching destination disassembly of train and correct placement of cars sd instructed in train yard or industry then reassemble train for next crew to take to next destination"
good,Intermodal is the fastest growing sector in transportation.  When I was hired it was the majority of the income for this $500Billion company.  Intermodal service work is skilled labor and fast paced.  It's also paid the least in the company and considered clerical work.
good,"CSX is a fast pace working environment that is solely concerned with the railroad. If you are looking for lots of responsibility with little training and a sink or swim environment, this is the place for you"
good,"CSX experienced a period of extreme turmoil as the result of activist shareholders and the subsequent death of a newly installed, disruptive CEO. The environment was challenging."
good,"Company doesn't care about employees. Worked for 18 years. Only got worse. Honest employees,hard working, we're left out in the cold to save money,  company doesn't understand if they do employees right the company will flourish  because the employees will flourish."
good,"Used to be great career but the whole atmosphere has changed since the new management.  Employees are stretched very thin as they have cut many jobs to raise the price of stock, leaving them with lees family time, and having to cut corners, sometimes sacrificing safety, and the proper procedures."
good,The company has restructured which is leaving thousands of employees without jobs.  I enjoyed my employment of 16 years and planned on reaching retirement.  The implementation of automated services and longer trains has left many without a future in the business.
good,I was a manager that worked for CSX for 5 years. My position was a trainmaster. During my time at CSX there was minimal worklife balance and for the time you had to put in the pay was low.
good,until your about 5 years in with the company you will be constantly furloughed which means you woulnt be making any money but you have to go back to work at the drop of a hate. you might be furloughed for a week or you might be for years and you could even be furloughed multiple times.
good,Get bags packed show up at crew room and have job briefing while focusing safety. Transported  to train to start transport of freight safely. Paying close attention to everything.
good,"Most of the time people keep to themselves, you are just there to do your own thing at CSX. If you never wanted to talk to anyone, you wouldn't have to. It's a very relaxed area of workplace."
good,"Stressful i do not recommend this job, you have no home life , but the pay is ok, just alot of red tap and safety rules. Rules seem to be set up to terminate you not make you better or safe."
good,"Unless you have been there for a long time, expect no set schedule or set pay for that matter. It is a union run job. A lot of helpful people to get you trained."
good,decent pay and good benefits. I was literally on call 365 days a year and the phone rang non stop. If you like to live at work then this is not a bad job.
good,"This company use to be a great place to work, but railroading is demanding."
good,"constant harassment from management sent down from higher management. company pits management against employees and the union."
good,Nice Place to work. Clean environment safe place to work. Management was cool. Work schedule was very flexible and conducive to my family lifestyle...
good,"Sub-contractor, Oasis Staffing, I would not work for them again. They payed you for 40 hard hour of work. I felt working for Oasis Staffing was the worst staffing company that you could work for. They paided you."
good,Be prepared to miss children grow up and not have a life really outside of work. You are on call 24 hrs 7 days a week. You don't get paid holidays except if you work certain jobs. Just be prepared to live out of a travel bag.
good,Over all... not a bad place to work. Very overly micro managed. Very safety oriented. Provides somewhat of an opportunity for advancement. Wouldn't necessarily recommend this company for a lifetime career job
good,"Working at CSX can be a very difficult challenge. The management team is constantly trying to justify their job with the upper management, as opposed to trying to be effective managers. The pay is what I would call ""so-so"", in my opinion. They could pay us better for what we do."
good,Not a bad job if you don't mind the layoffs. I worked for CSX for three years and was laid off 90% of the time. Great job if you have the seniority to hold a job. Poorly managed company all the way around. No communication.
good,"Due to the company guidelines, I am no at liberty to say other than you get to play outside in all weather conditions and you get to play with giant matchbox toys"
good,"recent changes in Executive management has led to massive layoffs of the most productive, senior and highest paid employees  Used to be like your family.  Looked forward to going to work every day, and everyone cared about each other.  Sorry to see that profits and shareholders have made caring  a thing of the past.  No longer do they care about hiring Veterans or Disabled or a rail career for managers. We all wish our former teammates well and success."
good,Extremely short staffed was forced to work 16 hour shifts and on average 64 hours a week and would only be notified of being forced within minutes of the next shift starting making it extremely difficult to have a family or to plan anything. We were not allowed to leave the job once the shift started so you would have to plan your meals for 16 hours with minimal sleep in between shifts as if you were on the extraboard  you would be subject to call 2 hours prior to the shift. The upside great benefits and pay. Good job for a young person with no kids or family who only wants to work and make money.
good,Fun job if you don't mind being away from home. Constant lay offs with economy fluctuations. Great pay and benefits with private retirement.
good,"Engaging work, but too many distractions preventing productivity.  ""Good old boy network"".  Great start if you are interested in the transportation industry."
good,"CSX is a decent company, but very political and management at the location I worked at liked to play games."
good,Great company to work for if you're single and want to make some really good money.
good,This is a company for someone who isn't married and doesn't have kids.  Excellent pay and benefits but little to no home life.  Always on call can turn your life upside down.
good,the typical day at work is busy
good,"A typical day on CSX is that you get notified by your cell phone or home phone to report to work in a two hour window. You have to report to work at least five to ten minutes early to get your grip and things in order and your clothing. If your the conductor on the job, you check the computer for government issue paperwork , also paperwork for train instruction, detail in track work, work authorities on the rails, hazard events, and anything that will inhibit you from traveling from point A to point B. You also have a job briefing with engineer of the job in which you discuss the train journey from A to B and all paperwork and the engineer goes to engines to inspect the conditions of the engines. Typical if everything is in order you have a 15 to 20 minute window for both crew members to be on the engines and ready to gather their train together or do any work that have to be done. Once the train is together and the instructions are given to move your train you follow the rules of the rail and the dispatcher instruction. The whole job is very stressful and high energy, you have long hours in which you must stay awake for hours. The environment is very tense and the relief of the getting to your place of destination and not having no problems or killing no one or endangering the public. And the pay is the most rewarding and enjoyable part of the job."
good,"You were expected to be available for support at a moments notice that would sometimes have you up troubleshooting at 2 or 3 am, but still expected to be in the office first thing in the morning regardless of the late night hours put in. Some days you would find yourself running on 3 hours of sleep and this went on for extended periods of time."
good,New leadership pushed out the higher paid more experienced people to save money. They did not care about the customers or what it did to all the employees who put their life into the Company. Save money
good,"The company could be great to work for but like every major corporation the cut corners and disregard the employees. I was hired on as a full time employee, however they took a class of 80 of us and trained us all in atlanta Georgia for 6 weeks and every single person who completed the training they furlough. People just changed their entire career and life style paths to go unemployed within 6 months, luckily I did not have a family at the time but the people who do it devastated them. Becareful working for CSX, save up your money cause you will most likely be laid off."
good,They pay you for inconveniencing your personal life. Went through a stretch where management was out of control. When they made organizational changes in 2017 all management started treating employees worse.
good,"very stressful lots of rules and regulations that you have to be in compliance with Federal, state, and company. good pay and benefits but not as good as it should be because it is a very dangerous and stressful job. good for someone who is not tied down because you may have to relocate sometime in your career and you are on call 24-7."
good,New leadership changed this company but it does provide excellent benefits and rail is a solid industry. There are many new policies and practices that recently took effect.
good,Culture is who you know what you know. Regardless of your experience and background management tends to move their favorite employees up in positions.
good,I wish not wish to make a comment. Although; there are good things about CSX. Overall.. It still needs work. It could be a lot better if people would learn to listen to others carefully and honestly. Instead of just trying to make quota and save money.
good,"CSX was all about making a profit and did not support its employees.  If there was  not a union, then the company would never have enough people who knows what they are doing for anything to get done."
good,Not a good place to work unless you’re a single person.  Not good for a family person.  They do have a good retirement though plus benefits.  CSX is also trying to get rid of business.
good,The most enjoyable part about the job is coming in contact with different people...the Hardest part about the job is getting the proper rest that you need before being called to take another trip...As well as working over 40 hours and not being compensated for it...
good,with the new ceo and his plan for precision railroading has cut a lot of jobs and have layed off/ or furloughed numerous of people. affects a lot of families.
good,"-Can't beat the benefits"
good,it would be a great place to work for if we didnt have a greedy ruthless selfish CEO to work for presently at this time.  Going in and out of furloughs and not working steady is taking a major toll on life events and being able to support myself and family.
good,"Great pay once you top out"
good,The company was a great company to work for. The previous CEO was employee oriented. We had employee activities such as Family Fun Day. The company made good profits before. The new CEO wants more profit at the cost of less employees.
good,Safety is number one....until things need fixed....then all safety goes out the window. Company actively tries to find reasons to fire employees instead of grow them. No room for growth.
good,Management his hired right out of college and does not understand railroad operations. They give you good benefits and good pay so you will put up with all the bullcrap. No career advancement for craft level employees.
good,"Because some of the process and systems are older, opportunities to make improvements are great. It is very satisfying when you are able to improve someone's daily work with a product/process improvement that you provided."
good,"at csx you are required to be on call 27/7, work many different jobs, and dont know if you will be laid off from week to week,but pay is great and they offer the best insurance i have ever had."
good,work on trains moving freight by rail no regular work schedule work days nights weekend and holidays. Always under threat of being fired if a mistake is made or if i take too much time off. Good pay but awful work environment no time at home with family.
good,"Company does not try and work with employees but instead tries to intimidate and bully. Very difficult life style with being on call 24/7/365. No room for error with this company, looks to terminate for any and all mistakes."
good,"Great Job, Great Pay, Just not managed very well from the Corporate level. Learned a variety of skills as far as Railroading. Unfortunately I was never able to apply them due to being laid off as soon as I finished training."
good,"Being on call 24/7 is really challenging when you want to maintain positive relationships with family and friends. When the business for CSXT is strong the pay is great along with the benefits but that in turn means a lot of time away from home and life events can and will occur without you present.  The management within the Transportation Division is very difficult to work with because of lack of communication, poor leadership skills, and wrongful use of authority from those you have it. A typical day at work would be showing up to work, getting the proper paperwork, having a job briefing, getting on your engines, putting the train together and leaving the yard in a timely manner. Most co-workers are willing to form good work related relationships by keeping communication open on the line of road and in the yard. The most enjoyable part of the job is leaving the property for the day."
good,"poor work life balance, great retirement, travel and relocation aid in promotion, industry has stability and career advancement opportunities, sometimes good old boy network can impact work environment, pay is fair for work and hours for most jobs, a lot of time away from home, coworkers can become like family, railroad's transport all goods national and international"
good,start off in the morning at the office with other co-workers sometimes a conference call or job briefing. I learned a lot about signal equipment and how it works .management looked out for people they liked only. Most co-workers were cool some was just suck in their ways. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unfair treatment. The most enjoyable part of the job was that met some great people there and still are friends with them
good,"Too many bureaucracies and politics that goes on that makes it harder to focus on my job.  There's a lot of nepotism and management does not care about you. There's too many silos, union vs. management, and management vs. management.  Employees are harassed for reporting injuries. discrimination does exist. promotions - its about who you know and not about your education/experience. some employees shouldn't be in these senior level positions. company does not stand behind their core values."
good,"good place to work if your single and have no children. Most days are twelve hours on nights. weekends, and holidays. Your coworkers are an enjoyable part of the job."
good,"CSXT provides fantastic pay and benefits and opportunity for advancement.  However, the work to family time ratio is very stressful on the home life.  Safety is an issue with any railroad and must be top priority for the company and employee.  CSX offered a great opportunity to learn a new field of engineering and management, for which I am grateful.  I met a lot of great people and built relationships with clients in management that I still maintain today."
good,Great pay but questionable practices.  Safety important but efficiency overshadows safety.
good,I drove freight trains. switched cars.traveled around regional area
good,24/7 on call job. The Management / employee relationship is horrible. The compensation and the benefits are excellent but require a lot of time away from your family. If you are single this is the job for you but if you have a family this might not be for you. To many nights away from your family.
good,Expect to get furloughed every year for the first few years.
good,"I enjoyed working on the railroad. I learned that safety is a way of life. I was friends with all of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was the most fun part of the job to me. When I would have to go out on the river line, and help out a train that's had some sort of trouble."
good,"Great pay, great benefits is about it.  Being a conductor you are rarely home.  Spent first 6 weeks in Atlanta for training, then remainder 18 weeks was on the job training."
good,"good place to work , time from home not so good. some 12 hour days sometimes felt like I was just a number, once the work was done management forgot who you were,  great money but job changes over the years were not good for the worker."
good,"Compensation and benefits was excellent.I was driving 1 hour and 45 mins. from home. I needed a job closer to home. My wife got really sick they diagnose her with metastasis cancer and it was hard to concentrate"
good,It was a good job just didn’t have enough seniority to hold a job. Also was on call 24/7 so the home life was absent.  It was a great overall experience.
good,Management can be great with the right boss. CSX is a great company but who you work for matters the most. Working in another place besides Baltimore Terminal would have been great.
good,"Used to be a great place to work, but current management and corporate culture are eliminating jobs all around the system. This is not based on economics but by a system created by our last CEO."
good,Csx is a good  place to  work the pay is not bad and the workers isn't bad either. The hardest part of the job is maybe the heat. They talk about safety big.   I have learned it's always easier to use the proper tool for the job.
good,"At the Curtis bay coal pier you will work four 16 hour days then an 8 hour day. Followed by four more 16 hour days with no end in sight. I was a pier tech there and while it is a great place to work, it is literally all you will do. People with more seniority will not help you out and pick up shifts you will be forced to work every day with no end in sight. They will say think of all the money your making but you won't care you'll just want a day off. Then as soon as the coal business slows down you'll get your day off in the form of a pink slip"
good,"not enjoyable, always worried about if you might be layed off. pay is good, benefits good, NO family life. Always on call 24 hours a day 7 days a week"
good,"Good job, but on call for 4 years before you can hold any type of shift work. Work in any weather and conditions. No family life until you get senority. Good pay and Benefits"
good,Work on call only. No schedule and difficult travel schedule. Job is fine but working environment leaves a lot to be desired.  Pay is good if you can take the schedule
good,moral is super low there. managers are trying to find ways to fire employees. great pay but the living is horrible> its hard on  family as well on the workers
good,This is a place that thrives on putting you down no matter how hard you work. It involves too many hours and middle of the week off days. Not a good situation for family time.
good,Was a great place to work and learn for over 20 years.  But when executive team changed and company laid off thousands of employees - culture changed.
good,Hostile work environment from some management . long hours and a lot unknown work hours . lots of hours spent away from home in hotels or waiting on taxi rides to and from locations unknown to find trains or recrew trains . lots of confusion and chaos . getting fired or time off is normal and expected in the railroad environment.
good,"Everyone is looking to get out with Hunter Harrison is in charge, did not think management could get any worse until he showed up. Lack of opportunities still has the old school railroad good ol boy network in effect."
good,I enjoyed the work and freedom of the job. I enjoyed being outside and the people I worked with and around. Relaxed environment and I could be myself around employees
good,"good money, terrible work/life balance. The major take away from working at CSX is that the shop I was at had a lot of very knowledgeable craftspeople that were more than willing to educate you on the working principles of pneumatic, electrical, and mechanical operations of the railroad."
good,It was a good job going down hill now . Always on call have to miss a lot of family time. Pay and benefits are good.you are away from home 36-42 hours.
good,"Demanding job.  extremely challenging.  Was in charge of over 180 employees and over 40 industries.  handles over 800 scheduled cars daily.  had over 120 miles of rail to protect daily.  Made sure that safety, service and cost were my most important aspects of my job."
good,"At one time this was the place to work, after new management has taken over, it's become so stressful and where harassment of employees is their way of managing.."
good,Good compensation and benefits. Management not so swift. Always looking to cover their behinds and get more work with fewer resources. Great retirement benefits (assuming Paul Ryan doesn't get his way). Many young managers that have less railroad knowledge than the rank and file. Can be frustrating to see the same mistakes being made over and over.
good,"CSX offers competitive pay and good health benefits.  There is little flexibility in the working hours, typically 8-5.  Most people are generous and willing to share knowledge and assist new employees."
good,Not an family oriented base company. Requires to be available most weekends and under staff that will allow for reasonable time off to attend family functions without using vacation time for every occurrence.
good,"Good benefits, but if you have family its hard to be there when needed.  On call 24/7, with usually only one day off a week.  Riding on train is nice, not to many people get to see the country like that."
good,CSX is an exciting business that has gone through countless changes and transformations over the years but always remains true to its core - moving freight from one location to another.
good,Safety is the number one goal. To move products across the country take a lot of people that are dedicated to getting a job done in the safest manner.
good,"Quality of life is Questionable. Hire you to fire you. Spend more time in a hotel than at home. Great benefits, though. Labor contracts are not worth the paper they are written on. Pay averages out to about $12 per hour."
good,"I'll admit, I loved the job. Most of the men I worked with were like brothers. That helped a lot since there's not much time for family life. Be prepared to miss a lot of holidays and birthdays while working. There is NO job security. If it gets slow, you get laid off. The union is a joke. It belongs to the company."
good,fun but not good for new family. hard to get paid correctly. layoffs happen often. Work in all types of weather. But training is paid
good,great job if your single and have no family. Your on call 24/7 and you better believe they will always call you. You get 8 hours of rest after getting off work and will be right back at work after that. the money is amazing as so is the benefits.
good,Great paying job with oppurtunity for advancement not a stable industry
good,"Typically your are on call, you must be available 24hrs a day 6days a week. So when you get called which you will never know you will have two hours to show up. You then do your paperwork for your train and jump the train and away you go. You are only allowed to work 12hrs a day but that is desceiving also."
good,"A typical day at work consists of being outdoors in all climates working around live equipment, trains, and digging in ballast and contaminated soil to lay in cable."
good,I have been off for a few months and they are still hiring and training. It seems as they really don't know what to do. Poorly ran company.
good,"i am a union employee, company has an us vs them mentality. Work is enjoyable, but under constant micro-management. Safety is the most important thing."
good,"The company reorganized and let people go. It was a good paying company and benefits, however, the shifts were long and not good chances for job advancement."
good,Without seniority this job is very stressful on you and if you have a family. Always wondering if your current job going to be available the next day. Might have to up and move on very little notice just to hold a job. Going above and beyond does very little for you in this career mainly because its a union job and the guy or girl that does just the bare minimal gets by just fine.
good,you spent hours in a hotel waiting for the phone to ring for a train home. alot of times you would get called for work right before going into your day off
good,Good place to work fast pace dangerous work. Must work in extreme weathers raining heat and cold   Will not have good days off will be working 2nd or third shift. And will he force over to the next shift 2 to 3 days a week.
good,"I worked for CSX after retiring from the Army. I retired because of being away from my family so much, but was away from them just as much, if not more than when I was in the Army. The pay and benefits were great, but it wasn't worth the time away from home."
good,"I safely built and switched Freight trains. Didn't care mush for the management, but it's no a bad job overall. I don't think I would like to go back to CSX: even if I had the opportunity..."
good,good pay but could be better if the negotiators would work a little harder to help others receive compensation. Management is often stressed and struggle to deal with the issue at hand. overall it a good place to work if you have thick skin.
good,Good job but not for family life. Required to spend a lot of time away from home and work holidays.Great pay and benefits. Retirement and 401 k match.
good,"This was a great company to work for up until they changed the management and from there it all went downhill and still is bad. They are more worried about the greed of lining their pockets, than looking after their employees and customers."
good,"The railroad culture in general is by no means for everyone. Pay and benefits are generally pretty good but don't count on having a personal life. Depending on where you work and what seniority you hold chances for advancement can be slim to none.Depending on traffic loads, being furloughed is a real possibility, especially in the first five years or so. That being said if you are comfortable with working any and all hours with no real way to schedule a life outside of the railroad it can certainly be a very rewarding place to work, knowing what you do makes peoples lives possible by transporting the raw materials to make stuff and then transporting the finished products. I was fortunate to work with a great group of guys but it's a roll of the dice who you will be working with on any particular day."
good,"The benefits were great. I thought the job was secure."
good,"I was laid off due to restructuring. I joined csx as a long term commitment. The pay is great, working conditions ok, bu tthere is no job security. Too many layoffs."
good,"Although the work was very rewarding the environment was less than ideal due to significant workforce reductions supporting ""Precision Scheduled Railroading"".   The days were long and the Company direction was uncertain.  The most difficult task was explaining the declining service while ensuring we maintained/cultivated existing business.  Providing best in class service was the driving force behind my desire to succeed."
good,There is little to no family time because you are working 60+ hours a week and staying in hotels while you are away from home resting.  Good trains go to those who know people in the dispatch office.  Will furlough without notice.
good,"Hard to be there with a family. Not having a schedule is hard on family life. New CEO is trying to implement new ideas to a 150 year old industry. Maybe too much, too quick."
good,Wouldn’t mind working there again  great pay had a lot of overtime somethings things could’ve been better but overall it was place that you could build
good,you have to putt up with a lot of changes to your lifestyle such as working shifts and days off otherwise work type and people are normal type butt under stress
good,"I really enjoyed working with CSX but after moving to advance my career and enrolling in every training offered I was still laid off.  I never took a day off and worked almost every weekend for over 4 years but was still laid off.  Also, we tripled the profit margin in the Philadelphia area in under 3 years."
good,Load and Unload Big Containers on the train. Park the containers and chassis in designed parking spots. Inspect the train before being able to leave for its destination.
good,"This place has excellent benefits and and god pay. The work is very steady. Just no free time, or able to have a life. You have to put in a good amount of time before you are able to get off of the 24/6 on call schedule. Even then you can still be bumped off of a steady schedule by seniority."
good,a typical work day included get freight together for outgoing trains and recieving inbound trains worked with each individual industry to ensur frieght was recieved in a timely manner.
good,"I have learn a lot from team and work culture and ethics they follow. "
good,"My employment with CSX has always been an on call basis type of career. I have learned that safety is a way of life and that no job is so important, no task is so urgent , that you can not take the time to perform your job safely."
good,"the railroad is a way of life, if you like working long hours and getting no time off then its the life for you.  i do not recommend this job to someone who is newly married and has little ones at home because you will hardly ever see them.  If you want a 9-5 and weekends off then this job is not for you."
good,Typical day is extremely stressful and busy. I learned that you have to be extremely organized to be productive. Management allows you to work together to solve problems. Workplace culture can be stressful because of the nature of the jobs and type of work performed. The hardest part of the job is the stress associated with downsizing and closing other locations. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people.
good,"Managers young ,don't know what they are doing. They don't listen, have know idea how to plan and schedule work. Order of supplies and labor needs are never done right. I used to own my own small company. If I made the mistakes they did I would have never made money."
good,"Retired from the U.S. Army in 1995 where I ran a service and recovery operation and was in charge of all fab work to include welding, machinist work, glass cutting and replacement, canvas repair. Worked for Csx as a Carman for 13 years in Atlanta Ga. before I became a manager. I was assigned to Birmingham Al. as a general foreman where I worked for 20 months till I was assigned to the Chicago Division in Riveradle Ill. on the Locomotive side June of 2013 to the present. I am in charge of the service center and the locomotive shop plus line of road and the car shop and car department yards. I am responsible for around 30 employee and have no injuries on my watch."
good,"CSX provides excellent company benefits. Though it is a company that does not provide a lot of family time for it's employees. Work hours are non-conventional. And time off is hard to come by for some employees."
good,"job can be over stressful at times. Most people are on edge, everyone is so concerned of being fired all the time. I spend the majority of my day listening to other complain about management and all the contradicting rules. if you are lazy you get away with doing less if you are a good worker, you will often get stuck with work overload."
good,"it is really a unique place to work nothing like I've ever done before"
good,"Work on call, with 10 hour rest. I was almost done with OTJ training when 2 people moved from down state to work the position I was hired for, so I was released!"
good,layed off again not a very good life style for wife and kids. co workers are good people.. management are out to fire you. this is the only job i have had when i get my call to work i ask myself what will i get fired for today. management is told they have to have failures. there is no self satisfaction in the job.
good,"You have no life but the pay is good and so are the benefits. Other employees are nice to work with. The life is too much for a family man or woman, life on the road."
good,Good job & great benefits but very tough when you have children because you will not see them with the hectic schedule you work.
good,"If you are interested in this field, then I'm pretty sure you did your research on what it entails. The railroad is not for everybody. If you love to make money, the railroad is for you with the cost of your time."
good,inspected trains and fixed trains and worked around and with trains. what can be said more about working with trains? you work with trains until they don't need you to work on trains anymore.
good,The company changed over the 8 years i worked there for various reason that I am not privileged to discuss. It is also ridiculous that Ladders attempts to force you to write a review on a former employer.
good,"Went to Atlanta GA. For training. Worked at the Rochester NY territory. Performed my job on Track switches. Learned my territory and associated equipment. Then after 60 days was Released from employment. The reason stated was that my Application was Rejected?? Now I'm trying to get my job back? It's posted now on CSX job site. "
good,Overall good company with great employees.  Work/Life balance challenging at best.  Current environment less stable than years past.    Would not return.
good,"New CSX is young, talented and mission focused.  Very diverse workforce.  A result of dramatic strategy change, the right hand does not always know what the left hand is doing."
good,It is a good job. The money is decent but they lay off a lot. You work alot and are gone from home alot but if you can work around that then it is a good job.
good,"Typical days lasted at the very least 12 hours.  After a 12 hour shift (on certain jobs) you were sent to a hotel for an unknown amount of time, but at the minimum 10 hours."
good,"The pay was exceptional, amazing, stupendous, spectacular, splendiferous, wonderful, great, awesome, and lovely! Everything else... hmmm, not so much."
good,"Typical work day very fast paced.  Learned to do inventory/warehouse duties, payroll.  Management always treated me fairly.  Hardest part of my job was always wondering when the next job cuts were going to happen and to who."
good,There is a great emphasis for being out in the field. Quite a bit of time spent away from home. Pay was incredible. Current leadership has the company heading for the ditch. Look for corporation to be split up and sold off in the future.
good,"csx was very unorganized, a lot of un experienced staff. the job tasks were easy and enjoyable to do. on hand you felt like an inmate in a prison because the bosses were always watching you and for no reason. they liked to impiment  scare tatics"
good,The Railroad was a hard physical job but there was a brotherhood between the guys. This was a job that would make you grow up fast and see what hard work really is.
good,"CSX used to be a good place to work. After the recent corporate takeover, morale plummeted. People were downsized willy-nilly, the organizational chart was shuffled in a seemingly random fashion, and signals were sent that employees need to work harder for lower compensation. "
good,Drastic operational overhaul making life unsteady for all parties involved. Changing corporate culture making future less stable than before at all levels of the company.
good,"It's a nice company with a lot a commitments to customers.  The good thing about them, is that they make good on their word to customers.  The people performing their duties are dedicated to their work.  It was a great experience for me.  Very educational.  I've learned a great deal from working for that company. Thanks."
good,"on call 24/7 holidays, weekends, and roster calls will keep you dazed and confused on the weekends when they are out of people. You can function along time without rest. The guys you work with are usually great guys/gals but the recruitment of managers outside of the company has brought the moral down to a point we have never seen before."
good,There has been a lot of corporate changes and downsizing. Job security is not confirmed at this time. The employees are very unsure about the future at CSX and are very concerned. Nobody is given any information regarding their position until they receive a lay off.
good,J'adore travailler dans cette entreprise. Mais les horaire ne sont pas convenable pour moi malheureusement
good,"In a very short time, CSX went from a great place to work with open lines of communication to  a place where you are worried if you will still have a job when you show up in the morning. This is no longer a company that I recommend to people."
good,Zero job security with CSX. There are too many changes and restructuring at this time. I would not look to leave a current job to go to this location.
good,"good pay,ceo is horrible put a lot of men on the street, other thab that it is a good place to work................................................!!!"
good,Work all the time and never know when that will be.  Management does not care about their employees.  It takes almost 10 years to hold a third shift job.
good,"Don't know if your going to have a job because the company keeps changing job pools from one terminal to the next. Never know when you are going to go to work unless you watch the board non stop. Company cut guaranteed earning by $1500.00 a month this spring. Been working with out a contract as a conductor for the past 2 years hence the pay cut, because the company and union can't sort this out."
good,"My position is a fast paced high pressure one that can lead to many stressful days or working on your off days. However, we are compensated well for it"
good,"It is your typical railroad.  Many antiquated thoughts about operations do not the meet the more modern standards of today.  In many cases, it is not what you know but who you know, which is what will get you a job."
good,"Good place to work, management not the easiest to understand, hours could be extremely long as in a 16 hour day followed by more 16 hour days and they don't understand when you say you have to get some rest."
good,"CSX offers outstanding benefits, however; pay is not very competitive and due to recent cuts and changes everyone has taken on more work, without more pay."
good,"I learned the importance of being fact-based to have the right results, the right way.  Being an example to my employees builds trust within the group. Set a standard for your team to follow by and the results will surprise.  Don't just tell them to do something, tell them why they are doing it."
good,"Great job with great pay, but absolutely no security. Management could not care less about our job and the company constantly cut or relocated jobs for no reason. The company always preached safety but would expect you to break rules in order to get the job done faster."
good,"Fiscally speaking CSX was a great company to work for, but it had a lot of drawbacks. When on call, which was six days a week, your life functioned around the railroad. There is no set schedule, you could work everyday or twice a week, it just depended on traffic flow. My coworkers were some of the best people I've ever had the pleasure of working with. Its definitely a job for someone without a family or a personal life."
good,Company needed to have strong leaders in the upper management level.  Provided no guidance or mentorship to middle management.  Cores values are solid.
good,"Great experience!!! Job requires total dedication to task at hand to ensure safe operations.... The most rough cut, detail oriented, innovative group of individuals you'd ever meet."
good,"CSX is a good company.  Great compensation and benefits but the environment is very challenging and demanding.  It is a 24/7 environment even in HR so you can expect to work  over 50 hours a week including  weekends, nights, and during vacation.  Checking email on your phone is a constant to keep up.  You must have flexibility and plenty of  free time.  Also the majority of the employees are unionized.  Senior leadership have good intentions but can be one sided often. As a result, its hard to reinforce policies consistently across all business units and employees know it.  Its slow to progess upward unless you impress the right people early in your career.   Otherwise you will find yourself trying to reinvent yourself to stay challenged."
good,The company is large and very corporate. The executives and senior management can be disconnected from their staff at times but it's because it's a very large company with thousands of employees. The Headquarters building downtown Jacksonville has their own cafeteria with good food so you don't have to walk several blocks for lunch. The company pushes for donations for United Way and cares about charity. You are expected to work 40+ hours per week or whatever it takes to get the job done. The company is already well established in their growth so it may take a while for advancement because someone has to retire or quit for a position to open up (depending on what department you work in or if you are willing to relocate). The company has a good pension.
good,"A typical day for me is taking a train from Louisville to Cincinnati, resting at a hotel, then bringing a train back. I learned that enjoy being a locomotive engineer. Local management seems to be fair and typically care about their employees, upper management not so much. My co-workers are a great bunch that I enjoy to be around. The hardest part of the and really the only thing I don't like about it is the lack of schedule and lack of sleep. Always being on call and never knowing when you're going to work, day or night, any hour. The most enjoyable part of the job is the travel, operating locomotives, and the comeradere you develop with co workers."
good,"Poor work schedule would only get a two hour phone call to report to work 24 hrs a day 7 days a week"
good,"co workers fun, all expierence learned, hardest part of job was very long hour's sometimes. typical day at work was challenges."
good,6 days on and 1 day off. Constantly on your toes waiting to be called to go into work. Sometimes if you have to you have to drive two hours to a terminal to work all night and stay overnight
good,Good work with great benefits. Having to be away from home a lot is difficult. Not having a boss constantly over your shoulder is nice though. There is room for advancement but relocation is necessary.
good,"Leader in the transportation industry. 200 year old industry with some cultural, ambiguity and political challenges.  Decent amount of diversity in some areas but opportunities to do more.  Company leadership driven to be productive."
good,I learn alot with company an got lot of great experince love to load car from train very fun an scary but it a great envierment.
good,"The people were great, but I got laid off after 9 months on the job. The Management could have been a lot better. Good money for the work."
good,"Everyone's experience with a class 1 is different. Mine was positive. Great benefits and my management was very easy to work for. The drawback was never knowing what to plan for as you are on call as a conductor 24/7. However, Trainmaster's make or break the job. I was fortunate enough to have fair and professional trainmasters. Not everyone is so lucky."
good,"Managed day to day railroad operations at rail yard."
good,"CSX is not a family oriented place to work. I have been there 15 years and alot has changed.  You work everyday, even when you are sick as a dog. The only thing that keeps a person going is the great people we work with. The work we do takes a toll on our health daily.  Our jobs aren't the hardest, but we have very stressful jobs and are not treated very well by our managers."
good,Crazy hours and poor management. They preach safety only when it benefits them
good,I was initially excited about starting a career with CSX. Their trainee program was excellent as well as the pay and benefits. Unfortunately there are supervisors that need to learn what leadership is and that threatening employees with their bonus is not an effective management technique. Due to the hostile work environment in the field I decided to part ways with CSX and seek other opportunities.
good,"Good company overall.  There are a few people in the company that can make it a bad work experience, but overall the structure of the company is solid and a good place to work."
good,Good pay but always on call and not much management support.
good,"Although I appreciate and take pride in my railroad career and enjoy working outdoors while knowing that my efforts keep our economy moving, I also have to consider the work environment provided by local and regional management is deemed hostile.  Ask any employee of this railroad and they will tell you, CSX ""hires to fire"".  From local management hiding in the bushes (literally) watching you as you work with sole intentions of trying to catch you making a safety infraction, to the Company's blatant disregard to honoring contracted union agreements, there's no wonder why many of its employees are literally there for the money, not the quality of life."
good,"Work all hours of the day and night.They are tough.I learned patience,wisdom and people are not always what they seem.Management is hardcore.Some co-workers are great but most are terrible human beings.Hard to get use to no schedule is the hardest part of the job.Most enjoyable part was quitting  time."
good,Loading and unloading containers and moving the to the east coast.
good,"Management's job is never ending and you wear many hats, but it can be rewarding when you have the resources you need to be successful."
good,"very demanding"
good,In the transportation department it is a 24/7 365 job. Trains never stop running. In management you phone never stops ringing which makes it very difficult for the home life.
good,you are on call 24/7 can work a lot or not much at all the work is tough lots of walking and lots of rules to know and follow it is all for your safety of course management makes sure you follow the rules or you get fired co worker are fun guys the hardest part is the hours you are up all night only get 10 hours of rest before you go back to work sometimes i would say what i enjoyed the most was the money and benefits won't find nothing better
good,Only bad thing about CSX is the furlough right after you mark up. Everything else there is just like any other typical job. Pay and benefits are great!!!
good,"Duties include loco. Inspections, wheel gage, air brakes, brake shoes, routine service, and"
good,Management is terrible... maturity is extremely low .. favoritism is extrem ... if your not interested in work 80 hours a week then your not on their good side ... Management over looks accident s if your liked or dating management.. or they know of a situation  ahead of time and Don t say anything then wait for the problem to accure ... I don't call that management.. I call that immaturity
good,"Their discipline is severe, especially absenteeism. Their absenteeism policy is ridiculous. Make sure you have documentation for all days off.  Keep records of all medical issues or problems.  If you are a hard worker you will do well.  There problems with management..very very stressful environment.  Not a job for someone who doesn't handle high stress and pressure well.  Way too much work gets added to someone elses job because of cut backs.  The union isn't as strong as it use to be and they are always giving up more benefits on negotiations for new contracts.  Eventually there won't be a union anymore, but the one thing they always do is get us pay raises.  Great paying job, but the stress and demands of the job will cause issues with health over time."
good,"You will not find a better place to work if you need insurance, retirement for yourself and your family.  That being said, you will not have a life to spend with your family, loved ones while working for the railroad.  IF you are in the transportation dept., your life at home will be limited to rest hours.  Unless you are very lucky, with a lot of seniority, you may be qualified for a weekend off day... one a month."
good,Great benefits but you are gone from home all the time not good for family life ...there work schedule is honorable nine days in and five off and u usually lose a day in travel alone
good,Limited security in employment. Travel from Syracuse New York to Montreal Canada. Moving all types of rail cars in accordance with FRA and Transport Canada rules and regulations.
good,Great group of guys that work alongside each other. managers some good some bad. Those that worked the job before they were managers for the most part knew how things worked. But managers with no experience were very hard to deal with.
good,"CSX taught me a lot and is not a bad place to work. If you are a person who likes to tear apart motors and rebuild/repair them, this is your job. Enjoyed mt time there."
good,The management really didn't crare about your well being like they say they do because at this job you will come in many life and death situations. I do believe the pay could have been better for the work you do as a ISW .
good,"Got the job after going through 6 weeks of school in Atlanta. Worked for 8 months and got laid off. Called me back 1.5 years later. Didn't have a warm and fuzzy about getting laid off again. They said come back or resign. Reluctantly, I resigned. Good thing, 2 of my coworkers were furloughed right when they returned(same seniority)."
good,"Going through rough times with new CEO and bad infrastructure. Management is treated poorly by upper management, plan to work a lot and plan to travel. Missed family times due to working nights and weekends."
good,I may have had my position dissolved due to management restructuring but I have nothing bad to say... CSX provide a very good life style while I was employed just wish it would have lasted until I retired. Railroad is hard work no doubt...but hard work builds character.
good,"Extremely demanding hours, but the company will give you a chance to make money from day one.  There are lots of managers employed which makes doing your job difficult at times."
good,The work is quite easy. The overall compensation and benefits are great. There is a lot of travel involved. Furloughs are inevitable. Great job when your not furloughed
good,"Good company, awesome benefits, hard to lead a family life.  Many changes occurring system wide due to technology forcing a loss of jobs."
good,"Outstanding compensation package that is hard to find elsewhere. However, there is very little quality of life outside of work."
good,"A lot of rules and responsibility. Safety is the most important thing. Management always puts pressure on when things aren't going as planned but otherwise helpful. Most co-workers are great to work with.Hardest part is being on call working alot of different jobs until you have been there a few years until you can hold a regular position, being on call 24/7/365. Pay and benefits."
good,wonderful people. cut throat industry. great pay and benefits. don't buy anything new for 3-4 yrs if you get on there. you'll get laid off.
good,A typical work day with this company consist of numerous job briefing to insure company and federal rule compliance. A work day has no regular work hours due to nature of the business of moving consumer good and natural resources. Safety is number one in all cases.
good,"Really good company to work for. As a freight conductor you don't have much of a personal life. People say that with a lot of jobs that it is job first than personal life. Well with CSX it is the most honest words I have ever heard spoken. It really is CSX first and your personal life late late late! second. If you can't abide by that or you don't agree with it you will not last. If you hire on at 18yrs of age and put enough time in to retire (as of today that would be 42yrs) you will have spent 75% of your life in a hotel room in another city / state. Amazing pay, amazing benefits. After 5 years easily $100k+ a year if you work."
good,"the culture is typical union. the old timers don't have any respect for the new comers cause they think it will take money out of their pockets.....oh..wait...it does.   Then..just like a union..when they lay off 600 people its the guys with the least seniority not necessarily the slackers that have sat in the pool and drawn a check for nothing for the last 10 years.  but if your in the pool then MAN,,, this is a GREAT job."
good,freight conductor can be an enjoyable job. hardest parts of the day may include working outside and high stress situations. I have gained a vast knowledge of mechanical experience I did not have.
good,"Not where you want to work if you have a family. Long hours away from home, on call, and no consideration for things that come up out of the blue"
good,U never know where you will be. You might not have a job or you could be making well over six figures.  Crew was awesome but management sucked!  A good amount of stress but you are well compensated.
good,Not a Bad job if you're not family oriented. It can take up a bit of your time constantly being on the go and on call for work. But it does pay well and has great benefits...
good,"I really never know what time I'm going to be called into work, but I don't mind.  I enjoy the work I do, and the people I work with are very helpful if I have questions or don't understand what we are going to be doing. We always do a job brief before we start our job and a couple more during the course of the job to make sure all involved in the job understands what we are doing."
good,"Enjoy being a supervisor as I have a lot of interaction with conductors. Also in my job I get to be involved with the customer relationships and delivery of products through rail transportation across the country."
good,It’s an okay place to work. Company isn’t as innovative as it could be. Culture still not too keen on remote. Parking isn’t great. Could be greater than what it currently is.
good,The pay is great but it comes with catch. If you have family expect to be away from them majority of the year and the job security is really based on your seniority meaning you can get hired and still have no job.
good,Overall good company but will hire alot then will layoff. Not sure if this still exists now. Each department is different. Will get the chance to travel unless you're at the headquarters in Jacksonville.
good,"It's the railroad. Don't even think about a career here if you're not extremely physically fit, alert, FOCUSED, and willing to work long hours (up to 12 per day) doing very physical work. The pay and benefits are excellent, as is the possibility for advancement IF you are willing to work hard and start at the bottom of a Union Shop environment. Definitely NOT for Snowflakes. No one will care about your feelings, just your performance, ability to follow the MANY rules and Federal Regulations, and your ability to WORK SAFELY!"
good,There are a lot of good people working at this company. Really enjoyed most of the people that I had the opportunity to work with. Management is very fair.
good,All they want to do is cut workers so they can make their bonuses. Great Benefits and retirement if you don't get furloughed. There is never a plan. Just show up and go with it.
good,"Organization is extremely flat now which limits career progression. Hedge fund takeover has made the company do things for short gains. Employees have to accept more responsibilities as we lose some through attrition and they do not re-fill their positions. Company still figuring itself out, but has done its best ever in the past year. Something is working, but can be tough to survive through it."
good,it was a good job just always cutting jobs and then calling back. tired of not knowing if i had a job week by week. it was great money but your always on call and never know when youll work or if they are going to lay off again.
good,This job is good career if you have the patience to be laid off throughout your career. Employees are micro managed and are constantly looking for a reason to fire crew.
good,Csx has the best pay and benefits  but most jobs there include working odd hours and weekends.   Jobs are unsecure due to decline of coal and new management. They will keep u in a job but most times involve relocation or travel.
good,"I love the job . "
good,Transported engineers from one working location and delivered them back to other work locations as needed. Followed federal motor vehicle regulations and operated vehicles safely.
good,CSX has it challenges and will depend on who are directly connected with will determine your success. Having a mentor is a big plus. You tend to wear many hats at one time and will be expected to learn on your own in some cases. Fast paced with a lot of detail special tooth's industry.
good,great benefits and really good pay. Hours can be a lil crazy but ok.the management is always looking to write you up and fire you.you are constantly looking over your shoulder because you are being watched.
good,CSX has good pay and benefits.  The job security at this time is very poor.  The hours and schedule make for a lot of time away from family. A lot of the jobs are on call type and you have to report within 2 hrs.
good,This job is great when I am actually working. I have been laid off for the past year and a half and only worked for a week when I was called back. I liked traveling and there were a variety of jobs to work.
good,"Working for the railroad is the best job I've ever had and hope it will be my lifelong career.  However, it is very hard to work for some of the railroads as they are very money-driven and do not seem to care about the workers that they may hurt in the process of chasing the dollar bill.  The railroads are constantly trying to trim as much cost as possible to increase profits.  This often means people lose their jobs.  Currently, CSX has hired a new CEO and he is making rapid changes to the current operating practices.  He is also consolidating and closing resources, which means people either have to move or are released from their jobs.  Meanwhile, the employees that are left are required to do more work without any more training or guidance.  It's a good paying job with excellent benefits, thanks mostly to the unions, but I'm not sure how long the constriction of manpower, equipment and locations can continue."
good,"Work day you go through some safety issue of the day do some stretching to get muscle going and then get on the days work maybe changing a part, or  moving a locomotive to another spot and or diagnosing a locomotive. "
good,CSX was a great place to work prior to the change in leadership and simultaneous organizational restructuring that led to mass layoffs in March of 2017.
good,"This job will take everything you have, plus a lot more.  The work/life balance is non-existent.  You are on call at all times."
good,"CSX treats their employees well, pays well and spends a lot of time on development.  "
good,Oversee and strategically place approximately 7 billion dollars of locomotive assets throughout the CSX network. Report to VP and AVP's in daily meetings on the state of the railroad. Develop and follow through with action plans to resolve issues that arise on the network. Utilizing and working closely with the correct teams in CSX to accomplish these goals is one of the most enjoyable aspects to this job.
good,"Railroad, on call 24-7, great benefits, hard labor work, retirement, weather conditions and heavy lifting"
good,Going in finding out who your engineer is for the day. Getting all of your paperwork about train your taking and going over it with engineer. Once done with that get all your safety gear and belongings and getting on train. Then as a conductor you get off check train out to make sure all train cars are there that is supposed to be. Releasing all hand brakes after talking on radio to engineer and yard . Once that is done ask for permission to leave yard to start your destination.master
good,"This work consists of long early days, great pay and great environment. Everyone is not made for this job you need to be in shape and ready to go everyday there's no time for mistakes or adjusts."
good,"I learned a lot, trained hard, experienced a new culture had great benefits and pay but it takes 10 years to not have to worry about being furloughed or laid off."
good,It was a good company to work for. Hours were long but pay was good. Benefits were unmatchable. Learned really good skills and would highly recommend the company.
good,"Laid off as a result of restructuring procedures."
good,"Great job, great co-workers but a big turn around in management. Hard to get used to a good boss before they transfer or leave the company."
good,"A fulfilling job with good training, good pay, good benefits and great retirement.  Job security is an issue even being a union employee."
good,"great place to work"
good,At times could be too much work put on one person.But overall a good place to work with good benefits.
good,Good pay and benefits but with very little time at home. Management system was very hard to work for.
good,"Great company to work for...but very long hours with no weeknights, weekends, or holidays off."
good,"This is an excellent place to work if you crave working with little to know supervision and enjoy working in the elements. The pay and benefits are well worth the time and dedication needed to work in the railroad industry. However, it does consume a great deal of time and demands strict attention to rules and regulations. This in not just for the safety of yourself, but for the safety of other's that work around you. The railroad is an unforgiving job."
good,"Was a fairly easy job,some heavy lifting required .management always trying to fire you over childish stuff other than that a great way to make money if ya dont mind being away from home alot"
good,"THE crews worked as a team to complete the task at hand. Work was fast paced but fun. Management was always helpful in  finishing task. Didn't enjoy having to work every weekend, away from family. Really enjoy working with the people i work with. The company as a whole is a great company, I would recommend this job for a younger person,"
good,One of the most unique jobs I have ever held. If it was a more stable work schedule I would still be employed. Pay was great and comparable to the amount of work associated with the position. Really great to get to see parts of the food industry that most will never get to see. Management was in the midst of change when I left this position.
good,i was a nice place to work i wish i was still there. the management was ok and under standing mc co workers was eazy to get alone with.
good,Fasted paced very busy loud place towork however the bosses were friendly and understandable. I've learned how to work on assembly line and how to operate different machines.The hardest part is proven i could be just as good as the men. The thing i liked the most is working with nice people.
good,Weeks working for CSX started on Sunday night catching a flight to a team location and starting early and working late in the day then fly home again on Friday night. I learned how to live out of a suitcase and How to get along with all types of people and how to build a great team. the hardest part of the job was the traveling and separation of teams and working outdoors in the weather. The most enjoyable was dealing with team members and making things better for the people and the company.
good,or go thru Randstad staffing services to get a job
good,For the most I enjoy working at csx I learned a lot the management team was usually helpful job security was always there .they definitely went out of their way to help me when my wife was diagnosed with cancer .i would say that I would definitely recommend csx for a career.
good,This is a great place to work to gain knowledge and skills in decision making for a person that does has family support. The travel and money is great as well as making lifelong friends.
good,"Collecting payroll sheets and inputting them in the system. Responding to emails, filing, paying bills, filing printers with paper and ink, distribution of mail and UPS and FEDEX, Taking inventory, ordering office supplies and PPE, stocking supplies for the T&E employees. Janitor duties. Driving Crews to their destination and back in a safe and timely manner. Worked with Management on a day to day basis."
good,"Learning experience. Operating rules, signals, physical aspects of the railroad. Made some great friends while training. The hardest part of the job was actually memorizing the definitions of the signals. What I enjoyed the most was the hands on/ field work."
good,"on call, never home, don't care about the employees. its a good paying job but you never have job security. the management tries to fire you daily after years of service. the only thing they care about is the stock prices"
good,the railroad is a hard job for a person who has a social life. hours are erratic and the job is dangerous. well payed but this is a job tat will take over your life.
good,A lack of trust between management and crew by CSX SENIOR MANAGEMENT having quatos to fail crews just doing their job. 31 years as Conductor working at various terminals I deal with many officers. Some good some bad. Their mentality is (US AGAINST THEM).
good,Terrible work life balance and management was not good to work for. I was not impressed with the direction of the company when i was there. I am not sure how they are doing now.
good,"Great pay, and benefits. Work conditions are horrible as well as the management. Its a great place to get fired from. i would not recommend this job to anyone that I like."
good,Csx has given me 17 yrs of employment and through those years I have seen lots of changes several furloughs and many hardships! I do not recommend this job for close family people because of the long houirs it calls for you to be away
good,"The main complaint is everyday I go home, I never know if I'll have a job the next day with all the layoffs. Beyond that I have nothing to complain about."
good,Provides good benefits and a great career if you survive. New employees expect to get furloughed / laid off. New CEO will shut down entire terminals and cut off 200 jobs if that is what it takes to make money.
good,The hardest part of this job was the time spent on the road trying to build seniority
good,Great place regarding compensation & benefits however senior management dept has become cut throat post departure of former CEO Mr Harrison. Harrison promoted those who earned as such while new Executive Team does so for political gain.
good,"Money only generates a life style, I only need enough to support my family at the same time love being with them. A very secure job only if you are willing to accept jobs meaning moving from one to another."
good,"while the money and benefits are decent, the work home life is completely non existent. on call 6 days a week. Even when you are home you have to be prepared to leave for work when they cal."
good,There is continued change. Seniority fluctuates. Very difficult to have a structured family life. Great pay and benefits. A typical yard day is from 8 to 12 hrs long. Switching cars and building outbound trains.
good,"CSX is a wonderful company to work for and the pay and benefits are hard to match anywhere else.  The only downside to working for CSX is that if you don't have any seniority, it is likely that you will not be working long before you are furloughed."
good,you can enjoy the job but upper management causes the job to be a job instead of a career. Great money but it comes with a price you lose quality of life.
good,"I loved the actual work, but the company/management made other aspects of the job, and your family life difficult. There is no employee moral, you are just a number to CSX"
good,"management was inexperienced, they hire people with a degree but have absolutely no experience with what they are hired to do. they need to promote people with experience. and put the people with a college degree in the field for a couple years before they start managing"
good,"Long house long days work most holidays "
good,Crew member on a mainline road train. The train crew would complete round trip over the road transfer of material and cargo.  Long hours away from home.
good,If you plan on seeing your family or having any kind of social life at all this is not a job for you. The pay and benefits are unmatched anywhere else in the blue collar world but you pay a STEEP price for them.
good,"Management is terrible, company is inefficient, job security is minimal."
good,"The pay and benefits are good, but otherwise it's not a great job.Lot's of long days and time in hotels. Discipline is extremely hard. You can get dismissed for the smallest infraction."
good,"opinion , work day stats when your called, learned to work safely at all times, management enforces safety from their perspective, culture is being away from home 12 + hours,"
good,"Position is / was excellent."
good,classification of train cars so the train is correctly built to deliver to other train yards  travel on trains from train yards to train yards in different cities
good,"Its the railroad so change is constant and the work vs family life is a struggle.  Pay is decent but for the hours you put in, could be better"
good,"Responsibilities:"
good,I enjoyed the challenge and the professionalism of my coworkers.  They did go through alot of changes once the President left the organization back in 2017 so it's not the CSX that it once was when I worked there.
good,"CSX is a fine company, but is experiencing many cutbacks, not all positions are able to be protected by the union(s). As a union employee having recently moved in to the region, I have no seniority; therefore, I am subject to being ""bumped""."
good,Great money but there's a lot of training that must be completed and pasted before you can even start making great money. Also this is a union job which mean if you're the last man hired you usually get the bids on jobs no one wants.
good,Always had to worry about layoff then shop was closed permantly. Was offered relocation but was in a very bad location for myself and family. But loved the work there.
good,"In the transportation field, there are many rules to know and follow. This is the type of career where there is no room for mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes, so if you do, you must learn from it and reframe from making that mistake twice. Getting the chance to go up and down the rails to see different towns and cities can be nice."
good,Job didn't ever make me feel secure. I felt I was always going to get laid-off. And everything I believed happened and now I'm at home.
good,"Great pay and benefits. Unions need to be stronger. Management is always on the prowl(literally hiding in bushes) to pull you out of service. Could be furloughed at anytime because it's a constant feast or famine struggle in transportation. Anyone that does work here, I would not recommend making any major purchases within the first 10 years of employment because RR unemployment does not pay well."
good,A typical work day started with working with a computer and retrieving work orders for myself and crew.
good,Come in at 5:30am check license servers. Take care of any existing issuse. Later in the day work with clients on resolving new issues and consulting on new projects .
good,"I loved my job.  I got along well with my coworkers and management.  The hardest part of the job being gone long periods of time.  A typical day consisted of operating the train, maintaining safety, looking out for pedestrians."
good,I learned a great deal while with CSX!  Management was decent and the opportunity for growth with the company was there at day one.  A year after I started a new CEO came on board and things changed pretty severely from there.
good,"Not a bad gig for someone that wants to make a living. It’s tough being away from your family at times. It’s also tough learning the job itself, but worth it in the end."
good,On call for all shifts.   Was a very Demanding job.  Did not have any time at home ever. Worked in all types of weather conditions. Payed alot of fees to be part of union.
good,No real issues. Looking to better myself. Enjoy the team and work but that is the extent of it. Not really anything negative to report. Its a good company.
good,I am very happy I had to the chance to work here. I was a lot of busy work but the pay was great and the people were extremely friendly. ..............
good,Tough to hold a job.  Constant talk of place being bought out so constantly worrying if job will be there tomorrow. People are ok to work with. Management unstable
good,Good company to work for with growth potential if you are willing to move and work non-traditional hours. The benefits are good and the work environment is never a dull moment.
good,"Typical day at work includes journal entries, account reconciliations and reviews. Monthly close process. The company uses great technology systems. Not a bad place to start in the company"
good,My typical day was very manageable. I was able to prioritize my workload and help my team daily. Management was very supportive and led the way for advancement.
good,"They have recently downsized their workforce and currently does not have a good reputation with its customers. Unless you work the trains, rail, signals or bridges it's safe to say they're not hiring."
good,"Great co-workers, benefits and pay. No work life balance. working outdoors in all weather conditions. Dangerous at times if not paying attention to surroundings."
good,"A typical day at work was demanding concerning emergency calls. I learned to calm, professional and communicate solutions to the problems addressed during the calls. The management was amazing. The most enjoyable part of my job was saving lives and assisting people in crisis situations."
good,CSX is an old fashioned railroad company with less focus on technology advancement and innovation. however the company has a good culture and encourages values. it is very to easy to reach out to cross teams and getting work done. everyone around here work towards a single goal which is delivering the product to the business partners on time. we are also following agile methodology as a company and making good progress.
good,Csx is a fast paced work environment.  Very very hard to balance work life and family life.  The pay is good and the benefits are ok.  Work is fairly easy
good,"Great experience Hard work is rewarded with great pay and benefit, Safety is always paramount, Various work shifts, Challenging, and exciting career with the ability to advance"
good,"Good place to work, Based all on seniority with jobs, days off, location, and so on. I really enjoyed working for them. Relocation was not for me. Good money."
good,excellent benefits. family oriented. great opportunities to gain experience and build a solid financial future. A great environment with safety being top priority..
good,Great company to work with awesome people around. Learned lot many new things. It used to be a very stable company but unfortunately with new CEO this year 80% employees lost their jobs.
good,"Csx is a pretty good company to work for. But the railroad is not a career or job, its a lifestyle. The pay is great and the hours suck. depending on the job your either walking a lot or just sitting on your butt for 12 hours"
good,The company is under new management and just let 800 of their most experienced manager go. The shareholders will decide if the new management stays. It's hard to believe the company will get better to work for with the leadership that is in place.
good,"Pay was outstanding. I really enjoyed working with a lot of the old guys, they really taught me a lot and they really wanted you to ask question so you would not get hurt or killed. After 6 months, right after the new year February 2009 they furloughed a lot of employees."
good,"Tough place to work. Great pay, but no life balance. Away from home often. Unsteady work hours, no quality of life. You work your way from conductor level to possible engineer through school."
good,I enjoyed my time with the company. Most of my time was spent riding a locomotive talking on the radio with a dispatcher in Jacksonville.
good,I always enjoyed working with the people at CSX. They made working for them very easy. I always got my assignments done and complete in a timely manner. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with all of the other drivers. I could not drive until I heard from the other drivers. This made my Job a little complicated but for the most part the job itself was very rewarding and I dealt with very good and motivated people.
good,"Working for CSX allowed me to learn all aspects of the Sales and Transportation business.  Allotted many opportunities to expand my career from Intermodal, Auto Operations to Sales in the  commodity of Metal.  The company is competitive and open to building employees up to their fullest capabilities."
good,"The hardest part about the job is being on call 24 hrs a day, 7 days a week. The co-workers are always willing to help. The management is always there to listen to any issues. The job can be mentally and physically demanding. A shift can be anywhere from 6 hrs to 16 hrs long depending on the job."
good,on call 24/7. work was easy. who wouldn't love riding in the cab of a locomotive? I did.  very good potential for great money but required overnight stays away from home.
good,great co and money. hard work but worth the effort. Lots of off hours. on call 24/7. great health benefits and ways to advance your career.
good,"I have learnt Oracle after coming to CSX only. My employer is NTTData Inc. I work for CSX as a contractor. "
good,On any given day there are new challenges from working long hours to dealing with the elements.  There are not many jobs that allow you to make a good leaving and be with good friends. We are more like family than coworkers.  The work is hard but the team work makes it rewarding.
good,"Great pay and benefits. The training was intense but very helpful. Great instructors they help you every step of the way. They did not want any one to fail. Some of the people outside of the training were rude, We were always told by the older guys we were not going to take their jobs. I really never payed no mind I was there to lean and become a railroad man. 2009 I was furloughed and went to work over seas. I was contacted to return back to work but was already committed to my over seas job."
good,I traveled quite often and learned a lot about industry and transportation environmental concerns. The hardest part of the job was when derailments or other concerns involving response during non working hours. I enjoyed the freedom of being self motivated and seeing the different cities I traveled.
good,"You will have to live on a train to make any money, and this job in very rule oriented.  If you make one mistake you will be fired on the spot for 30, 60, or 90 days.  I would not recommend this job to a family man but a single man."
good,"My work day starts with a phone call from crew management between 8pm and 4am notifying me that I'm being called to work.  Once I arrive at work, I log onto the computer and retrieve the necessary paper work for my train and review it with the engineer.  Next, I call the yardmaster to find out where the crew change out will be and the engineer and I head out to relive the inbound crew.  Once on the train we do another quick review of the paper work and call the dispatcher, who releases the train for movement.  Over the next 5-12 hours, the engineer and I coordinate the movement of the train with the dispatcher to its destination.  Once at the destination, the train will be moved into a yard or another crew will take over and take the train to the next destination."
good,working for CSX  has helped me to understand the different aspects of teamwork in Transportation. I have learned that it takes a team effort to accomplish the goal of customer satisfaction. This has to come from everyone working together. My co workers are the best part of this job. The diversity of working with so many different people brings a lot of fun to the job.
good,pays well lots of travel. long days long weeks . good benefits
good,"This was a good job and  it was often enjoyable. I could be called to work at anytime in addition to my regular work hours,  but I had wonderful co-workers who made the day easy. There were many rules and regulations I had to learn in order to do my job and to pass "
good,"Great job but only part time when events are scheduled. Start early and end late when working on the train, have worked 22 hour days on big events. Work includes yard work before and after events, which is prepping train, or unloading and cleaning train for next event."
good,Well run company with high standards. The work environment was pleasant.
good,It was a challenge everyday.I was in charge of 13 employees and 43 miles of railroad.
good,"The job was exciting and demanding, I loved it, no day was the same  each day contain a new challengel. I worked with some of the finest people in the world.I learned disciplent and patience.  Management worked more on discilent than educating employees on how to stay out of trouble on the job. Like on how to stay on top of a bad situation, because once it goes bad the company fine a way to drop it in your lap"
good,"There are many different things to do on the railroad. I either transported trains from one state to another or actually built trains in the yard to be transported. I learned a lot about safety and responsibility. The management had its rough parts, but they got the job done. The hardest part of the job was following all of the strictly enforced safety rules. The most enjoyable would have to be the pay and being outside in nice weather."
good,No two days are the same. There is a very good working relationship between management and the different crafts. Very good compensation and benefits.
good,The company is currently going through a leadership change. Way too top heavy and field managers are treated poorly.
good,"Not hard work, just home for only a few hours, but gone 36-48 hrs at a time"
good,CSXT is a good company overall. They do have some very poor management at the Indiana locations but the benefits are unbeatable.
good,"Good job and good pay with good benefits, bosses are always looking to fire you"
good,All kinds of hours and weather. Travel required paid bonus.
good,"Great company flexible hours, great co workers"
good,Good place to work with good pay. Different work schedules with offset days off but that is easy to get used to. Has strong commitment to employee safety and workplace
good,They saved money when they got rid of me. And others that went from one area to another I would be  there now if it weren’t for the COO. I would love to work with the others
good,"•	Extensively implemented Datapump, conventional Export/Import (Oracle 11g, 10g) for migration and logical backup of database."
good,"It was a well paying union job. Excellent medical benefits. Unfortunately, the coal market took a major hit and CSX was adversely effected. One of the outcomes was they abolished many clerical positions. Mine was one of them."
good,Learned a lot and saw a lot working on the railroad  Met a lot of great people I still call friends to this day.  I wish the railroad as a whole offered better job security.
good,"Travel to other depots or Augusta and be out ff town for days at a time, taking a train to industries to set and pick up freight cars or to other yards."
good,"This is a great job if all you wanna do is work and very little play, long hard days and grinding seniority, and working the bad jobs until you stand for the good ones"
good,"advantages and disadvantages like anywhere else "
good,CSX is a great and stable place to work. Excellent pay and benefits. The non traditional work schedule and lack of time time home is very challenging.
good,CSX Intermodal taught me the balance between the terminal and the rail.  I learned how to take union crews and work trains.  The experience was very valuable.
good,"Used to be one of the top railroads. Company is having some operational issues at this time, but If you can withstand the turbulence, it is a good long term career option."
good,CSX is filled with lots of great people and it is a company that rewards hard work and sacrifice. There are many excellent training opportunities and upward mobility is possible for those that work hard
good,"CSX is a company made up of railroaders in the process of updating all its systems.  In an effort to upgrade the systems, all layers of the company are in the update mode.  Some growing pains, but a great place to work."
good,rail road job where your under csx and fra rules. this job requires being on call 24 hours a day. I have no set schedule leaving me missing quality time with family.
good,A typical day is very busy. The working environment changes minute by minute. Long hours and frequent away from home. The work is outside in all weather conditions.
good,"Always on call. Work weekends and holidays on all shifts. Adverse weather conditions. Must have the ability to memorize several rail yards with acres of multiple tracks."
good,"The culture was moving in the right direction.  Unfortunately, there have been a lot of recent lay offs, approximately 20% of management employees.  "
good,A great place to work. Benefits are second to none. A company where you can stay 30 years and be proud to work for. Great place if you like to live in different locations.
good,A great place to work. Benefits are second to none. A company where you can stay 30 years and be proud to work for. Great place if you like to live in different locations.
good,Strong Union environment and many day to day obstacles. Great company to retire from for benefits and rail road retirement benefits.
good,"Great benefits, good retirement. Can be seriously dangerous if you arent alert and safety conscious. A lot of nepotism among higher management.  An insurance policy known as ""run-off "" insurance is a must. Everyone that works as union labor has been run-off at least once. Many rules are arbitrary and pointless. Many managers are nothing more than rule enforcing evaluators with no job experience. A lot of managers have a quota of discipline. In Jacksonville Division, a manager was required to have 60 test failures per month. Most resulting in days off without pay. The other engineers and conductors were great comrades and friends, trying to do the job safely and remain injury free. All while locked in an adversarial relation with managers who were expected and pressured to fire them. Money was good. Stress terrible."
good,My job title at CSX Transportation was Clerk. ..I had my  own vehicle and I answered calls from the YardMasters to swap out crews or to go pick up crews off of train...that's what my job entailed 90% of the time and the other 10% was clerical work.  I maintained the Crew Room Train printers...delivering orders to crews and running Rosters to fill jobs for next shift. I  never knew if I was going to work 8 hrs or 16 hrs. ..If they told me to stay then I had to stay and that was one of the down sides to the job. My job terms were different than the Conductor's and Engineer's...they are under a totally different agreement and have to deal with so much more than the Clerk's. CSX bought out the clerk jobs so I was out of a job that I thought I would retire from...no one expected it or seen it coming and I feel like the company could have done things different! I'm a hard worker and a loyal employee...the experience just made me want to rise above and to be the best that I can be for the next career that I  choose to embark on!
good,"Great place to wrok and grow a family."
good,travel well paid but also sacrificed time at home.  Managers depending on department looked to fire you and retirement was the best part.  Large furloughes
good,"Great pay and bennifits, good bunch of guys, long hours that go fast, hardest part of the job is the on call you can get called at any time"
good,CSX technology is an absolutely wonderful place to work. They are very understanding and will do everything possible to accommodate you and your needs. The only downside would be that there isnt much communication unless your part of a specific circle of management or upper management. Certain things that pertain to everyone should be shared with those that the information would impact. Other than that one flaw CSX technology is a wonderful place to work at.
good,It is a great place over all. The only bad thing is they tend to over hire sometimes and that leads to being layed off. Just go by the rules and dont cut corners.
good,"This group is always changing and our team does something new every day which allows for development and networking. The Market Strategy team deals with many groups within and without side of CSX. Travel, training, reporting, and making decisions with data are just a few of the things this group does for CSX."
good,involvement in the makeup of trains and traveling to various locations while working with professional people.
good,A typical day in the office varies depending on the workload of the shop. Some days were extremely slow and other days it seemed as if no sooner than you clocked in it was time to clock out.
good,A typical day of work for me is to travel with in a 5 state area to oversee all the freight conductor trainees and to ensure they are working safely and with in the operating rules set forth by the company and the Federal Railroad Administration. I learned a lot about safety and how you can actually improve your safety off the job as well. The hardest part of this job is being gone for long periods of time and missing out on important family events. The most rewarding part is taking someone with no experience and being able to break down the job so that they understand and can perform the job safely.
good,Report for a train assignment and get all paperwork necessary. Listen to a safety speech from a manager. work the train assignment under the very close scrutiny of several managers. When finished with the assignment go home. Maximum of 10 hours per assignment.
good,Internship - Railroad Education & Development
good,Working at CSX is a productive company and offers advancements for those who desire to reach employment goals.  The company cares about their employees and family members
good,"It was a good company, great benefits, the point system needs to be updated. You have to join the union which is a gift and a curse. The people I worked with where great."
good,"I drive a train on a daily bases. No train ever handles the same so everyday is a new adventure. We handle coal, intermodal and other commodities. We supply industries and make sure our customers are satisfied."
good,"At CSX, if you're willing to work hard and go the extra mile, this is a great place to work. Like every job, it has its challenges but it's a good company to work for. They provide online education classes for career planning as well."
good,"Once the CEO, Michael Ward, left...things were never the same. He made it a great place to work and allowed each employee (management/union) the opportunity to excel and lead within their role. Employees were also given the opportunity to develop themselves for the next level at the same time, if so desired."
good,managers were a mixed bag some were amazing and others were very incompetent  the work was rewarding but that was after borrowing tools from another maintainers truck because the manager didn't want to stock my truck with the bare necessity
good,"nice place to work, learned a lot. spent many days repairing freight cars and inspecting them. management is fair but at times seem over worked and stressed out. best part of the day is knowing you're moving america."
good,"It was strictly business, all work and no play. It was vey important to stay alert be aware of your surroundings where you had regular job briefings with your crew members."
good,It was my dream job;I was blessed with the opportunity to get on a train and travel to various towns and states.Waving at people as you pass by.When I was eight years old for Christmas my Father bought me a Lionel model train with the track and mountain tunnel.I never thought I would actually get a job working on a train.
good,"Good company, but never no when you position will be gone. They will send you to school, to give you training, then lay you off. Love to have stayed on longer, but the new CEO thought it was better to lay of 4000 plus 1000 managers to make the bottom line better."
good,"very long hours, gone from home a day or two. its hard to have a steady sleep schedule, always have management breathing down your neck, only thing good is the pay and the benefits"
good,I mostly worked on railroad bridges while employed there. I did other types of work such as track maintenance and also heavy machine operating especially using a crane. I worked four days a week and was off for three. I had time away from work and made good money there.
good,New stock holders cutting all jobs off. Dont never know if ur gonna have a job tomorrow. Does not care about the employees. Payin union dues also but there not trying to negotiate anything to help us
good,"I enjoyed my job and the people I worked with.  I worked in many different car shops and locomotive shops.  A job on any railroad unless you are in HQ, is not an office type job.  You get to be outside in all weather conditions and can often be dirty but it is very rewarding to actually be railroading.  Safety is a way of life for all railroaders and can never be ignored.  You are on call 24/7."
good,"Good place to work. Great benefits. Advancement opportunities available. Track, signal, transportation, mechanical positions. Also many other fields within."
good,"I feel if you are someone who has a young family it's hard to live a balanced life between being gone 6 days a week and maintain a healthy lifestyle with your family. Don't get me wrong money and benefits are awesome but I am missing my kids growing up and all there activities they are doing day in and day out. I have got to meet and work with slot if people from slot of different backgrounds, but family to me is more important."
good,"Very good job because of the money, but that is about all. Management pressures you not to turn in an injury when in reality injuries are very common."
good,"New managers are inexperienced,do not have people skills,do not know how to convey job assignments with company job procedure .Managers often pressured to write up employees for advancement"
good,A typical day consists of a fast paced always changing work schedule that challenges the mind and requires constant use of mental and physical skill. its given me a great outlook on the ability to please coworkers an customers each and everyday.
good,"People that come to work for CSX, don't leave CSX. CSX becomes how you walk, talk, and live. It is a very diverse work place, and your co-workers consider each other family."
good,If you can afford to be laid off a bunch your first five years then i guess it's not to bad of a place to work. I workrd 10 months then got laid  off.
good,Layoffs are awful and the family and work balance aren't great but everything else is amazing. The benefits and compensation are great but if you like your social life this isn't the place for you.
good,"Switching out freight cars to build outgoing trains"
good,CSX is overall a good company to work for when you work. Layoffs are expected and it's often hard to stay on any certain job. I've never had a problem with management. My favorite part of the job is getting to work outside and feeling like a part of something bigger. Working on call and never knowing for sure when you will go to work makes planning anything hard and is my least favorite part of the job. In the end I would say employees are justly compensated for all the inconvenience.
good,"Depending on the job the daily work changes, as does the schedule. It is an enjoyable place to work with some good people to work with."
good,"I work at CSX for the maintenance of way (MOW) we repair and build track and maintain our 57 miles of track. Typical day would consist of job briefings and work detail, which could include installing rail, track ties, surfacing, gauging, excavating, installing switch points and frogs. I have learned how to manage people better and to get jobs done in a timely safe manner. Management has changed a lot in the past couple years here, it's become all college graduates with no experience and nobody to guide them which has brought morale down. hardest part of my job is waiting for track time because we can't work if they are running a lot of trains. best part of the job is working with the guys in my gang."
good,"Great opportunity, benefits, and management. The employees boost safety and teamwork. Would consider working permanently with this company."
good,"Don't expect to have a regular work schedule. you might work in the yard one week building trains and switching freight cars. with ""regular work schedule"", i.e. work five days with two off normally an 8 hour shift never more than 12 though.(federal law and all) and the next week working the road, i.e. taking a train from one rail yard to the next sometimes gone for a day or two."
good,"Safety is very big here, people will always try to get you to change the way you learned it or will show you the wrong way and tell you to do it right, so always be cautious on how you do your job no matter how you were shown"
good,"Not a bad job at all. Good benefits, Good pay."
good,Work days here are long but your well compensated with health and bonus benefits. Management hassle you to complete work and sometimes find trivial things to suspend you over if you don't. Co-workers aren't that bad if you are easy to get along with many different types of people and they are usually knowledgeable
good,14 hour work days with a 5 day on 2 days off schedule. Ive learned how to make rapid decisions on the fly in a fast paced work environm                 ent. I have great co workers which is the most enjoyable part of the job. the hardest part of the job is work /home life balance..there is none!!!
good,Unique job that is unlike most others. Pay is wonderful but life takes a backseat. Many various jobs local and traveling. Prepare to work on call basis for the first 5 years before enough seniority is achieved to hold a position.
good,"A typical workday at CSX Properties Group requires the use of many technical applications to aide in decision making. This includes geo-spatial mapping tools, image storage systems, reports, and contract databases. I learned to utilize data across many platforms to achieve a dynamic result. Management offers guidance in effectively analyzing researched information and presenting results to the initial requestor. Both employee and manager are mutually held accountable for planning, implementing and reporting Annual Goals. The hardest part of the job was locating uncaptured stored records and matching with data from source material. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the team to improve processes to streamline production of work."
good,if you are in the T&E crafts it is a completely different lifestyle. Be prepared to not see milestones in your childs life and other family gatherings.
good,"Due to the economy the job has laid off hundreds of employees. There is no end in sight. You typically get called out at any time  with a two hour call. Get to work review work order with crew member go over safety hazards, equipment, etc... Hardest part of job is you are always working with someone new so you don't know there work habits, or how they feel about company."
good,"The security of a job is nice, but the work and family balance is a lot of give and take."
good,"Strong, stable company. Management seems to know what they are doing but are a little harsh."
good,"I loved my16 years. I had several different responsibilities from Dispatching, Recruiting, Customer Service and Settlements."
good,"Was a great career. retired after divorce and moved to Las Vegas. I learned a lot about transportation and railroading. More than half of my career there was in management so I learned quite a bit making things work even under the worst situations eg. weather, derailments."
good,CSX is a GREAT place to work. It is fun and challenging. A great tea of ADMINS. You can learn a lot. The team gets along well in and outside of work.
good,"Learned how to manage, how to approach people when they did something wrong/right, and to conrol a budget."
good,"Overall a good place to work. I enjoyed learing about Railroad operating procedeures and having a job with good pay and benefits. It took some adjustment being on call 24/7 and working in all weather conditions, but all in all it is a great company with great people."
good,"A typical day at CSX was always exciting. I was at a start-up terminal and we had the opportunity to ""break in"" brand new technology. In this position, you had to function as a team. Success demanded it. The hardest part of the job was the schedule (3rd shift). The most enjoyable part of the job was the technology."
good,"It's a dangerous job. Must me conscientious and take advantage of  all the safety seminars and classes. A hardworking job that takes you away from home and family, but offers great opportunities for advancement and higher pay."
good,My time at csx has been rewarding in the knowledge that we are and continue to develop the company to invigorate the process of how tomorrow moves forward
good,"Pays well, great benefits and great retirement. You will work long hours and work very hard. The schedule can change on a whim and you feel underpaid at times. Overall perk and benefits is what you have to look at."
good,"Locomotive Engineer, Freight Conductor, Tower Operator, Remote Control Locomotive Operator,  and New Hire Trainer. Place cars to facilitate loading and unloading, makeup and breakdown on trains in a rail yard. Operate locomotive equipment through the use of remote control device. Engineer monitors speed, air pressure, battery use, and other instruments to ensure that the locomotive runs smoothly."
good,Not a bad company to work for. Overall my experience was not bad. My main advice would simply be to avoid the Chicago yards if at all possible.  Switching is great the days are short but the management there leaves a lot to be desired.
good,Great place to work. Great benefits and the pay was great. Strict work policies. The union was ok. Shift was very inconvenient due to the seniority ladder.
good,"Great Job, great pay and benefits. Management depends on where you work, so far I have been lucky.  Seems like they hire, spend a load of money training,then put you to work and look for any excuse they can find to fire you.  Always on pins and needle worried about getting in trouble for violating one of the million rules that are written for anything that has ever happened to someone who has been injured while working here."
good,"At CSX no two days are alike. I have been fortunate to have a great team to work with. Challenges are tackled head on in a team setting. Management empowers and encourages it's personnel to do the right thing and safety is number one."
good,"Transporting rail road personnel to and from trains and other locations as needed. Learned a lot about railroad day to day operations."
good,"This was a good company until Hunter Harrison arrived and started to cut jobs.  The culture is ok, I had a really great boss for 8 years that really made it a great working environment."
good,Fast paced work place where you need to think on your feet and make fast decisions. In charge of making sure crews are on time for work. Long shifts and required overtime.
good,"Been with csx for 12+ years. Have had to chase my job around for the past 5 years and with the recent cuts, it’s getting worse. The pay is good, but the hours are unpredictable and long with most time spent away from home."
good,I like the place it's challenging no complaints. They will give you all the info you need to fix and troubleshoot locomotives. I've learned a lot from this company they're going through a change with new CEO.  Csx is union operated which is good it allows overtime vacation and seniority.
good,There are multiple opportunities across various departments. Salary is very competitive and often reviewed. There are multiple positions that require travel.
good,CSX was a great company to work for and the company culture was a welcome asset.  Management for the most part was understanding and they worked with employees.  Compensation was fair.
good,In the midst of undergoing major transition.  The most difficult part of the job is realizing that some of the changes are questionable when it comes to safety and protecting worker health.
good,"Great company except for occasional layoffs."
good,"Great job and atmosphere, but like all corporation you have to worry about job cuts which CSX is notorious for. Things are constantly changing with the railroad if you do get hired make sure you keep your resume updated."
good,"Great pay, Benefits are good.Retirement if it holds up is one of the best you can still get. Most of the guys you work with are good people. Easy laid back work. I've worked 10 times harder for half the pay"
good,Manage craft to repair locomotives and perform scheduled maintenance. Work closely with power desk to build consist to pull freight. Perform operational test on craft to insure compliance rules as well as safe work practices.
good,"Enjoyed my years with CSX but the management and culture has changed significantly and I'm afraid they are moving in the wrong direction. Although it was not my decision to leave, it was an option I had been exploring."
good,"Overall, a good place to work with good people; enjoyed the variety of marcomm projects and keeping up to date on the latest marcomm trends; partnered with many top-rate vendors and agencies."
good,"great pay scale"
good,"Overseeing the development of conductors and engineers on a daily basis and making sure customers are serviced in a safe and timely manner."
good,"I would go to Erwin TN, and pick up a crew take them all the way back to Martin ky. I learnt a lot about trains, the crew members was always so friendly."
good,"Overall good work environment, safety violations usually require employee terminations or at least suspensions. The key to working in this business is to understand fully the task requirements, follow the written rules associated with the tasks involved, perform the tasks to the best of your ability, adhering to costs, customer satisfaction and care of plant, equipment and fellow employees."
good,There is never a dull moment on the railroad. Most of the time you work long hours in the extreme conditions of the weather. This job is very demanding because it requires you to be on call 24 hours a day 7 days a week.
good,"never the same always going to different places and doing different things. can get a little stressful but pay is good, and benefits also."
good,Review previous shift turnover. Delegate repair work to union employees. Safety job briefing at the beginning of the shift. Maintain yard checks throughout the shift and analyze work throughout rail yard. Correct deficiencies on various yard projects throughout the shift
good,"typical day at work is always a learning experience you always have different situations with each and every train "
good,"Not very much opportunity for advancement because most departments are very flat organizationally, with more chiefs than Indians."
good,CSX is a great company. Pay is nice you just have to be a hard working individual. Only downfall is that its seniority based and job security in the first few years which is rather agitating.
good,CSX is a class 1 freight railroad company that challenges their employees to give 100% everyday. The company is extremely adamant about safety. Their rule book is 400 pages front and back and you are required to acknowledge and follow every one of them every day. You must be able to multitask in harsh environments and problem solve with little to no help. You have no schedule as you work on call and will sometimes spend extensive hours in a hotel. coping with stressful situations is a must. Personally I enjoy the challenges every time I go to work as the job is anything but boring or mundane.
good,"Being in the field is both rewarding and difficult. Being on call can be hard to schedule life event. When called out to sites with devastating damage, it is truly rewarding and puts everything in perspective. The random schedule becomes a minor inconvenience when weighed to the reward of helping other and the country get their lives and schedule back on track."
good,"Benefits and pay claims are great and the training program is growing and getting better. Railroad is tough to stick with the first couple of years. Getting laid off in the state of New York from the Railroad isn't good. It all in all is not a tough job, just lots of rules and you have to be on your toes at all times."
good,"I was I didn't decide to go to work for The new company,  CSX was always good to there employees and Stressed safty and rule compliance."
good,"A lot to learn as far as incite on learning all the different territories that you'll be traveling over."
good,"After running some tests we take a train from Mobile to New Orleans. Standard runs is you work on the lines. As for working in the yard, we build trains by operating the engines with remotes and communicating with switchmen on radios to rearrange tracks."
good,"CSX is an excellent company regarding compensation.  However, job security does not exist."
good,"Fun job, allowed me to meet a great many varied groups of people."
good,Stable and good pay unon work outdoors which is enjoyable. I did not like the lack of eduction of most union employee's but CSX offers the ability to move up in the company.
good,"Inspecting inbound/outbound loaded and empty vans and container/chassis for damages, Input of driver information and railbilling on all inbound loads. Checking BOL's against drivers paperwork allowing to match for destination and export information. Running hourly inventory reports for UPS and Mail. Checking all Haz Mat paperwork for appropriate descriptions, codes and sizes. Worked well with Ramp Managers and co-workers had many split shifts to relieve."
good,"This is a freight railroad business. The primary job is to move freight safely and efficiently. CSX is commited to making sure that is followed and gives you as many resources as possible to get it done. As a front line manager, you are the go-to guy when things do not go as planned and you better have an answer. Making sure employees go home the way the way that they left after work is always an important joy to the job. This railroad can be unforgiven."
good,"Working at CSX has been a phenomenal experience and has led to personal and professional growth and development for which I am very grateful. I have had the opportunity to work with all levels of the company, and have gained a unique perspective of the transportation industry and business management."
good,"I was a train Dispatcher located in Indianapolis, IN from 1999 to 2018. The job was fast paced and extremely stressful. But it was also very rewarding paying around 80k per year. Overtime was readily available. I had partially employer paid health care with dental and vision included. Great health insurance in today’s markets. Paid time off that increased with seniority. "
good,It is a hard job but they were is workers right and paid well. You have to be very carefull.work is being done all around you. And if somebody doesn't lockout like they are suppose to do and that sets motion where someone could die
good,It is similar to working as an air traffic controller;the difference was I directed train traffic at a fix position in a terminal railroad yard.You had to be able to multitask and you were under time constraints.
good,This is an area where real improvement is needed.  They do a poor job of educating lower management in general.  There are few opportunities to grow as they are unwilling to extend learning in areas where they are the weakest.
good,"CSX is a mission-driven company that sets goals varying from realistic to ambitious.  The management culture allows for work/home balance and flexibility providing that individuals are managing the business well within or exceeding company goals.  While the culture is predominantly male-dominated, CSX continues to work towards gender equality and in recent years has seen a rise in female promotions.  Transportation, in general, can be a stressful industry; and CSX is no exception.  The company strives to deliver the best in safety and on time service to its valued clients."
good,Safety is the first priority. Decent pay for job. Not much room for advancement. The job is what you make it. It is a team oriented environment. I would recommend this job to others.
good,Over all its a great job to have. Good people there to work with. But the company can be u fair when it comes to you screwing up. More hours then you wont some times.
good,Pay and overtime is no problem. Training new hire employees was very challenging and rewarding at the same time. Learning the in and out of the Railroad was great
good,Good company to work for if you don't mind a lot of travel.  Many helpful employees to work with.  All different types of managers on every end of the spectrum.
good,I was let go after dozens of my co-workers had already been let go.  The # of changes being implemented have had a very negative impact on customer service.
good,"This is railroading 101 !  No home life, hours of operation, anytime. If the railroad wanted you to have a normal life, it would have been issued to you along with your PPE."
good,great company good retirement work was good. weather could present some challenges if you was in the elements. team work was the name of the game you had to work together to get the job done
good,"Long hours, no work/life balance, always on call.  Management team is good, workds well together but now much of the upward mobility has been taken away."
good,"The guys were great to work with but when the new CEO took over all he cared about was profits, disregarded all union policies and closed shops and yard without a days warning."
good,"Great culture.   Very busy, nights and weekend work as well.  Four weeks a year vacation after five years of service.  Pension and 401K plans included."
good,"the railroad takes dedication, You have to be willing to work long days or nights in all weather conditions. The hardest part of the job is to retain and comply with all company and federal rules."
good,"Work long hours, weekends, nights, holidays. Not much time for anything other than work. Very challenging and engaging. Very rewarding, but you definitely earn every penny."
good,"Great benefits, however there is no stability with this company.  I have enjoyed working there over the past 10 years and would love to see coal come back to the area."
good,Great job for pay benefits and especially retirement. Usually get to work with some really good people. Spend a lot of time away from home unless you work a yard or local job
good,I'm looking to further advance myself and to obtain a new challenge in my railroad experience. I also am looking to seek a change of pace I am a hard worker who enjoys his work
good,"Training is informative and paid. The school is in Atlanta, Georgia."
good,"As long as ""SAFETY"" and ""RULES"" guidelines are/were followed, the job was/is pretty easy. Learned how to be a better leader, I was trained to job brief and train new hires. Making goals when in extreme cold, heavy snow conditions or thunder storms. Working with a lot of great people and crew members."
good,Lots of rules and lots of new managers wanting to make a name for themselves. Other than that it great pay and benefits. It all depends on what your position is. Transportation or Maintenance is the best branch to work for. Strong focus on safety and service. Yearly exams required to stay certified. Some travel for schooling.
good,"Your hours are variable, takes time to get some thing stable and that will not be promised, but this is why the pay is excellent."
good,This is a great job but unfortunately I was furloughed immediately upon completion of my 5 months training. No clue if or when they will call me back in
good,this was one of my favorite jobs. there was a lot of training and a lot of work outside. the biggest draw back was being laid off all the time.
good,Managing Train and service employees and meeting deadlines as it pertains to building trains and departing trains
good,"Learning opportunities from co-workers."
good,"CSX is a great place to make income for your family I had no problems with my Trainmasters overall i give CSX a great review, but it would have been nice to know more about the Furlough system, when we did our 6 weeks of training in Atlanta, The instructors kept telling us over and over it couldnt be a better time to work for the railroad, but when we got in the real world all they did was lay us off"
good,We inspect and repair freight train railroad cars.
good,It was really nice experience in working on Rail road company. CSX is one of the third largest rail road company in united states. Its always great learning curve in working with CSX transportation.
good,Enjoyed my time with csx. The only bad part of the company was not know if or when layoffs would come. Overall a good experience working there and worked with a lot of good guys
good,Steady work if not hectic and an occasional break for coffee. A ping Pong table would definitely help to keep me more agile :) ........................
good,The railroad industry was something different everyday and retiring after a 41 year career should tell you something   I would recommend to work in any department that is hiring  there is always room for advancement
good,"I enjoyed working for CSX as a dispatcher at Camden yards, among other places. Fair pay, a professional atmosphere. Chances for advancement. I had to retire early because they moved my job to Jacksonville Florida."
good,"You work very hard and put in a lot of long hours, but you are well compensated with salary and a great bonus."
good,"Personal safety and 100% rule compliance is conditional of employment."
good,"24 hour dispatching center. Come in,  take your job briefing and territory transfer time prior dispatcher, look over your territory and find out if there are any new train or track mandates. Constantly communicating with train/maintenance/dispatcher personnel as far as for the safe movement of trains on your dispatcher board. Adhering to all FRA and OSHA guidelines for the safe movement of trains."
good,"Solid culture, very profitable, strong name brand, many benefits thanks to rail unions, more than your average amount of holidays. Job and company security."
good,This is a very rewarding hands on position that allows you to be a true leader to your workforce. There is a work life balance that allows a lot of freedom to be with family.
good,I worked at CSX for 7 years must be used to working Outdoors Fast Pace used to being quick on your feet and good at reading and giving vital instructions let's be able to determine good and bad work conditions
good,"I lined trains on the tracks ,gave signals, the trains would move through the tracks into the rail yard.  I learned how to managed multiple trains and at the same time making sure they moved in a safe manner.  I enjoyed the challenge of the job, with little supervision."
good,"Work is on call and work all hours, the actual work itself is not too difficult but can be dangerous. the workplace culture is nice for 2 man crews, the hardest part is dealing with the managers"
good,"The days are long, the work is very physically intense but the job and people are enjoyable. The summers are great to be outside but winter gets a little cold."
good,Great job if you don't mind traveling . Company safety is an A+ but as far as treatment of employees goes not very good not a very family oriented company.
good,Great job great company good benefits enjoyed the guys I worked with and we got the job done....room for growth was also available to those who desired it....
good,Follow directions and take your time because you can get hurt and always wear your protection gear. They  train you very well and you can always ask if you don’t know.
good,Long hours. Must be erail safe  to work on the actual railroad yard..You can get extra classes to work with different areas of the actual railroad yard..

good,CSX is a great company because of it's employees. They are passionate about what they do and are always willing to help a fellow colleague. The company has a great history within the American economy and there are many opportunities ahead for CSX.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working for CSX Transportation.  It was a great company to work for.  I would still be working there had there not been a massive layoff.  I enjoyed my fellow coworkers and managers.  The benefits provided were exceptional along with the pay.
good,"very productive hard  work safe environment .Management  involved in work process. Work place environment  easy to work and employees grate to work with,"
good,A typical work day included getting freight loaded and unloaded in a timely manner. Making sure the trains got out on time. I had to make sure that all hazardous paperwork was in place for cargo that was leaving the yard
good,Management genuinely cares about the advancement of it's employees. Free lunches and open PTO make it for a excellent place of employment. Salary is quite low though. Will be finding other employment if salary does not increase with the cost of living in Florida.
good,Great opportunity on the cutting edge of transportation. The company benefits are great there as well. Most people who get jobs here never leave so opportunity are limited on getting on board with the company.
good,"CSX is undergoing significant changes in 2017. I do not expect the culture and work/life balance to be the same under Hunter Harrison. If you can get into the company, they do currently provide good compensation and benefits."
good,"Worked in Infosys, but Client was CSX Corporation. Worked on an application called IBM Tririga. Manager and Consultant were good. Guiding the right way always. Providing material and on hand guidance whenever we faced problems. Had fun interacting with them."
good,CSX is a rewarding place to work and know that you are providing a valuable service to keep the US economy moving. The Internal Audit group is a great place to gain experience working on cross-functional teams that will provide exposure to the whole organization.
good,"Great job but the company didn't have enough money to keep me on. I learned how to be member of a team. On a typical day, I had to get my paperwork ready for my travels on the train. The paperwork included all the hazardous materials that the train is hauling. I maintained communication to the dispatchers along my travels on the train. When I get to the different CSX yards, I speek to the yardmaster's and trainmaster's from that yard to find out what track that they want their cars at."
good,CSX strives for a safe work environment and take care of their employees.  They provide excellent benefits but not only for the employee but their family as well.
good,The information security architects were some of the most talented individuals I have ever had the privilege to work with.  The management vision and decisions left a bit to be desired.
good,"Everyone cared about your job as well as their own."
good,"Worked as Java Developer , very good place to work on Java web technologies."
good,"This is the same job, the railroad is the railroad and a service industry, communication is imperative and important. There needs to be a way to do this better."
good,"Liked my job, took pride in what I did, enjoyed the people I worked with. Do a good job for the company  and be safe while doing it."
good,"salary is very good,only downfall was not knowing when you were going to work,on call 24hrs a day. good people to work with."
good,Solid company. Slow movement due to union structure. Seniority matters more than education in the union ranks. Company is fairly solid and is experiencing growth in a lot of areas.
good,"I worked as a Software Developer Intern at CSX Transportation(Operations Research)."
good,I enjoyed working for CSX. CSX provides competitive pay and benefits. I had supportive crew and management. The hardest part of the job was knowing the dangers associated with it.
good,Lots of opportunity for growth in my career.  Many internal educational opportunities as well as external opportunities.  Most enjoyable was the variety of people I met and had the pleasure of working with over the years I was there.  An overall wonderful career experience
good,Same as before very safety minded working in and around heavy equipment. I learned how to weld and torch cutting.
good,It was a very good place to work. everyone got along and worked hard with each other.
good,"a. Working the yard, completing rail assignment (freight car layout), remote driving the engine, insuring all safety requirements are followed, freight cars are correctly located within the set. "
good,It's a way of life working on the railroad. You had to show up on time and be ready to work in any weather condition or problem.
good,"I have been an officer in the corporation for the last 13 years.  One of the great things about CSX is it allows its managers to take control and exercise ownership of processes.  This is especially true in field operations. The company's first core value is, "" It starts with the customer."""
good,CSXT is a strong viable company in the community. It has excellent benefits and great opportunity for growth if you are in the right place at the right time and with a management team who values hardwork and looks to help develop key players.
good,I actually work in waste water treatment facilities all along the gulf coast. Im alone most of the time and communicate with bosses daily over phone and email. I perform daily inspections (visual and lan analysis) and repair and replace equipment as needed.
good,I learned alot at csx i worked on signals putting them in learning to read blue prints and working with electrical and as a conductor i road on the trains and jumping off of them to switch switches and making sure the trains were set up
good,Working with the customer was the highlight of my day
good,18 years with the company. first 16 were great. I survived a hostile takeover but the company/environment was never the same. happy to say that I left on my own terms
good,"Great workplace environment for movement of products and goods.  Diversified culture and business environment.  Engineering Department supports construction projects, rail implementation, and other transportation business development."
good,"My position as a Freight Conductor for CSX provided me the ability to grow & learn on the job. If anyone is willing to travel & work hard, long hours that gives you great compensation, I recommend this company."
good,I enjoyed my job with the time i was there and would have loved to continue working with CSX. If i was given opportunity i would come back. But because there was change in new CEO i was let go due to seniority.
good,"Good place to work overall, make sure you question everything, follow everything, and pay attention to everything. Always look out for yourself, and be sure you know your job."
good,It is a large company so if you are looking for meaningful and impactful positions you will need to be in management and not a laborer.  CSX will compensate you well for work and time spent for the company.  They provide amazing heath benefits and great retirement pension.
good,Fast paced  and demanding. Work outside all weather conditions. Minimal allowed time off. Well compensated. Very good retirement. Very profitable company well established
good,"If I could do it all again, I would in a heartbeat.  I was fired from CSX Transportation because of a serious rules violation, which forced them to dismiss me."
good,"check engine for safety issues, and get a job briefing on whats going on at work and system wide.i learned to operate a locomotive engine. and do conductor work also a switchman, management was laid back .the hardest part of the job was working in the elements, the best part was the pay and benefits"
good,"A work day was never typical. I might be repairing a broken plane, scheduling inspections, supervising a technician, purchasing parts, or attending budgeting meetings."
good,"I truly enjoyed my 10 years with CSX, they truly had strong customer values and valued their employees. CSX  has a unique culture in the fact that it has union and management employees that work side by side on a daily basis which means contract and non contract issues can arise but I have always thought that CSX did a good job in bridging the gap between the union and management stigmas that exist in that culture."
good,"My first four years with CSX were amazing -  excellent work environment, work-life balance overall satisfaction. Recent CEO changed negatively affected work morale."
good,"Good work environment, really good benefits, especially railroad retirement. There is limited opportunity for advancement,especially outside of the department as it appears as the Internal audit function is not well respected or seen as a valuable source of future leaders."
good,CSX was a good place to work. The benefits and salary were very competitive compared  to other railroads. The retirement retirement benefits are the best.
good,for work place to work and good company good pay and good traveling would love to work for the company again. I learn how to tmr. the management was good to work for. I had some good co-workers that I work with. the hardest part of the job was being away from home. the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and the pay

good,"CSX is a very strong company with nothing but good things coming down the ""tracks.""  "
good,"I enjoyed all of the years I worked for CSX, I made many friends while enjoying strong working relationships."
good,"A typical day at work usually consisted of me taking transfer on my desk from the previous shift, make sure all trains are moving, take care of any problems on my railroad, and coordinate with management."
good,Well respected company in our community.  Enjoyable to work for; great interaction with colleagues.  
good,"csx is a great company to work for. their benefits are top tier, lifestyle is hard to get used too, but well worth the inconvenience.  overall a great place to build a career especially with all of the advancement options"
good,The union does a good job of protecting your interest and you're taken care of with benefits and pay. Management was the worst aspect. That mostly applied to the Selkirk Mechanical Yard at the time I was there. I've heard that it's gotten better.
good,CSX overall was a great company to work for. They offer great benefits and promote within. I would recommend CSX to people to work.   Great benefits and 401K plan
good,People are an asset. Upper management hires the right people to represent . Attitude among employees are great. Lot of smart people to work around and be mentored.
good,We do not walk and talk on our phones and we back into ALL parking spaces.  We also ALWAYS use hand rails and wear all personal protective gear within 25 feet of trains and the rail.
good,"Productive, fast paced, safety focused work environment. I would have never looked to leave if not for the downsizing in the Nashville area. Unfortunately I didn't have enough seniority to continue working at a job I loved."
good,"Fun job traveled out of Nashville Tn. Was in charge of safe train travel Moved all kinds freight cars, trailers dangerous materials "
good,Good place to work for just the moral is always dead. Can't really move nowhere because of why should I work any harder than the deadbeat beside me attitude. We all make same money attitude. Just follow the rules and do your work with quality and you will be fine.
good,"Fair and stable company and great place to work. Very strict on safety, yet less strict on performing maintenance on the operating equipment. Overall a good place to work."
good,Overall good experience. Had a supportive and knowledgeable manager. A lot of restructuring and job cuts in March 2017 create a stressful work environment.
good,Well compensated for the work required if the employees. Health benefits are top notch. The only downside is if you're low in seniority your shift won't be the greatest.
good,"The rating I provided is based on my current experience at CSX, however, the expected changes to the CEO and BOD may change the CSX culture."
good,"great retirement, other employee's were exceptional people, entry level has a lot of furloughs, out side of that it was a great job, would do again."
good,I learned what railroading consisted of and enjoyed it a lot of hard work for good pay in a union and had a lot of training in my life professionally and personally. My managers I had were very professional and courteous my coworkers also. The hardest part of my job was moving on from the company. The most enjoyable part was to be part of a union that worked.
good,"Working at CSX is a good job for you to be able to care for your famil3 only downside is they take half of your check for insurance, pension, taxes ,and union dues"
good,management need to be revised. instead of working on how o improve on your daily work day management looks to see how the can find you in contempt of a rule to wright you up or even fire you
good,"Typical seniority based union job. Limited ability for advancement. Rolling yearly lay offs. small amount of vacation available, no sick time allowed. encouraged to work sick, penalized if you do not."
good,Csx transportation is a great place to work at first it is alot to take in the training you must go through is very intensive and takes almost 6 months before are to become a conductor on your own but once you have a hang of it. It's a very enjoyable place to work.
good,I have worked at CSX for 13 years and it has taken a turn for the worst. CSX was once based on safety and efficiency. They seem to now focus on firing most of the workforce to obtain the goal of an low operating ratio. CSX does not pay the employees what they have promised and I am now looking forward to advancing in my career.
good,If you work for any railroad  company  you have to understand  that  you  will work many hours and miss a lot of family  time and  events. The railroad  is a very rewarding career monatary  but can take a hard and negative  energy of family  life because  your away from your family a lot. You must have a great family  life and understanding  spouse when considering  this career.
good,"Delivery of freight based on customer satisfaction is usually fact based, however the hours are long and the schedule drastically changes without much of a warning. More time is spent at work than home by far."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my tenure at CSX and wish my former colleagues the best in their future endeavors.  The experience and knowledge I gained is invaluable and I look forward to utilizing those skills in my new career.
good,"Great place to work,  but for such a large company, they do not care for the employees that are on the rail and road doing the work, nor do they mind laying off and losing employees that work hard every day"
good,Csx is an awesome place to work. The benefits are awesome. You work on called 24 hours a day. I learned a lot from CSX. The hardest part of the job is being will to dedicate yourself to work any time of the day.
good,Once you learn the in's and out's the job went smoothly. Being on the road made me miss holidays an such but the pay compensated for it. Lots of lay-offs though.
good,it was okay but it was just a temp job I have noticed they do this a lot and then drop people just before they are eligible for union membership. I liked the work but wish it could have been longer
good,"On a typical day at work I would enter 600-800 trlrs/cont. into system."
good,Great company to work for and day comes with constant opurtunities to prove yourself to the customers.There is always opportunity for advancement.Reguardless of the weather the customer has to be worked no exceptions.Excellent company to work for .

good,"●	Responsible for knowing and complying with yard and road characteristics of qualified territory including , local and line of road customers "
good,Communication skills and working with others was a great asset to working for this company. Enjoyed working with the people/bosses and working on river. Hardest part of job was managing barge during high water/ current conditions. Typical day was checking the safety of my deckhands/crew members. I had to check mechanical parts of barge/engines before operation each day to get coal from the terminal.
good,"As I a clock in I check what is needed to be done,"
good,On call-24/7 while working safely and efficiently for long hours of the day or night. Always working with someone different learning new things about each other. Hardest part of job is trying to find stuff to do when laying in hotel waiting on a train. Most  enjoyable is working with good employees.
good,good pay once you are done with training and working regularly. hard on the body and home life. save your money and be careful
good,A wonderful place to work with a focus on safety. There are a lot of experienced professionals who are dedicated to providing safe and efficient service.
good,I always wanted to work for the Railroad and was given the chance CSX. I did very well at school for Conductor training and was looking forward to making this job my home. Unfortunately that was not going to happen. My wife and children were not happy with me being gone for the long hours and even days at a time and the 110 mile round trip was not much fun either after working long hours. I wish that I would have had a solution to the problem but the only one was to stop working for the railroad for my family. I am now doing some contracting work on my own to fill in the gap until I am able to find a permanent position elsewhere.
good,"8 to 10 hours a day to include after hour response to remote user. Accepted, troubleshot and resolved an average of 15 tickets and at least 3 projects per day. Learned how to install, upgrade hardware and software. Became ITIL certified, learned how to use Active Directory and how to troubleshoot the network connectivity issues. CSX management went out of their way to ensure that we technicians had the full corporation of all CSX employees when it came to resolving PC issues. I was invited to join all inclusion Groups within the company and was always recognized for my Military Service during the annual Military Appreciation Day and Parade. I was rewarded with a monetary bonus for a job well done on many occasions. The coworkers at SouthPoint are super techs, I was not to fond of the other tech work ethics at the other locations, but had to fill in to help them from failure on resolving tickets and projects. The hardest part of the job was not being able to connect with the Remote users due to communications issues. My most enjoyable part of my job was how I was treated by all the CSX VIPs, managers and clerks."
good,"typical day starts with reading dispatcher messages, then a safety briefing is hedl to make sure eveyone full understands job. after that get on the train and go to your destination. unless switching cars in a yard then you just follow the switchlist"
good,"working hard making candy and storing the candy,working the assembly line was ok it you busy.packing and unpacking was alright you have to stand in one spot all day."
good,Solid company in a very interesting and diverse industry.
good,"The company has long standing and tenured individuals, which made it difficult for growth opportunities. The culture within my department was distasteful and apparently biased."
good,"Working with a crew to complete tasks in an environment where productivity can be challenging.  Overtime is a must.  You cannot turn it down.  Hardest part of the job is getting rest after getting off and having to come back and do another twelve or sixteen hours.  The money is great, but it can be challenging to balance home and work, but if you can it is an awesome company to be employed.  I have nothing bad to say about this company.  If money is your goal and providing a service is your what you are strive for, then CSX has a career for you!"
good,"Enjoyed my time with the company. ...would return immediately if given the opportunity. Quality time with the family was not the best,but we made it work."
good,Coming in the door it could be a lot to learn and very hard work. This job is for people who are ok with working outside. It didn't take long for me to work my way up to a jockey driver considering i have my CDL and knew a little about the container business. Management is very fair to those that come to work and not to play around. The hardest part of the job is being the ground man & coming in the door that will be your first position. The most enjoyable part about the job is working from the jockey truck. You still have to work hard & be productive but talking to co workers over the radio makes time go by or if you're the quiet type you can just stay to your self
good,"CSX Transportation is a great company in which to be employed. The benefits and compensation are very good. "

good,Due to the current ceo of the company (hunter harrison) ive found that its in my best interest to look for future employment elsewhere. His recent changes have changed the certainty i once had in the company.
good,Working in an ever changing environment that is challenging and rewarding. Designing new railcars or modifying existing railcars is a unique experience.
good,"(The Train never Stops)"
good,No Work / Life Balance company does not care about your work life balance or promoting good talent. Great benefits but lacks knowledge of other industries and their processes
good,"A typical day in the Telecommunications department including planning and installation of telecommunications equipment.  Planning included a safe working environment and execution of that plan with updates as needed.  I was usually the management on site sometimes with several other subordinates as well as working by myself.  Co-workers also were trained and usually their input in planning was highly advised creating a team like environment.  The hardest jobs usually was building telephone communications lines which required setting utility poles in extreme weather conditions i.e. heat, cold, rain and inclement weather.  Most enjoyable part of the job was the work environment itself with usually a friendly and sometimes fun situations."
good,A great place to work. Once you are 100% invested offers a wonderful retirement. The quality of like was challenging being away from home but the pay really good.
good,Too much time working not enough time off not enough atta-boys boys for the things you did good but plenty of taking credit by those above you and placing blame on you for things you didn't do wrong or had no part in little help in advancement lots of job competition
good,Riding on a train to different locations to drop off railroad cars. Was a very good place to work for. The hardest part of the job was getting call out every eight hours to go back to work.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working for CSX. It is a great job with great benefits short term as well as long term. Overall I was very happy and content with the work and management. Unfortunately I was furloughed after the company made cuts to improve the operating ratio. Be prepared to work many different shifts with inconsistent off day and an inconsistent schedule. Great place to learn and great people to work with and around.
good,The job was great and a typical day was 12 hours. Everyday was an adventure and everything was always different. The hardest part about the job was dealing with management due to them not knowing a conductor's job.
good,Stable job with good salary / benefits. Development of employees struggles a bit. Great locations and entry level opportunities. Wide range of job titles.
good,"Great benefits, great salary.  Long hours, no work/life balance. Great culture and people.  Opportunities for advancement and promotions.  Training is available."
good,"CSX is a great company to work for if you don't mind being away from home. You have to stay ""marked up"" i.e. ready for work and on call to make decent money. if that  is what you are willing to do and don't mind being called in at ANY time..."
good,"I enjoyed my job with CSX.  I enjoyed the diversity of the workforce and enjoyed my co-workers.  The pay and benefits were great but the hours were long.  I more than often worked 16 hour shift some days at a time, worked all weekends, all shifts, and holidays."
good,"The hardest part of the job is the schedule, there really isn't one you are on call 24/7.  The people are great the work is awesome, I truly love the job it is just very unpredictable. I have been furloughed twice in the past and just got furloughed again and it looks like this time it will be for a long time."
good,"Interacting with customers solving their problems, answering technical emails for training issues, loading training content to LMS, testing training courses"

good,CSX is a great place to work with amazing benefits. The job itself is dangerous but management really pushes safety. The equipment is well taken care of and new.
good,"Working for the railroad is unlike any other job I've ever had.  I was on call 24/7 for most of my 14 years there and spent many holidays, birthdays and weekends away from my family.  Great job with great benefits but not ideal for a person who values time with their family."
good,"I loved what I did everyday! There is nothing worse than hating to go to a job that you don't enjoy. It was not that way at CSX Transportation. I always was challenged on a daily basis. I could accept overtime, but it was not required. It was truly like extended family there."
good,I enjoyed the company until we got a new CEO. This company was a great place to work and allowed me to obtain a great working relationship with my team and customers.
good,"Working to move millions of tons of freight per day was enjoyable.  Interaction with customers and train crews was fulfilling. Job loss due to downsizing was upsetting, but I would not trade the experience for anything."

good,"Work varied every day, never did the same thing two days in a row . Company truck and tools provided . Training provided , safe work environment . Safety incentives"
good,"Csx is not for the faint of heart. A very dangerous hands on career that commands one hundred percent dedication. The management isn't bad, but can be very unreliable like any other job. I have learned how to be more efficient with my time as you operate on a schedule that is not solid at all. The hardest part of the job is just that, living your life at the mercy of a phone call to come in that you can never predict, 24 hours a day. They thing that makes it all worth l=while is the immaculate benefits, travel and opportunity to meet new people while having employment that is very essential to the entire world."
good,"great place to work,   good people to work with,   good benefits,   no room for advancement,  management is ok,  work in fiberglass,  four days of work then four days off"

I learned how to troubleshoot and deploy hardware and software while maintaining good customer relations. The environment was enjoyable and I even got to practice using my network skills aiding users and entire sites that were down
good,"CSX is a great company for those who are willing to work hard. They do require a lot of time but it is worth it."
good,Working under time restraints and producing a positive overall outcome. Working with a company like CSX requires a employee to become more and they also have a nice compensation package.

good,Hardest part of the job was learning the train culture and proprietary systems - hardware and software for CSX. Everyone was always very eager to help or explain
good,"I started on job training as a brakeman, and was promoted to conductor within two weeks. I worked both as a brakeman and conductor, depending on what was needed at the time. No high pressure, just do your assignment, that's the way it is."

good,"It was high pace and full of excitement, great opportunity to learn and advance into any other  career field and the education is there all the time t."
good,"I love my current job. The pay is good. The days are long 10.5 hrs a day min. You learn a lot of things like how to run equipment. Plan out work sites. Read site plans. How to wire up many different things like transformers, etc. The management cares about you. Work culture is hard. It's all outdoors. Sometimes you have to really exert yourself like when pulling out cable by hand or when digging by hand through the compact stone in the gauge of the rails. All in all it's a pretty good job."
good,"I would definitely recommend this company to someone who is single. My position is seniority based so there is a huge possibility that you would not be in the same place for long due to the cutbacks right now. Right now I'm 450 miles away from home, so if you can handle it then this is for you."
good,Called to work anytime of day on call 24 HRS a day. At CSXT you can earn a good living and provide for your family. The benefits package is outstanding. The hardest is not knowing when you're going to work. The most enjoyable part is if you're willing to work you can provide a good living for your family.

good,"CSX provides an awesome, collaborative work environment that allows me to use my skills as a mechanic to design and develop mechanical skills and equipment"
good,"This job is very rewarding. Each day you go in, you're assigned a route for the day, or days. Typically you stay in a hotel for the night of your trip, or at least in my experience as a conductor. They pay is very well for not having a college degree. Although you are not guaranteed holidays or weekends, that's told upon interview. You're on a 24/7 call schedule, with rotating guaranteed off days. I would say the hardest part of this job is that there is a possibility of missing important events with family and friends. The most enjoyable part this job is being able to travel, and support yourself and family very well financially. Overall, this is a great trade to get into."

good,"I had my own office, where I worked independently. Attended meetings to regroup and focus on the task at hand and future plans. Meetings always started out fun and exciting and everyone was very hands on. The environment was relaxed, but work focused."
good,"CSX was a great place to work. The only problem nowadays is they are operating with skeleton crews and have frequent lay-offs (furloughs). This is a place for someone to go to make some real good money for a while, and face a possible lay-off. They work short-handed now, so it got a little more dangerous even though they speak of safety a lot."
good,"Csx is a great company to work for. It does have its challenges with the job and there is a great deal of traveling, However the benefits and the pay do make up for most of the challenges. They take care of there employees and there family."
good,It was only a 6 month contract but met great people and enjoyed it. Unfortunately they are downsizing otherwise I definitely would have continued working there.
good,The upper management Stick together to do what they have to to get who they want in the spots they want them and get rid of the people that have been there a while as not to pay retirement.
good,The rail road is not your average job it goes from simple to complex in ever task the hardest part is the amount of information to maintain the massive amount of responsibility The most enjoyable part of the job is benefits advancements and the history of the culture
good,Morning Safety meetings in office work lounge. We all shared interesting safety stories. Including safety on and around trains. Safety at the beach. Management allowed us to be creative in our approach to handling safety issues. Monthly celebrations with meals delivered or visit restaurants. The most enjoyable was working with a variety of software to publish engineers specs.
good,Loved the job. It was challenging and met and or exceeded expectations as a leader and a manager. Must be able to think out of the box with little to no help from Senior Managers. Ability to make a plan and watch the plan come to fulfillment on your shift. Very rewarding job in being able to take someone off the street and train them to become a safe and efficient railroader. Must be able to balance efficiency and customer demands to meet the deadlines.
good,"I love railroading, and CSX was the best of the best. Switching to the training and education side of the industry and being able to mold the newest employees was a priceless opportunity. I certainly did miss working in the field dealing with the operation, but this time has rounded some sharp edges I may have had. I loved CSX and its people!"
good,"I retired from this company and I loved my job I wish they would allow me to continue to work in some other position, something in the safety department because if there is one thing i do know its railroad safety I have served on many safety teams during my career"
good,"I help move the country from Cleveland Ohio to buffalo new york. I also learned a skill that will last a life time, self discipline and a motivation for getting the job done rain or snow.  My leadership took on new heights that will benefit others work fources in the future."
good,"CSX was my husband and provider for 30+ years.  It is a wonderful place to work.  Sure at times we had pressure obligations to meet, we did them as a TEAM. Team work became FAMILY work.  I grew to know  my co-workers families, the new births and the sad deaths.  We were strong for each other. The hardest part was sometimes leaving, we often hung out in the parking lot. We had birthday celebrations monthly. DIVERSITY WAS TAUGHT."

good,"I was a Contract Employee working as an Administrative Assistant to one of the Vice Presidents of Purchasing and Materials. A typical day would start with getting any special duties from my direct report and acting accordingly. I would schedule all of her travel arrangements, meeting, lunches, etc. Assist the other workers within my area as needed. I was responsible to maintain and organize contracts with vendors for the railroad. I assisted with the purchasing of  ice and salt for the entire railroad and ensuring the products were received as required by CSX. I participated with cost saving projects and help implement any changes required. I took minutes during various staff and vendor meeting and published them to the appropriate staff. The work place culture was very professional and safety oriented. The time I spent at CSX I was very enjoyable, the work was challenging and I am grateful for the opportunity to have been part of the team."
good,Good to work for and would recommend job to young job seeker because they have good benefits.They pay well but you do travel a lot but all in a a great company.
good,Great pay and great people to work for lifestyle is not that great and the management is not that great. Driving the trains is a real thrilling job.
good,"Working for CSX was a job that I liked. However it is a job that when working for this company you do not see a lot of time at home. You will miss a lot of holidays with family, school events for your kids and things like that. Otherwise the job was great. The pay  was good and the company overall was pretty good to work for. If you are a family man I would suggest a different job if it bothers you being away from family.It is more suited for a single person with no ties."
good,"This is a good company to work for, however as with many companies promotion is more often based on a network of friends and not actual qualifications. Benefits are good, and pay is as well however the culture of the workplace can vary depending on the people, and particularly the management that you work among. Overall I would recommend this company to anyone offered a job, but be prepared for people with agendas and to play the politics game with coworkers and managers alike."
good,A typical day of work would be a productive and safe day. No insult no injury and if possible always try and help out co workers if struggling and find new ways to be more quality productive and cost efficient and using your employees to the best you can and teach them what they need to know and always listen to ideas.
good,"A safe and quality work experience. Supportive management and co-workers. Engaging workload, fluid and exciting environment."
good,"Transporting engineers and conductors was delightful, because they are characters. Everyday was a comedy show with them. I learned to keep all views on politics and religion personal. Management was always fair and honest. My co-workers enjoyed working together and problem solving. Driving twelve hour days can be tiring every now and then, however; I found great enjoyment reassuring a safe transition for our energy depleted travelers."
good,If I still had my job there I would have a great career. Some things could be better but over all great company. Its definitely a retirement
good,csx is a great place to have a carreer.i get a three hour call for work and meet the conductor at the yard office and go over our paperwork and job brief about the day in front of us.once the train arrives we board it and talk to the dispatcher to go on our journey.once we arrive at our final destination we go the the hotel and wait to get called to go back home.that might be anywhere from 12 hours to 24 hours all depending but the federal railroad administration says we must have at least 12 hours of rest before going back to work.i learned to be safe and on time.learning that you have adjust to unseen circumstances.my coworkers are fun but professional at what they do.some are better but all are good.i work with a lot of different people so noone is the same.waiting on the trains to arrive can be tireing and frustrating at times but the travel is the worst for me.am a family man and love spending time to fish and crab with them but the travel gets in the way of that.meeting new people and the pay and benefits of csx are awsome.ill miss the comradere of the guys
good,"I worked here as an intern and loved working here, and it was a great learning experience and the pay was great.  I had great mentors, and managers that kept me busy and motivated for work everyday.  The hardest part was getting up early everyday, but the best part was my co-workers and other interns and learning new things everyday from my personal mentors."

good,Great place to work for an extended period of time with pension plan. Slow paced environment but lots of history of success and stability in a very large industry.
good,Work day may consist of any where from 8 to 16 hour workdays. I learned a great deal of loading procedures and operating front loaders for containers. Management was ok but only worried about the job and not the employees. The hardest part of the job was the long hours that was demanding and the most enjoyable part was working with others to accomplish the goals for the day.
good,I did tests on railroad sings and the signals that the trains use most of my coworkers were great some were young with a lot to learn which was also part of what. Did was training them

Most enjoyable part is having co-workers who appreciate you and even though they re higher on seniority they treated you the same as everyone else."
good,CSX was a great company to work for that paid well and provided great benefits for its employees. But the on the road lifestyle did not work for me at the time.
good,"Highly profitable company. Always looking for avenues to extend their business. The railroad continues to move, there is never a boring moment. Safety is number one in office and field environment. We are the number one, class one railroad two years straight."

good,Great place to work minus the seniority cause lay off for those at the bottom.  But if you stick it out for the long haul it is a great polace to work.
good,"CSX is a very serious 365 days a year about the Railroad and the community it services.  Safety is not something you say it's something you MUST do every day.  It is a career not just a job.  I loved it, but it's not for everyone.  You will be well informed of expectations prior to employment."

good,enjoyed working there... good benefits and pay. Learned welding and how to use different tooling. Weather related duties cold in the train yards... hot in the shops.
good,"Long days and hard physical work built strong working relationships. Also built great training to play off each other's skills. Demand for mobility honed CDL driving skills. Management was on top of all situations, Most enjoyable part of job were the large digs, where we could show our resolve under hard physical work. The hardest part was moving to a new site and regrouping."
good,"A typical day at work was something to look forward to because I liked all the people I worked with. A typical day was to remain safe, and do what was on our daily line-up. Management was great, they took time to listen to daily shift needs and achieved work. The culture was laid back, and fun. The hardest part of my job was the fluctuating shifts, and the automated calls in the middle of the night alerting me of my shift to begin in 2 hours from the call. I enjoyed the freedom to work at our own, safe pace. It was empowering to know that my bosses believed we had been trained to be the best, and do our best while we were on the trains."

good,"CSX is a great company to work for due to its many benefits and great compensation package. I would say that good compensation comes with great responsibility. the hardest part of the job right now is working the 12hr shifts, but my employees make it all worthwhile. CSX is very big on SAFETY and I enjoy everyday that I can say that I sent my employees home in better shape than they came in. Our goal is to work safely and efficiently as possible."
good,CSX offers a large degree of promotion options. Your hard work will be the deciding factor for your success. I would have stayed at CSX if I was not furthering my education.
good,I really enjoyed my time at CSX. Great job with great benefits. Takes a lot of personal dedication to work for the railroad. Best part of the job was personal satisfaction from doing a days hard work. Worst part of the job was the excessive amount of hours away from home.
good,"CSX is a great company to work for.  The opportunities the company provides are up to the individual to take advantage of.  It takes a unique person to work for a railroad, dealing with being on call 24/7 as well as working in all types of weather, makes the job challenging.  I would say the most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with.  even though you basically do the same thing everyday the people make it interesting and fun."

good,"A normal day at work consist of getting to work, at least 15-30 min early to receive an in depth dispatcher turnover. Becoming aware of the locations and disposition of each and every train and train crew on my territory. One of the major qualities/skills I learned to hone was the ability to multi-task and work under pressure. My co-workers, the way  we worked, or my motto was the key to continuous movement of trains was safety and communication. If anything deviated from our original plan, say a train has engine failure or inadequate power, we would have a contingency plan to keep rail traffic moving. Roughly, the hardest part of the job  was adverse weather snow, ice, flash floods, wash outs. The most rewarding part of the job is being able to accomplish the daily objectives given to me by my Chief Dispatchers and successfully move rail traffic through the Chicago rail corridor."
good,"good place to work, the pay rate is great , great benefits, learn alot about vehicles"
good,A typical day at work would begin at five a.m. and often would end as late as ten p.m. with on call responsibilities.  I learned how to work with many different individuals with different backgrounds and personalities: utilize these people in positions that cater to their strengths.  The hardest part of the job was to prioritize work and be proactive in a short amount of time that would meet the company expectations and serve the customers in a timely and efficient manner without disruption.  The most enjoyable part of working for CSX was knowing I had performed to the best of my abilities and being rewarded each year through the Performance Management Evaluations.

good,CSX has improved the culture significantly during the time I've been here (21 years). I appreciate working in an environment where I feel valued.
good,"A typical night would be tranporting crews to/from their assigned trains in a timely manner. Working with over 200 employees within our Terminal allows me to see that we as individuals have diversed views on diversed issues, yet come together at the end of the day to respect one another and be able to complete any assignment given. The hardest part of my job, well, honestly, there is not one. i am blessed yet to respect and appreciate my position.The most enjoyable part of my job, is to be able to communicate with supervisors on duty that will interact with their employees. i am treated with dignity and respect and my opinion matters on certain john positions."

good,I am on a one year assignment working with CSX Transportation in the Imaging Services Department. I am working in an environment where we all work as a team. The management team allows their employees to give their input on any area that they feel will benefit the workflow. The most time consuming part of the job is the quality control process.

good,"A CSX conductor has a lot of responsibilities, first part of a typical day is to have a safety/Job briefing we I identify what safety precautions we are going to implement for the days work, we then discuss our dispatcher messages which informs us work limits, speed restrictions and potential cautions that could affect our attended route. We then go over our work order that tells what our train is made up of, we have to analyze our work order to make sure there aren't any type of speed, height, weight or hazarders restrictions that make up our train. If we are a ""Key"" train meaning a train with a combination of 20 or more hazards material by class and code, that we have the appropriate paper work on them along with an a emergency phone number. once we complete our job briefing we either have to get permission to either built or get on our train and go by either or our train master or dispatcher or yardmaster. Your day can vary either you are working in a yard (building trains), working Industries(delivering specific cars to Customers) or working on the road(Taking a train to a different station, yard or terminal). The day may vary day by day but the same beginning process Safety/Job briefing and the end of the day reporting the work being done to a Train Master or Railroad Dispatcher still remains Safety is our biggest concern at CSX all day every day!"

good,"I am not kidding when I say that late on Friday afternoons, after a week of working hard, in the Coal Department, we all used to stand around and marvel at how we could actually get paid for something we loved to do so much.  The typical day starts out at 0700 to be on the call with the Operating staff, because they're much closer to what's going on on the ground than you are, and you'd better know if something's gone wrong, or if things are operating the way they should.  You have to learn everything - not only how the railroad operates, the time tables, where it runs, your competition's prices (and most of the time, it's not another railroad), what the utility pays for both fuel and transportation, broken out for each element, and you have to learn how the utilities or industries in your district operate, what coal they use, how is it unloaded, and a vast amount of other facts.  And it's endless, because you're always trying to get that next customer.  CSX Management is fabulous!  Their philosophy is to push decision-making down to the lowest logical level, where the most facts are known.  The hardest part of the job, is just learning the above for the first time - after that, it's not bad.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that you are truly a ""family"", so everyone helps out everyone else when they need it, and everyone knows the basics of everyone else's personal lives, so that when a tragedy happens, you mourn with your work family as well as your blood family.  I would not have traded a minute of my time at CSX because I got to do so many fun things all the time."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time at CSX. The railroad industry is one of the kind and I would recommend to anyone who wants to have a stable and long career.

Most enjoyable part of the job was going home after completing a tour of duty.Hardest part of the job was witnessing crossing accidents/injuries and fatalities, My Co-Workers and I bonded like family members,be they managers,or crewmembers we were ther for one  reason-To perform our task, like a well-oiled machine."
good,Typical day at work is loading up truck heading to yard and looking around yard for anything out of order. I learned how to use construction tools and hardware. learned about OSHA.

When a employee whould go through hard times co-worker would do whatever they could by funraisers, given vacation time away to help there fellow co-worker. You where respected by management. As a hold the department had to go through in house training once or twice a year for in house software. You also was compensated for your work."
