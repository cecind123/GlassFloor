good,"My time at OGE has been blessed with fantastic co-workers. Generally, everyone enjoys working with each other, while focusing on getting issues and projects completed in a timely manner."
good,Great working with dedicated men and women committed to making a difference in their industry and communities. Working in a regulated industry was a dynamic experience.
good,Regulated utility making conservative moves with low risk.  Clear strtegy tends to be weak and flucuates with frquency and leans on the reactionary vs. long term planning
good,"OGE is a good company to work for if you have the right Bachelor's Degree (Engineering discipline). If you don't have the right degree there is very little opportunity for advancement no matter the ""soft skills""."
good,OGE Energy Corp overall is a great company with great benefits and pay. The majority of senior leadership is great and it is a collaborate work environment.
good,"Excellent job and excellent people IF you are in the right department. Some ""good ole boy"" networks, but as a whole...great place."
good,"I loved working for og&e it was a great company and great benefits, I worked there as a temp and was laid off due to lack of work , I really wish I would have got hired ."
good,"Great company with great benefits. Foremost emphasis is put on members safety."
good,Overall a great place to work and coworkers can't be any better.
good,"I've been with OGE for over 8 years and have been in 4 different roles that have helped me in my development to be in the supervisor role I am in today.  Over the last couple of years there has been a greater focus on process improvement across the organization that has led to efficiencies and reduced cost. This initiative has also provided a lot of opportunities to individuals to demonstrate their ability to lead."
good,"I worked for nearly 5 years at OGE Energy Corp. in the mid- to late-90s. I found the culture driven, and professionally fulfilling. I do wish when I worked there they were better about hiring minorities and women, but it seems they've done a good job since I've left."
good,"OGE is a place where all employees are held to high ethical standards. Everyone I work with work hard, but they are like family."
good,"In the last job I had there, Engineer Tech, I would find sketches and job info on my desk in the morning. My job was to prepare a sketch of the job site showing where poles or other equipment were to go from the info given to me. I used ArcFM mapping software for this. Contact information and location was included. The software also ordered the materials needed from the list I typed in. A hard copy of the job packet would go to the Construction Foreman and that's what he would work from. An electronic copy would go to the Lead Engineer Tech for review, then would be sent on to the group that electronically added the sketch to the master system maps of the electric company. From these master maps, prints were run after major storms to help with reconstruction. Also from these maps the company's advalorum taxes were calculated. My supervisor came in for a few hours per week, as he had two offices to supervise. So we worked unsupervised."
good,Outstanding organization with a family like culture aka employees are referred to as members.  It's a very old company with lots of history and it is one of the top employers in the state also one of the preferred employers in the state.  They are very geared towards training and development so you get to constantly keep your skills up to date.  They like to promote within so its a good place to start your career and grow. They may not be as competitive salary wise with other energy related companies but you can't beat their stability so it's a bit of a trade off.
good,"I worked in the HR department so I can't speak for other departments. . "
