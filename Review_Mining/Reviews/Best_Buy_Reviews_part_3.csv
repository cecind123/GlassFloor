rating,review
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,High paced challenging place to work with learning opportunities. Compensation /benefits are too low. Best part of the job is the satisfaction of helping people get their computer issues resolved. Management could do better by providing enough staffing to handle customer volume.
good,Great company to work for that helps employees achieve a reasonable work-life balance.
good,"A day a work would consist of ad prep for the coming week. Inventory  of our product. Scheduling employees, working with Gm to coordinate better sales strategies. Go over numbers with employes."
good,"Best buy is an over great place to work. like any other place they can use imporvment in small areas, They are like a big family and will take care of you as best they can."
good,Great place to hone and develop sales experience. Mundane and repetitive. Exciting to be working with the latest gadgets.
good,Everyone is kind and helpful. i enjoy this job I recommend it to anyone.
good,"Best Buy was hugely influential in shaping me as a person. Our management team were fair, fun, and overall great people to be around. Our team was very close to one another both at work and outside of work. My store far differs from the average Best Buy experience, I've been told. I would work there again were they to pay there employees a living wage."
good,"Fun place to work. Great team culture and moral overall. Unfortunately not much job security no matter your position there is always a ""REORG"" going on where they basically get rid of everyone."
good,Worked there for 7 years and got fired randomly with no explanation. It was the only job i have ever had. There is zero job security in this company. Otherwise I would have nothing but good things to say about this company.
good,"Best Buy sparked my aggressive sales interest once again when I started working there. The room for growth was exactly what I needed at the time, and indeed gave me the additional knowledge I needed from a retail stand point."
good,It was fast paced workplace. Wish I could've got a full time position. Love working in warehouse. I can use my special abilities.I learned alot. Recieving/Shipping product. Co-Workers was fun. Enjoyable part of my job was doing all of the hands on stuff like building and trying on new task.All my managers was also cool.
good,"Nice place to work, great discount, helpful managers.  Not a lot of growth options, little pay."
good,"A typical day in my position generally means being in the Home Theater department of the store.  I sold TV's, stereo equipment and even full home theater systems.  Along with plenty of services offered by Best Buys wide variety of work load."
good,A tipical day was working to kip up wit new thing taking elearnig in the computers working witt costomers
good,"I enjoyed working there. It was a fun atmosphere and busy which I like. The Management especially my main supervisor was very helpful and always polite and treated me with just as much respect as the next person. I learned a lot working there due to hands on, testing on their computers and workshops they would do once every few months."
good,Fun place to work while you're working your way through college. As with any company that doesn't have a education requirement for promotions many people earned their advancement by simply time put in and not work ethic or performance. This results in a culture where it's employees vs. management most of the time. To have a manager that relates to the employees and motivates them are rare. I was lucky enough to work under management that really was in the trenches with the team. Also unfortunately with retail store leaders are rotated around pretty often and the most recent and current management team are more results oriented than committed to their employees. If you do your work and stay committed to customer excellence you will be rewarded in your own right with experience and retail skills that will help you in any job you gain in the future.
good,"* Very busy, and you stay on your toes."
good,Loved working in the mall not having to deal with food just icecream and popcorn. If pay and benefits would of been better would of tried to advance in the company. Good first job
good,"this is a great place to work as part-time or if you are in school, but is also a career job where you can learn a lot."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Typical day at work :Arrive in the morning ready to do all the work assigned for the day, do the best to rich the golds requested by the company."
good,"Fun job with a fun manager.  Could be stressful at times, but overall a good job.  Coworkers were very helpful and I learned a great deal about cell phone companies and their phones."
good,"I work in mobile, so my day consists of activating phones. I've learned a lot working here. I never thought I would know how to activate a phone or be able to tell people which phone plan works best for them. My co-workers are nice, fun to work with. The hardest part of the job is having to call the different carriers and be placed on hold for up to 30 minutes. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers and listening to their stories."
good,"A typical day for myself involves face to face time with the customers. I also supervise the department that answers and are required to close sales over the phone. I spend much of my time working with my employees to help them become better at their jobs, and I would do whatever I could to help them advance. I have learned a great deal working here. I have a lot of patience to deal with the public. I worked many positions that all required to have a good grasp on Customer Service and problem resolution. The management is mixed. There are some managers that focus primarily on the bottom line, but we have some that find the employee's happiness more important. The hardest part of the job was when there was honestly nothing you could do to help a customer when you thought it was the right thing. I also did not enjoy some of the paperwork that was required. I really enjoyed spending time with my team and being customer facing."
good,Installed car electronics in customers vehicles from stereos to speakers.
good,"Working here was sort of a mixture of good and bad, I loved working there, the people I worked with were great on the floor and we always had fun, however the advancement and management could REALLY use improvement. The people in management were awesome, always helpful, so long as they were available. Promotional aspects are out the window though, in my year working there I heard of only 1 opportunity to advance and never heard who got it."
good,Best Buy Mobile is a wonderful place to learn and be developed
good,Resolving/taking escalations. Training associates and managing my team.
good,"management was descent, and the job was good, an the co-workers were friendly which was a plus. management was ok but they showed alot of favortism as far as who would move up in the company"
good,"Cleaning, stocking, sales, merchandising. Being this was my first job I learned the value of money and responsibility."
good,"I love working at Best Buy, best job I've had so far but I just don't want to work retail any longer, I totally have nothing against Best Buy or any of the people that work there."
good,I enjoy working at best buy. I love to interact with different costumers everyday. I like to know a customer is walking out of the store with everything they need and a smile on their face.
good,"typical day at work is fun and relaxed, learning is always constant in the electronics field, management could be alittle better, co-workers all work as a team, theirs nothing hard about best buy, my most enjoyable part of the job is having the biggest sale."
good,I worked hard daily to achieve sales goals. I learned much about new cutting edge technology. The management was good and so were the co-workers. The hardest part of the job was the long hours and as business declines because jobs declined the pressure rose on us to sell more. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning about new technology.
good,"Had a very good worked experience at Best Buy,typical days were very busy for me always scheduled on heavy load days,but enjoyed opening new products and stocking them,what I learned was assisting customers,and inventoring products and shipping product out.The Management had the hardes job always dealing with customers that wanted a discount on this,and that,'but' they were always Professional how they handle customers and there problems."
good,"Typically, the day opened with our opening task check list. We would make sure that the departmant was clean and well stocked. We stocked merchandise, Zoned our areas and Made sure all product was faced. I worked as a team with other employees in my department to make sure that customers were helped promptly. As part of a sales team, we would cover for other departments as they went to lunch. I learned how to multi task and group customers that had similar questions. I developed great listening skills and enjoyed giving the consumers the products that they needed. The hardest part of the job was getting up to the top of the overstock to stock my department."
good,"I was at Best Buy for a little over a year, and had a blast doing it. My coworkers got along just well, and management was manageable at times. Anyone that has worked in retail can tell you that it is a stressful job at times, especially during the holiday season."
good,Interesting company to work for. With anything in life you learn something new everyday.
good,I loved working as a sales oporator. I liked to take al the elearning so i could learn about all the produts we sold.
good,"Mid Busy, Patients was a plus, new management have no direction, co-workers was wonderful, hardest part was team effort, enjoyable part is know you did your best everyday by receiving a smile for conformation."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I enjoyed working there. The only problem that I had was that it was too far and the pay wasn't enough for the amount of driving I had to do. The hours were very sporadic and was very difficult to schedule school around it.
good,"The work environment is pretty good, everyone is friendly towards each other and everyone works as a team in order to reach their daily goals. Teamwork makes the dream work."
good,"Working for Bestbuy/GeekSquad for 12 years provided a lot of experience with sales, clients, working in teams, lots of hands on training. Moving up in the company is hard but achievable. The down side is that the location management are loyal to their team but the corporation is not. In the time that I've worked for Bestbuy/GeekSquad there has been several mass firing; at least 4. The last one caused my manger above me and myself to loose our jobs. That being said BestBuy/GeekSquad at the location level is great at the corporation level not so much."
good,I love the company but not the mangers. I have worked in a lot of deparment  in the computer but they didn't value me  They never paid me more. I never called out.
good,"As a Sales Associate at Best Buy, you'll be expected to be an expert on your assigned subset of electronics devices. Not only are you expected to meet a minimum sales quota, among other barometers for job  performance,  you will be expected to assist customers in problem solving and troubleshooting various tech issues. Still, the job is straightforward and outgoing individuals should not struggle."
good,Good place to work but understaffed at merchandising and inventory positions.  Company shows appreciation for the work you do.  Thank you come at a daily rate.
good,"I liked my store and my coworkers, I enjoyed my 1.5 years there. After the bonus change and the pushing SUPER hard on TTS and BPs I lost interest. They some managers started writing people up for ""not offering the Best Buy credit card"" and I thought that was kimd of sucky. I know it trickles from the top but jeez.."
good,Business is constantly moving and things within the store and each department are consistently changing. Be open to change and always keep a positive attitude.
good,"The hardest part of my job is when we get audited monthly where we need to ensure everything is functioning correctly along with down stocking products. You can find products all over the store where it doesn’t belong"
good,cool place to work if you like technology. typical day consist of trying to up sell client with magnolia products. fun environment. Management have your back most of the time.
good,"Decent experience, Great culture, not much room for advancement but great experience.  The compensation is mediocre but gaining the knowledge and experience is providing me opportunities for the future."
good,Just make sure that customer service has all of your product ready to go and you have all your confirmation number for the job in hand. Great place to work here is awesome teams there love putting things together is nice and happy place in law I would recommend people to Best Buy have great deals
good,Over all my experience working here was great great Associates and atmosphere people friendly the hours worked was ok it was a fast paced setting would recommen my friends and family to work here.
good,Assisted diverse clients set up and manage their new computers and cell phones. Working with diverse client base was the best part of the job. People leaving with a better understanding of technology was extremely rewarding. The hardest part of the job was getting clients to purchase Best Buy’s Geek Squad pakage
good,Best Buy is a fun fast paced place to work with plenty of opportunities available for those who are flexible enough to take advantage.  My work is market based so I travel throughout Michigan to assist stores with all kinds of issues.
good,"Best buy was the first job that I had that actually challenged me, it was a good challenge. Management was respectful and always gave great resources to become a worker, and to actually learn new skills. The Culture at the Best Buy I was at was amazing, a great family and learning environment to develop better skills for life. The hardest part working at best buy was dealing with system issues and knowing the work arounds. The most enjoyable part about working at best buy is having all of the materials and resources you needed to be able to completely help out a customer with any needs possible, and to maybe even help them with issues/needs they didnt even know they needed help with."
good,Best Buy has endless career opportunities a lot of the upper management has started off as sales employees. They unleash the power of their people.....
good,I worked  for the company for 12 years the culture is family driven. if you want advancement In logistics the leadership ship team will coach you and get you in the right direction I had to leave because of personal reasons (traveling from home to work)but it was a hard decision But all in all a good place to work
good,I loved working here and the people that I worked with made it worth while. The compensation was good for what you do. The only bad thing was that I was always fighting for hours and the computer work kinda sucks. Other bad thing is they always make you do credit cards for every customer. Wish they weren't so pushy about it. They bring in meals for long days like Christmas and black friday. I definitely miss it
good,Day run yes i work at best buy your home need work make some money good  i go to job get out school time 3:50 tomorrow go this good job data 29 help people
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Fast pace, great associates, need to have better training structure, great management team, I enjoyed being able to work in different departments,  Able to transfer to different locations because of the many locations they have."
good,I started right after high school and stayed while in college and it was great. The company really does a good job at training and developing its employees. They promote from within first and they'll (depending on location) will prepare you for the role. The compensation was great for the work and the monthly store bonuses are a fun driving incentive for everyone. Though college tuition reimbursement was my main highlight for staying for so long. The only real sad part was the sales goals being sometimes unrealistic and they need to make it relevant towards the store demographic/location. Our store was small and in a small area so getting sales was VERY difficult to achieve especially the $950/hour sales target in a low-income area.
good,One of my favorite work environments to be in. People and customers make the days go fast and always something to look forward to. Wish there was more potential for growth and opportunities.
good,"I get to spend much of my day greeting clients finding out what kind of a technical problems they are having on their computer, Internet, cell phones, And about any other kind of electronic device and most software problems if I can’t fix it right immediately I check there device in and have another technician complete the work then when they come back in I great them and show exactly what was fixed and see if there’s anything else I can help them and leave them with a big thank you."
good,The workplace atmosphere is a really relaxed and nice  environment to work in with many friendly faces and coworker always offering help. Requesting days off is much easier than other places and many opportunities to switch shifts if need be.
good,Enjoy the job just want more structured hours on days. Plus something that's a little closer to home. Other than that it's a company I enjoy working for.
good,"Got along great with everybody, easily the best 3am shift and I'm very appreciative of the opportunity they gave me. It gave me the experience as a stock clerk that I wound up really needing for future endeavors."
good,"good place to work, good co workers, managers are okay. good culture for best buy, sales oriented, flexible, good chance to learn valuable customer service skills"
good,"I loved working for Best Buy. The management is great overall, I was just unlucky to be at a smaller store. You get real hands on experience with customers."
good,"Best buy was exciting and challenging to work at, a lot of freedom to do what you thought was best; management backed us up a lot of we told a customer No already."
good,"While working there is good, every year seems like work/personal life gets more and more unbalanced.  Retail environment requires a lot of time dedicated ndiring holidays and increased hours during the days takes away family time."
good,"Loved working in the sales department.  Very competitive, tjhe management was very understanding about benefits such as sick pay and PTO.  Loved working for th emanagers and compnay as long as you work hard for them they take car eof you."
good,The company is great to work for. The company is doing what it needs to ensure its keep up with the current retail market. Besides that I rather not say anymore.
good,I would have not left the company had the weekly hours been more consistent. We started same time every day but never ended at the same time . Peak season was real busy and off peak you could barely get your hours.
good,"Fun place to show up to work every day, although I imagine that would change from store to store as each Best Buy will have a different culture.  However, in my 4 years with the company I recieved 10 pay increases until I was making a liveable wage.  Take advantage of the stock buying plan and 401k as its free money.  Also, take advantage of tuition reimbursement.  For someone who can stick it out and make it work, the company will take care of its own."
good,"I enjoyed the crew at Best Buy, I'm still in contact with some of the members there. It just was't for me as far as the hours of work and the pay. The customers some of the time were extremely rude."
good,"After nearly 2 years of working at this company I've learnt a great deal, both in sales skills and learning how to overcome challenges as well as what it's truly like to work as a team and be driven by a great manager."
good,"The company is wonderful to work for, just don't mess up a single time or you will get terminated, even after 9 years on the job. The employees are fantastic though. Would recommend."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,It was an awesome place to work until the end. They should have relocated us but instead they let all 5 of us go and when I talk to the head guys there they say she was fired for firing us
good,"It was a great place to work, a lot of freedom to be your own leader in specialty locations as well as really understanding the business from the perspective of a business owner. I think the company did a poor job retaining quality talent when the decision to close speciality stand alone locations was announced. A lot of changes in the last year with no real efforts to helped people that dedicated a lot of their time to the company."
good,"Would have loved to stay after season ended, but working two jobs didn't allow that to happen. Work performance suffered because of that. The people were awesome to work with, benefits were awesome."
good,"Because bestbuy is so ""living by the values"" in order to really give yourself the best possible outcome you have really accept that the way you conduct yourself is not for yourself but rather your store and team and from there you see that bestbuy has so much to offer if are able to see the biggest picture."
good,"This is a great place to begin a sales career for undergrads. There are endless discounts on products and some decent perks. Management is good, however the salary is small."
good,"Good for seasonal work. Great discounts. Flexible work days,Stress free environment. Lots of opportunities to learn and work as a team. Management was good."
good,"The most enjoyable thing about working at best buy was there was always something new going on. I loved explaining the awesome features of the televisions and cameras. It was fun to interact and sell cool items to interested people. Plus, I had the opportunity to learn a great deal about new electronics and products."
good,Best buy was a fantastic place to work for. I was able to hone in on my skills as a sales representative and customer service agent. I got so into it that I would go home and do homework on what I was selling in order to provide a better understanding within the customers needs and wants with their purchase.
good,"One of the best work environments I have been involved with. I wish I could still work at this particular location. I also wish the scheduling for sales associates was better during my time as a sales associate, but I transferred to the warehouse to make ends meet."
good,"I believe working at Best Buy was the early stages of becoming an adult and the stepping stone to my advancement into the future. When transferred over to Pacific Sales, it was truly life changing. Reason being is that they shaped me into the young, responsible, mature adult i am today. They taught me many managerial skills, communication skills, and resolution tactics. It is a tough jobs, sometimes, because you are always having frustrated customers."
good,"I have liked my time at Geek Squad, however, my job is not related to Information Technology enough. I come to Indeed to seek a role with more IT related skillets required."
good,Best Buy was a good company to work for. There was one manager there that felt I couldn't do my job because I didn't know much about different areas in the store. He didn't like the fact that I would transfer a call to its rightful location for the customer to get the correct help. He wanted me to figure it out and answer the customer. With me doing what I was trained to do he had my hours cut to only 4 hours a week so I quit.
good,The company looks to always provide the best for their employees. They could do better about making sure employees are aware of these benefits. Work Life balance needs to be worked on across the board.
good,they really look out for their team. I enjoyed working there and being open to new opportunities. it was life changing and I will definitely be back. I left on great terms and The boss doesn't mind having me return.
good,Great experience and great people. Learned a ton of information and added to my overall experience . Loved working for the tech section of Best Buy. Overall awesome
good,Horrible management. Worked overtime every week for 6 months straight. Coming in in days off even without a question but management would rather be on their phones than work.
good,My experience was great until the work was fair and the pay was ok. Management while I was there was horrible but they are under new management now. The hardest part of the job was nothing really this job wasn't really hard. The work culture was good we had good coworkers all the employees had a great bond. The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting new people and not being confined to 1 particular place.
good,Lots of team work--family feel. They were great about scheduling hours around my college classes. They did not pressure me to drive to work in bad weather conditions either.
good,Overall a nice place to work. The environment is very accepting of someone with no sales background and it allows them to be trained at their pace. The management is willing to work with you to find out where you fit best.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Good job just poor management. No paid vacation and inwas top on credit aps and geek squad. No and they had good discounts on most stuff.  But they dont promote alot within and they have there favorites.  Real big on clicks it is worse then high school. The turn over on GM were huge there
good,"I loved upper management but the sales associates bullyied me. I loved the job and was very good at making my daily quota. I loved helping customers, they were the most rewarding part of the job."
good,best buy was a great introduction to customer service. the people were nice and the customers were hard to deal with. the benefits were the best i have ever had
good,"On a bright note, being in the Warehouse was nice since you avoided customers majority of the time. You simply sorted out all the items to be put out to the sales floor."
good,"The management at the store where I worked was terrible. Most employees are under paid. I would not go back to working there but would encourage young people to do work at Best Buy, it is a good experience to have on your resume."
good,"Everyone’s very friendly, if anyone didn’t know ho to do something there was always someone willing to help them out, it we really ast paced and you were rated on how fast you were and if you weren’t fat enough someone would always have to talk to you about it  ( I didn’t have to worry about hat )"
good,"Worked there for 20 years and enjoyed the atmosphere and really loved the people. The customers were great, and it was always a new challenge. If you like retail and sales, then Best Buy is the place to go."
good,A typical day at work involves constant interaction with customers. Developing quick relationships and interactions to allow customer to trust in your expertise to assist them in their desired products. Offering a wide selection of solutions coupled with the very best in Customer Service and Support.
good,I enjoyed working here although it’s hard to advance.  You have to know someone or you get passed up.  Awesome atmosphere and laid back management but competitive at the same time!
good,"Working for Best Buy is a relax part time job and easy all you have to do is receive, organized and displayed shipments an offer excellent customer service."
good,Being the best while having fun. Very busy during the holidays and also very fast paced.Helping customers with their needs and of course the discounts make working here great.
good,Only thing I disliked was that the warehouse was extremely small and also it wasn't organize. I cant tell you how many times I organize the warehouse and before you know it it would be messed up the next day. Everyone is for them self and don't care about the warehouse. BUT the warehouse team was good always made a effort to clean up and all. overall its a good job I just dont like that the hours werent steady they will always change and i would have to make adjustments to them.
good,Look I really like Best buy the only problem here is that everybody think they are some type of Supervisor its real funny. beside that I love the job for the seasonal time I was there it was great.
good,Very busy during Christmas season!!!  Fun people to work with.  Most customers were easy to deal with.   Drunks and thieves were a small problem. Some mid level managers like to cut corners which made it difficult for asset protection.
good,It is very hard to advance at Best buy especially if you are good on the sales floor. a lot of the managers want to keep you on the floor if you are really good at sales.
good,only been working here for a few weeks but it is definitely better than my previous job. Co workers are helpful and friendly and the vibe throughout the store is always good
good,"Working for best buy was a good experience, however I will never forget the orientation which the GM mentioned to never forget the #1 role was ""to make this company money""."
good,I enjoyed Best Buy and learned a lot about sales and customer support. I enjoyed the opportunity to sell electronics and to learn about many products. Unfortunately they closed the store in Victoria soon after i started there.
good,Although best but unlike futureshop did not have commissions. We were under no pressure to real sales quotas . But we had constant sales meetings and did push service plans. It was fun in college part time but advancement was nearly impossible so I left
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Learned a lot on the job, training was long but good. I would recommend working here. Easy to move up if you work hard and do your job. Geek Squad is fun."
good,Being able to engage with team members was the most rewarding.  Benefits package could have been a little more employee friendly.  Overall god company to work for.
good,Retail has been an experience that I was unfamiliar with in the beginning coming from a food and beverage and casino background I thought retell would be a pretty smooth operation but around the holidays and special promotions it tends to get a bit  over the top with consumers trying to get the best deal
good,Best buy is a job not a career they will talk about advancement but will keep you stangnant if you are making that department money. Over good stepping stone job
good,Being an intern at this location prepared me for future payed employment experiences. I was well organized and determined while completing tasks and working through problems.
good,It was a fun job to work at and great discounts with the job.  I loved the people that I worked with for the most part and the customers you delt with were easy going and friendly
good,Your typical day is helping people turn their computers on and off with the occasional brain teaser of an actual broken computer comes up and you have some fun.
good,"Ive learned many new things within the company. There are systems that are universal amongst companies in the retail system which allowed me put what I learned from University schooling into context. The operations and management sides of the company seem to be very separate at the store levels and makes it difficult to keep the two running smoothly. "
good,"it is a good company to begin your employment, the staff and leadership team were very encouraging and motivating. the motto of best buy was well represented with the staff and supervisors"
good,"Clocking in, being on time are essential. Being educated on every piece of new electronic in the store is also essential so we are able to sale product easier. Also able to educate customers."
good,"Best Buy is a great place to learn a fast paced truthful non commission based workplace. The management helps build you up into the best person that you can be in and out of the store, and are there to help you every step of the way."
good,I never had any problems with this job. The atmosphere there was amazing as well as management. Friendly environment and the managers were amazing to work with.
good,"i loved working at best buy, i learned a lot and got to work with so much tec. i ended up leaving sense after the holidays my hours dropped and they did not give me full time."
good,"The days were fast paced putting out tags changing prices, management was ok. The hardest parts were to prepare the shuttle and the training wasn't up to part. The environment of the store was a second family."
good,"Great leaders to help you settle in and get started. Not a lot of Downsides to working here by comparison to other retail jobs. Very professional management team, and friendly employees."
good,"In college or university? This is a great flexible job with lost of perks being an employee."
good,Managers really push you to do better and teach you how to do everything. Very good discount to reward yourself as well or get gifts for your family. Overall great place to work
good,"Very easy to get on with, unfortunate that it was a contract job. The people I met that actually work for apex were nothing less than stellar, everyone extremely friendly and helpful"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Typical day at Best Buy for me would say I watch the cameras making sure to keep the product safe. I also make sure the employees work safe. I have learned that not all places of employment have to be fast paced driven and overall bad moral. The management team is very outgoing people driven and very likely to work with the employees. I cant think of anything about this job that would be hard to do. Most enjoyable part of the job is providing customer service. Meeting new people.
good,"job is pretty easy, great with time off or days off requests. As you would with other jobs some people are lazy and you are forced to pick up their extra slack but is doesn't go un-noticed. overall pretty good gig."
good,"Working in sales at Best Buy was very interesting. The environment compared to other sales positions is extremely fast paced, the sales people were always fun to work with, no matter which department. Hardest part of the job was the constant changing of the job with being updated as fast as possible with new products. Most enjoyable part was definitely working with customers, felt very comfortable to speak to everyone."
good,"Great place to start out in, management is usually great depending on how their day is going. Great place to learn skills and build your self. Sometimes there isn't enough coverage."
good,Enjoyed working for the company in different positions. Compensation was the hardest factor in leaving as most positions are entry level or put strain on your body physically.
good,If you're not from MN then this isn't the place to work... very passive. There also isn't a lot of opportunity to grow because BBY isn't growing. Very good work life balance but being 24 I really don't need that when I don't have any family in the city.
good,"It was decent a place to work for, but I didn't like the scheduling/hours. My co-workers were fantastic. I probably would have been happier if I worked for geek-squad instead."
good,This company does not care about their employees. They don't care about their customers either. You don't need any training to work here. That is the sad part because you are tech support.
good,Even though I made a lot of sales but didn't make enough geek squad protection. My schedule was shorten then call in to cover shift cause of sell drop. Also the mandate On best buy credit card
good,"Beginning your day, such a strong positive atmosphere and the manager is above all the most charged individuel I have ever seen everyday. Best Buy Pride is about making them the best choice in customer service and knowledged experience sales people."
good,Have some of the most amazing people during my 14 year run there. Very open and positive environment.  They value your ideas there and encourage forward thinking
good,Best Buy is a great place if you want to move up in a company. Best Buy has great benefits and typically has very good supervisors. I do recommend Best Buy as a place to work.
good,I loved working here it was so much fun and never regretted getting out of bed to come into work. then there was this BOSS that just did not make work a place i was comfortable with going to anymore.
good,what a great place to work. what a wonderful place to work. I just loved going to work making less than what I deserve to harass people to get a BEst buy credit card.
good,"I worked here a year and loved my job. Once one employee got upset I was growing in the company and that peorson whom worked there for 6 plus years was upset that I kept exceeding in my career field and they were not. I ended up quiting due to it being hard since, I worked next to that person daily, and holidays were our busiest time of the year which made it even harder. Managment didn't due much, and I didn't want that person to get fired so I just took a leap of faith and went my own pay. "
good,Working here allowed me to meet some great people and advance my social skills. This is a great job for someone who enjoys electronics and new technology.
good,I love working with the mangers and employees. I recommend this place for anyone who is willing to apply for job. Love all the experience that i got from this work place.
good,"e-learning:"
good,It is at least better than Marshalls... That place was just completely unfair and made me miserable. Best Buy at least offers many benefits for their employees. They really do care... Unlike Marshalls.
good,The team was great and everyday was fun and enjoyable place to work. It was almost like a small community; everything was convenient.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,a typical day at best buy for me was working to load and unload trucks as they came in and caring out tv for comsters and lost pre i reall like working her it was a lot of fun
good,Was hired seasonal and when they wanted to make me permenant they couldn't due to a hiring freeze. The people I worked with were great and management always made you feel good.
good,I have learned a lot about working with computers and management. The ability to move up in the company is very hard. It is very difficult to go work through the holidays with this company.
good,good retail start for a career.  If you work hard the management will like you and develop your skills to win in the store.  It is different is every location.
good,"Best Buy is a great company with a huge demographic. In one day you can go from meeting a local client to meeting a person from 3000 miles away. You definitely have to be prepared to meet all types of people from all walks of life. Working at Best Buy will always keep you on top of the latest and greatest regarding consumer technologies. As a team, depending on who you are, you will be expected to learn new ways to solve customer need(s). The most difficult part of the job is being away from your family during the holidays, but on the other hand the most enjoyable is helping out that one customer that you know you have impacted so greatly that their life literally was changed by meeting you."
good,"It was good for a time, but once people stop coming in and business is slow, it's hard to find work to do, and management will send you home if you don't have work. The ridiculously small cups used for free popcorn was a nice perk."
good,"My last job at Jewel-Osco was okay, not a glamorous job, but a good one. I only messed up a few times during training, when bagging groceries and straighten them up, but after four months I got it."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at best buy, the managerial staff was wonderful, there were a few times there was room for advancement but personal life and other business endeavors got in the way."
good,"I was always exciting to launch the new items in electronics at that time.  The staff was helpful and friendly, a great place."
good,"My typical work day is helping customers find the right device for their life. I help them find cool accessories for their devices. I also sell them protection for their devices. I work with cell phones, computers, and gaming."
good,Great place to work with a lot of opportunity for advancement. Leadership at all levels are invested in their associates with genuine care. A lot of their time is spent on training and supporting associates to deliver a great experience to it's customers.
good,best job I ever had. I drove for them for 10 years. If you are committed- they take care of their employees. They treat you like family.
good,We typically sign in with our manager at the beginning of the shift. Throughout the day we handle the customers needs. The hardest part of the job is the people. You sometimes have the rudest people walk into the store thinking they can treat you however they feel like because you work at Best Buy. The best part would be the people you work with because they are in the trenches with you so they understand what we go through everyday.
good,I loved working for this company and there was great employee benefits and discounts. However the fact that the company hires minors put a damper on the work culture in my opinion.
good,It was great to work for but as time goes on retaiil jobs as a while end up limiting your abilities. I am looking for something more than retail which is why its great until you realize your talents and can start to make use of them.
good,"It was a great place to work, only thing i did not like about it was management made me believe that even tho i was seasonal i was going to continue but i did not and thet laid me off."
good,"Overall, I love my job at best buy. I have learned critical tools that I will be able to apply to any job or career I am a part of in the future. Through best buy I obtained invaluable skills in how to provide exceptional customer service which are useful in any job environment."
good,it was an interesting job hard work fast paste time went by fast learned a lot of new things from different people I associated myself with
good,"This is retail at its finest. all customers all the time. Down time meant learning or cleaning. when you were busy, you stayed busy. The management suffered because they were hired to manage, not to lead. that put some strain on me because if they couldnt relate to us how could do better instead of just telling us too then we all suffered. I mostly enjoyed the customer interaction. thats what i loved most. finding what people needed after they told you what they wanted was always a fun process."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Very exciting place to work! I was only in the stores of this organization, not on the corporate side. However store management was always easy to work with and kept even a low-paying hourly job exciting to come to work for."
good,"Great place to work. The management is understanding and willing to help all employees better their performance on the job. The training is reasonable not excessive, yet helpful. The training prepares you for the real experience. I've learned how to up sale and promote  beneficial features the company offers every consumer. The colleagues I had the chance to work with were nice and welcoming. Every one for the majority tried to keep the best positive attitude whether the customers were around or not. The best of the job was each pay period the employees get rewarded by the General Manager with pay day treats."
good,used my knowledge to help others understand products and buy a protection plan
good,"good job to have, enjoy coming to work because of personal interests."
good,"it was great"
good,"worked with great and excited employees, but home theater was not as energetic as most employees or managers. Communication wasn't all there with home theater manager unless there was customers that needed help other than that no personality. I was already experience with home theater, but was out dated on the new flat screens and was some what difficult.   though i manage to train my self wish there was more help with training on the floor than just sitting in front of the the computer doing e-learnings."
good,I would arrive to work and after clocking in I would start unloading the trailer. My manager was a very down to earth person and all my co-workers were helpful and friendly. The most enjoyable part was looking at all the new technology that came in.
good,I learned a lot about myself and the people in Vegas very quickly at this job.
good,it was ok the money wasn't much it was a good day  good company towork for
good,best buy is a very pretty easy job. its a lot of excitement when customers come in to make a purchase.
good,"Had a direct line, so checked my voice mail and e-mails asap.  Using tickler file made sure time sensitive documents were faxed or mailed by 10 am. Lead attorneys would assign new cases, notified the affected store managers, called Attorneys General and customers from new lawsuits, often ate lunch at desk, worked out Settlement Agreements with various parties,, contacted relevant departments within the company to put them on notice regarding new cases, counseled GMs making court appearances within a few days, answered questions from in house Consumer Resources call and letter centers, set up files for new cases, entered all data in computer. Learned better conflict resolution skills, corporate flow chart and which persons within the Company were most helpful, how to work my way around unhelpful people.  The most difficult part of the job in-house was making appropriate managers and VPs take responsibility when necessary and negotiate terms with me.   The biggest difficulty from the customers was abusive language and behavior. I once had an especially angry customer post my personal information online and encourage other people to write abusive comments.  It was often difficult to be the public face of a large corporation and to absorb the customers' general sense of blame and anger. The best part of the job was negotiating either a win-win, or when the company was obviously not at fault, getting the win for the company.  I enjoyed looking over my numbers at the end of each month and proudly realize how many thousands of dollars I had saved my client - Best Buy. My co-workers"
good,"fun place to work"
good,"I had a great time working at the job. Over my careers i learnt a lot about the business especially customer service, Logistics, technical aspects and how to improve the customer experience."
good,Loved learning and helping customers get what they want! I worked in all departments because of my bilingual skills
good,"Over 12 years of Experience in sales and marketing."
good,I been working at best buy since 2010. It is a fun enjoyable environment with Employees that care about their day to day job responsibilities.

good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I love working for the Geek Squad the culture is amazing. The job is extremely fast paced and multitasking is key to everything running smoothly. My co-workers are the most amazing group of people we work hard and play hard I have a nice balance of work and play at the geek squad this allows me to not be a total stress ball at work. I have learned allot while at Geek Squad. The hardest part of the job is not being able to make someone happy.
good,Everybody is so nice and helpful. Managers are always helping out with everything. Overall its a fun place where you will always be busy working on something.
good,Environment is good and fun place to work. Customers can be a bit aggressive but nothing crazy.
good,I feel like you need to experience this for yourself. its part of your own growth story
good,"I loved working here, I wish I was still working there. sadly we had to part ways but I still can say that this company is amazing."
good,"I worked here during H.S. I don't think I can fairly review that since it was quite a while ago, but it was a good job to have during that time."
good,A day at Best Buy was typically helping customers with checking out. It was awesome around the holidays nut really busy.
good,"I have had many great years at Best Buy. Some of the best times of my life are because of it. If you are going to work retail, this is the place to work! I'm not the biggest fan of retail hours. It's very difficult to coordinate spending time with family and friends who are all off on the two most important days for you to work. Benefits are pretty solid once you get FT, and if you become a store GM, you get CRAZY stock options and additional benefits. I feel though that for what is expected, there should be a bit better hourly wages. However that is not a deal breaker."
good,Good company to work for but you get no life. Pay is pretty good once you reach supervisor
good,"This was the best place i have worked it's not boring, or too hard/easy i worked during christmas season so i got all the holiday rush but i would go back witht the chance."
good,"	Responsible for the direct supervision of a team of Geek Squad Agents, Customer Service Agents and Automotive Installation Technicians including training, delivering feedback and Performance Development reviews, and maintaining morale"
good,"the stuff was amazing, everything was easy to do."
good,helpful good people learn about new things .being there on time makeing every one happy . haveing a smile doing my job before i was told
good,Best buy is a great company to invest time into. they are highly focused on employee training and customer satisfaction. Management  trains each employee and helps encourage them to strive for better. Each customer is treated with care and they do their best to get what the customer needs however possible. the most enjoyable part of the job would definitely be the customers satisfaction and teaching them new things about the product they are wanting to buy. Best Buy is a fun and exciting place to work.
good,Very High Energetic Atmosphere Which Is Both Fun And Exciting
good,"I did't mind working in food, but I didn't see a career there."
good,"My short run at Best Buy was great. I wish I could have stayed longer, but they didn't keep any of the seasonals."
good,had a wonderful work experience dealing with all sorts of different customers
good,When I worked at Best Buy everyone loved coming to work and had fun while we were there. The whole store got along as a unit and we were all very profitable. Since the major changes Best Buy has had over the years the employees aren't as friendly and happy as they used to be and the store doesn't run as a well oiled machine anymore.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,great team work
good,"I loved working there, got treated with respect, they worked around my schedule."
good,"Fun place to work, but was only a part time job while I was in school and now that I'm not I need something full time with hopefully better pay, benefits, and not so many weekends and holidays that retail work entails."
good,I served as a double agent. Decent salary depending on the city you are in
good,Good place to work but needs to go back to its roots. Seems like Best Buy has lost the Geek Squad culture I used to be proud to be called a Geek Squad Agent now not so much anymore.
good,"Great co workers, fun atmosphere, fantasitc policies. My favorite place to shop."
good,"- help customers, keep work station clean, cash handling, price checks, product inquirers"
good,"a typical day at work is helping customers find the perfect electionic for their needs. i learned alot about TVs and Computers, managers were always on the floor getting the job done with the co-workers, the most enjoyable part is the personal connection."
good,"Unfortunately, a very hight turn around for its business. The Management staff are very uplifting. They seem to be number driven but at the same time very productive and you can learn alot."
good,"Typical day begins with setting out cash drawers for the entire store, then collecting all reports from the previous day and inputting data into the system for review. Then getting with employees and management for sales and credit application goals for the day, as well as any changes to products or services that are rolling out. Training and development of quality cashiers was a main responsibility."
good,While working at BestBuy a Typical day for me was rather busy because of the high demand for just about any and every technology equipment there was never a slow moment. While working at Bestbuy I learned a lot about high and demand products and how to handle and deal with the variety of personalities within customers. My most part of working at Bestbuy were the returning customers and how they entered my particular location specifically looking for me.
good,"Managing the daily business of several sales department's was my main responsibility at work. This included all areas from merchandising and scheludling to coaching/training and driving great sales results. The company had taught me alot throughout my career there, I learned how to better understand all areas of the business and how to lead/manage a team. I loved the management and all the people I worked with. The hardest part of the job was finding enough time to get everything done in a day. The best part of the job was playing with electronics, the customers and being a part of a great team."
good,Very fun when meeting new people and all of my co-workers were in good moods. The managers were awesome as well.
good,a typical day in the geek squad department fills many types of jobs ranging from troubleshooting at the desk over the phone or working on computers in the back whether it be virus wipes to updates and driver downloads. also instalations

good,Working at Best Buy was hard but rewarding work. The management that I started with was great. Very easy and relaxed work environment. Very Team oriented.
good,Best place I have worked at to date. Made lots of friends through working with Best Buy and got the opportunity to grow with the company. From working with the company I got the chance to learn new skills that I can use for other jobs.

good,"If you are looking for a quick paced, competitive environment with room for advancement while serving the public Best Buy is a great place.  Co-workers make the place really enjoyable."
good,"If you are looking for a basic job, Best Buy has everything you can offer. From Retail Sales to Geek Sqaud, Inventory and Assest Protectiong, they have a job for pretty much anyone. However, it is still a retail environment, so expect the same pros and cons that come with any customer-facing jobs."
good,Fantastic comany to assist customers with their everyday electronic needs and find the best solution for their lives and business to maintain retention and 100% customer satisfaction.
good,It was a pretty fun time there. I enjoyed my time talking about various products in the tech world and the gaming world. It was a ton of fun talking about all upcoming consoles and games as well as current ones.
good,Great GM and some great staff members. Overall an incredible company to work for. Had a great team around me in the 2 years I worked there. Had an incredible supervisor in the HT department.
good,"As many people know, working in retail can be a pain. At Best Buy it’s a very rewarding and fast paced environment which focuses solely on customers needs first. There is a little pressure at times but it’s important to remember to think about tomorrow. All of the possibilities are there and if you really put forth your best effort every day it does make a difference. I do have to say that I have never been more impressed with a company’s atmosphere and attention to customer experience. I loved working here."
good,"Provide personalized service to clients about various distinct mobile products and services "
good,On a store level it is hard to feel heard even if you go to a corporate rep. But he benefits and the coworkers are great and there’s lots of opportunity.
good,Best Buy is a fast paced retail for electronics and technology. Adequate staffing for busy periods. Staff are knowledgeable about the products and services offered. The minimal schedule requirements were difficult to comply due to additional job. I could not meet the minimal attendance.
good,It's a good environment to work and explore your passion for technology. You determine how great you can be with your hard work and progress. If you show initiative to learn and grow you'll go as far as you want.
good,Fast pace sales environment team work focused customer engagement driven atmosphere centered around customer needs and education. A tech experience each time you engage a customer creating a must return life style shopping experience.

good,Work is very fun and management can be your friends. The culture is focused on everyone having fun. The job is also a great way to learn and practice your sales skills.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"A conventional day at Best Buy (from a Sales Consultant perspective) consisted of first checking in with your manager or supervisor to converse about store, department, and individual sales goals for the day. Ideally, specific and actionable instruction was provided by store leadership on how to properly (i.e. aligned with company values) reach these goals. Once that was established, you perform solution - based selling with customers within your respective department (often times you must help other departments due to insufficient staffing) for the majority of your shift. Upon the conclusion of your shift, available store leadership will give you an update on store, department, and individual performance."
good,Best buy helped open up a lot of new doors for me. I was able to gain new knowledge from my leaders and my fellow team members. I was able to learn a lot about myself and the company.
good,"At my store,  it is really diverse as far as race and nationality, and being able to express ourselves as far as jewelry, not having to hide our tattoos, colored hair, and wearing cute pins on our shirts and crazy socks. Everyone has fun while being the best."
good,Organizing was always the goal of the store and if your numbers were holding up with other numbers in your area or for the in and out goals of your location. It was a great challenge and was made fun in most cases but tough work.
good,"Difficult trying to get hours that did not conflict with school so I had to leave, would recommend to anyone as a source of income but not as a career"
good,Had a good time while working at best buy. I worked during the holiday season and got a lot of hours and money in a short amount of time. My manager was cool and had flexible schedules which helped with school
good,"Great place to work at. Managers were great, not forced into overselling products that customers won't enjoy. Get to learn allot about the products in your department that didn't even know about."
good,best buy was and is a good first job to have. it was near the beginning of when i started working. It was cool to be around technology all the time and have nice co workers.
good,For Retail...Not a bad place to work.  You WILL be kept up on what is going on in the Electronic world !  I guess that is a good thing !  Hardest part of job is things are always changing.  I guess that is a good thing also I guess...
good,"The company as a whole is great, making great strides to be inclusive and caring. Added PTO and child care benefits for part timers to take advantage of. Not a lot of opportunity to move up unless you’d like to relocate. Depending on whether or not your management is caring, schedule can be flexible."
good,Had a great time working with people who all were on the same mission to have a good time while serving customers. Great experiences to speak to different people each and every days and help them with tech decisions for every occasion.
good,"I loved working at Best Buy. I had fantastic managers and I know that that is half of the reason I has such a good experience. The warehouse is a busy and stressful department to work in. It's our job to make sure the store is ready for the sales floor to sell products. The standard is high and we get audited all the time. One downside is there is little groups that form in each department, each department thinking they are better than the others. But over all it is a fun place to work."
good,Working in retail you would never know what to expect. this job taught me many different things about people. Interacting with different people made the job worth going to.
good,Its a great place to work only problem is that if you are seasonal trying to move within the company it takes weeks to find out basic information to a pint where you are probably better off looking elsewhere. The management at my store were extremely nice and stood up for their employees but they lack the ability to keep up on applications and go on constant vacations with things still hanging in the air.
good,Great  place to work!!! Learned leadership and management skills. Great environment. Started out as a seasonal hire and worked my way up the ladder into leadership.
good,"Best Buy is one of those places that you hope to stay with.  You can transfer to different stores keeping opportunities open for advancement.  Benefits are above average.  The actual work is fair, but at times challenging."
good,"I enjoyed working for Best Buy. It was a good overall experience. It's a lot like anywhere else, though - you're going to have good managers and bad. You just have to roll with the punches."
good,I was an employee at best buy for about 7 years total. The environment was good and the pay was amazing. I became a GM and i was easily making $6k-$7k monthly. Great job for advancement up to a point. I didn't know the right people to get a district job even though my number were unmatched. The discount is crazy and will make you want to stay there. Second best job i have ever had.
good,Very Customer Service Oriented the definition of service with a smile. Assisting customers with returns question about products and warranties all with a smile!!!
good,"I spent 7 years with the company and enjoyed it very much. Being in leadership the skills I learned from the company were valuable and set me up for a successful career inside"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Working at best buy was great because they communicated well. Everyone from the top of management to the newest person was taught to communicate well and it made everyone easier to work with because you didn't have to find stuff out on your own you could feel free to just ask.
good,"Fun laid back, people are easy to get along with. Managers do fun things for us outside of work. Starting pay pf $11 no required experienced ive been here for 4 years only leaving because I graduated college which they have helped tremedously for being sooooo flexible."
good,Best Buy does an amazing job with treating it's employees right. They train you to be experts in your field while making it a fun environment to be in.
good,"Learning all codes and procedures to assist officers in the field & phone calls when necessary."
good,"typical retail position, educated on electronics, managment was great. workplace culture was great. Hardest part of the job, was managing school schedule and work schedule. most enjoyable part of the job was black friday preparation."
good,it was fun a learning experience but the only thing i don't like it that the worker that give it all they got don't get notting no pay raise no good job the worker that are super friend with management are the one that get it all.
good,"My position in Parts Procurement was alongside 8-10 other team members, although we were situated in a warehouse full of technicians, other administrative teams, and order pickers. A typical day had us sitting at a desk with 2+ monitors, completing ""work orders"" by ordering the appropriate part from the appropriate vendor. We, as a team, could complete over 1,000+ work orders daily. I quickly become proficient with the Word, Excel, and Outlook programs through Microsoft, as well as learning 2 computer systems, and various ""wizards"" in which we used to order parts. Our management system with in tiers, with a team leaders who were more hands-on with any questions, approvals. We then had a Manager whom was above the team leaders, and whom would conduct the bi-weekly meetings. The workplace culture was a calm, welcoming, and happy environment. The hardest part of the job would be sitting at a desk for 5+ hours day, I would have liked to see sit-stand desks. The most enjoyable part of the job was my team, sitting with them and being able to create friendships while accomplishing our daily tasks. The most impressive part was the efficiency in which any problem, question, computer error, or general inquiry was taken care of. The only reason I did not star at this job was because I was hired on a contract basis, and when my contract was near finishing, the administrative budget did not allow for a full-time permanent position."
good,"Overall my experience was pretty good , If I could have gotten FT hours I would have remained with the company. The managers let you do your job, and assisted if you had questions"
good,"Best Buy was a great work environment I loved the people and the atmosphere one of the best places I have ever worked in.  Lots of  work always busy and dealing with customers face to face. Best Buy has a great process that helps standardize their technician's. Not much I could say is bad about the company, there benefits could use some work and pay but over all was a great place to work for."
good,"Great for students looking to learn about sales and customer service. Management will help you find your interest and career path, build confidence and learn how to read sales reports."
good,not going back. Only fun to work there because of the employee discount and if you like your coworkers.  There's no commission but you are held to sales minimums or you can get laid off.
good,One of the best jobs and team of managers I've ever worked for! We worked as a team to grow one of the top stores in our district. Lots of knowledge and a fun laid back work environment.
good,The managers were great. They were very helpful to teaching us the best ways to go about doing things. The job itself was so fun too. My favorite job.
good,easily the best work environment I've been in. i enjoyed going into work every day. the opportunities for advancement weren't the best but management tries its best to fit your needs otherwise
good,"I liked working here for the holidays. It was fast paced, but relaxed at the same time. The manager would hire other managers because he knew them, even though they weren't experienced. This was the only problem I saw here. I liked helping customers find things and recommending stuff for them. I also enjoyed unloading trucks and putting stuff away, because I got the physical part of the job and mental by interacting with customers."
good,"I was lucky and got to experience several opportunities while I was employed with the company. I got to volunteer in summer camp for kids, participate in Geek Squad Academy, and go to various appliance conventions. Overall the environment was great. "
good,"Working at Best Buy is a good intro to the work environment. My typical days involved changing tags, stocking items, and making product look presentable. The work environment was very casual, but there was a lot of downtime after the initial 3 or 4 hours of the shift."
good,"I have worked at Best Buy for almost 2 years and let me say, it is a fantastic job. The management is fantastic, the employees are great, and I have made many great memories being apart of the Best Buy family. Sadly, being a person that always has to be changing or ""growing"", I am quite burnt out of working there; thus, I believe it's time to find a new job. Don't get me wrong, it is a FANTASTIC job. The discount is amazing and the fact that they are so selective about who they hire (at least at my location) makes for a fantastic team. Customers are typically nice and it's always neat to be around so much new technology. I recommend it to anybody looking for a clean, safe, and relaxed environment."
good,It's a fun place to work. Not really a place to make a living unless you're in a management position. Typical days include multiple sales and a few breaks.
good,If you want to have a job that is competitive go to Best Buy. It can be hard during the holidays but working at Best Buy can teach you lots about your self and how you can be better.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"The most enjoyable apart of the job was the independence given, when assisting customers. The training was excellent as well and helpful for all of us."
good,"Great management, fun work environment, low sales floor salary cap, advancement needs go seem as a possibility not a long shot. Good overall place to work."
good,"Fue muy grato trabajar ahí. Son flexibles,"
good,"Strong upper-tier leadership, strong company overall.  Highly political, and it was extremely necessary to build strong relationships and create consensus prior to getting anything moved forward.  On the whole, very good people."
good,Probably the funniest thing that they had in there was the break room. I felt like it was a place when everyone could get together and have a good time if they wanted too.
good,"Best Buy was and over all great job, but it was not something i had plans on making a career out of. Best-buy was a great job to help support me through college."
good,There were team building activities every month. The staff meeting they developed games to have us participate. We would have a night where we would close down the entire store and have game night. I would ring up customers help and informed them about the Geek Squad Black Protection Plan.
good,"Arrived early in the morning to stock shelves and check prices. The management team was well organized and well put together. The culture there was pretty good, there were some times where employees seemed a little down and depressed."
good,"Super fun job and enjoyed the people i worked with, also the discounts are amazing especially if you become a brand expert such as sony or samsung. If the pay was better i would have stayed in a heart beat."
good,"Fantastic environment to work in, great teamwork, great training, and coaching, relaxing and enjoyable. I recommend employment to friends and family. Y"
good,Best Buy is a job you go to if you’re looking to truely become an expert on products and sell to customers. They give you all the knowledge you need to be the best at your job and let you be and do things in your own creative way.
good,"Best Buy becomes a family, although it will take more from you if you don't have a good balance. I loved my time here, the team we had acquired, and some of my best friends were made at this company."
good,"The people are great, especially the ones your working with. HR is great too even if you need someone to lend an ear. The major downside of being part time is the lack of lunch periods. In my experience many shifts were either too busy for me to take one or too short and one was not entitled."
good,"The pay is good but its sort of competitive, you have to learn products to be able to sell and complete your task, other than that is great for other people not so much for me because you really have to have certain products in order to tell customers about it or you have to google it. pretty much everyone working there knows the products and has been here for a while. there nice i guess, it wasn't a good fit for me because the products and im better in retail but that shouldnt stop you, you might like it."
good,"Work atmosphere was really good, teammates were very helpful. The company had training links to get a better understanding of the products sold at the store."
good,"Job was fast paced and fun, Employees are fun and professional. Room for advancement, good benefits, the staff really makes sure you've got it down before you start working."
good,While I was working at this company I learned so much about technology. Which it has proved to help me in future projects. Now I know what I need to look for when it comes to technology !
good,"If you're younger and looking to get into retail management or retail sales; this is definitely a great place to start. It is pretty easy to get hired on, and the work is never TOO crazy. Growth is there if you stick to it and keep looking for opportunities to exceed."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,informative and an eye opening experience. learned plenty there are definitely room for several improvement but one must accept the realities in working a large retail environment
good,"CEO is great "
good,"Great company to work for,"
good,very laid back and structured very well. lots of support when new.very welcoming. hardest part about working at bestbuy was always doing extended hour while going to school.
good,Best Buy was a good experience work wise and leaning wise but when it came to working with other it was like being in High School all over again. That's the part that killed the environment for me.
good,My job consisted of answering inbound calls and assisting with store pickups.  The management team was fantastic and always took your side when you made a decision when helping a customer and didn't over rule your choices.  There was however very little room for advancement as all the full time jobs were taken by the best buy employee for life.   Hardest part of the job was having to lift heavy items.   The most enjoyable part was when we would always for store contests as I usually would win.
good,"I truly enjoyed working at Best Buy. The employees really cared about each other and it was a very positive environment to work in. The pay was pretty great, considering me being a full-time college student."
good,"Great place to work, always feel like I can share my opinions with my managers. Does not overwork the staff but makes sure everyone is taken care of and cares about the challenges in our lives."
good,I liked working at Best Buy because of the quick-paced flow that Best Buy offers. There's lots to do no standing around. there's always management around to move you where needed when needed. i've learned alot about shipping & recieving.
good,There are no benefits and I made over 2 million dollars for the business while making 8 dollars an hour. There wasn't a opportunity of advancement. After giving my 2 weeks notice for my new position the GM fired me on the spot.
good,I did genuinely enjoy working here but i could not get the hours necessary to continue paying bills. The management teams at best buy are great and are always there when you need them but don't have control over the hours the store is allocated and there wasnt much they could do.
good,"There is not much advancement for entry level with no experience within the first year. The management is amazing. They will teach you all the skills you need to know, and they help you move up even if that means working for another store. They like to help you move forward; it is hard with very little management to move up."
good,"Customer Service Representative who maintains a high level of professionalism, patience and efficiency to minimize customer dissatisfaction and increase customer loyalty. Call Center Representative versed in customer support in high call volume environments. Superior computer skills and telephone etiquette."
good,it was an in between job thats mainly for kids or those that just want a job just to have one.  the pay sucks but what do you expect for a part time/seasonal job
good,"You will work in a cross-functional team comprised of other Product Managers, developers, QA and UX colleagues. Additionally, you will need to partner with other people from various departments to complete features."
good,"Good place to work but pay could be better, no complaints about management.  It is a good place to work but just wish they paid more but that goes for a lot of places nowadays."
good,I am senior software engineer .net developer with 6 years of experience.i have learnt so many technology while Workin g with best buy.Includes MSMQ.it was fun to learn the new technologies which I haven't work previously.
good,"A great place to work. The people are friendly, it is a retail job with customer service. The hours are both nights week ends and days. the staff is friendly and hard working."
good,"Until my job was outsourced, this has been an incredible place to work for the last 17 years!  From an ability to advance at a young age, to development to being the leader I am today, I owe that to BBY."
good,Hired as Loss Prevention. There is no loss prevention at Best Buy distribution center. They don't want to know who is stealing. But the security guards are made to do all type of dumb stuff.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Covert Geek Squad is a great place to work and provides excellent opportunities being able to be remote and work from home. It does require an open time commitment as the service is 24/7 so you must be willing to work all hours of the day.
good,"upper management could use some work, their level of engagement is not there. The work space over is good, but there is no work life balance, people need"
good,"If you're looking for a good part-time job, Best Buy in Kalispell is one of the best places to work. The manager is wonderful to work for, and the team really meshes well."
good,"Geek Squad gives you really good experience with client-facing computer repair. The management, at least at my store, is very hands-off and they let you do your thing because you are expected to be an expert. The freedom you have at Geek Squad is unlike any else in a retail environment. It can get stressful when you have angry client though, so be prepared to deal with that."
good,"Geek squad was great place to work for anyone that loves technology and computers . You don't handle the extreme . But you will definetly play your part. Management isn't all that great but it's also that way at a lot of places .. Mostly brain work so be prepared to think ..  This job was fun very informative , and most of easy"
good,"Although it can be very stressful meeting constant goals in multiple areas at once, best buy is a very challenging but beneficial environment which builds leaders geared to success."
good,Great place to work if you want to keep a social life outside of work. Ive learned superior customer service skills that will allow me to succeed in areas where others falter ( ie; losing temper;being rude to customers)
good,I worked at the Bestbuy in Orange ct horrible management staff they are all like little kids there. The time I was working there all the managers talk to the employees how ever they want basically it's like slavery there
good,Great place to work was extremely fun however hours were barely livable when working part time and no full time was available to take. Would of love to keep working there if they had hours to take.
good,In inventory you bring in new products and track down the products that the system says are on hand. This was sometimes a challenging task as finding it involved locating the digital trail and necessarily the item itself.
good,"Great Company to work for, people are very helpful. All of the term with this company I learned something new every day. met great people while working on the field with the Geek Squad."
good,Team very bonded and worked well with each other. Management trained alot and the team was awesome.  Loved how engaged we always had to be with customers.
good,High energy. Good place to meet people and give a great customer experience! Managers are very encouraging and always helping you to do better. Hours are kind of sporadic.
good,"Working  at best buy was very exciting, enjoyable, and very educational. I helped open that store from ground up. "
good,A great place to work if you're not too concerned with compensation. You meet a lot of interesting people and form friendships with almost everyone. You get paid to basically learn and interact with the latest technology.
good,"Friendly environment. Awesome people to work with. Open an explain every thing. Awesome managers.  Great skills, learned many,things while working there."
good,It was a very fun retail environment that offered opportunity to learn about many different products and departments within the large retail store. Strong sense of teamwork and one common goal without pressure of commissioned sales quotas.
good,I received proper training as an entry-level sales associate. I took the position of computer sales with little knowledge in the services and products offered by Best Buy. Fellow employees and managers were helpful to my success as a sales employee.
good,It was a great work environment just as long as you did not have the people that tired to make your job harder than what it was because then that wouldn't be right.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"moving up can be difficult but coworkers tend to make up for it "
good,I actually enjoyed working at best buy sometimes the only reason i came to work was for the customers because sometimes managment was terrible or security was bad too because we always had people stealing video games cds sometimes even phones they didnt always get caught but they should have gotten caught. But i loved working there its just if some of the managers wasnt so dull and up tight and hours where better some people would have stayed longer
good,"Have fun while being the best! Amazing culture, I've enjoyed these past 3 years I've been with the company.  Sometimes customers can be rude, but it is retail and you learn to deal with those that have bad attitudes!"
good,"mes gérants sont très compressives par rapport a l’école, "
good,"This was a great when it was around. The store in my location closed last year, but it was a great first job. It was so good to me that I stayed for 10 years."
good,Learned a lot at this company! Great management and great team atmosphere! Everything I learned working here has helped me become the professional I am today!
good,"Loved working there, always an open door policy and great management. Plenty of room for advancement or the ability to move positions around the store to get more hands on experience."
good,never a dull day goes by. you are always busy with the customer traffic coming through. managers are great and staff everyone have fun while being friendly.
good,"I loved working for best Buy. High energy, room for advancement and learned a lot about management and sales. Would still be workiknivng there if job position was eliminated."
good,"As a Floating Cadet, I would arrive at primary location by 8am."
good,"I helped customers find products that suited their computing preferences, recommending accessories and protection plans relevant to their need. It was a decent first job."
good,"The team I worked with were all wonderful people and we all had fun while still making sure we took care of customers. My job was very straight forward and I knew what was expected of me, as well as getting recognition for the tasks I accomplished."
good,Each day was exciting being in the field with Geek Squad.  Loved going to a new home each day and helping end users with their technology.  Co workers were great to work with.
good,Pay was not much but this was by far the best work environment I was ever apart of. Hours are limited as Best Buy in general is downsizing but it was a lot of fun
good,"You will develop the way of the jedi working with this retailer. Patience is very important, so you can achieve better sale tactics and constant goal reminders. Overall, a great place to develop rudimentary skills needed for future endeavor."
good,"Good job, great employees to work with. Management is great. Day goes by quick. I enjoyed working in cellular phones and giving  customers an overview of their choices for plans and advising them on recommendations."
good,Having fun while being the best! My favorite job I've had my co workers were awesome and it was always fun learning about new gadgets and technology. We always had awesome trainings to learn new things!
good,"A fun place to work.  I worked in the Mobile department which was the BEST place in the store! It was fast paced, the product changed constantly with multiple carriers."
good,Its a good team environment. Its flexible with other things that are going on in your life. Nice benefits to g along with.
good,Depending on what field you go in work can be a blast. If you're good with a certain electronic device or devices work can be a fun place. You get hands on training and you will have room for advancement.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"le nouveau qui a monté le plus rapidement dans l'équipe des nouvelles recrues."
good,Geek Squad has been a fun and enjoyable place to work while in school with flexible scheduling and opportunity for advancement. I would highly recommend this job to someone who is looking to get knowledge and support to proceed to continue in a career in Information Technology.
good,"Over the past 16 years I have been working for Best Buy and am grateful for everything it has offered me.  I learned how to communicate better with employees and customers on a day to day basis.  The culture at Best Buy is very strong and welcoming to all different kinds of people.  I enjoy the people that work around and with me.  The hardest part of the job is when the systems do not allow you to fulfill the customer promises.  I enjoy teaching people about technology and how it can make life easier/funner."
good,"Amazing company with great benefits. Focused on the employee experience while delivering results. Easy to advance based on your personal performance and work ethic,"
good,"Extremely fun to work at, constantly learning new things about products. Very competitive as far as sales and meeting quotas for the month."
good,"Working at Best Buy is not a super demanding experience, but does help one grow and mature in both work life and social life. The management is nice and friendly, but will help push you to be the best that you can be. You will make a lot of good friends and learn a lot of people skills that are crucial to every aspect of one's life. I am truly grateful for my time at Best Buy because it made me a better worker and a better person."
good,"Great company to work for the pay is a bit on the low side, The benefits are very good, and the work environment are great. Non-commissioned based sales let you take care of each customer without being pushy"
good,No chance for a real beak without hurting your numbers as since you are clocked in they count it. The culture was perfect/
good,Its a great place to work. everyone is nice but things can be more organized as far as schedules. Overall it has been a good experience.
good,I really enjoyed working at Best Buy because it was my first job out of high school and my managers were like my mentors. They were really helpful and didn't treat me any different because of my young age. They taught me how to be professional not only with speaking to customers but also with co workers.
good,"Best Buy offers a wide array of benefits for full and part time workers. Employees get to work with the newest technologies and electronics available for purchase. And the discount you receive is the best around. "
good,Fun and fast paced environment.  Knowledgeable staff. Mangement is easy to communicate with and co workers a like.  Tools to help you build and grow.
good,its a good place to work if your interested in electronics and home appliances. i would recommend to the nerd who loves to work with mobile phones and devices. also if your great at customer services and sales then this is the place for you.
good,"A typical day at Best Buy is a slow paced and fast paced environment at times. I learned that I have to always be on point and ready to give knowledge to any customer at anytime because people love to know that they can come right in and recieve the answers they need. Hardest part of the job was multitasking, but I always managed to get the job done for the day. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay and the atmosphere period."
good,The shift would normally start with a meet and greet before the store opens.  The managers usually gave us a brief explanation on what the store needed to make in order to hit budget.  After the meeting employees are then sent to there designated departments.  We focus on selling and helping customers.
good,I would come in and get print out of all items needed to be move to new displays and need price changes done. This position is called Merchandiser. It requires me to think quick and make all changes as swift as possible. My job consist of rearranging all product in store each week to the specifications of the weekly specials advertised in newspapers and promotional magazines. This happens during the early morning hours of 3 a.m. and on. It is done every Sunday morning before store opens. Then we continue with price changing throughout the day. We also interact with customers daily. If a customer needs assistance a you're the only one available you must preform the best quality service to insure the customer has a great experience in store.
good,A great experience throughout my 10 year career. Great culture that revolves around employee development and world class customer experiences.
good,It was great to work in a casual sales position and use my knowledge of computers. The workplace was safe and the co workers were nice. Management could be better.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,a typical day here is coming into work making sure your area is clean and neat before the store is open. making sure shelves are organized
good,"I have worked at Best Buy for over 11 years, I love the team I work with but in the recently the culture and management has all gone down hill"
good,"I enjoyed working for Best Buy.  The culture of the company promoted a drive to learn all about the products that were sold by the stores.  The on the job training was awesome, and management support was always there and encouraging."
good,Depending on your store it can be a step above average retail. Management doesn't always think outside the box in terms of hiring. They can sometimes be to strict about previous retail experience when considering applicants.
good,I am in love with this job. I love the culture. Being in the company is something that has changed my life for the better. I am looking to make this job a career.
good,Best Buy is a great company! They are motivating and provide a great environment. If you like technology it is a wonderland.
good,"At Best Buy Mobile the job was really great for the first couple years. The higher that you progress the more sales oriented your job becomes despite being ""non-commission"". Not a lot of room for growth."
good,I've learned to be patient while explaining the policies to a customer as a solutions specialist. This job had a great work environment where I felt comfortable enough to communicate everything with my manager.
good,"The work place is constantly changing making it challenging to present the clients with the best solutions. I enjoyed making friends with my fellow employees as well as some of my clients,"
good,"Fun and fast work place, Lots of employees to help the traffic of customers. Management is very helpful and understanding. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing a customer walk out the store with a smile on their face because they received all the help they needed."
good,"I have never had a working experience where I enjoyed coming in to work everyday and conversing with guests sharing the love of the products I was selling. They teach you a different way of working with consumers, to shy away from the ""jump in your face"" salesman. "
good,Fun workplace with supportive management. Had fun conversing with customers and being apart of the Best Buy. Can be a very fast paced atmosphere at times but was still organized.
good,"I started out as a seasonal warehouse associate, and through hard work was kept on as permanent employee. Everyone there including the managers were fun to work for. They were strict, but relaxed which made for an amazing environment to work in. The employee discount was great, but after I left it changed still good just not as good as it was, I enjoyed going to work there, and was surprised when I discovered that they do a lot of work in the community at least every weekend if not every other weekend. They offered a management training program if you wanted to get into management with the company. After a few months with them a position opened in their Geek Squad Auto Tech department installing and selling car electronics like radios or remote starts. It was something I wanted to do there as I enjoy doing that kind of work outside of work for friends and family. Sadly though I needed a full-time position which they did not have at the time so  I left on good terms. If they would have had a position available I would have stayed on with them."
good,"Productive"
good,"responsible for accomplishing a wide variety of tasks, particularly auditing and inspection. Employee audits are routinely performed and suspicious activity is investigated. Store audits are conducted to isolate problem zones or procedural flaws. Inventory audits are performed to detect stock shortages. Access points, buildings and equipment are frequently inspected to evaluate potential security risks."
good,"People were fun to work with here, learned a lot about sales here and it was fun during the day for the most part, The trucks were probably the hardest part about the job but it was enough people to help out so it wasn't that bad"
good,"Growth potential is there if you work diligently. Hardest part of the job is the client getting frustrated with you when you are trying to do the right thing for them, and they claim to know more than you do in your field."
good,"Loved my job, but as they say all good things may come to an end. Huge job cut lead to the loss of my position I was due to get, and the morale in my store has been gone ever since."
good,"Great people to work with, number 1 in all there products, they understand it as well, I learned so much working there the short time I did."
good,a typical day would be very busy especially during the holiday season the management was very helpful my co-workers were like family the hardest part sometime it can get overwhelming and the enjoyable part is interacting with my customers.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy was my most successful job. I went from part time, to full time, to department leader, then to Sales Supervisor, all within a time period of two years. My only complaint about the job was the frequent management and staff changes. I find it difficult to evolve and create a healthy and successful work environment and culture when your leadership team is constantly changing. Besides that, it was the best job that I've ever had."
good,working with customers over the phone and in person on customer orders. handle customer issues and make sure the customer gets taken care of and they keep shopping with us.
good,A typical day at work is very productive. I've learned the store and what to do on the daily basis. The management is pretty good at times. The co-workers are pretty cool at times I don't speak much so I'm the less social co-worker who's quick to speak to a customer and help them. I speak when it matters the most. The most enjoyable part of the job is when everyone gets there tasks done on time.
good,"A typical day at Best Buy was coming in, checking in and make sure everything in terms of numbers and such was up to date and greet our manager and supervisor for the day before heading out to the sales floor to engage the customers and assist them with sales and help them make their decisions. I learned what it is like to deal with customers face to face and create that personal relationship with them so that they would always come back in the future to shop with us there. The hardest part of the job was when the store traffic would be very slow and there weren't many customers, but other than that, I had the most excellent co-workers and supervisors anyone could ask for and always wanted to lend a hand if the need be."
good,"I really love best buy, like any job it has its moments I've gained so much knowledge and experience as well as learning how to communicate and getting out my bubble. Best Buy is a learning experince as well as a good stepping stone for job."
good,Learned a lot of new technical technology.  Upper management were ok.  Store manager was great. Assistant manger was really micro managing. coworkers were awesome.  The hardest part was the new installment billing and the store would offer the phones for $.01 and then get upset when a customer would not do installment billing.
good,"It requires sales, and technical skills to be a great Geek Squad Agent.  It is not all about doing repairs, and not all about sales, you have to do both.  Most technicians would think the job is to easy to charge correctly for services, and if you sell it you need to do the job."
good,"My job involved selling electronics. I learned a lot about cameras, TVs and video games while working for this company which just so happened to be my favorite part about this job. What I disliked the most was the compensation plan. The staff was wonderful for the most part."
good,I had a great experience working for Best Buy's Mobile department. I was able to hone in on my skills and learn new techniques in consulting and mobile sales as well.
good,"While checking customers out with products, I'd make sure they are leaving with the correct product and were happy with the service they had received while shopping. I learned many things about multiple electronics ranging from televisions to cell phones to computers. My co-workers were some of the best I have ever got the opportunity to work with while with a company. We were always willing to help and teach each other at any given time. Although there were few days of which I was able to receive a break, I enjoyed meeting new people and allowing customers to leave with a smile."
good,"I enjoyed working for Best Buy and moving up within the company but found it very hard to get ahead seemed to have a lot of friends only atmosphere took a long time to get to management job"
good,"I enjoy working here because I get to not only help customers get what they want and need, I also have a great team to help me out when I need them. Our management is also very understanding of family issues and will accommodate when things arise. I've learned to overcome my fear of speaking to strangers, and that if you don't know something, don't be afraid to admit it. 90% of the time the customer will understand. However the hardest part is the 10% of people who don't understand and will get loud about their concerns and dislikes. I've learned to just walk it off, for there are more enlightening and fun people who make working in retail worth the hassle."
good,"Great place to work, fun environment and management, but don't expect to get on full time or have opportunity to move up."
good,Best Buy is actually one of the best employers I've worked for. They treat all employees equally.
good,Good times helping clients find and understand mobile phones and plans. Access to new technology.
good,"I loved that I could learn multiple job stations allowing me to move up in the chain of command rather quickly. it didn't interfere with my schooling and it taught me how to be a open minded person so that I can give the best customer service ever. Plus I was 16 and how I was taught to hold my head up always work hard and to be prompt to work I still hold dear today and it has made me who I am"
good,Job was very fun were  had a great staff that keep everyone motivated everyday. Departments were always helpful to one another which made our store very profitable.
good,"Best Buy is a technologically advanced work place where keeping up with the new trends in technology is absolutely important. "
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Can Be very busy or very slow at times."
good,Good Times on team Blue.  It was something I did going through college.  Best buy is a comfortable working environment.
good,"Typical day at work is running from customer to customer and asking them about what and why they need the new product for, creating orders for customers if we dont have the product and getting them out in a timely manner and then getting to the next customer. "
good,I enjoyed working at Best Buy. I would have enjoyed it more if I didn't have certain problems that left my feet and body feeling horrible after only 3 - 4 hours on my feet.
good,Awesome summer job outdoors working on a golf course. 4 star resort with fantastic guests that make life easier. Most enjoyable part was socializing with guests after their round of golf and then of course receiving a nice tip.
good,Good learning experience for people needing experience in sales and commission sales
good,You walk around helping customers with what they are looking for that best suits them. I learned a lot about the technology of all electronics of all kinds. Great management and leadership from your peers. You have to take a lot of test on all electronics to keep up to date. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people everyday.
good,"A typical day at work usually starts on a flurry of clocking in and jumping into the fire. On a ""good day"" you could check your email, read an article in the employee news forums before working with your first client. Not many of those. Typical client experience: Client walks over to the Geek Squad ""horseshoe"" with an Agent (hopefully smiling) saying hello. If there is a line we let them know we will be with them shortly. "
good,"It is typical retail, but what makes this company different are the people at the STORE level. Great individuals make most stores a thrill to be in for the customer."
good,Interesting challenges and great experience. Opportunities available to advance.
good,Best Buy IS a Great Place To Work. The ONly Thing is tit hard to learn the things that are requred of you for way to liitle pay
good,"I loved coming into work and processing customers' transactions, selling product, and organizing my workplace every day. My GM was amazing and so were all other department supervisors. my coworkers were great as well. The hardest part of the job was trying my best and not being able to satisfy a customer, which only happened every once in a while, stuff happens. The most enjoyable part of working here was meeting, helping, and forming relationships with the customers so that they left with satisfaction and every need met."
good,"It's a great work environment!  I like to work for this company."
good,"Every day at work was always a adventure, the days were often slow but around holidays they were very exciting. Management took care of their employees and all my co-workers were not just co-workers but my teammates. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to connect with customers and meet new people everyday, I learned how to better my communication skills and become a better listener/problem solver."
good,"Getting involved in the sales part of Best Buy was fun for a term but it was hard to move up. If you weren't full time, of course, there were no benefits. "
good,"my job was to help costumer with information techonology question or guide them to make big purchase,  helping people making the right buy even tho we never got paye3d cominision i love to do my job."
good,"I was hired before our GO day and was able to go through multiple training exercises and in store lessons. I loved my coworkers and got along well with everybody easily. My managers were amazing and advancement opportunities were always open. The only problem I had was when I moved and wasn't able to get a transfer. Other than that, benefits were great and they teach you everything you need to know to advance."
good,"This company left a bad taste in my mouth for retail employers, management didn't want to train anyone for fear of being replaced."
good,"Awesome, interesting, great people to work with. Always have a good day."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"•Developed training & hiring process, directed hiring clinic for test store format "
good,They promote you if you perform. They also pay the best in retail. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my team. My biggest reward was seeing them grow into future leaders at Best Buy. The most frustrating part about working at Best Buy was that they held onto underperforming managers to long. They don't do a good job of bringing in external talent.
good,"Best Buy is a great company and I will bleed ""blue"" forever, but the lack of advancement opportunities with continual company restrucures has put a strain on my career."
good,"a typical day at bestbuy can be like any other job you have your good days and your bad days it really helps the work place when you have a strong leadership team. Best Buy does need work on pratice on there values as a company there are some big box stores that repersent there values to the fullest some not so much. The managment i got to work with was great the general manager was great, there was a few sales managers that were fantastic and a few that needed alot of work on leadership skills, the other managment team was fantasic and the as far as the co-workers go there are great people but not alot of team work they saw the store as departments when the number one goal is to help customers in any part of the store "" 1 team 1 dream"" did not apply when it should have. the hardest part of the job is trying to get everyone on board to meeting sales targets there are alot of times when it feels you are the only one putting in 110%.the most enjoyable part if you are a sales driven person is when you put a big sale through and knowing the customer/client is happy with the service you have given them. a sale like that can make a bad day go good in seconds"
good,"Loved my job sometimes I wish I still worked there and wouldn't have left if I was full-time. They give you the max hours without being considered full-time. Great place to work and if your good with computers, it is very simple."
good,Attended gallery and supervised space.
good,"Typical day for me was unloading trucks, building displays, tracking and recieving inventory. Also, assisting customers and helping with inventory shrink."
good,Stock Floors
good,This was one of the most entertaining jobs I've held in a while. Management and employees were great. The pay could've been better though. I'm a nerd so this was an amazing place to learn about technology.
good,loved working at best buy!! Meet lots of wonderful people but the management team can lack friendliness and really dont care if you have a family. Long work hrs over the holidays and not family friendly but the benefits are wonderful for full time employees and I dont know about now but one of the best employee discounts
good,great place to work for motivated folks. I work there when i was a junior in high school so awesome place for student to receive extra money
good,A typical day started with a team meeting at the beginning of my shift. in the team meeting we went over our goals we had to achieve for that day. We also greeted customers and helped them with problems they had. I learned the in and out of how a big corporation like best buy is ran. Our Management team were awesome. They helped us a lot on how best buy is ran on a daily basis. I would say the hardest part of my job was not satisfying every customer needs. Sometimes customer come in and ask for a certain item and we don't have. So the hardest part is when they have to go somewhere else to get that product. The enjoyable part of my job is seeing a satisfied customer who expects to be returning soon.
good,i loved working at best buy! employees&mangement were so nice!
good,A typical day at work would be getting there in the morning turning on all the displays. Therefore everything is ready and presentable for the costumers. I learned how to approach costumers without coming of to strong by gaining there trust then finding out why they came into our establishment. My favorite part of my job would have to be seeing a happy costumer walk out because of great costumer service. I really enjoy helping others.
good,A typical day at work is relaxed and slow paced. Working with customers and selling solutions in person and over the phone.
good,"co-workers were awesome and all the same age and we were close and managment treated us equal and with fairness. Hardest part of my job was not having an item in stock and customers had to wait, loved working in a great Company and awesome co-workers and had awesome compensation ."
good,"Motivated a non-performing team two weeks before iPhone 4S launch and successfully led district and company in performance and was able to maintain top 500 performance through the holiday season. Identified a unique company and industry issue in certain markets and directly helped establish a Standard Operating Procedure for the entire company.Adapt the management of the department to focus on gaps within sales, labor, productivity and inventory and in resulting hitting historically missed goals with the P&L"
good,"It was a very fun place to work at, very fast paced, always busy, time went by fast. I was a front cashier and my job was to check out customers as accurately and as fast as i can. the bad thing about it was that the job was seasonal / temporary"
good,worked as the only installer runing aound cleaning shop and ordering supplies and callliing customer to book an install
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,everyone knows everyones names very good place to work loved it
good,anybody that enjoys electronics and are good with people would highly enjoy working here
good,Learned how to install aftermarket electronics into and vehicle.
good,Great place to work if you enjoy being around electronics and the lastest and greatest in the fields.
good,I loved working at best buy because I love shopping there. I helped alot of customers while I was there and I was always selling those protection plans. I was such a good employee that on one of those customer surveys I was chosen as the employee who gave the best customer service out of everyone in the entire store.
good,This Job is a good job for students in college or a high school teen who wants to learn how the business world works like
good,Loved working their and the environment was very friendly and the managers were awesome to work for. Very easy scheduling never hard to get days off always worked with you on that
good,"Best Buy is not your typical retail store.  Once you become a member of the team, people learn very quickly to become independent and empowered.  There are good days and there are bad days.  For the most part the company as a whole is great and your experience is going to depend on your leadership and specific location. Everyday someone has a  bigger smile than others and the see-saw battle to even the odds is consistent across the board. There is a very mature aspect to working for this company where each individual must be in control of themselves emotionally and know your role and At the same time there are times where the freedom and fun you have while helping people with electronics and crazy questions is worth more than making more money.  Ultimately I never thought I would be working for Best Buy but now that I do, I am glad I decided to.  I am no where near the perfect employee and Best Buy is one of those companies that reminds you that you don't have to be perfect, just try your best."
good,"Had a great time working for them would love to work part time or not full time"
good,The people are friendly and very supportive. But the advancement process was a bit slow and unprofessional. Overall the job culture was warm and welcoming
good,"Its a fun place to work, and presents new challenges day by day. The management created a fun atmosphere while equipping us with the tools to be efficient at our job."
good,"Customers can be very nasty at times, but when you work with great people around you (those types of people you want to be around) it makes a great difference."
good,"I worked here for three years before i became board (unrelated to workplace) the people were great, made the time I worked here painless and rewarding"
good,Like every other place you work at they have their favorites. Managers aren’t really open to new ideas to improve workspace. Moving up is near impossible unless you make yourself known.
good,This company cares about their people and their customers! They are innovative and prepared to take on the next level of technology. Management is in tune with their employees and genuinely care about their staff.
good,Productive and fast pace environment. Great opportunity to expand your knowledge of the technology world and meet great people along the way. Just be an open book when coming to this job because it's a learning process. You might be in one department of the store but another department will always need some help so just learn and listen to your fellow associates when you can.
good,"The job taught me how to work well in a team environment, how to problem solve tasks on the fly, and how to provide great customer service in all situations."
good,"Get to meet and work with great people, no commission structure makes it such a relaxed friendly place to work. Must learn quick but they are helpful with training."
good,"Take part in the activities as there are bound to be plenty. Knowledge is at an abundance so use the tools, courses and programs available to expand your horizons and build your resume as this will help get promotions or branch out to other companies in varies fields. I went from working in Product Process (inventory, shipping and receiving) to finance at another company"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Learned a lot of valuable customer service skills. The staff was always a lot of fun to be around and the staff events were always a ball. Every day at work brought new learning opportunities and challenges.
good,Great Company! Treats employees amazing and work culture is very unique. I would recommend full-time or part-time employment to anyone looking to gain retail employment.
good,The most enjoyable part about my jobs was working in groups and moving in a fast past with other employees. The workplace culture was amazing because everybody had a positive attitude everyday at work and never had any problems.
good,The management team created a great work environment. The store team worked well together. They had great organizational skills. Really learned great customer support and service.
good,"flexible hours, great people and management that cares about its customers and its employees, with a fast paced environment and plenty of opportunities for advancement."
good,"I worked at Best Buy for almost 4 years of my life. During that time I had made my way up from a part time worker, to full time, to (almost a) senior. I had to move back to my home town due to personal reasons, but the room for growth is amazing, if you work in a big city. "
good,I love working at Best Buy. It’s always been a great company to work for and with. I love the team I work with it makes it hard to leave. The only down side is hours are tough. I want to be working at least 40 but it’s not looking great right now. But all in all I love Best Buy
good,"Très belle ambiance au travail"
good,Its very fun during the holidays and after but any other day gets boring. You learn a lot and meet a lot of cool people. Benefits are great. Hours sucked.
good,Great work environment with affable people. No room for advancement and every year you will get a raise. The company ask you to do a lot for little pay.
good,"Best Buy is your typical retail store in many things that matter--working holidays, extended hours during holiday ""drive time"", and daily, monthly, and quarterly revenue targets that can be stressful. But, what I liked about Best Buy is (as someone with a mild disability), the management did everything in their power to keep me with the company, whether it was taking calls, helping with warehouse, or moving me to different sales positions which not only made me super knowledgeable, but eventually gave me a chance to really understand the business."
good,"My usual day at Best Buy includes doing daily inventory tasks such as picking items, shipping items, locating products, and managing stock count. There are truck days as well in which we receive and unload current and future inventory. The management is good and I never feel pressured or seriously stressed while I am working. Overall I enjoy the job and have learned a lot about warehouse."
good,"Positive work environment."
good,Hardest part of the job is getting some questions about tech that you don't know about. It is a fun place to work but can get really hectic when it gets busy.
good,"Just a nice place to work at but a lot of step until you want to be. First an interview, then another one, training is by far over done but you get paid so thats great. But didn’t get the hours i wanted."
good,Working for Best Buy is wonderful. Its business and fun rolled into one. We do group events and have a good time in the store while still helping customers and being the best we can be as humans.
good,"Discounts abundant, always interesting gadgets and new technologies being discussed and thoughts being shared on them. Management possible one of the best I've personally ever had"
good,"i really like working at bestbuy it is a really good place to learn a lot about technology and customer service as well."
good,"I worked for the company for 10 years and would have continued if it wasn’t for the realignment. Great people, great benefits, great pay. Anyone would be lucky to be employed with Best Buy."
good,"Checking in is worthless, and should only be done with new employees during their first 90 days. If the managers and MOD doesn't wanna it, we shouldn't have to either."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,The culture of Best buy was strange in the fact that while corporate didn't give a about you.the store did. I made a lot of friends but after restructuring and such I found a better opportunity.
good,"Great place to work for the benefits and discounts. Culture varries based on store but overall pretty good place to work. you can definitely move up if you're good and understand the business (to include the ""office politics"")"
good,"A typical day at Best Buy can be rewarding and difficult at the same time."
good,I started a seasonal job (shopping season) at bestbuy and it is still on of my favorite places that I have worked. They were compassionate and understanding as family needs came up and genuinely cared about my wellbeing and that of my family. To be honest the work was easy but fast paced and everyone works together to get a job done.
good,this is a great place to work if you have the spirit to grow and always want better. the team is diligent on sales goals and advancing theam members to the next level
good,Best Buy was good for experience and growing knowledge of the industry but lacks a sense of fairness in terms of hours and salary they’re constantly hiring but not giving hours to current associates
good,"Best Buy is a fast paced friendly environment . Competive pay, and growth. Best Buy is also based around creating a world class customer experience..."
good,Management are friendly and the environment is incredibly welcoming. Processes are taught out well and employee happiness is very important to store leaders. I would recommend anyone work here!
good,A great place to work while in school. A lot of opportunity to learn and grow as a person. If you put in the work while you are there you can be paid back in kind with opportunity to move up.
good,I have worked at Best Buy for a year now and love it they have flexible hours if you are a student in college which was a big plus for me! The only problem when it came to working with best buy was that they would over hire and then you wouldn’t get any hours. I am living paycheck to paycheck putting myself through school.
good,Great place to work in working with people and helping others develop their leadership skills as well. A place where we help enrich peoples lives through technology
good,I enjoyed my three years at Best Buy and I would definitely recommend working there. every store is different so be prepared for different personalities.
good,overall best buy was an amazing place to work at. i recommend anyone wanting to start a retail experience job to work there. Co workers and management are very friendly and willing to help you achieve your goals.
good,"Discounts, culture, leadership, customer service, hours, advancement opportunities, technology, promos, demos, break room, insurance, holidays, vacation"
good,"Working in Geek Squad you quickly come to understand that no one that comes there knows anything about a computer more than to turn it on and open the internet. This can be frustrating at times, trying to explain basic concepts to people who have had a computer for more than 10 years, but still don't understand that the laptop from 2007 is getting old and time to replace it."
good,"Staff is a productive and hard working team. A Great learning experience for first time employees. Best Buy is full of a welcoming team, great place for recognizing talent."
good,"Grande organisation qui offre une opportunité de premier emploi à des centaines de jeunes, de gestionnaires. Belle expérience dans un univers amical, familier et exigeant."
good,Lost a child at the time of working there which made me make the decision to be there for my remaining children. The job taught me alot about the way a business is ran and I was able to apply that to others.
good,I didn't really like the sales floor but once I got out of that and into the warehouse I had a really good time. Outside of holidays there's pretty much nothing to do so you can start to relax
good,I enjoyed working for best buy only reason i quit was one of the coworks that had been there a hole lot longer than me was starting issues and i no longer wanted to work under him.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I enjoyed spending my day working with friends to help our customers find the exact thing they need even if it meant I forming them that that is what they need to accomplish their goals.
good,"The company overall is great with many benefits.  The only real drawback is who you end up with as a Manager/Supervisor.  Too much leeway is given to in store Managers who can, will and have terminate employees for no good reason."
good,"Best Buy was an amazing employer to work for, however they decided as a corporate decision to close all of their cellphone only stores and lay off or relocate all employees. When I went in for an interview at the big box I was treated rudely by management and they offered me a pay cut from $17/hour to $14/hour if I wanted to keep my job. I ended up taking the 3 month severance package at $17/hour for my severance package rate."
good,"I really like this place, it has a great enviroment and the bosses are super cool."
good,"I wouldn't personally suggest making Best Buy a long-term career choice. Sure, it was fun to work there, and the knowledge you obtain from new technology is incredible, but there isn't much room for advancement - or at least there wasn't when I was employed there. In fact, positions were being cut from the company which is why I ended up leaving in the first place; going from 40 hours a week to 4 (no exaggeration) due to over-staffing is not something I would consider boast-worthy. "
good,Had a great team and culture that has set me up for success. There is room growth and many within the store have been promoted to higher roles and moved onto bigger things.
good,Besides the work life balance the job is amazing. The pay needs a lot of work for their upper management but cant complain. Its is also a very quick paced environment.
good,Developed my skill at representing and built my confidence by putting myself in challenging situations. Workplace culture is pretty friendly but professional.
good,"Nice place to work through college, benefits are good. They are also pretty flexible on hours. My location was pretty laid back, there is goals you do have to reach but generally they are easy to get to."
good,"Great fellow employees and management.   Busy pace, when holiday seasons were approaching.    Learned how to operate newer cash register.   Worked the opening shift which gave me the opportunity to do a lot of cleaning and stocking."
good,"best work experiance for first time worker "
good,It was a cool and a fun place to work. I worked in the warehouse so i wasn't really on the sales floor often. Overall my coworkers were very helpful and nice.
good,Excellent  work place. Team work and communication among workers is a driving force behind best buy company. I would recommend the best buy to anyone.
good,"I worked there for 3 years and received two raises I had to fight to get a full time position after it was wrongly given to someone else, afterwards I was given bare minimum hours and given I lived so far away it became not worth it to work there for me, Now I loved the benefits and discounts I had a phenomenal manager at first and he left the company after many years sadly."
good,"Very fun workplace but, for young adults, should only be for personal advancement and getting work experience. However, the schedules are very flexible and the supervisors are very understanding."
good,"As Geek Squad Consultation Apple Master, I had the opportunity to work in a fun, face pace environment with the greatest and latest products. Clients were very appreciative of the work we do for them and the work was rewarding."
good,Great place to learn and gain skills.  I have nothing else to say about this but am being forced to write a review.  I have nothing else to say.  There is nothing else I can say.
good,"Best Buy has been a great place to learn and grown and has strongly aided in my development. Offered me a place to grow  and gain skills, and given me the ability to help others accomplish their goals."
good,"Is great place to work and a lot to learn, good management and good working environment. Good team environment, supportive supervisors. A variety of customers to deal with and learn from."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy has a great store culture aimed at providing customers with great products, complete solutions, and future-minded support. The team you work with becomes your family-away-from-home and the store as a whole has a great sense of teamwork."
good,"Es una gran compañía, donde uno puede aprender lo que le sea de mayor interés, con muy buenos valores, tanto operativos como humanos, la desventaja es la limitada promoción de desarrollo y los manejos arbitrarios de los lideres."
good,Great Company to work for if you are young and in college or just out of High School. They seem to start everyone off part time. I loved the job. It was just not enough money.
good,"A typical day at work involves explaining the difference between electricity and internet to customers, along with other tech-things. The management structure is the same for most stores, though each store handles company policy differently (for example, first store was more relaxed in terms of dress code. Current store is quite strict). I do LOVE the discount opportunities though, both from BBY and vendors (like HP, Verizon, etc)."
good,"Store to store is vastly different where it comes to work pace, depends on Bestbuy-defined metrics. In some stores I worked for this company, unfortunately, store metrics ranked low, but traffic as high as in their top stores which provokes unnecessary and unreasonable stress on a service/repair department I work at. Otherwise, a good place to start IT career as a repair tech. If your location has good management, expect a good culture and decent social events for an entry-corporate chain."
good,"If you are good at doing your job and constantly stay busy, then you will have no issues. Hardest times will be during the holiday season other than that, it is just a steady pace of work."
good,"Absolutely loved my time here. Pay was fair, benefits were good, coworkers were terrific, and the work was overall enjoyable. I would say this has been one of the best job experiences I’ve had."
good,"Great discounts, flexible schedule. I had two jobs and they were able to accommodate my needs. Best Buy hires the best.  So consider your self lucky if your offer the job."
good,Best Buy is a great work place if you are desperate for a job and want to help as many people in the tech industry as you can. I saw this as a great job for young people who are currently in college or people who are in a transition into a much larger job elsewhere. I would also see it as a great place for any manager.
good,"Great benefits, Great company to work for.  If not for certain managers, who do come and go, I would still be there.  If you take a job outside the stores, chance for promotion decrease to almost zero."
good,Loved working here but I couldn’t stay at the time as I was going to college at the moment so going to was an issue. No longer going to school so that won’t be an issue
good,A typical day at work is very easy going. I learned a whole lot more about what technology is best used in certain situations as well as how to pair clients to ideal solutions based on their needs. Learned how to activate cellphones to carrier plans and common problems that would cause some electronics to not run at full potential.
good,"Best Buy is an great place to work. A typical work day included being in  charge of ordering, receiving and counting all types of products. I was also responsible for ensuring that inventory records are accurate at all times, which they do through daily or weekly counts of all products."
good,"Best Buy is a fast paced work environment with ever changing products and needs, the attention to matrix makes it a competitive and fun work environment"
good,"I loved working with Best Buy for the years that I did. They have amazing benefits for their full time employees, but moving up within the company as a woman is very hard."
good,"spent way to long working here, went fro OS to full time and change locations 3 times. best buy is like any other retail but holds you to a standard of excellency."
good,"It is an awesome place to work, with great staff, and they also have excellent team building.  One of the down sides is that it's hard to move up though."
good,Working hard and showing initiative goes a long way with this organization. By doing so it helps dividends with your promotability. My store location was in the metro Atlanta area which promoted a lot of store traffic. Being able to handle holiday rushes and overall customer satisfaction gives you a one up on other employees.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,great place to work and develop sales skills. the lack of commission and small bonuses is really frustrating and if sales remain low job security can be placed at risk but over all if you focus and sell you should be ok.
good,"Poor pay, no opportunity for advancement. Great coworkers. Customers always unhappy & very rude. Store manager was terribly unhelpful. Good place for teens or retired person."
good,"enjoyed the team. fun fast paced environment. every day was never the same, had to deal with new problems each day. no matter what happened throughout the day i learned something new."
good,"It was fun to work with the team, you learned good time management skills, and teamwork skills. Also learned the importance of good customer relations."
good,"Era muy divertido y dinámico, manejaban una buena cultura sobre todo hacer validos los valores de la empresa."
good,"I enjoy working here but could use more hours.  Many people state this.  There are a few people that are full time 38 hour employees, but usually just one per department except for managers."
good,Had to go in and make sure to help all customers with any questions. Had to work on the register. Job was not too hard but was more of a high school job.
good,I enjoy working at Best Buy. I'm Part time. Management at the store is great. Everyone is friendly and helpful. The hardest part of my job is when customer are mad at you and unfortunately it's out of my hands due to third party delivery. I feel bad because I am limited on what I can do. The most enjoyable part of my job is when customers appreciate all of your hard work to help them.
good,Working for best buy has sure been an experience. I would say what attracted me most to Best buy was the culture it carried as a company. It is united and family oriented. As employees and customers we feel united and have each others back when needed.
good,"A typical day included clocking in and summarizing with the team lead my expectations for the sales day and my assignment where I would be selling. I was with a team of college students aged with all types of backgrounds. The role of home theater sales worked in all outlets of the store including appliances, televisions, and car electronics. The hardest part was not having enough customers for sales but it was fun because we had time to be with guests longer to build connections and find the perfect product for them."
good,"the experience was good, it was a dual world where on the road and in the office was completely different. the people at the geek squad where actually passionate about fixing costumer computer so it was nice."
good,I worked at this company a long time ago while I was a college sophomore and had just moved out of my parents house. I was working full time here and was not paid enough to make rent and all my other payments needed. Hence why I quit.
good,Beautiful Company to work for very nice and very knowledgeable. Fast paced and lots of opportunities with other jobs from learning experience. Would recommend this job to others.
good,"working at Best Buy was one of the funnest opportunities possible, great environment, great ,management, AMAZING DISCOUNTS on certain products. Easy going days"
good,The opportunity to work for Best Buy is awesome but the policy’s and management is easy to backfire into for exceptions and for favoritism to occur.they pay for holidays and for working on those holidays on top of double time and a half.
good,Doesn't work there but will love to give it a try learn more bout the job meet different employees have fun doing my job be a great helper help company grow more
good,The pay wasn't great but it was a good part time job.  I enjoyed being around all the cool toys and sharing my knowledge with the customers making sure they were comfortable with their purchases and their needs were met
good,"Great place to intorduce you into retail. some departments are fast paced and busy, some are more laid back and slow. Either way a great place to work and learn."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,With any retail job you are usually part-time and its almost impossible to become full-time. The people are fun and the knowledge you will obtain will lead you to a better job.
good,"great team spirit, nice life school, learning on each product. They make focus on performance, Bestbuy have current summit at toronto for the trainning"
good,Great Job! I came from a previous job that ended with 30 people quitting or being fired. I found this job at a very negative point in my life and I'm happy to say it's been the best job I've had. Period.
good,I've been calling on and supporting Best Buy stores in the area for six years. My interview with the store manager was relaxed because of our working relationship.
good,"An amazing place to be as the culture of working with Best Buy is second to none, they truly live their Values in ""having fun while being the best"" Newmarket and Barrie locations are very inviting and easy to work in."
good,Best Buy was great environment to work. 4 years later and I still consider it my best job even though the pay was kind of low. There was opportunity for advancement and a flexible work schedule.
good,I worked in several departments and they all where fun and challenging.  We where a sales organization but our goal was to get to know the customer and make them feel comfortable
good,"A typical day would be performing work on customer's computers such as hardware installs, software installs, data recovery, new computer set-ups or removing viruses from computers.  Sometimes were were assigned to the sales floor to sell computers, or computer related items in addition answer computer questions for customers."
good,"Fun place to work at!! I unfortunately didn't get enough hours but a lot of students work there so most dont mind. Very fun place to work at i can not stress that enough, employees even from other states are kind and have a good attitude!! Management too!"
good,Best Buy has trained me well in sales and customer service. Best Buy trains every new hire and newly promoted leadership employees. The culture is very family-like and supportive. The hardest part of the job is the compensation and management's willingness to train and mentor employees for future career advancement into leadership roles.
good,As a starting place Best buy offers flexible work hours and also an enjoyable environment. It gets hectic but its retail. That should be expected. Management varies on location.
good,"I enjoyed the detailed work I did at Best Buy. I answered the phone, did store pickup and ran customer service. The workplace culture was encouraging. My manager was understanding and promoted my growth as an employee."
good,Best Buy is an overall good company that will help teach its employees important professional skills to help elevate themselves.  They provide great training standards to help employees feel empowered.
good,"Not bad. Great experience. Only left due to restructure. Would have stayed, otherwise. Loved it. Had a great time. Definitely had the opportunity for growth."
good,"Great when it comes to pay for college students but if you have kids / a child the availability is the issue , you to work weekends and to be full time you need open availability."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Best Buy. I learned a lot about technology and sales, and the culture was very loose. The management cared about your situation and was willing to work with you. The most enjoyable part of the job was making people feel joyous about their purchases, and the fact the company was very good at providing admiration for a job well done."
good,The workers there all seem to be on drone mode. People don't seem that thrilled to work there. The managers have no one fluid type of conversation if one manager says no another will say yes. It gets old
good,"Depending on your GM you can have a very different work experience. I have worked at Best Buy's with great leadership and those with horrible leadership. The GM sets the tone for your store and if they understand that they are the manager of manager's and make sure the ASM understands his job is to empower employees to do their jobs, you will have a great work experience. If you work at a store where the ASM thinks their job is to assign busy work and thinks busy work is more important than training and your GM does not understand even the most basic elements of their job, it will not be great. The competitive atmosphere can also heavily effect the store if a GM is unwilling to deal with employees. Stolen sales and sniping (ignoring low value customers and waiting for a high value customer) can become common."
good,I have no issues working there. The people were nice and the pay was good for me at the time as well. They make sure you know everything you need to know before you step on the floor to help customers.
good,"Warehouse managment, organization and equipment use. Sales techniques, Valuable customer service/support. Most enjoyable part is learning about the new products and getting hands on experience with them to better your sales."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,its an okay place to work for.  good place for high school student to work. management us nice sometime. your always getting some kind of bonus.  all different walks of life are there
good,"While working at Best Buy warehouse I was employed by a temp agency, Kelly Services, so a lot of the required information didn't pertain to temp employees"
good,"I always enjoyed my time at Best Buy and I wish I could have stayed; I learned a lot and I had some great people I worked with. Unfortunately, it's still a retail job, with retail hours and retail clerk pay."
good,Very supportive work environment with energetic people. This job is great for a first job and for those interested in all things technology. Great discount and respectable employment.
good,"Had a wonderful time working at the location I worked at, managers are very helpful and understanding, always had a good time when i worked, everyone was understanding"
good,i really enjoy working at best buy it is a good place to gain interaction skills and i enjoy how interactive management is with me and my coworkers i have no complaints
good,"Geek Squad it's a good start point as a technician, they try to keep you updated and engage to new technologies. The work environment it's aceptable, nice work culture"
good,such a fun clean place to work. it is very difficult to learn everything about the electronics equipment you sell in a very short amount of time but the people are friendly and really cool. there wasn't much of a downside to working there other than it was a seasonal temporary position.
good,There is always a different day working at Best buy. You will never know what knind of customer you are going to have or what day you re going to have.
good,Fun work & good co-workers all around; everyone appointed in management have huge redeeming qualities. I built relationships at Best Buy where I couldn't think they were possible.
good,"Egos are much too strong in this atmosphere.  Basically the head manager went over 2 other manager's heads to get me fired because she didn't trust me after I resolved an issue that another employee had with me.  Not so much as a thought or a follow-up with the other employee, just her own- strong- assumptions."
good,"Current management is too concerned with the process and not providing the information to partners. "
good,"Awsome place to work at "
good,"The atmosphere was great. The staff is fun and knowledgeable. Management was run well. However, the sales quota is on a per hour basis, so this part about the job was a bit stressful. Other than that I really enjoyed working here. I still have friends from this job today."
good,"For those that enjoy technology this job is the best! Plenty of opportunity for advancement, but it does require that you work a lot of evening shifts which make it difficult when raising a family. This is normal in any sales environment. The goals were always attainable and the rewards were amazing!"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Clock in to work.  You check peoples receipts and also employees bags and coats.  Greeting people and assisting them to find the associates to help them out.
good,I joined BBY during a major restructuring and had the opportunity to contribute to not only my role and place within supply chain but on cross functional teams throughout the org.
good,It's a good place to work but there is no commission involved. I enjoyed working there but I wasn't getting paid a lot. We had monthly bonuses if the department did well as a team
good,I was a seasonal employee at Best buy this past wonter. I loved my time there and wish they would have kept me on. Management was amazing everyone is so nice. Hours were good and so was pay.
good,"Good people, pretty good management, but that also depend on which store you actually work in. Good sense of community, fast paced but fun environment. Would probably work there again if given the opportunity."
good,working at best buy is a lot of fun if you are a student or just looking for some more hours. the discount is really good as well as other benefits. I would defiantly recommend working at best buy
good,The new management is really disappointing. I believe they don't look out for the employees that have been part of the company for a long time and makes it hard for them to move up within the company.
good,This company is awesome for people who enjoy the greatest and latest technology. I have worked in many departments of this company I enjoyed being a sales consultant from my previous experience at this location.
good,"Best Buy was a great place to work.  Most of the people there are very friendly and they focus on both working hard and having fun.  The company has a very strong social conscience, with numerous volunteering opportunities for local social agencies, veterans, disaster relief, etc.  They have a strong commitment to diversity and the environment (Best Buy is a leader in recycling and is constantly working on reducing its carbon footprint).  If you have a passion for retail marketing or consumer electronics, this is probably one of the best places in the world to work.  One downside is that they are in a tough business environment, competing against Amazon and other retail marketers.  Layoffs and reorganizations are a regular occurrence, so one has to be flexible and willing to deal with frequent change."
good,"1 manager made my time not perfect. Otherwise, it was pretty straight forward work, and I loved what I sold. I learned valuable selling and people skills."
good,"At the start of the day management had a briefing, exercise and we begun our day. Everyone down to regular employees were excellent. They always made sure we had the essential things to perform our daily duties."
good,Pay was nice for part time and had really friendly coworkers and managers. Discount was great too. Overall a great experience for anyone who is looking for a fun part time job.
good,"Nice place to work, the culture around it is very friendly and everyone gets along. Management is good and they work with my hours and give me shifts that are easy towork into my life"
good,"I loved the people I met and worked with fun time at Store#1421"
good,"I would work here just for the discounts again and to have current knowledge in technology. Depending on your coworkers, it can be a really cool place."
good,"I was a seasonal working so theirs not much I could say."
good,"I loved best buy and everything about my team. I still currently work there until i get into another job to hopefully make a career. Best Buy is a great place to work if you love a team environment and getting the ""Job Done"" i highly recommend it for a stepping stone kind of job!"
good,"i enjoyed my time at best buy, it was my first job and they taught me a lot about having a job. one of my favorite companies i have worked for. i would recommend to a friend"
good,I would definitely recommend best buy to any of my friends i loved me job. my supervisor and i just did not get a long and really but heads. i would still be their if it wasn't for my supervisor.
good,"Great culture, but pressure to produce pushed some to reduce client attention.  Found the people to be top notch, but under pressure to perform.  Job ended up being outsourced."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"The employer facility I worked at was NCO, specifically for best buys website sales. "
good,"Best Buy itself is a fine company to work for in its sense that there is room for advancement, the pay is reasonable, and the benefits are good. It does of course have some downfalls usually getting enough people to cover a certain shift or heck being overstaffed can also be a tad annoying to work around. Besides all that i will say i am pretty satisfied with my stay there."
good,The workers are well mannered and respectful to both other employees and customers. The management is there for their employees and can be trusted with really working with them.
good,its not a bad a job to have there is just a lot of issues with leadership in certain stores its not consistent. great discount for purchasing small things. being able to play with the latest and greatest in the electronics world.
good,"there is a lot of new tech to play with, and the discounts are great,but the team rally in the morning gets tiresome. management can get a little pushy"
good,"I worked there for 2 years and in that time I made a lot of friends. The pay was good, the overtime was on a strict 'as-needed' basis. Management and employees were held accountable for their actions so there was no favoritism. The only draw back was if you were looking for a promotion, it was more based on who 'wowed' the interviewers and not based on actual experience."
good,"A typical day there isn't as hard or bad. They give a lot of raymond machine opportunities no matter who it is. Staff is pretty cool too. I was in Recieving, that section is better than Shipping in my opinion."
good,fun and fast paced it retail so be prepared to work it only as hard as you make it on your self  but hours of operations are decents never up to early and never home to late just dont expect weekends off
good,Great place to work. All employees are very friendly and willing to help. Working at this location for only a part time job but they are willing to move you up if needed
good,"At Best Buy, they have a very productive working environment. The team is very friendly and helpful. For me, working at Best Buy is a very educational."
good,Management doesn't really care to much about employee advancement but it isn't there fault because managers have a very busy job at a store to keep everything in order.
good,Best buy was a great place to work. No experience needed. Plenty of training on sales and electronic products made it easy to be successful there. Work culture there was having fun while being the best.
good,"The job is very laid back and easy to learn, as long as you're willing to learn that is. Enjoy waking up and the schedule is amazing. The work environment is god, everyone is friendly and vert out-going as well."
good,worked in multiple locations for over 15 years and every couple years restructure of company could mean loss of position.  Other than that I feel it is a great way to make money and get cool electronics at cheap prices.
good,"I was an appliance tech at first, then was a tech assistant for the appliance team, then for the tv team. kept record of parts inventory, answered phones,"
good,"A system of walking in, making a clipboard, finishing your uniform and then heading out to take care of customer needs. Management was always friendly as well which kept the vibes going."
good,Excellent job with a great opportunity to learn and teach about the best in technology. Excellent place to learn about customer service and how to work as a team.
good,Geek squad gives out so much to make up for decent pay. This place is fun and has a home feel to it. Everyonr gets along but management can be hard on people sometimes. Still wpuld highly recommend
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,My favorite thing about Best Buy is Geek Squad!! I worked for Geek Squad for 4+ years and the culture is one of the best I've ever experienced both in-store and remotely.
good,"Fun to learn and meet great people with great benefits and good atmosphere.  Teamwork is a must for this job, because without it you can't succeed at the jon"
good,"It can be stressful, high demand, and the most aggravating job you'll ever have.  But it can be the most rewarding, fun, and build friendships for life from working for this great company.  I learned so much from working for Best Buy.  From working for and with some incredible people that take the time to build you and mold you into being the future of the business.  I miss it every day.  I took a job that promised opportunity of advancement.  I lost that job shortly after taking it due to illness.  I wish I would have stayed with the company that invested in me, built me up, and made me really feel like I was a key component to the team."
good,"Not a bad place to work, everyone is friendly. I felt at home when was there. The things you deal with is half pc/laptop repair and the other half is helping people at front desk"
good,"Working for best buy was a challenge everyday to find new ways to give customers full and undivided attention while also understanding that each and every customer is different so you may have the most peachy and pleasant young entrepreneur or the most violent and irate individual who is stuck in their ways and, to the core, would rather not have to deal with technology. It truly becomes a challenge when you master your own craft of customer service and utilize your leadership as necessary tools to your improvement with the company."
good,"Best Buy was my first job ever and I did not think I would ever venture out. I quickly moved up with the company, grew, and developed in my work ethic. I learned how to be a well rounded leader to not only develop my own team, but to assist in developing others. For this I am forever grateful. I am not looking to move on from Best Buy and leave them because I dislike it, it is just time."
good,Es un a empresa muy flexible y profesional que ofrece mucho apoyo a estudiantes.
good,loyalty equals a long career at best buy. I worked for best buy 12 years and it all went to waste due to a misunderstanding. I did love the perks a manager. Major discounts on mobile plans. huge discounts on all accessories.
good,"I've worked here for some time now but i love the flexibility of it between work and school. Easy to move up, but retail is pretty much the same, you get a lot of favoritism but hey its good pay for the amount of work."
good,"Great work place, A lot of things to learn. fast pace and always busy, great discount and employee benefits. Great way to interact with customers and learn what they are looking for in a consumer electronics world"
good,Everyday was full of learning from this company. From learning how to deal with customers to learning about new products and plans. Hardest part about this job was that location. It was slow so there were times when we had no customers.
good,"Best Buy is a great place to bring your unique skills and add value to a culture that strives on team learning and sharing to support the customer and employee.  The values of BBY are at the core of its culture in everything that they do.  The  Employee experience is most valued along with truly finding a ways to solve for the customer.  Its a great work environment that is exciting, fun and interactive."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Best Buy Inc., and it is indeed my dream to end up back there someday. I hope I can make that dream happen. Very lovely atmosphere."
good,"Typical day consists of helping customers needs/wants. Finding out what they need and solving there problems quickly and efficiently. Management are fairly nice most days, but have there off days as well. The hardest part of the job has to be customers that aren't so friendly. Enjoyable aspects of this job are the benefits from working there such as discounts etc."
good,"While working the holiday season back in 2015, the workplace was friendly, easy going, yet fast pace. They always kept you busy, and everyone was always happy to help one another. "
good,Best Buy is a company that allows you to succeed to the highest level with personal ownership.  There are a ton of things that you will learn from working with this company.  To be successful you must be willing to change as times go.  Every day is a new day with the company and you will have a ton of opportunities to showcase your personal talents.
good,I drank the blue kool-aid and had almost 8 years of fun working for Best Buy. I worked in many locations in several states and met some great people..
good,"I've worked at a few Best Buys, some in different states. It's a great company to work for in my opinion. I've come to realize though, that this company feeds off favoritism. If you are on the sales floor and meeting your sales goals, they will favor you and give you more hours. It makes the higher-up people less stressed. Rather than helping people not meeting goals, as often as they say they would, they just rely on you to get better on your own. Also, a lot of people I've come across, are set in stone. They have been with the company for so long, and that's where they are going to stay. In that case, if you get hired on and work your butt off, you're going to be in that position of working your butt off until those set-in-stone people quit (or get fired). Which will last until you leave, because those people are content as heck. None of them want to leave. Sorry for the rant, but if you're looking for a job to grow with, look elsewhere. If you can afford less than 30 hours a week and want to enjoy some nice discounts and meet cool people and work for an overall great company (for a while) by all means, do so."
good,"A typical day at work consists of selling and helping everyone around you. I learned how to sell efficiently, and how to sell to each individual customer to meet their needs. Management is very helpful with making sure everyone has the tools needed to sell and keep customers happy. Fun working environment, team has same goals which makes it easy to work together. Hardest part of the job would have to be understanding that you wont always meet your goal everyday. Most enjoyable part of the job would be making sure the customer leaves happy."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Day at work: Fast paced, employee development, employee development, customer interaction."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Best Buy. I got to meet a lot of people, and also got paid to talk about video games, and movies with my customers. The discount was the best part. "
good,Sell sell sell! the key to the whole thing is to sell the pitch not the product. this is the place where you can learn all about what you use in your daily life
good,"Great place to work! Friendly atmosphere, great co workers! Team oriented! Learned valuable skills, hardest part about the position was the hours for seasonal!"
good,"For a student,going to college .its a really good job.They are really flexible about their scheduling and working with your schedule.Over all a good experience working with them."
good,"I was given the chance to try my hand at video game retail sales when I landed a seasonal job at Best Buy as a Gaming Specialist. It was such a fun job, great people to work with, great managers, wish I could've gotten a part time or full time position."
good,"Daily activities included, motivating great employees who wanted to have fun and learn at the same time. Managers were great and were able to develop a great culture and motivate employees to give their all. Great place to begin a retail life and learn if you are truly interested in learning."
good,The staff was young energetic and outgoing...team work was essential to the success of the company... the benefits are great. Uniform was pretty flexible and comfortable.. management was helpful
good,Good experience and learned alot from the work. Learned how to work in a fast paced environment and properly get things finished to benefit the company.
good,Fun job great people and fast pace.The store relies on you to know how most everything works and be able to fix the problems that come up.  People respect your opinion on what to get to fit there needs.  you have to be good with people because emotions  can he high in their time of need.
good,"Good discount, great community. Only downfalls are the hours you work in retail will be evenings and weekends, and customers are jerks sometimes."
good,En esta empresa tus compañeros te apoyan ademas de que al entrar te dan una induccion de su cultura laboral cada semana vas aprendiendo cosas nuevas ademas de que no te aburres siempre hay algo que hacer.
good,"Depending on your location, the management can be great, a good team-leader, always listening to you and helping you out. Or they can be controlling, or even worse, extremely passive about everything."
good,"It's a good training ground for youngsters who want to develop they're skills in the sales work, good working environment I was blessed to be part of one of the best team in Canada."
good,"Was great working at Geek Squad."
good,Focus on company sales. Great customer service. I liked working there because I'm always into electronic devices then one day I decided to apply at Best Buy I want to sale products since I had few experience about electronic devices I wanted to make useful so I did.  It was very pleasure to work with this company as team.
good,"Awesome job and great pay. Easy going and flexible with scheduling "
good,A typical day at work after clocking in was to check the performance management report. This was to check the prior day to see how our performance was and to match it to month to date. I would then speak with each employee to show them the progress of how our department was doing. I would coach them immediately after checking the report to show them our department progress and their individual sales tracker. I would show them where they were shining and performing well and also how they could improve. I have learned how to lead a team and inspire them to exceed more then what was required. Management was very helpful and when I didn't know something they were informative. My coworkers were a pleasure and fun to be around. They were very friendly while remaining professional. The hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers but maintaining a positive attitude and finding solutions was helpful when the customer was happy with the result. I enjoyed meeting new people and shared the excitement  when a customer was ecstatic about a purchase.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Working at Best buy, you will never experience the same day twice. It is always a new day with promising customers to help and lead into the latest and greatest tech available. Management is there to help the employee help the customer."
good,"It is a good place to work. Good co-workers, management is ok, real easy job, and everyday is enjoyable.  Stock shelves, change prices, and help customers."
good,"Good place to work, managers try to help as best they can. Fun culture, interesting conversations with customers all day."
good,"Fun environment, but barely any full time positions to advance to. No room for promotion and advancement in the company, no benefits being a part time worker."
good,"overall great place to wokr great employees job security and hours we not always good, most of hours were based off of jobs demand and if not available then hours were not present. overall good place to work"
good,"I love working at Best Buy, I think the staff is wonderful and management is always there when you need them. I never have the same day twice there which is something I enjoy."
good,i like worked with best buy but the salary was not good there they was good with costumer and they had free service for special costumer.
good,A typical day of work consists of providing a solution to customers technological problems. Everyday there will be a new problem hence you learn something new each day. Management is fair but focuses on sales (typical). Co-workers function as a team. Mostly problem solvers. The hardest part of the job is overcrowded deadlines. To many devices to be fixed in too little time.
good,"I love working as a Consultant Agent for Geek Squad. The only downsides are broken systems used by management, and angry ignorant customers, though you'll find that at any customer facing job."
good,Very good place to work at. Everybody is super friendly and helpful if you are in need of help. Great benefits and an awesome pay. Person can learn a lot from working in place like this.
good,"good place if you like technology and are knowledgeable, Help customers and get sales, there are metric requirements, so sometimes you may have to over sell the customer if you don't want to get chewed out by your supervisor"
good,Overall satisfying work and benefits. Quite frankly no one pays more than Best Buy as far as a retail job is concerned. Really enjoyable work experience as long as you have a great leader in place.
good,"I used to hate Best Buy with a passion, and wouldn't go near them because they were incompetent and didn't know what they were looking for or what the products were. Now that I've worked there and times have changed, I've seen the training they go through to make sure customers get the right products and the help they want. (Stay away from Geek Squad, though)"
good,"Its, a great company to work for, especially if your looking to build a career in sales. Leader ship is good and the Cultural background is a mixed of ever different race."
good,I love Best Buy.  Awesome products.  Awesome people.  Great culture of productivity.  Company trusts its store level leadership team to run a business without micromanaging.
good,Best Buy is a great company that strives to deliver strong Expert Service and great Employee Engagement to deliver on the financial outcomes. It is challenging and rewarding.
good,"This is a good company that supports their employees success in the company. Informative, but a great and positive environment. Best Buy was a positive environment"
good,I really enjoy working at Best Buy. The only reason why I am posting my resume is to see what else is out there and if possible a better job offer.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Friendly staff and management. I have been with the company for close to 3 years now and i dont regret a day of it. the only negative being that you have to work holidays because it is a retail store
good,"I left the company due to health complications at the time. Otherwise, great place to work. Great staff, excellent management team, and amazingly simple job."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Best Buy i learned so much thanks to the Geek Squad. I love meeting new people which i had the chance to meet some amazing characters. You really form a bond with your coworkers, management and customers  as well with all the different story being exchanged this is a great place for any young adult to work that is willing to learn. There was no hard days at work cause i enjoyed what i did. Working in mobile is the best if you are a phone person and love to set things up in a personal way"
good,"Been at Geek Squad for 10 months. Came in knowing the bad rep that they get. All I have to say is that it depends on the location and staff at the store. My location is full of knowledgeable people that are more than willing to help those that are reasonable. "
good,"Fun place, great culture. Management can be hit or miss but mostly good leadership. The corporate campus has a lot of great features."
good,"Hectic  during the holidays, but still a fun place to work. Obviously, you have to be prepared to work in a retail environment."
good,"For the 4 years in retail, both sales and customer service aspect, the company has taught me very much. They strive to make you a better sales associate. If you show effort, management will see it and help you excel to greater things."
good,"Working here is great, never had an issue just ready to move onto the next step in my life and look for a new career. No issues great company no problems."
good,"Typical day at work 9 times out of 10 it'd be very busy. The hardest part about this job was holidays such as black friday, but through all that team work was always in play."
good,"Average day is getting to every customer and demonstrating our full soulition/ promise. At Best Buy, I've learned to build strong rapports with each person, figure out their greatest desires and wants for the product they have came in for; displaying its features and drawing them in. Once you have taken the dollar amount out of focus and shined the light on life value, then you may close the sale. Management is fantastic, they go well out of their way to maintain their employees happinesss. Its non commission based so co-workers arent a issue at all. New customers who never learned anything about how todays world functions has to be the hardest part of the job. Demonstrating how a product works and getting the customer excited about it has to be the most enjoyable"
good,Always keeps you up to date with the newest electronics. Also great discounts on items. They also help you to get apple certified.
good,"Lost my leadership position to a re-structure but Best Buy will forever be the greatest place to work. I had tons of fun while also be challenged on a daily basis, highly recommend."
good,I would reccommend Best Buy to any friend or family member. The company has amazing values and strives to always be the best while already being the best!
good,"Poor work/life balance, but good benefits. never same work schedule and the objectives of the job changed daily. Tough company to work for."
good,"love working at best buy, nice people, great working environment, just looking for something new in my life, something more challenging for me."
good,Best Buy is one of the best electronics retailers out there to work for.  They take care of their own and have a great work ethic.  Pay is not quite the best but they make up for it in benefits and discounts.
good,Planning and managing inbound operations. Working with multiple carriers. Learned to think fast and outside the box. Co-workers were exceptional. Loved delivering on what was promised.
good,"I worked for Best Buy when the company had just begun to get noticed by not just geeks, but any and everyone that could afford some kind of electronic device or at least wanted one.  In less than three months I went from night stocker to supervisor.  At the time the company was really big on promoting those who had dreams of moving up in the company.  Hard work was often rewarded with all expenses paid trips for you and a guest.  My co-workers were more like a second family.  The management however, I would consider the evil step-mother.  The little people worked while the big shots got all the recognition and the credit."
good,i came into best buy need a lot of knowledge they were great at helping you and getting you to the top. the down side is once you get to the top compensation dose not change
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Working at the service counter can be a little bit daunting, but it's quite enjoyable to those who like working with a team. There have been days where I felt I was the only one doing anything, other days where I felt everyone was taking over my job to give me a break. Working through problem customers and getting them to calm down even when their products are not functioning properly can be a challenge, but the end results of having happy customers walking out the door is well worth it."
good,"They actually paid better than what I expected from a retail company. It was a fun and competitive environment. My duties included:"
good,Working at Best Buy was truly exciting and a great learning experience for those who would like to pursue as a sales coordinator. Learning what's new with technology was never boring.
good,Great place to work for.  The environment is relaxed with motivation to succeed.  Only down side is lots of younger workers that do not have work ethic and managers will not hold them accountable.
good,I am just a seasonal employee but I felt very welcomed. The managers are very helpful when they are not busy. I learned a lot more about electronic devices there.
good,"Had fun working with my coworkers as well as teaching them how to sell phones to customers based on their lifestyles. Our team would find ways to attract customers every sunday. We would also troubleshoot any problems customers had because while i worked there, we made it our missions to not only sell them a mobile device but also to get to know them and set up a relationship that would keep brining them to us which in return bought in greater sales."
good,"Fun company too work for with an encouraging staff. In the time I've been there the turn over rate was quite high, with minimal room for advancement."
good,The Music was Loud and distracting. I was unable to hear myself think while trying to provide the best Customer Service possible.
good,"This was a tremendous place to gain a lot of accounting experience. I learned so much about the accounting field. A typical day would start with making a spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel for either a budget, accounts payable or accounts receivable for a business. I would reconcile bank accounts and post ledgers. Management was amazing and willing to teach and communicate knowledge they have learned. The hardest part of my job there was trying to find things to keep me busy. It was not a large company so there was some downtime in which the manager and I would talk about various accounting topics. The most enjoyable part of my job was performing task for forensic accountants for on-going legal issues."
good,"Typical day at work would be helping customers, adding on protection plans, handling money, opening credit cards, stocking, answering phones and cleaning."
good,Currently in turn around mode the company is recovering from economic downturn and a changing industry.  I would recommend to someone starting a career or long term.
good,Great  place to work. Diversity company. Great benefits. Able to work with multiple computer networks. Learn a lot of knowledge for future advancement.
good,My mornings always start as the opening manager letting all employees and vendors in. I then start by sending last nights numbers out and getting the new day started by setting goals for the new day. While maintaining the store look and feel and helping with any issue that may arise.
good,A typical day of work would be standing and fast walking 100% of the time but the people who I worked with made the day better.
good,Other than the fact that the managers i worked for were not the best Best Buy was one of my most favorite jobs to work for. While working for this location i learned a lot about the products and a lot about how to sell them. The training that i received while working for Best Buy was phenomenal.
good,"My day starts out with me printing out reports for my employees individual performance, print off the daily schedule of the employees that will be in every department of the store. Taking the reports and getting the employees ""Check-In"" where we establish SMART goals for the day that will get them to achieve their sales goals. Then throughout the day I deal with customer issues, making sure customers are being matched with employees, assisting with any employee issues (customer related, process related, or other emergencies), dealing with Manager On Duty issues that could be customer realated, process related, SHRINK related, Inventory or merchandising issues. As well as doing in the moment coachings that  will help the employee better their selves. Managing these tasks on a daily basis for the most part, but after doing this for several years I have learned to be able to handle multiple tasks throughout the day and still manage to get them finished in a timely manner. This is done because I have a great support staff of direct reports as well as peer managers to delegate some tasks."
good,Love this place. Friendly and helpful co-workers. Store is located in a nice city with a wide selection of items all at a great price.
good,"Loved working for this company."
good,Best Buy is a great company to work for! I worked in 4 stores and held many different positions. Hardest part is holiday season due to hours and being away from family. Most enjoyable part of the job is the team atmosphere and helping team members develop in their career.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Empowers employees to be leaders and teach them leadership skills, Business plans, purchase stock orders  "
good,This company has been very good to me. Especially now that I have had a baby. My only problem is there is no room for advancement in the AP department and AP is treated like glorified door greeters. AP should be treated as an important function for the company as this department prevents the company from losing money due to theft both internal and external.
good,"Still workign here due to the exceptional discount we receive. Been through 3 different managers in 2 years at my store. Each one has their pros and cons, has every manager at every corporation does."

good,Working at Best Buy helped me quite a bit with personable skills and  I gained a ton of experience with face to face selling.  Great company but you won't start making good money until you move into a supervisor role.  Pay is very good once you've reached that point.
good,Best Buy overall has been a great experience for me. I have been working here since high school. Everyone here is pretty cool. The hardest part about this job is having issues with orders. But get to work with awesome co workers and good customers all day.
good,"Best Buy is a fun place to work as long as you stay on the good side of the managers. I found that even though they taught you a lot at the job and they paid you pretty well sometimes their management will make you want to quit. As a warehouse worker at Best Buy you will most likely work the truck days which are 2 days a week. They can be up to about 3000 units and you must be willing to stay until the job is complete. Other things you might be doing would be weekly planogram loads, basically, you would go to each department and make sure the product is placed where it should be. The hardest part of the job would be the scheduling, you never get a set schedule per week and it usually changes last minute. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the employee discount and the co-workers. They have a lot of great co-workers at Best Buy you just have to be careful what you say."
good,"A typical day would be assisting customers based on my product knowledge, learning to stay focused while checking in with management for a quick smile if needed in between customers and workflow. The hardest part of the job would be waiting on or getting co-workers from other job duties that they are busy with. The most enjoyable part of the job would be conversation with customers known or co-workers during and after workflow."
good,Great company to work for. Be prepared to work. Teaches you to be proactive. Learn skills you can carry on through life. Fun atmosphere.
good,"A great place to build your customer service skills. The management may sometimes be lacking in experience or maturity, but the environment really feels like home. You're part of a family at Best Buy. It may not pay very well, you may be struggling to pay bills or live on your own, but at least there is opportunity to move into something better. Work hard, show you're the best, don't be afraid of new situations, and eventually, there will be potential for a promotion."
good,"Great company to work for, learning about new and innovative products all the time! Great to work with customers and helping them stay up to date !"

good,"Best Buy is a diverse company where you get to meet all types of customers and co-workers. At this company i learn to interact with meany people, from simplifying situations to finding custom solutions for each customer. i then grew to teaching coaching and training others to follow in my footsteps to continue being successful and help the companies progress. The hardest part of the job at Best Buy is solving complex issues that where out of my hands at times. with good network i was able to find ways to solve issues. The most enjoyable part of the job was working around challenges,teaching and coaching others on how to think on their feet."
good,Most days when i worked i had a good experience. i dealt with the day to day services and exchanges. I have trained over 20 employees and learned the in and outs of all store work. my co workers were great and very helpful with everything that i did.. the hardest part of my job was dealing with angry customers. i enjoyed my coworkers the most and the comradery.

good,Great little college job. Pays better than most retail. Works hard to have a good culture and environment.
good,"A typical day at work for me consist of my reviewing the previous days numbers. Reviewing my individual goal for the day and my departments goal. I then overlook applicants online resumes and conduct over the phone interviews with qualified applicants. I then communicate with my supervisor and teammates to prepare Home Theater customers orders. We determine what products and Geek Squad services are best for them based on their consultation visit. The hardest part of my work day is my lunch break because I never get to enjoy my meal. I am constantly being paged to assist my co workers, therefore I sometimes do no take a lunch break. The most enjoyable part of my day is when I am able to fix a customer issue and prevent them from demanding refunds for their products and services."
good,Rewarding helping employees with their human resources needs.
good,Great discounts as incentives and good benefits. Good work hours. Plenty of different job opportunities.
good,during he holidays its very busy with the right team your long hours seem very short. the discounts are great. management always helped me with whatever i needed. the hardest part was probably when it slowed down and having to stand up for hours at a time but you get used to it. i learned great customer service and to not be shy and be friendly and sociable.
good,best buy was awesome i learned so much about computers while i was there. management was really helpful and supportive also. most days were really fast paced and i really enjoyed putting that large sale together.
good,"A typical day at BestBuy consist of helping customers and providing them with the product and knowledge they need. I have gained a great amount of self confidence and great customer interactions by engaging with different social groups. BestBuy has a positive atmosphere and give us every opportunity to grow a little more in the company each day. I would say the most enjoyable  part of the job is to make sure we meet our goals because we are always rewarded. As long the job is done correctly and expectations are met, bestbuy is a fun place to work."

I use all these skills on a daily basis."
good,"Typical work day would be helping customers understand their product. Usually customers come in with problems that consist of their units needing to be fixed. Management is great, Co-workers are alright and the hardest part about my day is telling the customer that we have to hold on to their product for either an hour, one day or a week (depending on workload) in order to fix it. Reason why its hard is because people are attached to their products and I understand that! The most enjoyable part about my day is actually getting to fix things!"

good,"One of the best companies i have ever worked for as far as friendly and fun co-workers and management. You will learn constantly, hardest part of the job is keeping up with learning. Most enjoyable part of the job, working with customers who come in confused and frustrated with technology and you being the one to help them so much so that they write a letter to your manager saying how amazing you are and how they wish you luck with your future at best buy and your compensation and recognition from management is a thank you and 200 path to exultant points worth $10. I love this company but it does not matter how hard you work or how good your sales are you start as low as they can get you at and in one year your best chance of a raise is $0.40 if your the best $0.25 for most. When an employer sees Best Buy on your resume they know you were properly trained and if you were able to stick it out there long enough that you would benefit their company. Excellent first job or working your way through school."
good,"this is the best place to start in the IT field, there is a lot to learn, the best part of this job is the extended training."
good,"Each day I would check our sales standing compared to all other stores in the district to know where we needed to focus on to be number one.

Also would pull large items like T.V.s stored back there for sales floor members. On many days I would control the cameras and look for people trying to steal from the store. If I caught someone before then were able to leave, I would detain them in a room and call the cops. Do my paper work log the video, then let the cops do the rest."

good,"Working at Best Buy has been one of the most enjoyable experiences of my life because of the people I have gotten to interact with. One of my favorite aspects of Best Buy is that we are non-commisson based, which makes the experience more enjoyable for not only the customers, but also the employees as well (since we don't need to fight each other for sales). By interacting with customers on a daily basis, I have enhanced my communication skills so that I can listen to customers needs, interpret what is being told to me, analyze the information I have been given to find a solution, and process the information to sort through options to find the best possible solution. I have become so comfortable talking to strangers at Best Buy."

Sometimes it's hard dealing with some of the customers and reaching our goals but when we do we love to celebrate. We have our standard procedures that we follow which is really simple and our closing duties are really basic. The most enjoyable part of the job is when we get to do group activities with each other. It gives us all time to catch up and laugh and have fun.
good,Its an okay place to work for younger high school and college students but the management isn't great and the job security isn't either because I got laid off. But other then that it is a fun place to work no commission on sales though so if you end up selling a 50inch tv you just get a good job from your supervisor and thats it same pay check

In Mobile it takes alot of steps to complete the sale process. From helping them find the right phone for them and all the accessories they will need. Then explaining the Buy Back and Black Tie so they understand how it will be a valuable service for them. Then activating the phone in Beastt, hoping all the time it works right and doesn't crash. Then getting the phone up and running, explaining how the phone works, installing their accessories, and finally making sure the phone works ok."

good,"Fantastic people to work with, decent benefits for a part-time job, but can be difficult to move up. Shifts are variable. I've had shifts that start at 6am and some that start at 9pm for the holiday season."
good,Best Buy had an amazing team to work with. The co-workers there had an amazing work ethic and made the job feel as if it wasn't a job. It drove me to perform better as I had a positive attitude.
good,Great place to work. Fair compensation. Great work environment. Prepares you for not only Best Buy but future careers if you want to switch to something else
good,A typical day working at best buy included learned and teaching product knowledge while chasing a sales goal. The hardest part of the job was not getting caught up continually talking to just one customer.
good,Best Buy was a great position to work while I was completing my college education.  The job kept me moving and didn't let me lose rack of what I was working for.  I highly recommend people to work at Best Buy and learn from their core values.
good,I really enjoyed my time at Best Buy i would love to go back to work for them if there is an opportunity. My coworkers were all great people to work with and the company events were fun.
good,Keep up to date on the latest tech. Great employee discounts. Flexible work schedule. High demand for organization and efficiency. Must work Holidays. Every employee works Black Friday
good,"Best Buy went through some severe downs before rebounding under Hubert Joly.  Overall, it's a good company to work for, as long as you work well with customers.  There have been a number of re-organizations over the years, which could be stressful for supervisors and managers, as positions were sometimes eliminated, though line-level employees were rarely downsized."
good,"Gave me various skills to which I still use today. The work environment was was unlike any I've ever been apart of with everyone sharing a common goal to succeed and grow. Not to forget the added benefit to be around all the latest tech and share your knowledge  and enthusiasm with all customer, co-workers, family and friends."
good,Great entry level job. Flexible schedule. Part time and full time positions. Great job advancement. Recommend job for high school students and young adults.
good,"as the only merch tech I would review daily workload & planograms to be set, troubleshoot non working displays(av displays, mobile phones & cpu's), install new OS in displays, mount & set 39"" - 80"" TV's, set vendor & brand displays for Samsung, Sony, LG & Vizio; install & set in dash radio display. "
good,"Good place to work, great benefits, clean place, very well organized, there isn't much else to say I'm just trying to reach this stupid minimum requirement"

good,"Had lots of training in sales and an enjoyable atmosphere to work in.There were times when things ike sales quotas got stressful, but no one was ever fired because of it."
good,"It was a wonderful experience to work for Best Buy. The managers were great, helpful, and always understanding. The discounts were great and the people even better"
good,It was a good experience I learned a lot about sales and customer services. Scheduling wasn’t always in my favor but when I would have my drill weekends they would give me the days off
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I loved working there!! Wish I were still close enough to make it feasible for me. Fun job, continued learning, discounts, awesome vendor rewards and discounts ON TOP of getting BestBuy discount!! I had great bosses and supervisors. Staying late some nights was not really great.

good,Love my position at best buy.  Workplace culture is great.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with unhappy customers that had a bad experience with products that did not work for them.
good,"Working at Best Buy was an experience. You were always learning something new. The tech department was always involving us, bringing in new 'toys' for us to try out. I would reccomend working for them. It's an easy laid back environment"
good,The people there were fun to be around everyone always help each other. The manager always had your back if a customer is getting too aggressive. While in bestbuy I learn new way on how to talk to different people and make them feel comfortable.
good,"It was great loved working there! but it was a seasonal position. great people, great environment. had team meeting and team events and pot lucks. and daily competitions."
good,"I've been with the company for almost 5 years. Regardless if you are management, sales, or operations, your success comes down to you. Expectations are set and you can choose to meet them, rise above them, or not."
good,"I love the people I work with. If the pay was a little more, I would have no reason to leave. Both my manger and the store manager are very hands on. They will not ask you do something they will not do themselves."
good,"Good place for a part time job, if your going to school, employee discounts, etc. Fun work environment, fun customers, fun coworkers, great first line supervisors, overall lead management at the time was meh"
good,Loved my time spent at Best Buy/ Geek squad. Retail life wasnt my style and I decided to pursue other employment. I would recommend working here if you don't mind working weekends and holidays.
good,"Geek Squad Consultation Agent is a fast paced, but rewarding job. The work life balance is on par with a typical 9-5, in the since that you can have a life outside of work, but sometimes work is so enjoyable you will opt to stay extra if allowed."
good,Only negative that I could say was that failing management was not removed from their position to make way for a better fit because the store had its cliques and they were friends with upper management
good,"I worked at the Best Buy in merrillville for just about a year, it was one of the best places I have ever had the privilege of working at. Like any place, if you work hard and actually care about your job like I did, you will be respected and well-liked. The managers all looked out for me, made me feel like I was making a difference and that I was apart of a team. My only issue was with the lack of advancement opportunities, I applied for a full-time position several times and despite hard work and dedication I was passed over for someone else."
good,"That's where my journey started as an IT in the US. I will always be thankful for the opportunity they gave me to grow as a man, tech, and teammate. Up to this day I still learn new things."
good,I still occupy Best Buy floor space as an Oculus Brand Ambassador - to contribute to the enthusiasm with a high level of sales expertise is a Premium Retail Services deliverable.
good,"Best Buy tends to attract great employees and has a friendly, inclusive work culture. The management does their best to keep employees happy. "
good,As asset protection it can be pretty boring but it is very relaxed. The management at my location is great and there are lots of hours that I had without anyone reprimanding me for staying too long.
good,"18 years with Best buy, lots of fond memories and lots of firsts as well as rewards. Just time to start something new. I have worked at a few Geeksquad USo's and this area is very poor. Poor management from the top, poor acountability. Poor advancement"
good,"I have to say the company is great, and with all of the companies I love I have to say I enjoy going to work and they really do care about if you are trained in you department."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Out of all the jobs I've had, this has been my favorite by far. The work can be a little dull at times but the people make up for it for miles. I have never worked for a company more accepting and supporting. My department is quite laid back so I've had a blast with these people. The culture at my store makes me want to come into work everyday and inspires me to be better. I just wished that they could have payed more and given me more hours so that I could stay with them."
good,It was honestly a good learning experience to work here. Everyone was really friendly and eager to help the customers. Management was at its finest as well.
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work for a part-time, full-time, or seasonal job. It is not a place to make a career though because the company gets rid of manager positions and restructures the company often."
good,"Best Buy as a company is great! I have never worked for a better company. Best Buy cares about thier employees and tries hard to create the best employee experience you can have. Fast paced environment definitely makes the day pass quickly. Amazing benefits, discounts and rewards programs."
good,Beat buy is a decent first place to work they offer good benefits ( for full time employees) most of the cons for best buy are the general retail cons . It's actually a good company
good,"I loved working for Best Buy. They had amazing management. You are a able to get bonuses if your department went over their quota for sales, and yes this was for non-managers as well. I was going to college at the time and they worked around my school schedule very well as well. But end of the day other jobs pay more than a box store so I moved on but if pay was higher would love to work for them again."
good,Buen lugar para trabajar pero muy poco sueldo y sin comisión
good,Best Buy is a great place to work. Great learning environment. Great benefits. Competitive pay. Flexiable part time hours. Great to employees. Best to go into the store in person to help hiring process.
good,"Love working with my friends, the pay could be better but the benefits are pretty good. The discount is quite nice as well. Feel like the company is making good choices moving into the future"
good,"Working at Best Buy is honestly great for any college students looking to make extra money or to cover their responsibilities. They are great with working around your schedule. Sometimes it does get a little slow and the hours cut back quite a bit, but for someone who is in school its great. The work environment is fun. You get to work with most people that are also in school."
good,"I loved the environment and everyone I worked with. It was the best job I've had so far. The management always stepped in and was there to talk to if we needed anything, they were very easy to talk to."
good,"If you want to build experience in sales, customer service, or light IT, work here for a bit. You get good benefits to begin with, and the discount is pretty good."
good,I liked being able to learn about new technology and generally had a good time.The employee discount is so good and overall the customers treated me with respect
good,"Management was usually great! They worked with me whenever something came up with family and I needed a certain time/day off. My managers clearly cared about the well-being of their employees. Management encouraged employees to sharpen their decision-making skills. They also offer classes (once or twice per month) for developing leadership skills."
good,"Management and coworkers really helped create a family and team first work culture, going in everyday was not a drag. Really laid back environment, I would definitely recommend."
good,Working for this company is amazing. It made me the young leader that I am today. It allowed to me network out to others and learn how to have transparent conversations which is something I was never too fond of.
good,"Good place to work but have to make sure you have a lot of patients especially if you're in customer service returns, exchanges, online pickups, delivery skills."
good,"As a Customer Service Support Representative, you will serve as a liaison between the laboratory and our customers in response to inquiries and problems. This involves researching, troubleshooting and resolving customer problems. Our Customer Service Support Representative performs a wide variety of administrative/clerical duties. This is a high volume call center environment; taking 100+ calls per day."
good,"Great place to work, competitive compensation.  Great benefits package.  Development programs ad internal growth opportunities.  Ability to relocate across the country."
good,"It was a great place to work when I first started there but, after being there for 6+ years it's becoming stagnant and stressful. I enjoyed every aspect of it."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"An average day would consist of assisting customers with average issues that may occur when conducting business with Best Buy. I find that the people I work with are often filled with a great sense of humor and better personalities. However at times coworkers can often times be under motivated, leading to more work on an individual employee."
good,My Time with Best Buy was a positive experience because it gave me the chance to learn several new skills that will help supplement me in the future. I enjoyed the management as well.
good,"This is a well enough paying job for a college student or young adult with plenty of hours and opportunity. Very flexible for schedules, and a good management team."
good,I have been working at bestbuy for the past 3.5 years and have always felt at home no matter what store I work in. I never feel pressured at work and they always accommodate any problem I have.
good,I loved Best Buy while i was employed there. The work enviroment was friendly and welcoming. Got the oppurtunity to learn a great deal and meet new people.
good,"had to work black friday"
good,"I enjoy the atmosphere here including the culture, the people, and the management. The sales structure is pressured, but rewarding and the goals are obtainable if you put effort into it."
good,The people that you meet are pretty cool. Laid back environment. It was a lot of fun. They taught me a lot about the things that i know today about electronics.
good,"The management team, team, and work environment was so fun and upbeat!"
good,"When I started at Best Buy I had a terrific General Manager. You had to be competitive to keep your job with him but it was also rewarding and just felt nice to do things right. Later on he got promoted and we got a new GM. This one was lazy and barely did anything beyond taking care of customer problem that were right in front of him at the time. The quality of the workplace plummeted. A few examples would be that we stopped winning awards for our store and our Christmas party budget was almost nothing. "
good,"Great company to work for, lots of areas for advancement for those willing to apply themselves.  Varied levels of expertise depending on what field of employment you pursue."
good,Consirate to workers and would help you out and were very understanding of individual situation as in if they needed some time off but would prefered to be warned ahead of time
good,Enjoyed working for best buy but sales wasn't my thing. Liked the ability to learn through the best buy learning modules. I was a Microsoft Specialist and was able to attend a conference in Seattle. That was awesome!
good,For many people this was their first job where one is taught the basics of retail and customer service. I was fortunate enough to have excellent mentors and an amazing leadership team that was able to coach and guide every individual to success. I would defenitly recommend to work for Best Buy and give it your all.
good,"There's a lot to do in a day, from cleaning/merchandising to selling and customer service.  They have a great Medical/Dental plan as well as RSP matching, EPP, and Stock purchase options."
good,Management was great. The hardest part was Black Friday. The most enjoyable was my coworkers. The benefits were amazing. I would definitely work there again.
good,enjoyed the culture of the job. Great opportunity to interact with customers and learned about electronic devices i may have never came in contact with otherwise.
good,"A typical day at Best Buy is pretty busy. You have to make sure the store pick up items is all ready to go for customers when they arrive come pick up. You have to ring out customers throughout the day, and also return items that comes back to the store. Management is very superior and organized, there is a store meeting every morning before opening, letting us employees know what our goal is for the day and what we need to work on throughout the day to reach our store goal. The workplace in Best Buy is very fun, you get to know first hand about electronics and devices that comes in stores, and learn how to function them or even fix a situation in case any customer have a question about a item in the store. The hardest part about Best Buy is having to be up to date and knowing all the devices and learning how to function them. You have to know everything about the item in order to sell it. The most enjoyable part working for Best Buy is that you learn something new from everyone and the electronics that you would never know if you've never worked there. You also learn how to pitch to customers to sell an item which is a very great skill to know. Working at Best Buy is a great and comfortable place to work at I highly recommend it, especially if you love electronics and want to learn how to sell things in near future."
good,"Good place to work. Good benefits even for part time! Great people, management is a mixed bag. They all seem to have ""god complexes"", some are awesome managers and it makes you want to live up to their expectation while others could use some retraining, such as a refresher course on how to interact with others. Some act as if they've been living in a cave for the last 5 years. You get a great social life and earn confidence by engaging with customers and vendors. Cool store perks and vendor credits toward discounted, free, and even unreleased subscriptions, service plans, tech, products, software, even discounted company stock. Some helpful advice, NEVER LEAVE HOME WITHOUT YOUR BLUE SHIRT!"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,If i open the day starts with getting the work area ready for customers. On a monthly bases new learning techniques and product information is provided to keep our knowledge of the newest and greatest products. The staff is willing and happy to help.
good,The greatest thing of best buy will be the people you work with. Holidays are stressful. Work/life balance is non existent during christmas time. Great place to work part time.
good,"it was fun, from the management to my coworker. what I enjoy the work area, all of the management were helpful they work with you to achieve with your goal and theirs."
good,"Great first job, family environment."
good,"A typical day our call volume can be very high, as a team we recieve an average of 30-40 inbound calls per agent, and about 20-25 outbound calls. In addition to that we also handle the escalation department, where we assist our clients with solutions to their delivery needs."
good,"In this position, I had the opportunity to obtain knowledge regarding different aspects of technology and how they interact with other.  The work atmosphere was comfortable and most employees attempted to work as a team.  "
good,"this was my dream job and for a while that dream was fully realized, but then came the new GM for store 509, it was by his horrible mismanagement that many of the core employees that made the store a joy to visit has abandoned ship,the store and supervisors are awesome but the GM could possibly drive you away like he did his other employees."
good,"great company to build a career at.  You can shift disciplines as well which is unheard of in many companies.  Benefits are great, pay is really good, if you do your best, you will be rewarded for it.  If not, just apply for a different role and you should be good to go."
good,I learned how to shipping and receiving is done. How to properly load and unload product from tvs- refrigerators. I learned hiw to each other people my job so that u may help elsewhere within the store.
good,Fun company to work for. New technology is always great to be around. Downfall lots of turn over at the part time level. constant grind to deliver sales metrics
good,"The typical day can move either really quickly or really slowly depending on the day of the week and the hour. Mornings on weekdays tend to drag on because customers do not really show up until around 2 or 3 hours after the store opens. Weekends can be very hectic if there is an event or promotion but usually the store is staffed accordingly."
good,"I really enjoyed working here, the amount of customers keeps you busy and when you are slow, the employees are great sources of knowledge and entertainment. Management depends on where you work but yearly do a survey on things they can improve on and they take it seriously and change to better help the employees."
good,I started working at Best Buy for my first junior BA job. I must say this job really taught me a lot about the BA field and helped me get better understanding of the role.
good,"It's very much a customer service environment, coupled with an arsenal of product knowledge and recommendations. The culture is very welcoming and inclusive. The hardest part of the job sometimes is the scheduling around holidays and promotional sales. The best part of the job is the people, the environment, the discounts, and the product training."
good,"My work experience was great except the open door policy was a little wishy washy when it came to exposing unfair work ethics of other employees with no physical proof, for instance I couldn’t prove being verbally sexually harassed by a female department lead and because I showed no interest in her she would drag me on performance reviews made by leads periodically."
good,"Best Buy was a fun high school job for me, I enjoyed my coworkers. Customer-facing jobs are always a little stressful because the general public isn't so great sometimes."
good,Working at Bestbuy had shown me many skills! Quality customer services and sales training and much more. In August 2018 I was sent to Phoenix Arizona to do sales training!
good,"make sure you try to learn where all the products are"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"•	Conduct requirement level work effort estimations and integrate for the whole system."
good,Good place to work and had great time with learning new product as well as skills development. Management was great as well as help push development of associates to better them selves.
good,"An excellent job with a professional and helpful management,  While working there it provides a great opportunity to learn about the latest electronics and develop customer service skills,  "
good,Fast and ever changing environment where all days were filled with troubleshooting and multi-tasking from the moment you came to the moment you left. Loved my job.
good,"Best Buy was my first job. Lots of things to learn about products and selling. You have to meet many goals from sales to credit applications. As a company, Best Buy is great."
good,I was hired for seasonal purposes. My responsibilities included maintaining the register and assist customers with their purchases along with keeping a clean area for my work space. Also I was in charge of making sure the surrounding area was stocked with certain items
good,the management was fun to work with and will work with you all they cant and if they cant they will reach out for help to get you the training you need top advance your career
good,"Super easy and laid back, not a lot of tasks. consistant shifts, reasonable breaks, and flexible hours! would recommend to people looking for a easy going job."
good,Hours are very flexible which is good since many of the employees were full time students and only needed to work part time. The job was very fast paced at times but nothing too stressful.
good,It was a seasonal position during Christmas. I was sales associate on the floor and enjoyed working with the people and giving them the best customer service possible.
good,"A good place to work part-time. I assume full-time would be a little more difficult because advancement, though possible, will require significant amounts of time."
good,"Best Buy has one of the best training programs I've ever seen, hours are manageable, schedule is flexible, breaks are always available, benefits are good."
good,I don't have much to say here about anything. I have enjoyed working electronic retail. It is fast paced can be stressful at times and others it can be really really simple and easy to do.
good,"Great Company with a great CEO."
good,I Had A Great Time Working With The Geek Squad For Best Buy. I Would Recommend Working for Best Buy. The Management Staff Was Fantastic. Everyone Worked Together To complete Each Task.
good,"Nice place to work at as an entry level job. All employees are nice and work together. Hours aren’t too bad. Store hours are 10-9 so you don’t work too early and not too late. Managers are excellent communicators. Like said before, great place to start as an entry level job."
good,"fun and easy to get the hang of things, able to learn new things and really understand more about technologies and the new things that are on the market"
good,"Fast paced job with lovable crew members who made the tasks easier and enjoyable. "
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Nice place to work,Fast paced environment . No commission so give true advise to customers and sell as per their needs. Price match guarantee. all home solution under one umbrella."
good,"Loved working here it was a great Experience, I’ve worked at Best Buy for about 2 years now and the management and co workers were amazing so I overall recommend."
good,"For all the knocks against retail, Best Buy has done nothing but take care of me as a professional and a person.  They have stuck with me through marriage, the birth of my children, and finally my graduation from college.  I would recommend Best Buy as a place to work to just about anyone who is looking for a job, who is willing to work, and wants a legitimate chance to move up within a company."
good,"Great teams of people to work with. Fantastic discount, management are pretty decent and the company is willing to work around school schedules. Overall good"
good,"always fun, the customers wasn't to bad, the workers are amazing, everyone is treated as family, they always go above and beyond, flexible with hours."
good,"I enjoyed my job at Best Buy, my coworkers were fun and bosses were very understanding. I left because I moved and at the time I didn't give a 2 weeks notice which I regret now because it was a fun job that I would have liked to go back to."
good,"Best Buy is a wonderful company to be apart of, from seasonal to management there is continued opportunity for growth. An amazing culture to be apart of and a very family oriented feel through many of the stores."
good,My time at GeekSquad was a wonderful experience. They make sure you are 100% trained to take on that job or any juaftrr them. They company as a whole give you insensitive to want to work.
good,"management, co-workers and vendors were all great awesome environment. pay was minimum wage sometime not enough hours but overall great place to work at for students."
good,I always stay busy at Best Buy.  My day is non-stop which I love.  The people I work with are great and my managers are definitely about the people.  Managers are willing to work with your schedule which I haven't had to deal with personally but it makes it easy for my coworkers who have school or second jobs.
good,Working for Best Buy was the most rewarding time in my working career up to this time. I enjoyed my time with this company. Every day was a new experience for myself as well as the amazing team of folks that I had the opportunity to work with for a few years
good,"I very much enjoyed my time with Best Buy and have cultivated many many great relationships with co-workers, management, and senior management. I will be missing it, if not returning when a better position becomes available."
good,The best place to work as the everyone is really helpful and friendly. They become your second family and as an employee you look forward to go to work everyday.
good,Good place to work. Workers are great. Certain managers should not be in the position that they are because they will take things personally out on you.
good,always happy to work with others and getting to know how things work in best buy mobile the best part of being there was making customers happy and satisfied
good,Best Buy was a great company to work for. They allowed me to have flexible schedules and we’re always open to different workday opportunities. Management was management just like anywhere. The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with different personalities but at the end of the day we all came together and worked as a team to accomplish our sales goal. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be interacting with customers and teaching them different skills and educating them on electronics and home devices.
good,I would work there anytime and would love to be a pert of the team I was in. Unfortunately I was given a seasonal position and worked there for only 3 months. I was taken off there employee access even before the last day of work. I would have loved to have a full time position there. I dedicated a lot of time there and customer service on a face to face level is a satisfaction for me when it is meeting that expectation.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"It’s was fun working at Best Buy, good pay they take good care of their employee...hope to find a good job like Bestbuy...the big problem is they make you work like sleeve"
good,"I started as CA (front desk client interaction) and moved to an ARA (back room fixing computers) position."
good,Excellent company with great potential. Can advance to great heights within the company. Competative salaries with similar companies. Wonderful company benefits.
good,"You will always have an answer to your questions and no confusion about your role at Best Buy. Most of the training is online, and there's very little differences from store to store. Easy to use online resources, fast paced, shifts don't drag."
good,You truly get out what you put in.  Advancement is based on the employee.   From the part timer to the General Manger everyone get employee discounts and ability to move up.
good,"There's a lot of favouritism in management. They used to value their employees but a lot of things have gone down and management has changed and apparently, so have their values."
good,"If you’re in high school and looking for a part time jobs it’s great.  Better than food industry for same pay, you will learn things that will help you with customer service for the rest of your work life."
good,This place was the absolute best. It wasn't just a retail store it was also a family store not only the people you work with but your customers. This was the greatest job I ever had and the only place I ever wanted to work in my entire life. That thing's not changed I would probably still be there.
good,"Best buy is a Great company to work for, I enjoyed all my time there. My management team was caring and all for helping you with anything, family problems to issues with customers, I would work for them again."
good,"Best Buy is a terrific job for any High School student or anyone looking to start a resume with some good experience."
good,"I worked as an Asset Protection Specialist whose job it is to maximize safety in the workplace and minimize loss to the store in the form of theft or processing errors. I found the job rewarding with incredible coworkers. Unfortunately, Asset Protection does not have a lot of vertical growth potential. If you want to move up within the company, sales is your best option. However, if you want to stay in the career path of security, this job acts as the perfect stepping stone."
good,Rally fun to work at great people and learning the product and how to sell it is always fun. you get to see new people everyday and the wage is great for the work youre doing
good,"Honestly one of the best jobs, very easy to learn, enjoyed the friendly atmosphere. Learned a lot of useful things that I still use to this day. Management was great!"
good,"Good place to work, but it is very hard to move up. The company exoects professional sales people but being that they are not in commision, the company cannot offer competitive wages"
good,"I loved working at Best Buy , learned everything about technology. Improve my customer service. The pay was decent. Management helped me by giving me feedback to improve my sales."
good,not a bad company to work for . i got great hours but was no space there to move up with in the company . didnt enjoy because in an enviroment like that id prefer to make commision
good,"Productive and fun place to work if you like customer service and dealing with a much older crowd. There’s moments when it’s slow, but then it picks up and everyone that I’ve met seem really nice. The managers all care if you’re enjoying your job and always willing to help you if you ask"

good,"it was a good place to work. no drama, management sometimes expected more out of employees but other than that. everyone and everything was cool and it was pretty good"
good,Been through many leadership changes in a 3 year period. Overall provides a great service at a respectable cost. Flexibility to work more is nice if the business allows. Hourly pay is good for the holiday season when demand for services is greater. A great many resources are available for learning new skills and growing as an individual and a part of a team.
good,"Best Buy is the best platform to learn new things. I had a very good experience with them. If you have skills they will promote. Also, support from the management is awesome."
good,I've been with Best Buy for a number of years at this point in various roles.  Just like any company it's the people that you work for and with side by side that make the job something more.  It's been a great journey so far!
good,I loved working there as I got to enjoy working with the people around me! The staff is what made this place great! Management where I worked would always give me the bet opportunites to advance in my current role.
good,"Through my time working at Best Buy, I never had any complaints, the management I worked under was very helpful and the fellow employees were easy to work with. I would definitely recommend the company to friends and family."

good,"I love bestbuy because we worked as a team nd collaborating with the co workers, plus the managers worked closely with us when it came to training one one ones, and scheduling. I love the people at the bestbuy!"
good,"A typical day consisted of helping customers with their issues and helping fix them. Some days were relaxing, some were really busy. Generally, weekends were busier as well as times when most people would get off work."
good,"How much you benefit from this company really depends on how hard you work and who you have as a direct report. "
good,the employee discount was great. I would always buy things for myself. Pay was horrible. Barely give any raises. It is all about networking and preference
good,Best Buy was my first real job. I enjoyed working at the company and did not intend to leave. I was very young (18) when i first started and did not know that had I pursued a career with the company I most likely would have advanced within the company fairly quickly.
good,"Culture is very much aimed at motivating a college/high school age work force."
good,Working at Best Buy was one of the greatest working experiences of my life. The camaraderie amongst the coworkers and the managers being readily available and approachable made it fun and stress free.
good,I always had fun working there and creating awesome experiences for customers.  I might have stayed longer but they restructed the company and got rid of all the sales supervisors across the company.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"great place to work at, my only gripe was a lack of on the floor training. it was more of learning things at home, if your more of a hands on learning then you will struggle."
good,"Great Positive day working, challenging tasks, meeting people during the day. Made great sales during work on the floor, organizing was simple. Lots of energy to burn."
good,Working at Best Buy was my first job I have ever worked and the experience was definitely worth it. Being able to work around a team who are willing to teach and help you strive and work towards future goals. Hardest part of the day would be receiving shipment with shortage of staff members but the best part of the work place experience was the company benefits and bonuses.
good,Best Buy is a good first Job or a good job to showcase your skills in sales and leadership. Listen and Learn and you should have no problem achieving success.
good,"Of all of the corporations I have worked with in a 20+-year career, Best Buy was in the top 2 in terms of leadership, talent, culture and incredible work experiences. I was sad to have to go after the mass layoffs!"
good,"The company was great to me, it gave me plenty of oportunity to work and plenty of nice people to work with.  I worked seasonal and enjoyed it a lot, but when it came to the end of the season there was no part time work available."
good,I've been working in this company about 3 months. I really love the environment and the management. we are like a family and we have a same goal. we all try to achieve that and help each other.
good,"Great place to work, friendly work environment,great potential for promotion,"
good,"A typical day at work depends on if you open or close. just making sure customers were being helped and everything on the floor was ready to go. Management and workplace culture is great, everyone is very friendly and pretty easy to get along with."
good,"This job helped me to stay on the cutting edge of tech, and all that goes with it. Many opportunities to learn about the products and services that were provided."
good,Meet tons of new people it was a great experience.The job was very flexible. Probably mostly due to the rapport I built with my coworkers and manager . I would recommend the warehouse to anyone trying to supplement their college degree.
good,I enjoy working with bestbuy. the management is friendly and likes to see its employees grow and create a relaxed and competative working experience. There is not really much room to advance and opportunities to become leadership is hard to come by.
good,"Good people, great customers, good exposure to technology, decent opportunities for advancement, pretty good discounts, supervisors and mangers really cared"
good,I enjoyed being apart of a company that is used to advance people in the world of technology. It was productive in a work environment that helped consumers understand how and what to use.
good,Relaxed environment and great management. Great discounts and competitive atmosphere. I really enjoyed coming to work and taking care of customers needs.
good,"Best Buy was a team atmosphere.  Management was fair and helpful.  A typical day at work was dependant on the time of year.  It ranged from very slow at times, which allowed for getting other job responsibilities done in a timely manner to extremely busy (black Friday) where it was so busy we barely had time for a break."
good,"Fun coworkers, Best Buy pushes for individuality and focuses on customer satisfaction. Competitive pay/benefits, great paid training and you get to experience new technology as it comes out!"
good,"The job is challenging yet the team collaborates well.  During the holidays the job has been stressful, yet working and helping individuals with technology is something I enjoy and am passionate about.  The managers work well with the employees and have grow on me over time.  I recommend the job I held in customer service for individuals who love technology and people."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Great place to work if your in college or as a part time placement , ennjoyed my time but very little potential for growth . Discounts were great though and staff was slso great"
good,"troubleshoot personal computer problems, also set up anti-virus software for the customer. I learned how to properly communicate with customers, and communication skills. The management was really great. The work culture was also diverse. The hardest part of the job was helping indecisive customers. The most enjoyable part was being in the field that I love."
good,It’s a great place to work if money isn’t an issue. The staff is wonderful but the pay is lacking for part timers.  Best time to work is the holidays because there is always something to do and there are more hours to be had.
good,"Nothing really bad to say about Best Buy, liked the company it just sucks on hours if you're not full-time you'll work 30 hours one week and 5 the next."
good,"Nice staff,  worked around my school schedule,  very helpful with training.  This was my first job and they made it a fun and great learning experience for me."
good,"Best Buy was the only retail job I was sad to leave. The only reason I ended up leaving was because I moved to Savannah for school and couldn't work at the Best Buy down there due to its location and my age. If I ever had to go back to working retail, I would go back to Best Buy in a heartbeat. I learned SO much about computers and other technology while I was there. We had amazing employees who would continually educate each other. I really loved it and felt like I was part of one big family."
good,I learned a lot about troubleshooting and fixing basic computer issues. Geek Squad is a great place to be while in college. Upon graduation there is little room for growth and little pay for what opportunities you may receive.
good,It was a very great job to work while I was in college getting my degree. Fun if you love technology. ARA position is better overall with better pay. But CA position was still fun and exciting.
good,A very good place to work. The employees are great to work with. You will learn plenty about the retail industry and grow to prosper in many other areas. It's a big community filled with leaders that want to see the company continue to grow.
good,"Typical day included making sure you're up to date on new and current products. Learned a lot of skills there such as communication, sales, and reporting. Culture was that more of a family than a job."
good,"Best Buy is a one of a kind workplace. The employees all get along and there is no such thing as favoritism. It's a fast paced, fair working establishment that anybody would be lucky to work at."
good,"Good working environment "
good,A typical day at Best Buy as a Sales Consultant involves you interacting with any customers that need help or advice on the products that are offered. The Associate will also try to inform the customer about what products and services that will fit the customer's needs and wants.
good,Fast paced sales for the number one consumer electronics retailer in the world. Management listens to issues and assists in providing resolutions. Hardest part of the jobs is what is typical in sales; window shoppers.
good,If there was one thing I could say about working with Best Buy is it's Management team works VERY well with their employees and customers. I continue to shop there because I've never had a bad experience.
good,"I think Best Buy is a great place to work if you're just beginning in your career life and really need money. The work is easy but repetitive and the management team and their managent strategies are superb. It does kind of suck that your have to work weekends and holidays but they can be really flexible with your hours and scheduel. Overall I think the pay is great for someone just starting out and in need a some good money. How ever, I don't believe advancement in this company is common to come across."
good,La experiencia q adquieres en best buy te ayuda en varios temas desde ventas hasta aprender sobre la tecnologia y sus aportaciones para el uso domestico
good,I do not really have a long review or recommendation because pretty much everyone at BestBuy have a different opinion of the company and the work they do.

good,I have enjoyed working in retail for the past year with my fellow coworkers and supervisors. It is a great company where one can pursue a career with electronics.

good,"Most interesting job I've ever had, From the leadership to the people you get to meet everyday, Never a dull moment. You also get to play with lots of cool products"
good,"A typical day at this job is very informative and there are very friendly competitions for sales. The most enjoyable part of the job was being informed about the new video games and the prices of video game consoles. However, the hardest part of the job for me was to make a sale to a customer."
good,"Working here was genuinely enjoyable. My team as well as management worked together daily to accomplish our goals. The customer satisfaction was kept high and I came to know many regulars that enjoyed their experiences with us. The hardest thing about work was the learning curve. If you aren't knowledgeable when it comes to electronics, you will spend a lot of time learning."
good,A typical work day is coming in to do my morning duties. Making sure that the department is fully stocked and set up for customers. Make sure my area is clean and bright. Then when the store open try to take care of customers to best of my abilities. I have learned that you can not make ever customer happy. But a smile can go a long way. Your attitude an expressions can influences a customers experience. The workplace culture is very cut throat. Management is poor and makes the work environment hostile and personal. They need more training in personal and management skills. The best part of my job is interaction with the customers and meeting new people.
good,It's a great place to work with high earning potential. The company does a great job of taking care of employees. Culture is highly competitive and work on a day to day basis in fast paced and fun.
good,I loved working at Best Buy. They train their employees well. The typical work days go very smoothly with well predictable duties. They educated me on several of their products and how they perform. They management there are very nice and always available when an employee has questions or just needs to vent their stress. The hardest part of the job was not enough available hours.
good,Be assertive and you will do great.  This is not the place for the laid back people.  Make sure you discuss the hierarchy and what you will be doing and what the expectations are and how you will meet them.  Some of the higher ups may make changes that your manager may or may not know about.  They have a lot of contractors for this reason.
good,Overtime was giving majority of the time at work. Your hours became flexible during the week when the schedule was made. Overall was a pretty cool environment to work in.
good,best buy was a great job everyone was really nice but my coworkers were all crazy young like the guy training me was 17.  theyre laid back but also serious during peak seasons.
good,Very fast working environment and sometimes long hours. Black Friday sales go threw the roof so it is all hands on deck. Sometimes it gets crazy picking orders and we did have our share of returns.All in all it is a great place to work. starting pay is 14.85
good,Loved working for that geek squad  working on computers was great want I love to do.  love to work on something that I cant fix one way and then work on it.
good,If you are motivated and truly enjoy working with customers to solve complex sales solutions then best buy is the place to work. A great company that can really pay off for the people that really put in the work to grow.

good,"a typical day at work would be busy and filled with new learning oppourtunities. I learned a ton about how sales business works inside and outside of the best buy business. The management was good, they were understanding and included employees with tasks. Workplace culture was amazing, very friendly environment. Hardest part of the job would be improvising when no manager is available for assistance. Most enjoyable part of the job in my opinion was making sales and helping customers."
good,In's & Out's of daily technological problems tied into contracts. Many adjustments that are needed to be made daily in a business along with precise execution to improve daily business.

good,Best Buy brinda a sus empleados un ambiente laboral optimista.
good,"A typical day at work for me is coming in at my scheduled shift and check how the business is doing and what our daily goals are. Then I go to the sales floor and drive the business by helping every customers that comes into the building and making sure that my team is doing the same. On times where we are not busy I take the time to train our employees on the proper way to sell all of our products and services in the computer department. Throughout my time at Best Buy I have learned a lot of management skills and what it takes to successfully run a business. The workplace culture at Best Buy is very competitive, we are always talking about numbers and who got the better sale. Overall its a very fun environment. The hardest part about the job is the times where there are not a lot of customers in the building. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers and trying to land a great sale every time!"

Throughout my two years working for Best Buy, I was integrated into a family culture and felt consistently appreciated by my peers as well as my superiors.

good,"Good place to work. Best Buy needs to just take care of their employees better. Their pay scale isn't the greatest. Management can be good some days and awful other days. If they could get pay up and management all on the same track, the company would be much better and the employees would be much happier."

The hardest part about the job is if you make it hard. I enjoy best buy, one of the top companies on my list. The employees are like brothers and sisters. Family based in a sense of speaking. Management as well, handles your issues on the spot or if not it will be sorted before the day is over. Best buy is currently my job right now. They taught me not give up so easily and keep on keeping on."

good,"A typical day involves helping customers, asking questions and finding out the true needs. I learned that asking questions helps get the true answers. Management is great good communication! The co-workers are helpful an will tell you anything you aren't sure about. The hardest part is keeping all the products and functions straight. The best part of the job is the environment."
good,I didn't leave yet but I put in my notice . I live in another county. I need something closer to where I live. I really like the job but it won't work.
good,"I would come in. Clock in, get me walkie/head set system and my clip board and get ready to sell merchandise to customers. I worked in the computer department and sold computers and accessories. I learned a lot about computers and accessories. Also the rest  of the stores merchandise as well. It was great because I love technology and especially computers, that's why I'm getting a degree in computers. Management at Best Buy was pretty good. They helped you out as much as they could and answered all the questions you had. I just wish they would have given me a better chance to prove myself after holidays were over. I was seasonal there so it made it hard to lock down a fulltime position. My co-workers were cool people and helped me out as much as they could. They answered all my questions to help me succeed. The hardest part about the job was being competitive with the other salesman and getting your goal amount of sales. Its very a competitive working environment. The most enjoyable part of that job was learning about computers and accessories. I would recommend this job to someone who has sales experience and knows a good amount about computers."
good,"I like the fast pace and being able to work on my own AND have options/opportunities work with others. Minimal traveling required, responsibilities are clear and thorough."
good,"A wonderful retailing position, if you must work retail. Leadership is a bit shaky, but that's a result of the quick and secured advancement opportunities."

good,The time I've worked at bestbuy was a great experience and a way to learn a lot of new things to use through your life. You have to be willing to adapt and learn new things constantly or else you'll be behind. If you like working and helping out customers one on one you'll gain a lot of experience here.
good,Best Buy is one of the best companies to work for. I've learned a lot about customer service and problem-solving solutions.The management always pushed us to accomplish daily sales goals. My co-workers are the best and always work great as a team. The hardest part of my job is meeting sales goals with little traffic. The most enjoyable part of my job is the different people you meet every day.

good,"I'm very grateful to Best Buy & the Geek Squad in particular. Although I don't necessarily enjoy retail positions, working in the computer department & with the Geek Squad is a great way to gain some real-world experience for beginning tech-support professionals who may be attending school or pursuing certification. Interacting with clients and customers about their technology needs helps one to learn how to explain ""tech talk"" to the less tech-savvy customer. In addition, you're always learning about emerging technology."

If you don't make excuses for the results you get and understand that regardless or location or store you can be a top ranked location and control your own career you are simply playing victim.

The company empowers it's supervisors and managers more than any other company I have worked for.  You will really drill down on business acumen and understand the how and the what of what makes a profitable store.   I have learned A LOT with Best Buy.  My business acumen is extremely strong.

Sales promotions and point- of-sale were things that we strive to complete every week, especially on holidays. It was a very fun environment and tech-savvy. We all worked as a collective team and often had team rallies before we began to open the store that day. It was a very interesting experience working here."

From open to close, the area is often full of customers eager to get their hands on the latest mobile devices and learn of the various technologies being released to the public on a daily basis. Being a Samsung Expert, I must get to know each customer in order to learn which product best fits their needs, taking various approaches in helping them to learn. In addition to the in depth product knowledge I must hold, I also am required to understand the financial aspect attached to the mobile phones, that is the various cellular plans. Explaining details such as data usage, minutes, as well as other cost factors my goal is to make each and every customer a happy knowledgeable buyer. Due to the high volume of customers on a daily basis my co-workers and I have become quite the team working together in such a way to make it an effortlessly easy experience for all customers. The hardest part of the job is we do deal with a very diverse crowd, and with that comes some customers that do not speak english. It can be hard to make sure customers are fully satisfied when you do not speak their native language. However we have a diverse staff that we can call upon to help translate, so we do try our best in helping any and everyone. All in all this has not only further strengthened my ability in sales, but in customer service as well as my organizational skills. I would recommend this job to anymore, as it proved to be a great learning experience."

With that being said I've learned how to interact with a variety of different people which is essential to anyones success with Best Buy. Most of the managers and employees are fun loving people who like to work hard, have fun, and get paid. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with people, 95% of the people out there are nice, reasonable, and patient and 5% of them are rude, inpatient, unreasonable, demanding or just plain theifs/fraudsters. Making sure that the interaction with the 5% doesn't influence the interaction with the other 95% is probably the toughest part for me.

good,"I was in what was called the ""asset protection"" department and most of my job consisted of standing at the door, welcoming in customers, checking receipts on big purchase items such as TV's or computers, and ensuring a variety of safety standards were met. My coworkers made the job very enjoyable. I was working my way through college and Best Buy afforded me the chance to meet a number of people my own age and make friends and acquaintances I never would have otherwise. Management was always responsive to my requests for time off to catch up on school work, and even extended family vacations when they came around, although that might have been because in a typical year I only submitted around 2 time-off requests. Apart from being considerate of my college courses when scheduling me, most of the managers made a conscious effort to befriend all the employees in the store. As an asset protection employee the hardest part of the job was handling an irate customer. As the last person a customer sees before exiting the store I was occasionally subject to a barrage of insults and sometimes threats but these occasions were relatively rare and nothing could detract from the absolute exultation and joy I felt when I caught a thief on camera. The bottom line is that the people you would work with are enjoyable and mostly easy going, the job is at times challenging, but mostly easy, and the store atmosphere is remarkably laid-back for a sales environment."

They're even more passionate about delivering a world class Customer Experience. Their are always opportunities to move up in the company based on ""You""."
good,"Retail isn't for everyone but the best part about being a technician for geek squad is that you rarely are responsible to sell. My job duties included dealing with daily work flows, contacting clients, repairing units, shipping units to authorized repair centers. Overall the most enjoyable part of this job was supplying a great service to the community. The one thing that was hard about this job was breaking the news of the cost of the work to a client. Most clients don't realize that although a small repair may be easy for the technician, it isn't the actual time of the process of fixing the unit its knowing what to fix."
good,Electronic wonderland for kids of all ages. wonderful place to enlighten yourself about today's advancing technology.
good,I start the day opening the store making sure our displays are fully functional. then go to the morning meeting to talk about our goals for the day and how were going to execute the gameplan. ive learned great sales techniques and how to find whats right for the customers needs. the most enjoyable part of the day is just knowing my knowledge of our products is going to making our customers experience great before and after leaving the store.

good,"Being in one of the original Best Buy Mobiles was really neat. I saw this concept become standard over a matter of months. The setup then was separate from the Best Buy stores and had its own since of small business. This has since changed, but it was rewarding while I was there."
good,"Meeting and greeting all costumers. Increase company sales revenue, maintain a high closing rate by quickly developing positive customer rapport, and cultivate a strong relationship with all customers to ensure complete customer satisfaction.

good,"Working at Best Buy consists of always being friendly, cheerful and available to help customers. I learned how to read people by asking questions that will get them to tell me a little about themselves. This helps me get a better understanding of their needs in a product and the services that can be bundled to better their experience. My co-workers and managers were all nice people that were easy to get along with, they also made work fun. The hardest part of the job i think was selling the product insurance for the minor products like scratch protection for games and cds, etc. Also getting people to sign up for credit cards was somewhat difficult because so many people are reluctant and its hard to keep insisting while they say no. I enjoyed the job all around, it was a great learning experience and I gained alot of knowledge about electronics."
good,I only was hired at Best Buy in the mobile department for the hoilday season but It was a great place to work. my co-workers were friendly and very willing to help me learn my duties.

The staff is good and helps you with anything you need or answers any question they are very patient on training you I was on the computers section and was also on cash register
good,I wish they had commission but other than that it was an great experience I learned so much from working there work wise and product wise. Great staff

good,"Bestbuy is an amazing company to work for.  You do have daily goals to meet which are easy to do."
good,"Starting from the management to the system, everything carried out in best buy is phenomenon. they have great work ethics and an amazing environment to work."
good,"best buy is a really chill place to work at . you’re constantly learning about products everyday which may be overwhelming at first but employees will give you tips and tricks on how to sell products and what specs products have . but you mostly learn as time goes by , it’s really easy. you’ll get used to it . YOU DO NOT GET COMMISION . we work off how much revenue we bring into the store , so from my experience we were told to make a goal of 3,000$ in sale each shift which considering the prices of products it’s fairly easy to get but some days it may be hard since people mostly just want to look around and ask question, the more revenue you bring in thehapier management will be with you . some days it may be slow which tends to be so boring but your coworkerstrybto make the best out of the time ."
good,"Best Buy has made great strides in creating a workplace culture that stands out among retail stores. The focus on letting employees be themselves while in store and at home. Just show up and do your job! Take a place in workplace competitions and events from Holiday themed department competitions, to crazy sock day. Now this may be limited to just my store's management being young at heart, but the company puts great effort into allowing each store to have it's own little culture that the employee's create themselves."
good,"They try hard to ensure everyone is included and feels supported, even part-timers which is rare but appreciated. I enjoy some of the major and obvious benefits. The managerial staff has ups and downs, especially depending on your store. I've found mine to be helpful, proactive, relatable, and some of the most morally upstanding and helpful folks out there. The GM at my location is the most can-do ultra-helpful person I've ever met and he inspires me to be better which I appreciate."
good,Great job to have if you are interested in retail growth. OTJ is also a plus. Tons of training offered and often mandated. Best buy was great. When I moved on everyone was extremely supportive.
good,"I actually miss working for best buy, I started in Colorado as CSS up at the front lanes part time, transferred stores for an open mobile position, then ended up promoting and transferring back to my original store for a Verizon Expert position. Management was everything and I ended up getting awesome GM's, ASM's, Ops, team leads, etc at both stores I was at which is rare. They cared about our success as individuals and teams, hosted leadership coachings for those interested in management. My store got along great, everyone was friends, super laid back but we still rocked our budget every month as well as bps. I'll admit O struggled with BPs the 4 years I was there because, ew credit cards, but at the end of the day it's money in your pocket. Plus that mobile bonus every month was nice, I hear y'all don't have that any more."
good,Best Buy is a great place to work while doing school or simply wanting a career out of retail. The management is constantly working to improve you and your experience there. The raises are pretty fair and you can make a good amount of money moving up in the company without a degree. I’d recommend to anyone who loves to learn and educate others on technology. I enjoy that it’s not on commission but you will get the sense of being on commission in some stores
good,"Best Buy is honestly a really good place to work for. I've worked since June 2019, and I've had a great experience. I've worked fast food, clothing retail, family owned businesses, and other side jobs. "

good,I had a great work experience at the company great coworkers and demanding work but gave me a chance when I needed it I believe they r a good company to work for
good,Good experience. Co-workers were amazing however management could use some work.  They place a lot of pressure on selling warranties which can take away the genuine customer experience we so much would like to provide.
good,"I was assigned to high traffic call center answering client questions regarding data recovery while navigating multiple software platforms resolving issues in a professional manner. The percentage of supervisor and managers, to employees is high,and the mature level of the employees makes it somewhat difficult to advance since positions of mid management don't open often."
good,I loved working at Best Buy it was more of a family than anything else the best part was coming into work knowing that my coworkers were just as excited to see me as I was as I was to see them. The pay and the advancement is amazing

good,"A typical day usually involves taking appointments and diagnosing any issuing the customer may be having with the device in question. I will make repairs, software and hardware. I answer the phone and do my best to possibly figure out what might be causing problems. If i can find out whats Happening over the phone, I might be able to direct the customer on steps that need to be taken to fix it. If not, I schedule them for an appointment."
good,"Worked a lot with customers and products, learned a lot about products. Coworkers were nice, everyone was competitive and it was fun. We always worked to meet our goals together and everyone worked as a team."
good,"The employees work indoors. The customer service is very great. The people that work at Best Buy smile a friendly smile, greet people shopping, and say hello to them. They are team players and they cooperate with each other."
good,"Ability to grow soft skills and learn sales tactics. Management always willing to assist you grow, and positions open frequently in the best buy world as people move on to bigger things."
good,"As a retail job, it is a lot of fun, especially if you love technology and other like minded people. It helps to teach you how to work with a large group of people and can really increase your selling skills if you put in the effort. While there are a lot of ""Big Corporate"" stuff comes down that you may not understand at an entry level, they have always done their best to maintain their talent."
good,"The only difficulty time I could think of was during Black Friday and the holiday season. The hours get really long, but the pay is ok for the long hours"
good,Fast paced workplace but yet very enjoyable. Was able to learn about a subject that I was looking into for a job after graduation. Would recommend to people as a great place to work.
good,"I loved working at Best Buy. I loved technology and helping people understand it and enjoy it. They were very good on product knowledge. The only complaint I had was they got cheap. Changing our pay rate. I went from making $40,000.00 in sales to $30,000.00 in management."
good,"I can't speak for all managers, obviously, but my manager believed in me, invested in me, and helped bring out my strengths and hone my weaknesses. For being a large company, Best Buy felt small and it felt like my work was actually making an impact."
good,Great people to work with. Very Friendly supervisors who will help in any way they can. Hope they will increase the pay and more hours. Will work there again in the future.
good,I had a very unique experience at Best Buy mainly because I felt that I developed most of my social and customer care skills and more importantly teamwork. Best Buy has helped me develop this skills so proficiently that I even got promoted to a higher position where I managed other teams
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"They delete position and those people have no jobs, but they get to Apply for one or leave the company, this happens every two years. You also can have a great store, a great team and your district manager will hire a cancerous gm, like they did at store 224, in one year the whole store had quit and they had to rehire everyone again to do it again."
good,"It was an internship but we were treated like we were a part of them.It was amazing, Management was very organised,I do not really think there was any hard point to the job"
good,"Working at Best Buy Mobile was a great experience because of the several skills I gained working in the fast-paced environment, and the atmosphere that was created with the co-workers"
good,The pay rate did not properly accomidating to my living and lifestyle choices. The job offered no chances nor opportunities to grow within the company so i had to strive for a more pleasing position which could give me those chances towards growth and development
good,It was a relaxing and comfortable environment. I learned a lot about customer service. I learned how to communicate effectively with customers and provide good advice.
good,This company has a workplace culture that encourages teamwork and embraces diversity. There are opportunities for advancement provided you are willing to work hard. The most enjoyable parts of the job are the comradery among employees and the opportunity to try out new technologies
good,"Working in Operations, it's harder to find a full time position, or move up in the company because of lack of sales experience. I really loved this job but after figuring out that I would not be able to advance my career in the company, I decided to look elsewhere."
good,"One of their core values is to have fun while being the best. For retail you can certainly do a whole lot worse. The culture encourages individualism, sharing your personality."

good,I truly enjoyed my experience at Best Buy.  It was a challenging culture that rewarded hard work and outstanding performance.  I was afforded the opportunity to work in multiple areas and develop a well rounded skill set.
good,"Had a lot of fun working there. Wish I could have stayed on permanently as all i had was a seasonal position. My only issue there was one of the managers did not get a joke I made, and harassed me about it for several weeks, even after I went and explained what I said."
good,"The pay could be more competitive. Discounts are PHENOMENAL. Room for advancement and also, cross training! Which is amazing!"
good,one of the best companies that I have worked with. They care about the people doing the job and provide rewards and great compensation to those who really deserved it.
good,It is a great place to work you make the best of your environment there are good competition between employees but in the end we all win cause we are a team. Team work is always needed
good,A typical day a work would consist of checking numbers and right to helping clients. it can be fast paced and slow paced at times but the people are what make it. I have found to have such teammates that make it worth while. The discount is awesome and my managment team was able to work around my personal schedule. Id say give it a shot and you might make i t to the top if you are skilled.

good,"Best Buy was by far the best place I've worked at thus far, the management respects their employees and that means a lot! it keeps everybody working!!"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,It's like any retail job everything is great except for the occasional crazy customer. good pay and benefits for full-time workers. You don't have to know everything at the store just what's in your section.
good,This company is one of the best work experiences. It is obvious they care for their employees. Advancement opportunities that challenge you and help your growth.
good,"I was a vendor provided laborer for Sprint that was unfortunately at a location that decided to pull the position. "
good,"I had a great experience working at Best Buy.  I began as a sales associate in Home Theatre, they recognized my aptitude for customer service and I moved quickly into that role.  After a few years, I moved into the Geek Squad.  I loved working there.  "
good,"I love working here! I've always left my other jobs because of poor management. They managers care about you. The only downfall is that if you are hired on as a part time employee, dont expect more than 20 hours unless your lucky. Hours are not consistent and most of the time the merchandising team doesnt get enough hours to finish our tasks by the deadline."
good,"Meeting & greeting customers all day long to help solve their specific needs in a variety of products.  Hardest part of the job is in between customers (waiting), Engaging customers in conversation about what they desire."
good,"Great team and people that work there. management was fare and there was a focus on work life balance, how ever it is retail and there are always busy times year round."
good,"The management are great, and create a family like bond with everyone in the store. Overall a great place to work at. The people who work here are great to be around and thus it creates a friendly workplace."
good,I have worked here for years. The store is clean. The co-workers are awesome and the customers are mainly kind. I WOULD recommend working at the Coon Rapids store (540). The other neighboring stores aren't as great. Discount is the BEST at any other place. It's 5% above company cost.
good,"Over all it was a very good job, Management was understanding and helpful, its like a family there. Customers were usally very nice and understanding about having or order products and that we were a smaller store. On a Customer service side of things, it advanced my skills greatly,"
good,"So my store was kind of a rare kind of place, the GM was one of the best people I've ever met and so were alot of his supervisors. However, advancement is tough unless you want to commit to it being your career. I still do all my shopping there and dont plan on changing. If you want a fun place to work with great management, store 43 is for you."
good,"Best Buy has taught me in a few short years, more about running a business than the many years I attended college lectures.  "
good,This job was fast past and interesting. I had to interact with different types of customers and offered help and directed advice on products and services.

good,I loved working for Best Buy. They truly have a great work environment and I enjoyed working with the team for many years. It's a challenge and you really do learn something new everyday.

good,The manager there were pretty awesome and would be there if you needed help the customer service manager was strict but kind the right stores have good people. The Gm there knew how to talk to people.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"The people you have to help are the hardest part of the job. Some of them will not see whats in front of them, some will be easy to help, some will have difficult problems but all of them are rewarding. You get to meet cool people too."
good,I don’t have much complaints of Best Buy. It is a job I love but I have decided to pursue a career as a surgical technologist. My time here was great and this job really helped me grow as a person.
good,"Me gusto trabajar ahí, me hubiera gustado estar más tiempo que sólo la temporada, aprendí mucho sobre negociar con la gente, entender que necesitaban y apoyarlas. "

good,"Working at Best Buy for me was always fun your always moving, greeting customers, explaining the deals an great buy for the day/week your team is your most important asset for your department. Skills, motivation, good rapport , and excellent co-workers/managers will ease your day along the down side is sometimes you have to deal with a few irate customers just be confident in yourself and uphold Best Buy's/ Your claim to professionalism DO NOT lower your customer service standards smile and try to resolve their complaints as quickly an accurately as possible"
good,"It’s a really chill place to work. Lots of people that know tech. Not a push over place, or forceful sales environment. Very cohesive and fun to work at."

good,"It's a ok place to work, and you can feel really not stress out and it's easy and stuff. I liked it it's for people to develope into the customer service role."
good,"When I first started working I thought there is no way I can handle this. It was right before Black Friday, the busiest time of the year, but my manager helped me learn. I had no knowledge of computers, but he helped me out. The job was very nice. Everyone was friendly and was able to help me out with new tasks."
good,I loved coming to work everyday and working with familiar faces and management that understood my personal like and how much working there meant to me. The hardest part of the job was meeting the sales goals at certain times or days due to myself not having a good understanding of how to handle sales goals until 6 months into the job.
good,"There is always opportunity for advancement, sometimes there can be short staffing. The lunch breaks are awesome, with couches to sleep, multiple tvs, one for gaming and one for watching movies. Plenty of chairs, free donuts every friday morning they get paid. Friendly and vocal communication over radio with management and sales floor. Breaks include a 45 minute- 1 hour lunch and two 15 minute breaks for a full 8 hour shift."
good,Awesome place to work the environment was professional and very team oriented! The salary was competitive and the hours were flexible. I really enjoyed my position.
good,"It;s a great job, especially for students and young adults. You learn a lot of skills with management that helps you through it all. Once developed there is opportunity for promotion."
good,"Best Buy is probably the best job anyone could have for high school, college, or anyone looking for a work-life balance. They work with you. They pay more than most entry level jobs, but definitely not career money. The benefits are fantastic."
good,"Great place to work!"
good,It is a great part time job. The people are great and management knows how to treat their employees. It was the best experience I have had working. The only reason I left was because I was offered a full time job somewhere else.
good,the best buy really enjoyed work help with my old team are friendly. most i worked in morning and weekend too. only i work part time. my old management very nice and make sure everything this business so important. well i miss work with them good time.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,The company's philosophy is great! The company has good goals and does have a lot of benefits and opportunities for customers to save.  You meet all kinds of people with the same interests as you. And all the people that work there are good people.
good,Work Culture at Best Buy was very productive.  Co-workers were good and smart and willing to assist in problems.  Able to learn the job very quickly Good team work.
good,"Like any job, there are those one-off things that arent pleasant about the job. but for the most part, they are a great company that has the best balance of interests from the perspective of the client, employee, and company."
good,I was working temporary. If I didn't have a full time job I would've definitely considered working full time at best buy! There was always overtime available also!
good,Pay is not to competitive and the pay raise scale isn't ideal or at a good wage. besides that one of the best job ive had as far as culture and work environment goes.
good,I loved every person i worked with there from the management to the janitorial staff!!! The team was like a family and would encourage and challenge their employees.
good,Best Buy is a great place to learn about new technology and the workplace and people are great. Management is also really nice and responds to employees all the time
good,The company has a lot of growth potential and if you work hard it is highly rewarding. Just hope that you have a leadership team that likes you if not you will be forever grinding for nothing until you burn out.
good,Best Buy is a great company to work for. Everything you do impacts the store and you get rewarded and recognized for achievement. The culture is super positive and driven. The only downside is that there can be some people who don't participate in the culture or refuse to join in on team meetings.
good,"Yes, there are many who complain, just like any job, but this is actually a great place to work. The discount is amazing, the management is strong, yet flexible with hours and what you can do to provide good customer service, the pay is pretty good, it's easy to get in and hard to get fired."
good,"There is definitely corporate rules that need to be followed, but the team at my store made it an amazing place to work. I had never had a management team that was so supportive of anything I wanted."
good,"great place to work, good interaction with customer base, friendly coworkers  & employee discounts,fast paced transactions.   a web site for educational training ."
good,"Great place to work to build skills for higher paying job."
good,top endroit pour travailler  si vous voulez avoir de l experience surtout avec l equipe et les outils  donees  pour votre integration
good,Management was always on top of making employees met and exceeded their potential! I can honestly say that I enjoyed my time there as an employee. It wasn't until I was approaching maternity leave and applied for a full-time instead of part-time position that I ended my relationship with the company. After working their for over a year I was passed up for the position because I was to far along in my pregnancy and they didn't want to have to give me paid maternity leave. I wasn't officially told this but friends within management let me know not long after that my pregnancy was the reason I didn't get the position.
good,You learn to multitask and learn how to be patient when working with others. You gain the ability to learn how to problem solve right on the spot. Very diverse place to work in.
good,The pay could be better but the working environment was great. They do promote within. Management was supportive of people wanting to promote to more demanding and better paying positions.
good,"Excellent place to work , good environment , good supervisors, hardest part of the job ? answering questions from customer which is not bad if you know your stuff."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Management needs improvement  seeing as how they prefer to be best friends with everyone and as soon as their department goes under they turn on everyone.
good,It’s a great place to get sales experience. Best Buy is one of the only retailers that trains their employees rigorously to learn and understand the product. On boarding can be challenging but fun. For the first month or so customer may have questions that you have no idea how to answer or where to start. It’s always fun learning new things to better help serve customers.
good,"Best Buy was hands down the best company for which I have ever worked. Fast-paced shifts, plenty of support between departments, as well as friendly competition are just a few of the many great hallmarks of my time with them."
good,You have to really like working to want to advance. Once you take on responsibility to be good at it you have to really be dedicated. Being a SWAT is nice as long as you have open communication with your team
good,"Big name and big positive reviews overall. very busy days at work but taught me a lot of things. management was great. helped me learn the work culture in Canada. Great work mates and a great team."
good,Fun job especially if you are into football. The age of the players range from as young as 5/6 to 14 I enjoyed coaching my second and third graders. Nothing special just a summer job to help you kill time and build your resume.
good,"Hands down one of the most easiest jobs I've ever had. My coworkers were fun and so were the managers. If you like to learn about the latest tech and enjoy talking to people, Best Buy is for you."
good,"No matter the day, everyone I worked with was amazing. When I had a family emergency the managers immediately asked if I was alright, rather than asking when I'd be back, or belittling me for asking for time off."
good,"A good place to start working. In my store, it is difficult to promote. I guess because there are many folks that like working there and stay for a long time."
good,"Great company consent and fast past 10 to 30 stop aday depending on the season 5 to 7 work week 8 to 12 hour work day depending on work load and speed alot of driving because of the warehouse being centralized.."
good,Nice place to work and be around tech. Seems tough to advance. Managers make the job fun. The shifts rotate so one day you could open the next you could close. Pay is bi weekly which if you're part time like me makes budgeting difficult.
good,Best Buy is really all about being AMAZING and being HUMAN. Management could use some work at certain locations but overall it's a great place to work.
good,I started as part time and with hard work I was able to move up from there and get management experience. The management that I was under at the time cared a lot about employees and their development. If you’re looking to climb the ladder this is the company to work for. The heavily promote from within. If you work hard and do your job you get rewarded. Discounts were great and so were the benefits.
good,You have to work with customers a lot but the environment is fun and being able to hang out with your co-workers in a great work environment is always nice.
good,"I've been a sales associate at best buy for 5 months now. The people working with you are great, at least at my location. The management style is one of the best I've seen. As an employee working their it feels good to work there. The only complaint I would have is the work as salesman can be very stressful at times because you are pressured to meet your number goals."
good,"Great for practicing selling skills and product knowledge"
good,"I was a newly separated, single mother. I hadn't worked but off and on, for 13 years"
good,"I have worked a lot of retail in my life and the Best Buy in Holmdel, NJ was the first time a job felt more like a family. Great leadership that not only pushes to build the company but build yourself."
good,"Best Buy was my leading foundation on determining my great skills that I was able to take to my next job.  Becoming a mother, the work/life balance was hard and that was my reasoning for continuing my work journey."
good,"company overall cares for there employees, compensation could be better but potential for growth within the company was within reach for those willing to put in the effort."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"At my location, Best Buy North Bay was a phenomenal place to work. It has a very positive work environment, with constant on-going feedback, training, and coaching to help better yourself not just as an employee, but as an individual as well. The managerial staff at Best Buy North Bay was by far the best I've ever worked for. In such a large store with x number of associates, they make you feel as though everyone's voice matters. They are extremely flexible, offering top notch work/life balance, and consecutively day after day, find a way to make work fun. Finally, for those of you potentially interested in working at Best Buy, my GM of the North Bay store, #632 will be the best boss you've ever had."
good,"After having my daughter, this was a great job to start off. It was very productive and the rest of the staff was easy to work with. It made it very fun."
good,"Pretty good, just no job security or advancement which sucked. I liked my job at Best Buy and I wish I could have had an opportunity to prove myself in order to stay on the team after the season was over"
good,"Fast paced, great atmosphere with great employees. every order is different so you see a variety of products throughout the shift. all team members help each other to succeed."
good,"Overall good place to work. Relaxed staff and positive work environment. Management is relaxed as well and is willing to work with your schedule. As a full time student, this is important."
good,"Best Buy is great for someone who is looking to start off in the tech field, or someone who feels comfortable working retail. Currently a very stable place to work for."
good,A great workplace with good culture and lots of opportunities to advance into a leadership role. A typical days consists of customer service and helping customers making their decisions in purchasing tech. A lot of customers are confused about the latest tech and helping them is the greatest satisfaction.
good,Team oriented environment..Great Morale..Very diverse ..They are very flexible with your work hours /schedule.I was able to go to school and work plus get home at an reasonable time all while on public transportation..There are not many opportunities for job advancement..but overall great place to work
good,Great work from home position. Providing Technical support to  customers based off service level agreements. Open schedule.Great environment.Great company to work for and you do have opportunities to advance within
good,I Loved working at Best Buy. I was very Happy to be apart of the Best Buy Team. I left do to commute and the increased work hours based on the new management structure.
good,"Good opportunities to grow and develop, although management makes or breaks the culture. Holiday overnight shifts are worth it. Chaotic but helps with team building and collaboration with others."
good,"I learned a lot of good skills.The culture was really supportive and friendly. To progress after a certain point you must become a manager. Thus, to progress  more you may have to move to a different best buy location."
good,"This is the first job in a long time where I have been in the public eye and I was nervous about it, my co-workers are extremely helpful and it makes the environment more enjoyable."
good,had fun working there. you learn alot when it comes to the new products out there. some of the managers were great and some acted like they didnt care
good,"Being at Best Buy for a short time has given me great opportunities to learn & grown inside the company. With new products coming in from each department monthly, you had a chance to learn & grow with the changes"
good,"Good place to work, nice discount, as a manager it can be difficult as they have management restructures every year so your position can be eliminated."
good,"Had a  great team to work with, work flow was perfectly balanced, competitive pay for the job required,  discount  on items  in store, great benefits."
good,"Everyone I met was great. Very helpful, friendly, we all knew when it was time to work and when it was time to catch up. The managers were great too. As long as you did your job then you had no problems and could get along with everyone."
good,"Management really cares about how each associate is doing outside work. If they can help you in any way they will. Everyone else is just as great as the management team, if you need any help either on the floor or off the floor they will do what they can to help. The employee team does some sort of team event each month which is really fun. I think the hardest part of the day is the customers but with everyone willing to help out it doesn't feel as bad as it could be."
good,was a good place to work. plenty of room for job advancement. working for this company offers a variety of job duties and plenty of departments to work in.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,A great place to work and learn. Structured e learning tools to help drive the company mission and culture. Teamwork definitely promoted. Family atmosphere favored among workers. Excellent management.
good,Great people to work with. they will train you and give you all the necesary tools needed to do your job. why I was there for a not too long. Why is it so important to talk about bestbuy when am appling for something different?
good,Job was to meet and greet all customers as they come in looking for different electronics. loved communicating and selling the right things to people. learned a lot about retail and supervising
good,great place to make a career in sales but if in ops slow paced advancement. great free education in logistics and financials. the health benefits are the best but they are better than none.
good,"It was a great place to work, with lots of opportunity to learn and grow both in company and as an individual. Good culture and great fun to be had while getting work done."
good,I truly enjoyed my time with the company. It started as a part time job after college and turned into a great career. They also provided relocation opportunities.
good,J'aime l'ambiance au sein de l'équipe parce qu'on apprend au jour le jour.
good,Much competitive job and such a lot of experience with the technician service at the facility and big opportunity to grow up buy the deffrent position.
good,I have worked in retail for 5 years starting off at the Camarillo Outlets in 2 stores. Compared to there Best Buy is very laid back but built around a culture of expert service giving employees training and many opportunities to learn
good,"The work place was and is still is a good place to work at but felt that management wasn't/isn't aware of all the potential that their own employee might have if Management actually took the time to acknowledge it, then maybe the employees wont be so down and upset about going in to work."
good,I really enjoyed my time at Best Buy. Wonderful environment and culture. There were many opportunities for continued learning.  The resources on site were very supportive of employees.
good,"First and foremost I was a transitioning veteran who had worked for Best Buy during high school and some of college. During my transition Best Buy was the first place to offer me employment not only due to my past experience, but because they appreciate those who have served our country HONORABLY! During my tenor at Store 293 I was provided with tools to help me achieve my goals, a management team that was supportive, and a work culture that I was thrilled to be apart of!"
good,"Maintain, repair, and service client technology: laptops, pcs, tablets, phones and other devices.

good,Awesome environment able to learn in a fast pace environment. Learn the latest and greatest in the technology department. Individuals will learn and be able to provide customers with the best experience.
good,"Learning about new technology, meeting new faces, management made it fun to be at work, which made it easier to work. Hardest about the job was spending too much money because they offered great employee benefits."
good,"Best Buy ultimately gave me the tools i needed to become a strong leader and to make new goals for myself for my career oppurtunites."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy has been very good to me over the past four years, even with the occasional ups and downs in management and business as a retail store. It has allowed me the freedom I needed while I was an undergrad, and although I intend to leave this job as soon as better employment comes along, I would highly recommend it to any other young people looking for a good part-time job!"
good,"Best Buy was the best job I ever had. Unfortunately, I left due to relocation, but if I ever get the opportunity to work for such an amazing company again, I would gladly accept."
good,"I worked at best buy for roughly about 6 months, depending your role day to day work is usually very costumer oriented.You learn lots about the consumer technological needs."
good,"friendly co workers, clock in, everyone is helpfull can ask any other employee for help and if they can they will help. Managers are understanding and expectations are not overwhelming but its not like there is not any expectation. They push you and motivate you."
good,Working for Bestbuy has provided me with abundance of knowledge when it comes to the technology and telecommunications industry. Th culture is vibrant and exceptional when it comes to fostering a Customer- First culture. Management is always looking out for your best interest.
good,It's a great place to work and hone your sales and customer service skills - the clients can be brutally entitled and demanding. leadership is really supportive and usually well placed in their job role -
good,Excellent Environment for whom is starting on the sales related position. Fast paced and nice coworkers. Amazing management. Excellent prices for employers.
good,I still currently work there and I absolutely love what I do and the people I work with. We are all family there. The management there is very good and treats the employees very well
good,"Best Buy is a great company to work for, they treat all their employees equally and phenomenally. For the most part I enjoyed Best Buy because everyone's attitude is cheerful, there are flexible schedules and they make it an enjoyable experience. Working in the Appliances department a typical day at work consisted of contacting customers constantly and working with customers to the point they became clients due to the extensive follow-ups that were necessary to execute good customer service. Thanks to retail I learned crucial customer service skills and learned to communicate well with everyone and provide best possible solutions at all times. The management pushes you to be the best version of yourself in order to maximize sales and maintain personal satisfaction, they followed company values to the book and the culture was very work-oriented. The hardest part of the job was figuring out solutions for upset clients in which at a store level you could not do much for them, but you somehow had to make certain calls or emails in order to resolve problems. The most enjoyable part of the job is the work environment as a whole."
good,"High stress, but very well compensated with salary and stocks. many perks with vendors and trips. Lots of recognition for top performers, and great pay incentives for top performers as well."
good,Great work environment and you will get all the training you need to be successful at any position.Its rewarding helping our customers find the products they need.
good,"Best Buy/Geek Squad is the very best employer I have had.  Hands down, barre none.  I would recommend them to anybody and I wouldn't mind at all working for them again."
good,Best Buy was a great place to work at with many career options. Best buy provided all the training needed to accomplish talks and moving up was easy for those willing to put in the work. Work culture is great and the CEO Hubert Joly is an amazing down to earth person.
good,Best Buy is a fun place to work! Works well with school schedules. Management is good. Very focused on career development. Willing to work to get you in good career placement.
good,"it enhance your skill and developed self esteem, the work place is fun and manageable and its has environmental friendly, it has more challenges at work specially you work under pressure"
good,I was a new immigrant to this country that time I applied for this job. They welcomed me and I started working there for a year. It was definitely a great experience for me. I met with good people and I did my best.
good,"Great Company for anyone looking to learn about electronics. Good customer service, and really employed oriented. Work hard, and go far with this company."
good,i really enjoyed working here. Have to stay updated on current technology and have to deal with rude customers but hours are ok and management was ok pay was horrible
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Working for Best Buy gave me many great opportunities to grow and develop. My time spent at Best Buy was very enjoyable and the relationships made are still in place today! Overall Best Buy was a great opportunity and a great company to work for.
good,Great people and management is always there for you. They are awesome and very motivating. The team is young and very active. They are very motivating and great people.
good,Having fun while working was stressed but not enforced fun and creative ways to complete work. Being able to help customers while stocking was always a bonus. Management was great at staying goal-oriented.
good,Management did take a downward spiral after Crystal (previous general manager) left. Strictly relating to job security and overall well being of staff. Great place to get your foot in the door in the technology realm.
good,This was a fun faced paced environment where you were challenged to sell and upsell products to the daily consumer. it was fun finding peoples needs and meeting them
good,"I loved this job, but the pay wasn't loving me back. I learned a lot in the short amount of time I worked there though. The people I worked with were great as well"
good,"I loved working here,  just not alot of room for advancement if you aren't friends with management. Pay wasn't very competitive and people who've been there for years sit around while the newer people do all the work. Besides that the business is a great business to be a part of. They made the job fun and offer incentives, you get to meet alot of different people."
good,A lot of fast paced things to do. Most of time normal hours especially for sales floor. Other jobs somestimes required various hours like extremely early in the morning or sometimes past midnight.
good,Una empresa bastante ordenada y lugar ideal para primer trabajo de jóvenes.
good,loved the environment and loved the people. Wish I had a solid position. However you need some knowledge because you are really never in just one department. Customers from every department of the store will come you; which isn't a big deal.
good,I miss working here. I didn’t have the money to stay there and work my way up but I would have loved to be a permanent memeber of the Best Buy team had the pay been sufficient.
good,Good place to work with no degree. A lot of guys get here making way less than what other jobs will pay. If you do not want to go to school this is the place to go. But they will also help pay for schooling.
good,"The team we had at 1420 was like no other store. It was a pleasure working there with those people. Pay wasn’t great but discount was. The attandence policy kinda sucks, but on there end they need employees to be there."
good,"I honestly loved this job. Yes, the hours are typical of a retail environment, but that didn't take away from the atmosphere. The job can be hard sometimes if you don't know your knowledge, but so long as you are willing to learn then you will have a great time. The pay is a little lacking and could be better so this is better for a part time and not sole income. Would I go back though? Yes!"
good,"Fun and relaxed atmosphere with some of the most amazing co-workers."
good,"I was hired as a seasonal employee and offered a part-time job. I truly enjoyed going from Sales to merchandising. "
good,"The people you work with become your family and friends. "
good,"You will see your coworkers as family, it is a very fun place to work."
good,A fast pace environment that always kept me busy. Management was great and were always there to support you when you needed it. I also enjoyed interaction with other customers and associates.
good,If you enjoy getting people to experience technology and making their lives better with embracing tech this is the place to work to make that happen. One of my favorite things is getting a customer to experience what I do when I put a new piece of technology in front of them and watching them in amazement
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Was a great place to work and I recommend it if you can afford to take a low salary. Should be a commission based pay. Pay scale went up but if you were already at above the minimum of the increase your pay did not go up accordingly.
good,I personally love the place. Leadership is really there for you and will help put you in a position to be a success. You earn the security of knowing you're job isn't going anywhere any time soon.
good,I enjoy working there fun lots of energy and management is always willing to help you achieve your goals. And the employee discounts are the best! They train very well and keep you up to date as far as where the company is going.
good,It was an ok place to work. The management was absolutely horrible. 2 of the people that worked in management were married and they were never around at the time when they were needed.
good,Fairly easy going as long as the jobs are getting done in a timely manner. Coworkers are fun and easy to communicate with. Sales floor gets competitive to which department sells the most and management created games in which the departments would compete.
good,"Great place to work whether it's your first job, making your way through college or looking for long term career. Growth potential dependent on your need for success. Sky's the limit"
good,Just an average place to work and dress for the type of season your in. Nice being in a position not having to work with a group of individuals where your able to work as fast or at a slower pace if needed.
good,Staff was awesome to work with. all had similar love for things I did so we could completely geek out on stuff and we would always know what the other was talking about. Everyone was friendly and professional.
good,Typical day is selling solutions to customers. I learned A LOT about leadership and selling skills. Best Buy provides employees with excellent training. Can be very competitive. Hardest part is on your feet moving all shift.
good,Best first job anyone can ask for. Many use it as a stepping stone into a tech career. Always competitive in sales and so on.. Growth does happen at a steady pace here.
good,"I help sell any Digital Imaging products such as Cameras, drones and Go Pros. I help customers pick the best camera that they need along with lenses and any other accessories. I want to make sure that they leave with the best product for them. I also know how to work sales."
good,"This is a retail environment, so be prepared for long hours and terrible work life balance. Once you get passed that, Best Buy is a great place to work and you will learn skills that will carryover wherever you go. A great job if you are young and without a family."
good,Best Buy is a great company to work for to gain sales and customer service experience. I gained confidence in myself and that let to other opportunities in the work force.
good,"Before I started working for Geek Squad, all appliance delivery and install was being done by third party laborers. They've revolutionized the industry by now using their own employees, making the customer experience much smoother for the most part. But because it was such a new idea, it was a difficult work environment being guinea pigs. I have faith that the idea will take off and will run much smoother in the future, but it was too physically demanding and was taking a toll on my personal life/overall life goals, and I decided it best to part ways. That said, Best Buy and Geek Squad alike are wonderful to work for. Benefits were amazing, discounts were numerous, and there are a bevy of different job opportunities."
good,I appreciate the flexibility of hours to allow me the ability to work another job concurrently.  There doesn't seem to be much opportunity of advancement.

good,I love working here and I don't ever want to leave. The work is fun and fast pace. Management is so understanding. Best managers I ever had.

good,"A typical day at work means unpacking merchandise for processing, then placing them in their appointed locations.  I am now also assisting with sales, and will be working to do that in addition to my inventory duties. The workplace culture is great. Advancement seems limited, and my age seems to work somewhat against me (I'm 58), but then the store has Amazon as a competitor, and that is hard on the company."
good,"i worked at best buy, geek squad department for two years, it is a great position for whoever wants a career in the information technology field. it is a good starting position."
good,"Really have no complaints apart from the pay. It is a bit low in my opinion, and the way yearly raises work is not truly fair as it is based off of your department's rating and not your own."
good,"All everyone does all day is walk around and talk and text like this was a social media gathering, and managers act as your friend and then tell you what to do when it get busy because they can’t handle business until it is slow. They will move up their friends before they move up a well rounded individual."
good,"Bestbuy is a fun and exciting place to work. Everyone was very productive, well trained."
good,"Management: Overall management was great. They were very lenient and understanding."
good,"Best Buy was pretty great to work for. The management was very nice and attentive and the perks were great. This was a seasonal job and they did not need any part time or full time workers, so I was not hired on permanently, but if they had positions open at the time, I would have liked to stay working there."
good,"Very productive working environment, continuous improvement and learning is always the message. Customer Experience is the focus that leads to continuous sales encounters"
good,Best Buy has help me grow as a person outside of the work environment. I would recommend this company to anyone. I started as a seasonal employee and now I'm in management position which shows anyone that if you work hard enough you can definitely grow.
good,"Normal days include going over sales goals, finding ways to benefit the store, and working with management to improve personal behaviors. There is a bit of favoritism that occurs."
good,From the moment you walk through the doors you are able to help customers to find what they are looking for.  Training modules are very informative.  Other employees are always helpful in training as well.
good,"Fun place to work at. Best Buy has given me many opportunities and allowed me to become comfortable in talking to everyone. "
good,"Normal day at work involved greeting customers as they came into your assigned department or area."

good,a normal day at work wold consist of ringing people up with their products at the check lanes or doing returns the desk. the hardest part of the job would be the selling of our protection plan.
good,Selling consumer electronics and demonstrating how the products works for the customers life style. Working together with management on new ways to sell and show new products. Its a fun place to work
good,"I enjoy working at Best Buy. I have been working there for over 3 years. Best buy has taught me a lot and given me great experience in retail and customer service! It is a friendly environment to work in with good pay to start out, but I wish there were more raises and opportunities to grow throughout the company."
good,"Probably the best company ive every worked. Great people, great pay, flexible hours, and plenty of opportunity to move up.worked with the company almost 9 yrs."
good,"Great job if you love to sell and give advice when it comes to tech pay is great, but not ideal when it comes to working hours if you intend on being with family as much as possible."
good,I enjoyed going to work everyday and interacting with my co-workers. Although some of the calls and customers could be difficult to assist. It was comforting to know that you had a great support system there to help get you through those tough times.
good,"enjoyed being there, always a great environment and great people to be around. always busy, time went by very fast, there was always something to do or someone to help and answer a question for. you strive to helping a customer and providing the best experience possible for them."
good,"Una muy buena empresa, muy buen ambiente de trabajo."
good,"My typical day at Best Buy consisted of selling and answering questions about computer products. I loved working here, as many of the employees were helpful when you had a question about the products."
good,The company is a good company but they lack the focus on the company values. They tell u to have fun while being the best but run the company company with an iron fist. They need to learn how to put value and stock behind loyal employees than new hires
good,"The typical day is working with customers, down stocking, and talking. I learned a few things about networking that I had not known beforehand. the management is great with friendly and understanding managers. Seems like everybody who works there is easy to get along with, they also have most of the same interests as the next person. The hardest part about the job is finding something to do when it gets slow. I enjoyed talking with my co-workers as they know a lot about many of my interests."
good,A typical day at Best Buy is dealing with a patient issue. I learned when you are dealing with technology and thousands of dollars you must come up with a quick solution. The management was ok they were very pushy with sales goals. The workplace culture was great everyone got along. The hardest part of the job was Black Friday. Everyone had to do a mandatory 12 hour shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was they would give us as many hours as we wanted to work to make extra money.

good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.

good,great place to work. the people were the best part of the job. I would recommend working there to friends and family. Loved the fast paced learning environment.
good,"Starting out working there is a great role. You learn plenty about how to excel in retail sales. I was able to perform a lot of tasks and help customers. My only concern is that it doesn't seem active enough for me to feel more confident about time spent there. We rarely get many customers, and this could effect my hourly schedule. They also have a lot of employees which cuts down on hours for newer positions."
good,Great place to work with amazing people. The training is time consuming but definitely helpful. The atmosphere is very friendly. There is always something going on for the employees. I would really love to work there again.
good,"I was there for a few months in my seasonal job, so experience was limited; but it had a great atmosphere and seemed like a great place to work and advance."

good,"Geek squad was the best job I ever had, not because of the salary or the working conditions, but because of the culture and the other Agents across the country and even over in the US."
good,"The typical day at work consisted of friendly talk amongst co workers on down town but usually was filled up with talking to customers or stocking up the place. The managers were very friendly, helpful, and profession in their work. The hardest part of the job was stocking lots of product especially around the holiday season as it consisted of constant picking up of packages. Lastly, the most enjoyable part was the friendly atmosphere among each other."
good,Love working for Best Buy and it will jumpstart any career path you would like to take. You get to interact with people everyday and literally have multiple tries to better someone's day.

good,Bosses and other colleagues really impact whether or not this job would be fun or if it would be dreadful. In my experiences everyone who works there is knowledgeable and tends to want to have fun while being the best.
good,"have fun, learn all the new tech gear, and move up. its a fast paced job. mornings can be a little slow but at night hold on. moving is is not always easy but is possible"
good,A typical day at work is high energy and competitive. I learned how to sell a variety of products and services. The managers that I worked for in both locations were great in assisting with sales and helping me cultivate my skills. BestBuy has great workplace culture and they make sure that their values are instilled in employees with yearly company training. The hardest part of the job is adapting to different departments. The most enjoyable part of the job is building solutions for the customer.
good,Best Buy is an excellent company who prides itself on being at the forefront of change and people development. It provides a tremendous amount of growth and long term skills to aid in life and career.
good,"I worked as a cashier and on the floor as a sales associate. I enjoyed being a cashier more because I was able to interact with more people. I usually worked the day shift until close. Everyone I came into contact with was so sweet, it's just the type of environment Best Buy has. Management was always there supporting us and helping us grow in our career and in our personal life. Incredible employee discounts. I wanted to come to work because I enjoyed my job though, not for what I got out of it. To this day, I am still friends with several people and former managers."

good,"was a great time with them, they were sad to see me go but I was looking for a full time, which could not be given to me. Definitely"
good,"Probably the most fun I've ever had at a job."
good,"Geek Squad City was a fun place, work was fairly consistent. Finding promotion was a frustrating process from the bottom to the top even with managers wanting higher spots. Break room was fully furnished with PS4, Xbox, gaming PC, pool table, ping pong table, big cafeteria serving at the time rather unhealthy food. "
good,"Enjoyed learning about a bunch of different technology such as phones, gaming, computers, home theater, and connected home. I've made many of friends and enjoyed working with my husband.

good,"I loved working here both times i worked for the company. when i worked for the company in high school it was far better and the location and culture was great they are always flexible with school schedules and if you have kids. i worked for the front end, customer service and the warehouse and i loved all three positions. my supervisors were unfortunately not all that great at the second location i worked for... they didn't care much about the customers it was all about making money which was something i'd always complain about to our GM and nothing ever seemed to happen. i would have stayed if they would have hired me for full time, the part time hours just weren't enough."
good,"Great environment, benefits & plenty of room for growth. They provide plenty of training and tools to perform your job. Flexible schedule & pay holidays is just some of the perks."
good,"Best Buy was my first job and it was a great opportunity for me. We were very often recognized for any great sales we made with all of our employees but not monetarily considering employees don't get commission anymore. Also, training took place off site in a hotel over a course of three days."
good,I enjoy working here dealing with planogram changes as well as downstocking. Hardest part is getting big jobs done in small amount of time. Most enjoyable part is being part of a team that knows the true meaning of teamwork. Being able to work with each other through our strengths and weaknesses. Confiding as well as consoling coworkers going through a tough time at work while being professional and courteous.
good,i work at Best Buy as my coop placement and had an amazing experience the people were amazing and I became quick friends with and the work and helping customers was very enjoyable.
good,"The culture of this job was pretty fun. The managers were very motivational and whenever we had early- early morning meetings, refreshments were served. Good ones, too.

good,I was able to learn quite a lot while working at Best Buy and I enjoyed my time there. Even when it got busy it was manageable and I was able to go to management if I had any concerns. They were very willing to teach me what I wanted to learn.
good,je trouve que l'ambiance est la meilleur mais le salaire est vraiment a discuter ( comme vendeur )
good,over all had a great experience at BestBuy. Taking into consideration the surrounding neighborhood and poverty the job wasn't as bad as it could have been. Management did not handle apprehension situation appropriately.
good,"It is a very great place to work but pay is not great, For the amount of revenue they create they should be able to pay their employees better than what they currently do."
good,"Overall job was great. You mainly spent your time talking to customers about which products they should buy, finding out whether they were available and completing the transaction. When not with customers you simply organized shelf's and stocked product."
good,great work environment  for the beginner because they got a lot of opportunity to learn and increase the experience which defiantly helps a lot in future.
good,"I won't say it was the best thing ever, however I will say I loved my job. Through my 7 years at Best Buy I have worked in 3 different stores, a handful of managers, and 5 different general managers; through all that my opinion of Best Buy never changed. By far one of the best places I think you could work at. All fall you dread that Black Friday sale and the next thing you know you find out that you love it because they are so great at training they make sure that you don't go untrained especially at some of the hardest times of the year. Don't get me wrong, the job isn't always butterflies and cupcakes but for me I wouldn't have had any other job for those 7 years. I now a consumer and not an employee will still soley shop there due to their trainings that the employees go through to know the newest technology that will fit in with your lifestyle."
good,Management was exceptional and most of the people who worked there truly liked their jobs.  Selling protection plans for some items was difficult and was a requirement of the job.
good,Work is do-able. You will be taught in how to succeed in your role. Learn how to effectively listen and find cues to what the client is really looking for. Management is patient . Workplace culture is fun.

good,All I really remember about Best Buy was that it was boring at times. Plus I didn't really like the travel when I was on the project team. Other than that I was alright.
good,The management were always friendly and helpful. We always had a good time working together. All the people i worked with were relaxed and having a good time getting the work done.
good,"The company really tries to look after it's employees, giving them chances of monthly and quarterly bonuses. Great holiday hours. And amazing health care benefits."

good,"Bestbuy is the place to be. The management is extremely understanding and caring. They value you as a person and an employee. I understand that the experience is different at each store, but I've worked at multiple bestbuy locations and it's been a really easy transition."
good,There is a lot of fun to had working at geek squad and plenty of room for growth if that is the goal. It may be a little different than expected to be honest and clients can be difficult but the close friendships and good people you will work closely with will help.
good,"In my opinion, everyone who wishes to be in a sales profession should have at least some form of retail sales experience as you are exposed to almost every type of individual from various and diverse backgrounds. Each of which obtain different buying criteria and require different demands as to what they expect from the product you're selling and their desired outcome."
good,"Honestly, working at Best Buy was a blast! I had fun while working! I gained a lot of customer service experience as I grew in this company.

Loved to see new faces and talk to people every day!"

good,Would still be working for this company had they not consolidated their IT support teams and eliminated many of the distribution points IT staff. Would go back working for them in a heartbeat if I could.
good,Best Buy is a great place to work and they truly care about how their employee experience.  They give you everything you need to do to succeed all you have to do is pay attention.
good,I really enjoyed my tenure working for the company.   I thought I was at  a max in my position and I wanted to grow anywhere I could so I regrettfuly left the company.   That will be a mistake I  will have to live with.
good,I love working at Best Buy it is a fun environment and friendly staff who make you feel welcome especially when you are new to the company I don't like management
good,"I've been working there for almost 3 years and I love this job. I've been given every opportunity to be promoted, work closely with management and expand on my training as I make my way to supervisor and manager levels of work. I would recommend this job to anyone who loves dealing with technology, finding the right solution for customers and working in a goal-oriented environment that has fun while being the best,"
good,I help build the red deer best buy and it was a great place to work i was in charge of the media part and loved working there and seeing all the new games and moives.
good,"On a typical day working for Pacific Sales, one will be working with the public signing them up for deliveries, assisting them with their purchases for appliances and parts, and sometimes just advice as to what will look nice in their home.  It's an enjoyable position as one can learn a lot for their own home which will make an sales associate give better advice to their customers."
good,"Activate phones, work with customers, sell products!"
good,"A typical day in the life of a Best Buy associate varied from day to day. On an opening shift you would get the department powered up as well as make sure everything was functioning correctly then you would assign daily tasks for associates to complete. I learned as well as applied things everyday on sales strategies, teaching back what I had learned, how to sell new emerging technologies, and the benefits of giving consumers more open to buy dollars with Best Buy Financing. The workplace culture was the greatest thing about Best Buy as the people that work there are amazing. The hardest part of the job was the random hours with the ever changing schedule."
good,"Very fun environment with a bunch of team building activities that motivate the store to do well. The team was always fun to be around and also had a can do attitude. I would work here again, the only reason I left was because I went to school somewhere else."

good,"A typical day could be busy or slow "
good,Everyone was very helpful and had a positive attitude. The store was consistently busy and I loved helping customers. All in all it was just fun and fulfilling
good,I like this job so much. Explains why I been here so long it's just time for more money. I recommend this job to a few friends that like the company as much as I do. Management was always fair co workers always keep me positive.
good,"Everyone there is so nice and welcoming. On my first day i felt like i was part of the team immediately, they made it seem like i have been working there for months! Great environment! everyone is so willing to help, and make sure you really get what you need and helps take care of any customer issues when needed. Management was great overall, but some certain managers were just terrible..."
good,"Workplace was amazing, the management team is very professional and are always there to help you out. Co-Workers are great too, to be honest not really anything negative to say about the company or the store, they genuinely try to help out customers and their warranties are very useful when it comes to protecting your products."
good,"Great team, fun people to work with. Best environment ever. Working the sales floor can be stressful but give you good insight on how to be a great salesperson."
good,"Overall, best buy is a fun place to work at, but management is different in every store and training amongst both management and line level is very different for every employee. There needs to be more consistency between stores following policy."

good,"A typical day, is coming in to the building clocking in and taking customer payments. I didn't learn to much accept what I already knew. The managers aren't the best and their approaches aren't that great. the co-workers are some of the best people I've ever met. The hardest part is staying cool when the customer is yelling at you. Is talking to co-workers."
good,"Productive and fun workplace with competitive pay and great benefits I have been with the company for a long time and they have always treated me fairly and offered me great incentives to work here. Theywill put you to work though, and expect things to get done in a timely manner."
good,"Best Buy is a part time job. There is always something to do most days. The holidays is the most active time for the company so there is always something to do or to sell. Hours do have a large range from 0-30 hours for part time. Great place to start to establish yourself and there are many positions open for those who wish for opportunity. However, be prepared for training because it is quite extensive."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I've been with the company for three years. There are awesome benefits, (401K matching, insurance, stock purchasing, sales contests) as well as lots of opportunities for upward mobility. The employees genuinely have the ability to have their voices heard, all the way up the ladder and that was something I didn't expect. The hardest part is the sales schedule, but that is the same for most retail. Working with the technology is the best part. You get to go to training and have the chance to work with lots of different vendors."
good,"I would've liked more hours, but I greatly enjoyed my time there. I was initially seasonal but got hired as part-time after i showed my stuff at the store."
good,working at best buy was fun it was cool for me to be around electronics all day and to get to meet new people and help them find the perfect products for their lifestyle
good,"I loved this job! I was treated well. It was wonderful to feel appreciated every day and they did that in many different ways. It made me feel excited to go to work everyday. I was one of  the highest trained employees in the store because of the job I did. Multichannel sales associate, so my job was to keep calls off the floor and help the customers myself with whatever they needed."
good,"As a kid in my 20's, this was the best job I could ask for. Good pay, get to play with the newest tech, flexible schedules, and tuition reimbursement."
good,"Super fun to talk to customers regarding upcoming cell phone technology."
good,Amazing workplace with great people. Definitely a learning experience. The management is extremely organized and you learn something new if not multiple things everyday

good,"I have been an Employee of Best Buy for 18 years. I have held Many Positions from Customer Service, Sales; Department Supervisor and Geek Squad Agent. It has been a great company to work for."
good,"Best Buy was a great environment to work for, people are good to work with, management related to their workers, company had good benefits and perks, was a fun place to work overall."
good,"My location has/had some great people that I connected with beyond work. The environment in our warehouse is comfortable and the work ethic is admirable. "
good,I love the people that i work with and i thoroughly enjoy working for this company. They provide you with ample training and will always do their best to help you where you are struggling. The company provided weekly and monthly check-ins.
good,"A typical day for me involved working in the computer department assisting customers with there needs or helping other departments around the store if things got busy for them. Management was very nice and respectable, no real issues with them."
good,Great job for someone to build a career with or starting out a new one. The company is ran like a family and all of the workers form great relationships with each other.
good,they are very supportive when it comes to working with students work schedules. And they do try to show appreciation to their employees.
good,Enjoyed my time there. Will definitely help you in learning new technology and speaking to people. It increases your confidence in the ability to sale things.
good,"BestBuy est une entreprise génial avec des avantages sociaux plus que bonne (Dentaire, invalidité, etc.) Également, a de très belle valeurs et des équipes génial. Le seul défaut pour la vente est le fait que le salaire est plutôt bas et sans commission en plus."
good,Working for this company was great!!!!! Only down fall was it was only part time maybe 15-20 hours a week. Great pay for the job and people were great. Overall it was a great work atmosphere
good,"Es una gran empresa con muchas oportunidades de crecimiento, el ambiente laboral es muy divertido y relajado, hay momentos para todo, tanto para trabajar, como ara descansar, comer y hasta dormir. Claro, cuando se pueda. "
good,I was pleased to have worked for Best Buy but was unable to transfer with my job title. If I could remotely work for them I would. I learned a lot working there and was provided with several learning tools. The hardest part of working there was not being able to satisfy every customer. The people working there were like family and communicating at times was a little difficult. The best part was when customers rated my serivce excellent.
good,"Best Buy is a company to watch and participate if you can - the opportunity to learn from working with a close knit family is honorable. "
good,Met some lifelong friends. Made great memories.  Just a fun place to be. Managers were all cool and easy going. Sometimes the schedule can be a bit crazy.  But you'll meet great people that all seem to get along really nicely.
good,Great company to work for and even more awesome people to work with. Amazing mission statements and customer promises that we live by. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting the customer the perfect solution for what they are looking for and giving them the best value for what they are paying.
good,very busy work environment. i learned a lot about the product that they carried. management was really good amazing people in that position. working for the company was amazing very fun and amazing opportunity's.
good,Need to move forward in my career field. Great place for improvement and start off in a field. Need to improve management.
good,Being allowed to come to work and have fun with staff and peers. setting up demos and enjoying fun with customers. after driving your team to hit your monthly goals and your GM throws a BBQ for the store is not only nice but a huge team builder.
good,I thought this was going to be a permanent position and was disappointed that it was temporary for the Holiday Season.  I was very happy working here.
good,"a typical day at work would be to troubleshoot any client of ours with any software and hardware based needs "
good,Great! A wonderful place to work! Typical day includes contacting customers.  Getting to understand  them and giving the best solution that are suitable towards their needs.  Learned about what components make a computer on the inside.  Co-workers are great and fun to be around.  They are always willing to help.  The hardest part about the job is maintaining being the best.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that being the best is also rewarding.
good,Working at Best Buy is a great experience to build relationships as well as further your career in the sales industry.  It is a great place to get your foot in the door and to get a taste for what sales is like on a daily basis.  I have the privilege to work with a great group of team leaders and managers.
good,"A typical day was very busy, as I helped in all aspects. I learned all aspects of repair both software and hardware repair on both apple and windows machines, and mobile devices. I learned how to effectively coach out to 50+ employees every month on selling strategies, and product knowledge, and how to handle clients with new and old technology. The hardest part of the job Would be having the need to be there for more than 45+ hours a week consistantly due to understaffing. The most enjoyable part was helping coworkers succeed, educating clients, fixing technology brought to me and seeing the clients be happy."
good,Great place to learn skills which help with customer engagement knowing and understanding for company values to better service its cliental.
good,"I love working for them,they are an awesome store,but some of the management team are very bias to certain parts of the team."
good,It was a good first job for myself and helped me gain a lot of warehouse experience and walkie certification. Overall the people are nice and I am glad I had this as my first job.
good,"Management was ok, had someone who at least knew what was going on with machines, then when he left to be a store manager, the replacement didn't know anything and lead to believe that didn't want to know anything about the field only customer satisfaction.  Co-workers had fun and were able to answer some questions or willing to give a second opinion when client asked for one"
good,"Best Buy has been an amazing company to further my personal skill set.  They provided me with opportunity at a young age to gain management, customer service, and sales experience.  Being a retail manager is a continuous grind that is very fast pace, and rewarding!  At this point in my life I am looking for a job with a better work-life balance and am excited to see what opportunities the future hold for me!"
good,"A typical day at Best Buy is always changing. You can go from doing one thing one day to doing the complete opposite the next day. I have learned a lot and made it a must to learn as many areas of the job as possible. I feel that makes me more valuable as a worker and and allows me to contribute more to the company. Management knows what they are doing and are able to come up and execute plans when something goes wrong or to make a process go smoother. My coworkers are all well rounded, so they are able to pick up the slack if someone doesn't come in. The hardest part of the job is not knowing what you will walk into that day. The most enjoyable part of the job is the freedom to learn different things at your own pace which opens up a lot of opportunities later down the line."
good,Enjoyed working with the public and helping with all technical needs. Great hours and flexible management staff. Pay could be more for the work that is done but overall not a bad job or rate of pay.
good,"Its working at a major electronics retailer, what's not to love! The biggest problem was having self control to not blow my entire paycheck on misc items at the store."
good,Worked with many fantastic employees who had the desire to win. Customer service and employee training were always a focus. Loved being part of the Best Buy team for so many years to watch it grow into the Fortune 200 company it is today.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"great place to work at"
good,BestBuy stands out from any other retail business. The leaders in my store are there to motivate and drive goals. Every day is different.
good,"Best Buy is a great place to start building a career. Several positions to work in. Always around the newest tech. Management was sometimes iffy, but always nice people. Co-workers, like any job, just varied on the willingness of the employee. Hardest part of the job was the mix of hours with the sales goals. Most enjoyable were the people, employees and customers, and also being around all the technology with great discounts."
good,Great company to learn from and grow with!  Many opportunities available as well as great benefits!  Enjoyable experience with many outstanding leaders!
good,"I find it very weird to come into a place and rate my success there off of how much other people want to spend their money.  I will likely not have a future in sales.  That being said, you are not on commission here so there is a lot less pressure to sell which is nice."
good,"when I get there if I open I do my report and make sure the things are in the front, I answer about 5 lines, answer customer questions over the phone and then I do cashier if needed. I love my co-workers I love my job, i love working there, i have fun when I'm at work this is one of the most best job i have ever had the management team is great."
good,"In my experience at Best Buy, the job in itself is fairly easy, but the only downside to it is the managers that hardly know what they are doing. The product knowledge is easy to acquire and the customers are extremely nice and fun to help out. Selling is also a great skill to have."
good,Making sales and getting customers signed up for best was the main goals in the store so basically by learning how to get to customer to become loyal customers by getting them to become Best buy card members was my ultimate goal and I reached that goal with great people that I work teaching me.
good,"For a retail job, this is one of the best to have. I am sure that management and experience changes from store to store, but Geek Squad has a unique culture that makes it all worth it. High stress and high fun."
good,"Best Buy is an easy and fun place to work. However, they rarely give full time and with no full time you wont receive the benefits. Overall, it is a good job with good management if you are looking for work on the side."
good,BestBuy is awesome to work for they really take care of all their employees and also give you all the tools to succeed on the sales floor and off loved every minute while working @ BESTBUY.
good,Best Buy is a great company. They give great life balance and support employees to take care of themselves outside of work.
good,"Best Buy in general treated their employees with respect and how I believe a company as large as them should. But management at store level, I feel, get lost in the world of ""customer first."" While I believe in this motto for companies and stores like this, when you delve too deep into this, employees start to dislike the work place and therefore, production and customer service go down. while i did not fall victim to the last part of the review, most of my colleges did."
good,"They were always good to work around school.  They treated me well and I really enjoy working with them, however, I'd like to spread my wings and take on a new adventure."
good,Working at Best Buy Canada is probably one of the more exciting jobs i have worked at because i get to meet new clients to interact with daily especially working at the down-town Toronto location. Also the co-workers make the environment one of the best to work in as they help push you to do better and always appreciate the hard work each of us do. Hardest part of the job is dealing with clients who are difficult to deal with but that can also be one of the most enjoyable because making a client feel amazing and seeing a smile on their face after a purchase they made and to make them feel good about themselves is one of the most enjoyable part of my job. Management is top-notch and they care about their employees which makes us feel wanted and appreciated which in turns makes us help the company achieve their goals that much easier and more fun while doing so.
good,A typical work day for me would be coaching and training my line level employees. I learned how excel my selling abilities and understand the customer thru conversation and lifestyle questions. My management team could of been a little better at communicating things out instead of watching someone fail slowly without reassuring the expectations. My co-workers made my life so much easier when you give respect you will receive it. Good co-workers make it easy. The hardest part of my job was putting 110% effort without any verbal recognition or pay increase for years at a time. The best part about my job was interacting with every customer and with lifestyle question figuring there needs wants and desires!!
good,"This was my favorite place to work, everything about all the jobs I did was there was someone there to always help. I learned so many beneficial things working here that I can and have used in other jobs. The way it worked was that we were almost like a family and were always there for each other and the customers were also great."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Nice stepping stone for employment."
good,"The only downside to working at Best Buy is the great variability in work schedule, but that may be common in retail. Other than that, it's a great group of people to work for."
good,"No job is easy, especially retail...But it's a great job to get your foot in the door of how a successful retail store should run. The environment is really nice and the coworkers are part of the reason that makes me love going to work. All in all, it's an excellent place to work."
good,Great working atmosphere. Freedom of expression to create great sales tactics. Great co-workers and managers overall an amazing job.
good,"you make your presence know at main office & clock in."
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work at. Working at Best Buy enhanced my knowledge in retail a lot. I learned things I've never known about, as well as interacting with customers on a daily basis."
good,Everyone works their hardest and helps one another to make a great team. The managers are motivated and motivate all the workers. There is a lot of opportunities to grow within the company.
good,"I learned a lot about the skills needed in the retail space, as well as learning skills such as working a cash register, and warehouse work."
good,"Great place to work in college. They pay you a decent amount for the work, but i do feel that they should pay more in mobile. Verizon and ATT pay their employees significantly better."
good,I worked an 8 hour day where I worked in different departments in the store to help customers find product. I overseen the loss prevention with keeping the product inside the store by stopping customers from stealing.
good,"Great place to work, great management team and great co-workers. I get a great sense of accomplishment knowing that I help customers finding what they need."
good,"I temped here so there really was no job security but the job itself was an amazing experience. No complaints.... ... ... They are making me write more so here it goes. I got the job through Right Staff, they typically handle most of their seasonal temps from my understanding. The managers there made the most out of my schedule, keeping me on for extra hours and work time through the vacation of my other job (per my personal request) and also made my other full time schedule work with their full time schedule."
good,Management cares about there employees. You always have something to learn. A very versatile learning environment. There is always something to do. Very busy during holidays.
good,"Overall Bestbuy had a great culture as well as great training, but the management was horrible and HR didn't help. I had sent in multiple requests mohave management reviewed i was harassed on multiple occasions. In the end i decided to leave it was a great culture, training and learning experience, but horrible management."
good,"even though this was seasonal, I loved the job. they give you a great discount and you have fun while working because you can learn new products and features. the coworkers were great. I could spend a whole day there and it wouldn't feel like I was actually working because it was so much fun!"
good,I love working here. Its a great environment with great people to work with. All is great besides the pay and opportunities to advance.
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. I worked there for 5 years and enjoyed it all. Unfortunately they do way to much down sizing
good,Great company to work for. The employee benefits are the best around. Good management in the stores that I have worked for.

good,"Great company, allows you to gain excellent skill sets in customer service, communication, troubleshooting, keep up on new advance technology."
good,"This is a very good place to work, daily jobs never get tedious as there is always something new walking through the door. I new challenge always arises. Also colleagues in different stores are always there to help if you get stuck and you get a lot of support from sales consultants."
good,Good job to start out with but not sure about the job growth their. Times can be hectic and overwhelming but then you will have a lot of boring days.
good,"know your accomplishments, don't sell yourself short. If a success of yours has flown under the radar, now's the time to bring it up. Chances are your boss will ask what you brought to the team in the time you've been there, and you should exactly how your work has affected the company. Keep a running tally of the good things you've done for your company."
good,It was a great job to work at it was just the same thing everyday though.  And you really didn't know if the department would last or not. I learned to have patience when it came to dealing with parts and breaking stuff or waiting around. Management was great and so where the co-workers. There really was no hard part to the job to me.  Breaks where the most enjoyable.
good,"I worked at the Medford OR  store for a long time. I would have never left but I moved. Best work place ever!"
good,"I like to work hard, and find myself doing everything I can to get more and more work. My job At GeekSquad Consists mostly of customer relations and basic repairs on computers. My clients come in with a problem and I find a solution for them. Most clients come in very frustrated about their technical issues. It is my duty to diffuse the situation and provide a solution to their problem. I see a lot of customers in a short amount of time. I like to build a relationship with my customers, to ensure future visits from them. The management is quite good and my fellow coworkers are fantastic. I only wish I could work more there."
good,During my time at Best Buy I was taught many things by my General Manager and top management. I learned extensive supervisory and consultation skills and garnished many great connections that I will have for many years to come. I am truly thankful for everything this company has helped me accomplish thus far.
good,"I began in an experimental position called Customer Communications Manager and called people while helping at check in for Geek Squad services. I moved up to Supervisor by hard work and dedication. I did not care to move into store management so I moved aside to let others who did become supervisor, however I was requested as supervisor again at a later date. The hardest and most enjoyable part of the jobs that can be had there are the same, the customers. I learned a lot there about teamwork and coordination as well as scheduling work or employees."
good,"I had a great time working at Best Buy Mobile simply  because of the great work environment. The customers were usually very nice and patient,most very respectful."

good,"•	Provided courteous and professional customer service. "
good,The training for this job and the manager were amazing. I learned so many tips and techniques for selling products. I really liked all of my co-workers there and enjoyed working along side other tech nerds like myself. I learned a lot from them also. The hardest part of the job was having to stay so late until everything was perfectly in place. I feel they really should have had more people there to close the store. The most enjoyable part for me was learning about all of the different products and all of the growth that I achieved.
good,"I love the employees, I love the company, I love the push for innovation--I quit because of the management at the location I was at. Poor knowledge with direct supervisors--many times a supervisor would just sign off on things that I did that they didn't know how to do."
good,This is a great job if you are looking for something part time.  If you love customer service and love to help people then this is the place to be.
good,"Over all was a wonderful opportunity to work for this company at this location. I have never had any real issues with any of my co-workers and found most to be enjoyable. I learned a lot about sales, customer service, installation, store merchandising, packing and shipping, and over all store security, and additionally through my positions  learned a lot about being a leader and what it takes to run a store. The hardest part of any of my jobs is keeping up with the weekly changes to many of the policies and any other updates.

The thing with Best Buy, they care about the employee more than any other company I have worked for. The benefits provided are outstanding. As with every company though, there can be a good amount of instability with management. But if you get a good set of leadership, this is a great company to work for."

The management was terrible but my coworkers were great. my pay was abysmally inadequate, I learned next to nothing, my coworkers were, again, good, the hardest part of the job was talking to managers because they were a pain in the but, and the most enjoyable portion was seeing money deposited into my bank every other week."

Management always there for us when we have questions or any issues. I learned that with hard work and dedication you can always move up from your beginning position."
good,"A typical day at work was coming in early to repair, configure, and maintain computer systems. Management was great at keeping the moral up. My co-workers were knowledgeable in their field.

Provide trouble shooting in store and over the phone when necessary. make sure the employees understand the work performed or needs to be performed to finish customer computers. The guys I work with are knowledgeable about all aspects of IT. We all work together to educate each other on the new viruses out today. hardest part of the job is management at best buy does not always understand what we do. We try to keep them in the loop, but its difficult because some managers don't speak pc we try to do what we can. i always enjoy when a customer can understand what you did and appreciates the work we do."
good,"It is an extremely fun and entertaining place to work. Very good management and worker structure. It is clean and always has something to do to make sure everyone is busy. Has a very well kept break room as well, with refrigerator for food as well as television to watch."
good,This job really helped me to properly interact with the customers. It taught me so much about how a deal really works and how a sale should be conducted. Its not about selling the most expensive item on the market. It's about making sure that your customers are well taken care of and that they are suited with the item that best suits their needs.
good,"Management was great. Job was not difficult. Customers can be rowdy, but it is manageable. I would punch in, work on computers, talk with customers, and then leave. Coworkers were great to work with. They made the work fun. You learn a lot about diagnosing and repairing machines, even if you though you already knew how to do that."

I spent hours doing training on new and upcoming products that would help benefit the average person in their day to day lives. Management was enjoyable, upper management acted personable with other employees and built strong relationships with one another. Co-Workers were also a big plus of Best Buy. Not only did we work efficiently as a team but also had fun together as friends. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with all the growing technology day in and day out; however this was also one of the most fun parts as well.

good,A typical day at Best Buy would be engaging with all customers and helping them with whatever concern they have. What I learned at Best Buy was the entire procedure of selling and engaging with a customer in a professional way. The management at Best Buy is good and they take their job very seriously. The co-workers are very interactive and fun to be around. The hardest part of the job is to finish off the sale. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know everyone around you.
good,A typical work day includes a variety of things from being face to face with customers and be swamped with units to be fixed. While managing the time between both can feel a bit overwhelming. But while its the hardest part of the job it is also the most fun at time being crunched for time while fixing units in-between customer. So there is always work to be done.

good,"Atypical day was full of energy and fun"
good,Best Buy was a great company to work for.  It was a fun secure environment to be in.  They were very supportive of my school and extra job.
good,"Not only was the work environment great for young employees, but it seemed as though the customers were the cherry on top. Rarely did I have a bad time with any customer, young or old. Everyday I knew I'd leave happier clocking out than I did clocking in and the proof was seen everyday; I just like helping people! The difficulty of Best Buy would be the requirement to meet certain budget quota that was a bit reaching for the kind of traffic the location I worked saw. But none the less the challenge of meeting or better yet exceeding what was expected on paper in many ways inspired me to do better each day I had the chance to work. By far my most favorite job of all."

good,"Everyday at Best Buy is a good day, they keep me on my feet and moving all day, there's never a moment where there is nothing that needs to be done. As sales support I handle the online orders that customers make to be picked up in store, or mailed directly to their house. I'm responsible for the carry out needs of customers, and maintaining the warehouse. I also handle additional register support as needed, to help the customers have a better experience with us. My management team is very helpful, and encouraging they always help me with any needs I may have regarding the job. "

good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I worked almost every position available inside of a Best Buy store. I prided myself on knowledge of the whole entire store inside and out. I enjoyed interacting with customers as much as I enjoyed interacting with management.
good,"Management was good in many cases, supervisors stayed more up to date with needed support and did most of the work to take care of the employees. There is a lot that was learned and enjoyed throughout the day, went to Apple training classes outside of work and learned a lot from that with other employees."
good,I love computers and other electronics. Best Buy gave me the chance to learn more about good customer service the job ended because it was only seasonal but I enjoyed working there and would love to work there again.
good,"I learned from working at best buy everyday is a new day and you should take it as such. That you never stop growing no matter how long you've been with the company. The hardest part of the job most times is trying to come to a complete level with customers who have no respect, but at the same time it is something that must be done. I love everyday that I go into work because there is always something new to learn and I have the ability to make someones day!"
good,"Unloading trucks, stocking store, pulling orders, assisting customers"

good,"Working in a fast paced extremely active work had anything but typical days. I learned how to adapt to different types of customers, departments, and how to work along side different types of people. the management was more than amazing and was the only place I saw all members of management work as a team together. I was able to learn from many different co-workers about all the departments of the store in able to perform my job to the best of my abilities. The hardest part of the job was having to rely on delivery of ordered products. The best and most enjoyable part of the job was when I was able to help customers find exactly what they needed/wanted and go above and beyond to make the customers experience enjoyable."
good,"Helping each customer find the right computer was an interesting and fun puzzle to work on. Each customer had their own wants and needs and finding the right computer for them was rewarding."

The atmosphere with my co-workers was awesome! We operated like a unit and treated each other like family."
good,"Co- Workers are a blast to be around, usual start the day off with a run down of how the day has been going good or bad. Management is laid back and doesn't add stress to your life with unrealistic goals."
good,its one awesome place to work where you can help the everyday common man or woman to get the best deal without paying out the door prices.
good,"Work schedule was the normal retail with changing daily shifts."
good,"Personally, the above quote mentions my day at Best Buy the best. Our managers has set a culture where we all enjoy each other company while providing outstanding consultation to our customers and hitting our sales goal for the day. As the months passed by since I started at Best Buy, I've grown more into training new hires and making sure everyone knows where we at for the day and how our business is doing for the month. I will go and assist customers while setting an example to our new hires on how it should be done. Consistent communication to my supervisor or manager is constant so we could be motivated on being the best in the company.

good,"This was by far the best job I've had. I decided to leave before I started college because the required hours would have interfered with my school schedule. The compensation was good considering my age. The employees were great. I'm still close friends with people I used to work with there. The management was a bit uptight, but it was not too hard to deal with."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is partnering with different vendors cross-culturally and learning about new technology trends and ideals.
good,management lacked the ability to understand customer to employee situations
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,One minute you're bored just cleaning and the next you're swamped with 3 customers. I learned more then just home theater I floated when other departments were very busy and not enough Associates to help. A lot of teamwork development and how to be a better manager.
good,"I worked at the Lake Charles Best Buy for about 2.5 years. I had a great time when I worked there and I met a lot of interesting people. The managers were some of the coolest people I'd ever met. The job requires a lot of product knowledge, but after they train you, it's no problem at all. Every day we would play games around selling and offering services. There were serious times when the managers wanted us to hit budgets, and not want us to joke around too much, but that didn't last too long. We had a good work and play ratio. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers. It was easy to look forward to the day's work when you thought of going and spending the day working with friends."

good,"I was Sr Supervisor in the Computer dept and Supervisor in the Appliance dept. I made sure my team was in their proper position to assist the customer, made sure they offer the extended warranty. Hardest part was learning the different ways the washers and dryers work and their parts that was covered in a regular warranty and the extended one. I really loved my job because of all the customers I helped."
good,"Most days were filled with getting ready for new shipments of movies and music, which meant that we had to test them out in order to tell the customer our honest opinion. One night we played a video game collectively as one store and had a blast."
good,with all the customers coming in and out all day it was a very fast past eviroment

good,"Jacksonville Nc best buy is the best! Can't be beat! Great managers, great people, and great atmosphere"
good,"My day would start off at the Store Pick-up counter. The people I worked with were friendly and helpful. They made me feel comfortable and confident. When a customer came up to the counter I would ask them if they were picking up a product that has already been purchased. I would then proceed to get their last name so I could find their product. Then I would go through the computer system and find the customer and confirm that they picked up their product. The hardest part was keeping up my speed. The best part was meeting new people every day and being able to help others. When the front-lane checkouts were busy and needed help, I was the one to go up front and help. So, a typical day was doing pick-ups and helping check-out customers. The supervisor, boss, and manager were always there when we needed a helping hand with customers. They were very helpful when were really busy. I learned from the job that helping other people can be fun and rewarding. I think the most important thing I learned from the job was speed, urgency and accuracy are critical in customer service."
good,Will work with hours for you and training worked well for employee
good,"For all the bad rap that the Geek Squad gets, this team was an amazing group of guys that I would love to work with any day of the week."
good,"Once at work I'm monitoring the cameras and keeping an eye out for unnecessary activity. It keeps me alerts and involves a lot of self patience due to long hours and standing at all times.

good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I have been into technology since I was 5 years old. I built my first computer at the age of 10. I have been an extreme techie nerd my whole life, and Best Buy has given me many ways to expand my knowledge and productivity. A typical day is me going over to my department and making sure everything is turned on and working well. I then clean our cashier area. Then I check to see where I am ""zoned"" in the department, and go to that area where I help customers with any questions they have and sell products. My co-workers are mostly around my age, and only a little bit older, which really helps when relating technology and real life discussions and work situations. Hardest part of my job is not being able to answer a question that a customer has. Most enjoyable part of my job is being able to set up a customer with the best piece of technology that will help improve their life with everything that they do."
good,enjoyed working in many areas of the company. started as a part time cashier and was trained as a merchandise specialist where I learned how to set retail displays and was within a year promoted to a loss prevention supervisor

good,"I really enjoyed working here, hours were what made me leave. I was a part timer but i worked full time hrs."
good,great life learning tools learned with new tech. great place to start a career
good,"It's a great place to work with great people and great culture, but can be hectic around the holiday season. That can be expected, however, as it's retail. Fun perks to working there, such as discounts, recognition. Fun helping people out, but it is quite a bummer to help those who do not want to be helped."
good,"All in all, it's not bad working at Best Buy 501. It is a store that listens when you have something to say, which, compared to what I hear from other friends of mine in retail is a rarity, one that I am quite thankful for."
good,"I love this company! I'm currently working 70-80 hours a week, but I love my boss and I love the work! It's a very fast-paced job and there is never any down time, but it's exciting and I feel like I add value and accomplish a lot on a daily basis. The people are friendly at Best Buy and my situation is a little different because I followed my boss to the job and jumped right in. Unfortunately, I never had time to participate in the 3-day training because the desk is so crazy busy, but I figured out who to reach out to and feel like I've mastered the job (somewhat) in a very short time."
good,Employees work hard every day with little recognition from management.
good,"A typical day of work at Best Buy included helping Customers find exactly what they needed to meet their Home Theater needs. I learned about the different kinds of Television Technology, Surround Sound, and Cable Information. The Management was understaffed but did try there best to help out when we needed it. I really enjoyed working with all of the staff and we all helped each other out and learned from one another. The hardest part of the Job would be explaining the Technology to the customer; each customer understood things explained to them a certain way which you had to pin point on a case to case basis. The most enjoyable part of my Job was seeing that Customer Happy when I put the confidence in them that they were buying the right product."
good,A typical work day for me was to clock in on time and remain at my cash register at all times while customers are ready to check out. When they were out on the floor shopping I would restock the area around me with items that were misplaced. What we learned was that it was easier to clean up as you go that way you could help others that no time to clean up their areas during closing. Mangement was pretty stable always someone to talk to when things went wrong or if customers wanted to know more information. Co-workers were decent and always on top of teamwork. The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with difficult customers had many throughout the day and sometimes could use a break. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing at the end of the day that I made a customers day by helping them out.
good,"Every morning we would go over numbers and then huddle up and start our day with what ever the chant of the day was. Most employess scattered to their assigned departments and they open the store, as Sales Operator I would go behind the customer service desk sit at my desk put on my headset and take care of any assignments needed done on Word, Excel, Power Point and make calls and sales over the phone, retrieve the sold item from the sales floor or warehouse and hold it in a cabinet in customer service. That a typical day. But the employes all were very friendly and fun, they would call my desk to get help or send me to the floor because i had to be certified in every department in order to sale from every department over the phone. I think that would be the hardest part of working there. My management was very happy I turned the stores over-the-phone sales from nothing to the highest in the region, but the position was a new one and they didn't really know how to manage me because I learned the job and went to trainings and knew more about my job than they did at the time. But my position quickly turned into everyone's job, I would have a million assignments and a sales goal and management would take me from my desk to help on the floor and handle their angry customers and review applications and do interviews for new employees over the phone and I was being stretched too thin. The reward of looking at the sales a t the end of the day was the best part of the day, to see how the other stores did and almost always at the top of sales in the state."

good,"A typical day at Best Buy involved opening the store, requiring that all Home Theaters display devices are up and running properly, loading the cash registers with currency, attend the morning meetings which consisted of news about the company and an interactive activity to wake everyone up. I learned about the many products that companies like Sonos, Sony, Samsung, LG, Sharp, Apple, HP, and many other electronic companies produce. I became very familiar with even product outside my Home theater department like computers, cell phones, and appliances. I also learned how to read store numbers as far as gross margin, revenue to budget, and were concerned. Management was great, all willing to attend to all our questions and concerns. The hardest part of the job would have to multitasking and having to attend to multiple customers at a time during hectic shopping seasons. Nonetheless, it something I was able to quickly adapt to. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the fact that I was constantly surrounded by my hobby, electronics, which made the job a lot easier."

I've obtained so much knowledge and training with Geek Squad. Between Windows 7 to Samsung's Latest Smart interaction TV, I am constantly learning the latest technology the industry offers. The hardest part of my job at times can be the at times the time frame in which units under go repair. Its tough to give a customer an accurate time frame when we cannot give it to them without running further tests."

Every one cares about one another, and I've never been in a store where everyone gets along like they do at my store. My employees make my job easy. They are encouraged to make decisions that best fit the customers' needs in any given situation because they know that I will support them in what ever decision they make if it's in the best interest of the customer and the company. If there was a hard part of the job it would have to be keeping up with technology."
good,"Best Buy is a good place to work for. I work part time so I do not have any benefits. Their core values are very high. Job security/ Advancement job security is good, advancement is always a lateral move, unless for some reason management leaves and you are qualified for the position.

good,"Great part time work, unique individuals make it a great place to work at."
good,"Depending on the General Manager, it can be a great, or horrible place to work."
good,"Overall, Best Buy has been a great company to work for. There is always room for advancement if you desire to. You also have the ability to work in different areas to see what positions your talents may suit. Great managers allow for flexible scheduling if in school, great benefits and a positive work environment."
good,I loved Best Buy so much that I still have dreams that I still work there. Time went by fast because I was into putting things together such as displays and I also loved interacting with the public.
good,"Far as distance to get to work is fair if you "
good,"It was fun to work with people and understand what they need, then selling it to them. Everyone on the staff was mellow for the most part. I made lots of friends I still talk to today working there."

good,"I was hired as a seasonal worker and loved working there from day one until my last day. Great company "
good,"Son muy incluyentes, un trabajo algo estricto pero con valides de por qué sea ase"
good,"I would say that Bestbuy was a great place to work at, the managers were very kind and wanted everyone to succeed, there were things in place to handle discrimination and other forms of harassment, and overall it was wonderful."
good,Super fun job that doesn't drag too much into the work/life balance. Most days don't feel like they drag simply because of the company you'd keep around you. Great environment.
good,"Outstanding stepping stone organization for entry-level work. They hire from within, too. I was a full time student for half of my time at Best Buy and they always did their best to take care of me."
good,"It was a great place to work.  My managers cared about me on a deep level, the benefits were phenomenal, and the pay was competitive for that field. Great place to work and gives great sales experience if you work hard and want to learn."

good,It’s was a welcoming environment of customers and a caring management team. Well rounded environment with co workers that push you to succeed. Management treats everyone as people allowing time for them to grow
good,"This was by far the best workplace experience I've had. Everyone was professional, respectful and made me feel very comfortable. I learned a lot about a high level of customer service which is still a very useful."

good,I enjoyed my time at Best Buy. I learned useful selling skills and knowledge in electronics. The pay was fair and the hours were good. It’s hard to move up to management unless you have a degree.
good,It was a good experience when it came to sales and such. I would recommend to students and people who are looking to step their feet into retail. Great environment.
good,Very fun place to work.  The compensation was very good.  My position was seasonal so i was not guaranteed a permanent position.  Most of the time they keep you on after the holidays but you may only get one shift a week or every other week until a position opens up.  If a position opens up then so do your opportunites.  The employees there were all friendly and easy to get along with.  At best buy there was always something to do to keep you busy.
good,"I've worked for Best Buy before in New York. Company is great. Employee experiences are based on individual store management styles. My most recent store, for the most part, was a great place to be in. There is a lot of sales metrics that need to be met, so that can be stressful for some."
good,"When i was first hired, I only applied for part-time positions but was only offered seasonal. I had jury duty my first week and was forgotten about for my training as an employee the next week. It took me 2 months to complete virtual training due to my days being either delayed or far spread, out where it took my colleagues 1 week to complete training. Mass hire and mass training. In the Thousand Oaks mass training assembly, they lacked sufficient seating and no lunch break was given and I passed out in front of about 50 people (meeting held multiple small rooms with 6-7 groups of 7-10 employees and no seating) and I completely embarrassed myself. Future out-of-city meetings should require lunch breaks and seating. Aside from those inconveniences, the communication between the managers is efficient as well as the systems they have in place to have each others back. Everything goes smooth."
good,"Great place for customer service and gaining knowledge in computers etc."
good,"If your a nerd or aspiring nerd or any other person for that matter, Best Buy is a great company to work for. If you are dedicated to doing your job, even if you mess up, management supports you and you will quickly make friends along the way."

Great benefits, flexible work time and ongoing training keeps you up to date. Overall great 5 year experience."
good,"Went from part time to full time going from sales to merchandising specialist. Later moved up to SWAT. Managers were great, employees were wonderful. Had fun while working. Can’t say that about a lot of jobs these days. Left for health issues, but would have gladly stayed."

good,"Best Buy is a great place to work for anyone looking to get a new start in electronics/technology. There are many opportunities to work different roles in the store; whether it be the sales floor, inventory, or merchandising. The managers are all helpful and welcoming, and everyone in the store is knowledgeable in their department.  They seem very driven to make not only the customers, but also their employees happy."
good,"My coworkers really became family and it was amazing team work, at the time Best Buy just wasn't right for me and I miss it dearly (would go back in a heartbeat). I highly recommend this job it was amazing and I enjoyed my team"
good,"I personally loved working for best buy. The hours were flexible, the team members were always friendly,the work was not stressful. The hardest part about the job was just dealing with different types of people and their different attitudes."
good,"I come in every morning around 6:30, go to my department and start working. I get on a stand pallet truck and do order pick. I pick 4 aisles from end to end. Stack as much as I can and drop it off on a conveyer belt."

good,I had no trouble the whole time i worked there. I was in the Geek Squad...It was always fun & lively there. The work was something I had previously done so it wasn't anything I couldn't handle. I would definitely work there again at the drop of a hat.
good,The co-workers were best in class and management was extremely helpful while I was there. I felt like I was part of a family. Anyone would be pleased to work with new technology and providing people with tech to help there daily lives.

good,"They have plenty of good employees to work with and I like getting to know them, and the customers are great too! If you're looking for a great atmosphere come here!"
good,Over all amazing place to work at the only reason I am considering leaving Best Buy is because I just moved and I need a job that is going to give me more hours and a hire pay.
good,"Enjoyable position that offered extensive training opportunities. Every day the challenges were different, making it hard to get bored. The most attractive benefit to working at Best Buy is the discounts offered to employees. It helps offset the entry-level pay. Fortunately, with performance and longevity, that pay can increase to a reasonable wage. Overall, Best Buy/Geek Squad is a solid place to work."
good,it’s a good company to work for. They have really good benefits. It’s fun to work there and it’s easy to move up within the company.  Flexibility in what store you work for to

good,"Excellent team work, best management, well organized and well paid company. I can never forget my experience working with Best Buy. During Christmas season a lot of extra shifts available. You will bring here working hard, punctuality and dedication. They will give you best environment, good pay and a lot of experience."
good,"Fast moving , very exciting and fun. Latest technology , forward thinking when comes to digital and they got a real good campus and gym."
good,The company really cares about the empoooyee experience and they truely want to be a great place to work. I would definitely recommend working for Best Buy at any location.
good,Great atmosphere. Management is always willing to help & always had your back when situations got tough. Days could be hectic but truly was not a super difficult job if you did your training and were on top of your daily and weekly requirements.
good,"Best Buy has changed a great deal over the past decade and become a leader in specialty retail.  They've bucked the ""Amazon Showroom"" moniker and have made great strides to become a company growing towards the future.  I enjoyed my time working there thoroughly."
good,"Great place to learn customer service and selling skills. Also a great place to interact with customers face to face. Listen to their needs and wants, then make  recommendations  ."
good,Best Buy was a good stepping stone to understand how to run a business from the fundamentals of training and structure for accountability all the way to profit and loss management but now I’m ready to advance my skills.
good,It is a retail environment and holidays can be hard but Best Buy has a very positive culture. great resources and benefits available to full and part time employees.
good,I worked in the warehouse as my first job after i graduated highschool and I loved it. The enviroment was amazing and there was alot of great support around to help me learn new skills and tasks
good,"Very good GM, and Ops manager. I learned how to manager multiple teams of associates and handle adversity in very busy location. Worked there until I finished college."
good,"Working for Best Buy is not as difficult as it seems. You meet your daily, weekly, and monthly goals. Even if you are customer service, you have Protection Plan goals to reach. As well as credit card applications when financing a product for a customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning the latest technology. Every time there is a new product out, employees would have to do on electronic training to gain product knowledge and confidently describe the products to customers when interested. Since the age group of the store I worked for were 20-50 year old's, work became interesting."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.

good,"Very Productive and fun working with the company and people."
good,"Really liked working there, I worked there just for the season, if given the option to stay there I would of chose to stay but it's like they just didn't want to hire anymore people. They told me they could hire me part time instead of seasonal depending on my performance, but that was a lie. Other than that I would recommend it, great experience."
good,Working at Best Buy has given me some of the most valuable experience I could have asked for. It has taught me how to work with technology as well as with people.
good,"If you enjoy technology, then best buy is right for you, if you enjoy working with people. Give it a shot. After working there, if it wasn't for the new management in Victor, NY. I would most likely still be working there."
good,I enjoyed my first retail experiences working at Best Buy.  I would recommend it to someone looking to hop into retail and learning how large chain corporations run.  The hardest part of the job was nightly inventory when things would get misplaced by staff or customers. The best part of the job was working with fun people that had similar interests to me.
good,"Great place to work, store leadership cares but there is a big disconnect between corporate teams and their stores.  When I first started there were plenty of advancement opportunities. Company went through a restructure and got rid of many leadership roles within my store."
good,Fun place to work at for a while although management team can sometimes be too strict unessecarily as well as be kinder to certain employees based on who they like more.
good,It was a fun entertaining and educational experience! I would definitely recommend you get in a competitive attitude because there are requirements that must be met but are lightly enforced. If you want to progress through the ranks you MUST show dedication good work ethic and good numbers!
good,"General Manager was very nice, they usually have food in the break room. I worked customer service/cashier and my job was fine, not too stressful. They don't tell people that the store is closed when we close, so people just wander aimlessly around and everybody has to wait for each customer to leave."
good,When I arrived I always had my invoice of appointments that I needed to complete that day. Almost always all of the parts or equipment necessary for the jobs arrived to the warehouse on time. Everything was efficient and smoothly operated. Other staff members were great working as a team to complete all tasks.
good,"Best Buy has taught me many valuable communication and sales skills."
good,I loved working at the store for the holidays as a seasonal worker in the warehouse. My management team was the absolute best with working with my other job I had as well.
good,Great managers and the culture is great. Fun people to work with go store 1066..l learned a lot s out the retail structure and how it works. Building lifetime relationships!
good,I have learned so much with Best Buy but the biggest takeaway is my newfound appreciation for every single person behind the job. They really make the difference
good,"It is fun to work at Best Buy if you like helping customers and retail.  I personally am not a fan of sales positions because that is exactly what the entire focus is on with good reason.  However, when there is slow customer traffic in the store, hours get cut which is unfortunate but that is just how retail goes.  Fun place to work."
good,"Great managers, great coworkers, great perks and benefits.  Set schedule, and they are somewhat flexible.  They have great performance based bonuses dependent on your department and store performance."
good,Many opportunities for career advancement the company really invest in their employees and promote within wanting ll employees to explore career advancement.

good,The job is great if you don't have a huge responsibility. I enjoyed working there while I was in school. The only problem I had was when I found out that I was making less than my Male 20 year younger counterparts.
good,Working at Best Buy gave me the leadership qualities that I needed to be successful. They continuously worked with me to ensure my growth in the company. It was always fun to test out new products and become knowledgeable about them. I would suggest this to anyone who wants to begin their career in sales because the opportunities are endless.
good,"Merch team is  morning shift. During nonholiday hours, we are at the store at around 6AM to 7AM. Ending hours vary on labor for that week. I know our full time individual doesn't leave until around 2 or 3pm. The rest of us are part time. We are a smaller store. Part time folks leave anytime between 12-2PM. "
good,"The area for employees was absolutely amazing and the training provided was pretty good, overall great and helpful staff. Although i didn't know about TVs, I was given the responsibility of working in the games section because it was my expertise, and i was able to help lots of customers because of my knowledge on games. overall 10/10 experience"
good,"Work atmosphere was relaxed but at the same time professional. Duties weren't difficult. Just consistent. Must be cordial even to people that don't deserve it. If a customer had an issue with you, management would step in and relieve you of the situation. Strict on punctuality. "
good,"They always challenge you to be your best and also have employee contests for different things. There is a lot of hours available for part-time employees, for example when I got a lot of hours I was close to 30 hours a week and there was no problem getting time off during the week as you can exchange shift very easily with other people in your department."
good,Everyday was a lesson learn and also Very fun and exciting to be with a company that taught you how to do you job. Best Buy is a company of growth and development.
good,"The most enjoyable part about the job was helping customer. just knowing I helped a bit counts to any customer. Trying is key. I enjoyed my peers and most of management, when you are somewhere for eight hours a day five days a week you become very close with others.

good,"Despite the store being often busy, the environment is very welcoming and there is always someone who is willing to help when in times of doubt. Very nice and approachable staff and I had an overall positive experience at the store. Only drawback were the many shifts and long hours of work but the pay made up for it."
good,"Best Buy is a showroom of all sorts of amazing technology, we all believe that we work in the ultimate toy store. While here I get to interact with customers and really show them how much they are capable of achieving with technology. Best Buy provides great tools and resources for the sales consultants as well as the customer."
good,Best Buy is one of the best places to work bar none. This company is more like being a part of  family versus a fortune 500 company which is amazing to me.
good,"Working Here is definitely not what it seems. People think it's easy but there is actually way more work then you expect it to be. Overall, you pick up super quick and it becomes extremely fast pace but it is a rewarding job."
good,"Very flexible job with a lot of good rewards involved. Not too much labor or mental stress put on oneself, and a very understanding management team. Would recommend."
good,This is a great company to work for. Great for students and those who wish to work part time.  The hours where quite flexible. It is a fun place to work at.  Management was great. Very open door policy.
good,A typical day at work would start off with a manager meeting to discuss corporate expectations and our goals. The managers would then break off into their respective departments and discuss sales goals with the sales team. I would then offer any counsel or advice to my staff as i supervised them on the floor. Whenever they made a sale i would finalize the transaction and document on our daily and monthly sales goals.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"its a great company for those starting out and are looking for a flexible job for school and other reasons, just not much chance of growth if you don't have the right connections"
good,"Working there was great, the company does a really good job at product training.  Each store is different but it was a good working environment. would recommend it"
good,"Typical day was about 8 hours long, sometimes normal or slow depending on the day. "
good,Best buy on cedar hill in Beaverton was a great place for work and career advancement. Working there was fun and the management was great. Employee discount on electronics is the best part.
good,Apply you wont regret working for best buy. I had an amazing time working at best buy. The employees were awesome  and management knew what they were doing. I was always treated fair and payed handsomely
good,"Best Buy hires quality employees, and this greatly contributes to the collaborative culture the environment fosters. Transferring to other stores due to relocation is easy and supported. The long holiday hours are grueling, and often the reason people leave the company, although I guaranteed the majority of them look back on their time at Best Buy fondly. In the working environment, expectations are made clear, there are never any setups for failure. Your managers care about you and your experience at work, and when there are discrepancies or disagreements, they are easily resolved because the management team is tight knit, and there is a lot of overlap in coverage/care. It may be challenging to be recognized/compensated accordingly, but the best way to combat this is to show your strengths, and ask for what you want. I recommend working for this company."
good,"The bestbuy culture is so diverse and so competitive, I've enjoyed that the most, the hunt and the winning desire that surrounds you is amazing!"
good,A typical work day consisted of cash managing in the morning to ensure all registers had the correct amount of money to start off the business day. When the store opened I would manage the front end of store for two hours. Within the two hours I would coach employees in transaction accoiuntability and help with any customer issues. In the afternoon I would contact candidates to interview and decide which candidates to move on to a second interview with a manager. Ive learned how to become a strong leader and face any challenge with a positive mindset. All leadership worked together and lived the Best Buy values which helped us drive results and provided a positive environment for employees. The hardest part of of my job was the lack of communication around important changes that would impact my daily responsibilities. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with diverse individuals and getting to know them.
good,This was a fun place to work. Management at my store is very concerned with their employees well being. If you work hard you get a good amount of hours.
good,"A typical day at work is very relaxing sitting by myself focusing on assisting customers over the phone. Sometimes there will be moments where customer service may need help so you will also need to assist them. You will deal with angry customers on the phone, during returns and exchanges, and with in store pick ups. Sometimes managers won't be available immediately so you will have to deescalate the situation without them. This job is very simple but there will be moments when people make mistakes that can intervene with your personal life."
good,"Loved every minute of it, great people, great job."
good,"The team i worked with at Best Buy made my job so much better. Everything ran smoothly and accordingly. Management team was fair and honest. Sure you get your bad days, but everyone does. Amazing experience!"
good,When i first got there I was excited to start working. They would train me and have me shadow other employees and make sure I learned quickly so they could put me out of the floor.
good,Had fun at BEST BUY . It got hectic at times but that’s what Retail is. Management & my Co-workers were team players so that helps more than anything .
good,i love working at best buy. my managers and supervisors are funny and understanding that i have  a life outside of work. i worked front lanes then they moved me to phone operator without asking because i speak spanish.
good,when i worked for best buy it was amazing they did everything that they could for me and more. They treat everyone that comes in as family and friends and they do not worry about taking their time with everyone to make sure that they leave with a smile
good,Best Buy was a great place to work. Management and supervisors were great. I loved learning to do new things and competing with my fellow employees. I was sad to hear of the possibility of it closing.
good,I’m lucky enough to work at a store with a great work environment and amazing management that make you feel comfortable and you really feel like you can count on the. For any issue. 10/10 recommend MY store.
good,"Fun place to work, everyone is really cool. Everyone is pretty laid back, yet respectful. They seem to hire a specific type of person. Someone who is always smiling."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"The atmosphere at Best Buy is team oriented. Everyone is working toward the same goals. Even though you maybe assigned a department to work, you basically work where you're needed. You're encouraged to learn about multiple products, not just your concentrated area. Management is always encouraging and willing to assist where needed."
good,This was a great place to work I really did love. great discounts amazing people and manager. lot of opportunity to learn every new positions. the only thing that I wish was that they paid more.
good,"Always learning something new. Realistic trainings offered. With any retail, the hardest part was dealing with crazy customers. Company offers amazing benefits and discounts for employees. Able to earn bonus checks based on sales. Company offers reward packages based on top performance as well."
good,"The work environment was very diverse, the employees and managers are very nice and are always willing to help out. There are educational net learings that are available for employees to better educate themselves and to keep them updated on what going on in the company. Managers would always make the day interesting by having daily contest for the staff, i really enjoyed that because it made the staff alot more modivated to get out there and engage every customer and sale sale sale."
good,"When I   started at the GeekSquad  it  was  the best job in the world. I felt my opinions were important. We had one of the best stores in the world #662. We won a lot of  contests,  once that happened people were promoted and they replacements  that were  brought  in  began to destroy the culture and  store numbers. That is why  I quit.  If I could go back in time and work at the  original  662 I  would.  The management at that time has been the  best management I've  ever worked  for  in my  life."
good,"Great job, Great people. "
good,"The place is awesome, especially if you are in to technology, even if you are not it is still pretty great since there is a place for pretty much everyone there from the quietest person to the most outgoing cheer-full kind, there is always a fit for everybody."
good,Gave my fellow department employees demonstrations and discussions on Samsung tech products and the advantages/pros to using these items. My peers took this information and had growth in their Samsung sales at Best Buy.
good,"Daily routine is pretty similar. Hit sales goals, hit app goals, sell protection plans. Pay is fair, job is easy most days. Holidays suck. Some customers are rude. But as are most in retail. Pretty easy job for the most part."
good,"management is fairly competent and easy to work with, hardest part is the customers who hate everyone. good location means lots of work to keep you occupied. staff are fun and friendly."
good,"I absolutely love this company. the general manager, all the managers for the matter, are amazing people! The co workers are also fun. It’s like a family environment. Some departments are way harder to work in than others, not every spot is made for anyone. It can be very challenging at times."
good,"A fun place to work if you enjoy helping people on a day-to-day basis. The culture of the company has good intentions but depending on store it may not be the same. Pay is relatively decent with decent opportunity to advance if you know the right people. but this may deter some due to the fact that you are unable to make commission at a Best buy store in any position. but if you hit your goals as a store or in your vendor specific position you are compensated handsomely for your efforts by means of bonuses. these bonuses consist of quarterly or monthly bonuses depending on position or company guidelines. It's a great place to work a lot of stores have great people in charge, with a killer discount on a lot of technology if that's your thing. but make sure you enjoy helping people and enjoy customer feedback to motivate you to do your job."
good,I enjoyed my job at best buy. I would return in a heartbeat. They really put time and effort into educating their employees on the products and services they sell.
good,"Decent job that has decent pay however it is a store to store bases. You really got to watch out what store you go to. Some stores are amazing and some are just a huge nightmare."
good,"Best Buy is a great place to get hands on in retail. As someone went to college for film, getting hands on with the tech that Best Buy had to offer and explain it to customers helped me in more ways than one. I would highly recommend this company to others."
good,"In the rough world of working retail, Best Buy shined through as a solid workplace in my life. Yes, the hours were terrible during the holidays but they make it abundantly clear that you will be working them when you are hired on. They are constantly trying to keep up with the other retail giants and sometimes fall short. All this being said, every store and management is different and I may have just got lucky with my experience. The work culture that forms around Best Buy employees is something special and I still instantly connect with others that have previously worked at a BB store."
good,I love learning about technology and bestbuy  Provided me with information and knowledge.  Best place to work at very fun interesting people come in employees are amazing and  Management is There to help if you ever need it
good,"Learned a lot of new things in the department I worked in. The coworkers I loved because they were very helpful and I was not scared to ask a question because they all are willing to help. Hardest part of the job was, just remembering all the new information that you had to tell customers. Management and the workplace felt like a family, they really cared for one another."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I have never worked for a company with as great of a culture as Best Buy has. Hands down, the people make the experience great! The work environment is very flexible and you dont feel micromanaged."
good,"Great place to work with caring people."
good,"I was very pleased to work for Best Buy. While I was employed, my grandmother passed away and they were very supportive and willing to work with my family's particular mourning rituals. They offered plenty of overtime and were always willing to train me for different roles within their warehouse, and encouraged me to apply directly with the company in an effort to keep me on. They were understanding, supportive, encouraging, and all together one of my favorite places to work"
good,"The team at Best Buy is the most out going. They make sure you’re comfortable in your environment, and they want you to learn more as you go. There’s so much room for improvement"
good,"Although the Pay was less than adequate, I had a ton of fun at Best Buy. The managers made work fun. My coworkers were also great! I also love helping customers through the knowledge of products you get it through its training."
good,"I worked as an Asset Protection Specialist which meant that I watched for people trying to steal things. When it was slow, it was incredibly boring but I loved being able to help customers find what they were looking for or at the very least help them find someone who could find it or find a solution elsewhere."
good,"I've been working for Best Buy for a little over 4 years and have to say it's been one of the best jobs I could have gotten immediately out of high school that paid well, offered plenty of opportunities for advancement, and allows me to work for a company that believes in people. The best part is knowing I could always go back if I ever left, anywhere in the country."
good,"Work hours were very reasonable and not too long.  Shift balancing was not always present and you may be stuck working 6-7 days in a row with 4 days off.  Pay was moderate, not as high as I would like (was appropriate for the hours though).  Work was generally pretty lax, but you need to be on the ball.  Management was okay.  Role advancement was not an option either due to skills or management (never clear on which).  1-1's every month for performance reviews and suggestions."
good,"Excellent experience, I recommend it, good environment, you can learn new stuff, If you are a part time is a little bit difficult to get a full time, you would have to be auto motivated."
good,"Best buy has a phenomenal culture, welcoming all different types of individuals to the company and appreciating and valuing all of their differences.  In regards to management Hubert, the CEO is phenomenal and taking us right where we need to go.  However individual managers can be hit or miss.  Some good and some bad depending on the circumstance.  Hardest part of the job is probably the constant redirection based on having to move with customer trends.  Most enjoyable really are the people and the culture."
good,"I absolutely love my job. The managers are fantastic and human. My only problem with working there is it being retail. The hours and pay a great compared to many other places, I would and have recommended Best Buy to friends and family."
good,"Best Buy as a company is a great place to work in terms of career as well as education. Between the eLearnings and the education assistance they offer, you will always learn something new, and something useful for life outside of retail."
good,South Florida has some of the BEST General Managers in the company. I was sad reading through the bad experiences that some employees have had at Best Buy. The company spends tons of  time and effort to give  their managers training on delivering a world class employee experience. I was lucky enough to be surrounded by inspiring leaders who truly cared about the employees that worked for them. We would have monthly 1:1s and daily check-ins to keep us updated on our progress. I loved that everything was focused around the customers and how to give them a full solution that met all their needs and not just selling what they asked for. I learned how to be a top performing manager through empowering the employees around me and I am so grateful for all the opportunities I had while working at Best Buy.
good,"It is the best place to get your electronics, getting to know customers and assisting them with their needs is the best part of my JOB. If you are young enthusiastic wanting to learn about technology and maybe grow within the company go for this job."
good,"I started at Best Buy as a seasonal hire, luckily they kept me on board after the holidays as a part timer.  Best Buy has many areas where you can focus your knowledge and share your expertise.  I have worked in a few of the departments including Magnolia Home Theater, Computer, MASS Appliances, and Customer Service.  Because of the constant motivation given by the mangers you will always strive for your best.  Best Buy will become a second family for you.  Teaching you valuable skills that will indefinitely help you in the future.  I will always recommend Best Buy for anyone at any age.  A normal day at work is always striving to human.  Meaning you can relate each product to every client, showing how something can improve their lives.  The job can be stressful at times but everyone their will always be willing to help you solve any issue no matter how small.  You learn independence fixing issues great and small with a breeze on your own.  To handle multiple complicated tasks without breaking a sweat.  The best thing about Best Buy is the friendships and memories.  Soon enough you will know everyone in the entire store and you will all be friends.  Everyone there is a family which I think every workplace should be."
good,"It was very fast paced. At least in the department I was placed in. It allowed you to make friends and connections, it was independent work but with others around you."

good,"I enjoyed my time at BBY.  I would absolutely consider returning under the right circumstances.  I was treated fairly.  I only left due to an amazing opportunity in a non-parallel modality, where compensation was exponentially higher."
good,room to grow and create strong bonds and relationships. Management will help you gain new skills if your interested in growth. Flexible with schedule and hours.
good,"Not a bad place to work, maybe even build a career there too. Just depends if you are into that type of work, the people are good too, very helpful. They support their employees in anyway possible, rather it being education or growing with the company."
good,One of the best jobs i ever had! always bought us snacks on saturday! I would love to go back but unfortunately they don't pay as much as id like for someone with 2 kids.
good,i loe working at bestbuy and i love my coworkers i just need more oppurtunity for advancement or fiscally wise. the hardest part of my job is being called racist for following company policy
good,"Best Buy was a great place to work. The management has helped me grow so far with my career, and helped mold me into the sales person I am. Very open and friendly work environment."

good,It was a great environment to get exposed to the retail field as well as gain a vast knowledge of many new and upcoming products. The team experience is great as well.
good,"I am currently a seasonal employee. From what I have seen Best Buy is a really nice company to work for. The pay is fair, the dress code is laid back, and the management is very nice and knowledgeable."
good,Fun environment where I am able to really be myself laugh and have fun while being the best. My media management is great and my corporate partners have been great and are informative. The culture a Best Buy is to grow in a ever changing world and they are doing so. Great company to be with!
good,"Exciting work environment if you love computers and sales. Never had a job that I liked better. People were amazing, made many connections, and it ended too soon"
good,Started off part time sales @ $9.00/hr and within 5 years became a Double Agent with Best Buy's Geek Squad making almost $20.00/hour installing home theater systems and setting up wireless internet solutions.
good,"If you're looking for a break in sales get started here, you will always make more than minimum wage and can move up although slowly.  they provide absolute great on the job training"
good,"Fun place to work, coworkers are smart and funny, management are understanding and professional. Environment is fun and enjoyable. they offer paid time off great benefits and amazing discounts."
good,I really enjoyed working for Best Buy it was a great culture. fun learning the electronics and i enjoy customer service so it was good medium for me at this company
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy is a fast paced, fun atmosphere. I have enjoyed my time with them thus far. Management is great, there are always opportunities to learn new things and they live by the motto ""have fun while being the best""."
good,"I worked at the Best Buy in downtown Chicago, and the managers were super cool with me from the start. They offered great discounts. The position I was in was very competitive, and since it was temporary, I wasn’t hoping for any advancements any time soon."
good,Most people at BBY are collaborative and results oriented. The CEO is extremely motivating and inspiring and you want to do your best. I really enjoy the culture.
good,"I always enjoy coming into work to help clients find what will enhance their lives. Management cares about the employees, and helps guide them to their next career step."
good,best buy was great i didn't want to do this dang review but here i am indeed nice one. id recommend working there to anyone who truly has passion for technology. id go back if it didnt take so long to move up within.
good,Best Buy is a great company to work for and hard work pays off. There is no shortage of recognition for a job well done. Everyone who works there is great and some are like family.
good,It is a relaxed environment with face changing technology. I work on inventory so I mostly deal with the truck coming in and out. The enjoyable part is the team and management.
good,"A typical day at work is the same at any retailer, except the company culture at Best Buy I believe is better then any other retailer.  The leadership taught us what they knew and what they did not know we learned through learning modules."
good,"Best Buy is solely responsible for helping me grow my career into what it is today. The company gave me the tools, resources and opportunities that helped me become an expert-level application architect for them."
good,Worked there for a summer and the job was straight forward. The training showed exactly what you had to do and leadership was great and was very approachable
good,"Great place to work, just wish they had more options for time off. If you love technology, and have a willing for sales then the mobile is great for people you."
good,"Good management, flexible hours, organized company. I learned about time management and staying calm during high intensity hours of the day. The most enjoyable part of the day was satisfying a costumer."
good,"As long as you got your work done you did not have any problems with management. There were some slow times during which we might not have gotten our 40 hours a week, however management always tried to make sure we had work to do during the slower times."
good,"I worked part-time as a Merchandiser/Inventory Specialist and received at max 30 hours a week unless it was the holidays, at which I sometimes got 40. The work/life balance and flexible scheduling was great. The cost of living for the Brooklyn store was bad, however the College Station store was livable. It's pretty hard to secure a full-time position in the operations department because there are usually lifers there. Coworkers are very friendly as well as the managers/supervisors. I would highly recommend this job to anyone as long as your willing to work and keep a smile on your face."
good,when we are working geek squad we always working as a team. Because team working is most important . we respect each other and we have an good relationship with our customer .
good,"Great company, friendly management, excellent benefits. This is a fine job for someone in their early 20s starting out in their first real job, it does have room for advancement if you are willing to switch stores and start working definitely more than 40 hours per week.  Its good if you are a retiree also looking to keep busy part time. However, if you are single and trying to live on your own, the salary does not meet expectations at all. Other companies will pay well, but then work you until you drop dead, Best Buy does not do that to you, so the trade off is the salary.  I have worked in other companies as much as 96 hours in 1 week with no benefit at all except I was downsized despite being on salary, I am over 50 years old and will not do that again.  Best Buy does not seem to do that, unless you are moving up and into your own store soon. This culture may change though as sales and economies change with it. The going is good now, but during the Obama years, this company purged management multiple times over, so it remains to be seen what will happen next.  But if you are starting out or finishing your work life, consider Best Buy, its definitely a good spot for those in this position in life!"
good,"Overall my experience at Best Buy was positive."
good,"I like helping customers, but I do not likeupselling, that is why I am in asset protection.  Best Buy has a good culture and the managers I have worked with have been quite steller"
good,"Had an amazing time moving up from the sales floor to Geek Squad. Once I was in, I felt appreciated and got along with everyone right away. The work there was also fun, being able to sit with clients and teach them about their new technology."
good,I had a great time for my first job. We always got the job done and still had a good day that didn't feel like work. I never felt like I couldn't go to work because it was a painful job I loved going.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.

good,Great place to work with employees.  Management was amazing and provided opportunities to learn new areas of the store and to learn about new technology.
good,"everyone has worked with others well mainly in your own lane, peak season dose get crazy hours go up its hard work, but worth the time and effort, teams are well communications build up over time."
good,"Fast paced day, appliance installations, great workplace culture. The hardest part of the job is moving the deliveries around but it isnt't really that difficult to do. Culture is family oriented, and most enjoyable part of the job is that the days really fly by."
good,I would recommend Best Buy to anyone who wants to learn a sales job and advance into management. They offer a great training program for people without any leadership experience
good,Good hours and nice place to work. Customers can be interesting at times. Overall quality work environment and can`t really complain about anything particular. Enjoyed working here.
good,The company is one of the best for first time job opportunities. The working environment is welcoming and friendly. The pay is fair starting out with room to advance.
good,"Great work place to be, working in sales (Home Theatre) main job was selling TVS. Learned more about TVS then ill ever need to know, as well as learning about everything else in the store. Management at best buy is Amazing. Nothing really boring about the job unless there is no customers. Most enjoyable part is walking around and talking to customers about todays technology."
good,"Best Buy taught me to run a multi faceted business with incredible business acumen.  There is always assistance when needed and was given amazing recognition,"

good,"Great place to work.  Very strong vision and mission.  Cares about its employees.  Many employee resource groups, leaders that take accountability and want to do the right thing for the company.  Great brand.  Proud to be employed at BBY!"
good,I have worked at Best Buy two different times. I have left to pursue different ventures. On both occasions I had the support of my fellow staff of Best Buy Supporting me. Not all stores are created equally but some are fantastic.
good,"The work environment is great! The people I work with are fun and are excellent team players. When you needed a day or a couple of days off management would always be willing to give you the days needed as long (of course) if you give them two weeks in advance. I got a raise not even within a year working there and there are raises each year. The only downfall are the hours. There are not enough. The hardest part of the job is the communication between management and employees. I would always be the last to hear important changes to the company and important  information in general. Management could be a bit intense but I always had a great relationship with them. There are times, especially during the holidays, when they ask you to do impossible tasks and not give you a enough time to do them. All in all its a great place to start or work at if you're going to school since they are flexible with the hours. And it's like a family environment; always welcoming."
good,I’d like to stay with Best Buy whenever I go to relocate. It won’t be until the spring time next year that I move but it’ll be sad to move from the people I work with now.
good,I really enjoyed working at Best Buy in Burlington.  Coworkers were always willing to help when asked.  Very pleasant atmosphere to work. Benefits  were available and training for my department was excellent.
good,"I like working with Best Buy. I love technology, so working for Best Buy was a no brainer. The management is built on great leadership and the job culture makes it easy and fun to be an employee."

good,"Awesome place if u can sell"
good,Nice living room set of town you stay and are you from the slavemasters and footboard no frame 6th and footboard no frame 6th and footboard no problem hey do you have planned for tonight everything else in a lot of the struggle to survive is the dresser still want me to see
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work. I started as a part time cashier and in less than three month was promoted to full time customer service specialist. The leaders in the store really did lead by example. They ensured all employees were comfortable in their current positions, if they wernt then they made sure they were able to match a job to the employee."
good,"Good place to work. Good management, other employees were awesome. Decent discounts on product. And the ability to move up if you want into the company."
good,Would come in greeted by all my co workers with a friendly smile. We would all have the same goal which was to help customers with their purchases which helped keep work professional. Learned valuable sales knowledge and information on computers and tablets.
good,"I loved my job at best buy. It can be stressful at times, but will miss the culture. Management was great, and my co workers were awesome. It is a great team."
good,"Mainly worked register, but customer service center was the most interesting area to work in. Call center can be stressful and long hours on the register can be boring"
good,"Pacific sales was the start to helping me be shaped into a manager. This job role taught me how to be more individualized, more prone to solving problems alone and with the minimum resources i had available. It was a minimal physical labor job, but more of a mental job that required a lot of patience and mind power"
good,"Great culture can stand behind the values and the services, but occasionally there are those managers that maybe should not be in leadership roles. I had more good experiences than bad ones."
good,"cuentan con un ambiente laboral bastante agradable, cuentas con muchos beneficios como empleado fijo de la compañía."
good,Best Buy is a good place to work due to the high standards of management as well as the different types of people you get to meet as well as work with.
good,"This job gave me a new look on electronic support. These people are not on commission so they genuinely care about the customers and clients. This is not an easy job, as customer relations can be difficult. However, I would definitely return here if given the opportunity. The managers take the time to ask you how you're doing and take the time to get to know you."
good,Great place to work. Very challenging. Sometimes stressful. Love working during peak season. Great HR DEPT. Cross training is allowed & encouraged. Great Benefits. Believes in teamwork. Given the ability & knowledge on how to be productive & take initiative
good,Had fun interacting with customers and employees.  Really enjoyed watching at Geek Squad how the agents were able to troubleshoot and teach customers about their products!
good,"During my time at Best Buy as a merchandising specialist, I have had the privilege of working with great co workers, supervisors, and managers. The work environment is very friendly and I do not believe I have ever had any issues with the company or it's employees."
good,"Best Buy has been my favorite occupation so far out of all of my previous occupations. The environment is relaxed and very enjoyable. The management team is very reliable and caring, they also look for the best in their employees."
good,"A typical day would begin with checking over the inventory in the store. Make sure all the client PC that are ready for pickup have all their accessories and see who still owes a balance. Your day will be filled with checking in/out clients. Typically for check in you will try to look at the problem the person has and diagnose the best solution for them. Typically some of these problems are minor and can be fixed on the spot. The others you'll need to check in (anything that can't be fixed within 5 minutes). Additionally, you can help fix/repair some computers IF you have the knowledge AND you ARA/Manager approves the action. This is a fast pace job and would need to learn the system very quickly. However, once you get all the systems down, it's relatively easy. Just expect angry customers here and there."
good,They treated you like a family they were very customer focused it was nice to see I enjoyed the employees just as much as I enjoyed the customers they came in for a reason a purpose to get all the knowledge they need on a product and we were provided with training on most product and if we had little knowledge on that product we would look it up at work and product test stuff and share our info with the other associates
good,"A work environment were team work was actually followed without management asking. Customer were understanding, I like the price match because customer's would leave happy with a product."
good,"A work environment were team work was actually followed without management asking. Customer were understanding, I like the price match because customer's would leave happy with a product."
good,I started here during school and loved the culture and the responsibilities of my job. The job fit my needs perfectly while working part-time during school. Best Buy provides a lot of training and tools to build employees up and further their career goals.
good,Great Learning opportunities through their e-learnings and trainings. Management is pretty supportive and works with you. The thing that I enjoy most is helping the customers find solutions that help address any pain points they may have not even realized that they have.
good,"I am only part-time, so the only benefit I receive is the discounts. I know the benefits for full-timers are really good. The discounts are really good on most items. There are a few big ticket items with no discount. Work and management is easy-going if you are a hard worker and put in the time and effort."
good,"The job itself wasn't that bad. The work was easy to learn and perform, the employees were great, the managers were fun and supportive. But the customers are what gave the headaches."
good,I have worked in a administrative capacity for Best Buy for 10+ years and have always enjoyed the challenge the company offers.  Unfortunately there are limited advancement opportunities for the administrative roles outside of the corporate office located in Minnesota.
good,"Communicated effectively to customer explaining the issue while repairing the customer’s electronic device."
good,Selling appliances for be see t buy was an amazing experience but I need strictly part time. Working for a boss who truely cared about his employees was also amazing.
good,Awesome benefits and bonus structure! ..........Lots of room for growth and advancement!!............Tons of training and development!!!  Great company values!!!
good,Working at best buy I was given multiple chances to advance myself within the company. Management paid attention to employees goals and acknowledged work ethic.
good,I started out at Best Buy as a assest protection making sure no one stole anything from the store and after seven month I was moved to sale working at the front lanes.
good,"It's a great company, I used to love it, great ;pay and benefits. However,  the last time I worked there I worked at a different location than I did before that store was horrible, management was terrible and was the reason I left, i would consider going back but never to that store."
good,Working at Best Buy has been a great experience to grow and learn as a person. But its really about the people you work with not the job that makes the job or work place a good environment or a poor one.
good,"Aprendí a trabajar con todo tipo de personas sin discriminar raza, creencias etc."
good,"Best Buy is a great company to work for if you enjoy technology and love being around it a lot.  There is always something new to learn and BBY is keen on keeping their employees up to date on training on the latest technologies that hit the market.  I had a great experience with all of the management team as they all seemed to really care about taking care of the customer and treating the employees with respect. Compensation will not blow you away especially at entry level positions.  Even if you are the greatest salesperson on the floor, your bonuses are still dependent upon the overall performance of the entire store month by month.  This means that you can do awesome individually, but if your store didn't perform and hit all the necessary metrics, there is no extra money on your paycheck to reflect your sales efforts.  The Job Work/Life balance is going to be at least a little off at any retail job that is open 7 days a week, and holidays can be especially rough during the black friday and xmas shopping events of course.  Besides that, great culture and lots of fun to be had working for a well established company."
good,"As a sales consultant I am required to help the costumer with their every need and make them feel as comfortable as possible and make them feel welcomed to Best Buy. "

good,"Loved the company , fun , competitive , family oriented , great growth and development . Pay structure is great , work life balance . Management is good as well"
good,I learned how to answer random detail questions. I earned how to work with difficult people and difficult co-workers. Being Blaimed by my superviser for co- woker miskates that affected my job.
good,"Everyday is high passed working day, learning new products to help us give our customers a better experience while shopping with us."
good,Love best buy's upper management and the mobile phone department. Working weekends and holidays is hard on an employee that has kids so maybe rotating that a little better so it's not every weekend or holiday would be better.
good,"Loved my position leading a large team that were focused on the client experience.  Although we worked many hours and some long days the team worked together and supported each other."
good,"Everybody at Best Buy had a great attitude toward their job, no one would ever look upset to work. I learned better customer service than in my previous jobs. The management was fair, there were no favorites in my opinion and all managers were friendly towards their fellow employers. The workplace culture was all electronics from laptops/desktops to refrigerators to games to basically everything electrical. Fortunately I didn't find anything to struggle me in the work area, I would always get my job done correctly with a smile, I loved going to work. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to my friends on my free time and meeting new people."
good,"Company did a great job training and investing in their people."
good,"when I use to work at best buy, I remember it being so team oriented, well structured with meetings and managers did a great job on informing co- workers vital information when needed. benefits were great"

All of my co-workers are very well rounded and accepting to new-comers as well as veterans to the store. When I first started I was given adequate time to learn the store as well as their processes in the workplace, I never felt rushed in any scenario in which i had to learn a new skill. Management is extremely understanding towards personal life as well as in the workplace. Overall my current employer has been one of the greatest experiences in a workplace."
good,"fun and friendly environment, busy atmosphere, good compensation with good benefits. Work life balance could be better but it is retail. Sales objectives are a requirement."
good,"For me, it was a decent job at the time. Good pay, clean work. You have to really stand out, or else they will lay you off. I gave it my all at bestbuy"
good,"It was an overall good experience working there, with many benefits where the managers are competent and try to adhere to not only the customers but employees also."
good,Best Buy is a fast paced retail workplace with good structure. Employees are able to interact with customers to find a ultimate solution for that customer in a wide range of fields.
good,Best Buy is a great place to work.  A typical day is spent performing stocking and price change duties as well as making sure that all displays are functional.  The management is fun and easy to work with.  The workplace culture is fast-paced and encourages teamwork.
good,"Best Buy gives you all the tools to succeed. It is a very fun environment that is relaxed when it can be, but also can be fairly fast paced. Managers are very helpful and stick up for the employees. Best Buy offers many options to change jobs and move up to where an employee would want to be."
good,"Only part time was a great work environment. Manager was friendly and it was great to work there at the time,It was one of my firsr jobs so I realy enjoyed working there"
good,"my typical days were usually pretty easy. just help the customer find what they're looking for and make sure it was a good shopping experience. i would also stock shelves, help load or unload the merch truck, run OMS(pick up and deliveries that were ordered online). i learned a lot about making sure that every shopper that came in had a good time and were helped as best of my ability. the feeling of working there was over-all pretty good. i never felt objectified because of my disabilities at all.the hardest part of the job would probably have to be on black friday mainly because there was a lot of customers and my anxiety took over. i got better with it over time though. the most enjoyable part was everyday i had a fellow employee to talk to and/or joke around with and it made the work experience that much better"
good,"My experience at Best Buy was great, everyone was friendly, helpful, and welcoming. Once I learned the basics of working as a sales associate I Immediately excelled and began to help out others who I believed were not as proficient."
good,"Worked as a seasonal employee over the holidays, although I wish I had more hours the time went by well. Although they are not consistent with the schedule, hours were alright."
good,"A normal day is pretty smooth back in the warehouse. There's a truck normally once or twice a week to restock the store. Picks and online orders, wrapping and boxing products for shipment, Helping with customers load TVs into their vehicles...piece of cake!"
good,Company provides e-learning ongoing to support employee knowledge of products and service. Manager team is friendly and directs work great. Co-worker are nice and helpful. Love the teamwork.
good,One can learn a lot working here. You can gain everything from sales experience to learning about tech. For a student I would recommend BB as a place to work.
good,Great company to work for. Embraces the culture of having fun while being the best. Competitive. I have yet to work for a company that embraces investing in training for it's employees as them.
good,"If you love tech and the latest gadgets and services all under one roof, look no further than BestBuy! Their employee discount is outstanding and their train is one of the best in the business."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Fun place to work. Felxable with school hours. Enjoyed my coworkers. Was able to move around to different departments. Learned a lot about technology and appliances
good,I have just started for the seasonal position at best buy and everyone within the job was already friendly and nice. Within the job it is also wonderful where I can give the customers advice and them actually listening to my advice makes me feel like I am actually doing something right.
good,Highly concentrated on customer and employee engagement through several store meetings and parties. Fun environment to be comfortable in to perform quality customer service.
good,"It was super fun, running around and helping as many people as you can. It's very rewarding if you have a good manager. I really enjoyed my time there, and I would go back if I could afford it."
good,I would say overall this was the best company i have worked for so far. The only reason i had to leave was because the store ended up closing down. The had a great training programs available for people who wanted to move up within the company.
good,"When I worked there it was a great place to work. The general manager was one of the best managers I ever worked for. The assistant manager and supervisors are great! They coach you and train you well! They don’t jump down your throat if you mess up, they are very positive, they praise you when you accomplish great things, advancement is good, the pay at the time was above what most places were offering with it being a college town and most places only paying minimum wage."
good,"I have been with Best Buy for more than 2 years now and I absolutely love it. The ambiance, work environment, employee-manager relationship and work load makes it a perfect workplace for any teenager. I started working at best buy as a Seasonal Inventory Specialist. I worked in the operations department for a year and then moved on to the sales floor as a part time Computing Expert and soon got a full-time spot. Growth opportunities are always there. One can always switch from one department to another as there are many different roles within departments. And Geek Squad is another step-up option. The best thing in my job is the employee-manager relationship. I have worked with two different General Managers and 3 different Sales Managers and literally all of them were very professional, educated and ethical. Not a single manager left Best Buy but they all got promoted to different spots. As long as you are delivering your best, always willing to learn about new stuff, obey the rules and policies and respect everyone while being the best, you would simply love working at best buy."
good,"Awesome place to work if you’re trying to get a fresh start or even transitioning from the corporate stressful environment. This place allows you to be yourself, you meet awesome and unique people, empathetic management."
good,Best Buy has a great customer base and great work environment. All workers are friendly and wiling to help you develop your skills as an employee. However after you have been there for awhile advancement really comes to a stop. There was a lot of jealousy among managers and for the most part everyone was out to take everyone else's job or to stop them from moving up to save their own job. Overall the job itself is paid well depending on your position you are paid accordingly as I made $14 an hour to be a team leader. However be careful who you trust in the company or who you think is trying to help you once you start your journey up the ladder
good,"At geek squad, there hasn't been a day yet that i haven't learned anything new. Everyday there is a new challenge and when you fix that challenge you learn something new. And then you teach you coworkers. Management of this place is decent. Hardest part would be not wanting to learn. Learning new stuff and being an apple master for geek squad would be the most enjoyable part of this job."
good,"If you understand communication as a whole, and were able to implement this to your management, they would do what they could to help grow you in the company.  I believe they are constantly changing to keep with the industry and doing what they need to for there costumer and employee"
good,absolutely loved working at best buy in lloydminster very loving and caring staff and managers they all love to help anyone who walks in they always make the morning and evening staff meetings superbly fun and interesting
good,Learned alot about retail working at best buy I had a great time working with the stock team there I am glad for the work ethic I learned there I would go back there any time
good,"Working at this place was like working with family. they set goals that were reachable and then set them a hint higher, if you had problems supervisors and management would help work with you to improve and even when family issues arose management was very supportive and helped you through it. The training for the job you get hired for is really easy and they have e-learnings to help you improve your skills in multiple areas. This was by far my favorite job ever."
good,enjoyable place to be; you're welcome to come here and stay and it is one of the best places to work for if you intend on being comfortable and you want to be okay and not take risk!
good,Best Buy is the place to be. You learn so many things and interact and meet some amazing people along the way. They help you grow as an employee and person.
good,"Working at Best Buy was really fun. It was probably the best retail job I've held in my lifetime. Working there had it's ups and downs, but my fellow coworkers were helpful at times, and the management cared about your performance. They would usually have you practice and try to apply what you've learned. They did weekly check-ins to ensure that the learning curve was there."
good,"Great place to work for anyone looking to get into entry level sales or some sort of technology related field. Plenty of opportunities to learn strong sales techniques that can be beneficial outside the world of retail. Knowledge in the products can also be beneficial outside of sales. Great work environment, great management and staff. Holidays can be stressful as expected but again having a good team to work with will definitely help the experience."
good,great opportunities to move around and learn.  has great programs for leaders.  great pay and great atmosphere. incentives like bouncing and discounts are good as well.
good,Fun place welcomes everyone in as a family. Fairly management. Working hours are flexible for each employee. Love to enjoy their time. Bigger opportunitys.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I loved working at Best Buy more than any job ever. They had a very welcoming crew and being on the floor always gave me a great feeling with being face to face with customers.
good,"I run the Customer Service Department. I have to try and learn the entire store, so there is always something new everyday. There is always a different issue and customers are looking for something different everyday. Customers amaze me at times because of all the stories I hear. Some are sad and some are amazing. There is a variety of different cultures. The hardest part of my job is telling the customer no. My job requires me to go out and beyond to satisfy the customer. Since the customer service department is right next to Geeksquad. I am able to learn more about computers and how they work and function. I also get to get updates on new viruses that come out. Best Buy is an amazing place to work for. It definitely helped me grow and become a better person. "
good,"Team work and customer service were very important at Best Buy. Every morning there were morning meetings where managers would tell us our sales number and how well we were doing. Employees are rewarded for their hard work either by preferred shifts, bonuses, and promotions. Educational classes are offered if an employee wants to transfer to a different department such as computers or audio. This education helped provided more knowledgable customer service. You need to have a outgoing positive attitude to do this job because it is sales. Best Buy also offered competitive pay."
good,This is very busy fast pace job with uneven schedules ranging from 4-8 hours on a typical day with short breaks and lunches. It was a nice environment and the day went by fast when there is a lot of work and the supervisors are easy going and are very motivational and helpful when you are in need.
good,"I was on Best Buy's Geek Squad and it was a lot of fun to work there. Each day was something different, which was a welcomed surprise each day. It was an awesome feeling to help people install items they really wanted."
good,"Definitely a great place to work. Had a lot of fun working with customers and fellow associates. Almost every manager I worked with at Best Buy was great. The only ""hard"" part for most was selling the Best Buy card."
good,"Learning a lot additional skills - Microsoft, spreadsheet newest technology keep me  up to date with  new electronics. Learning to work in big corporation understanding process and environment of multiculturalism, respect others gives me lots of personal satisfaction."
good,"Fun culture and exciting advancements to stay relevant as a big box retailer certainly makes Best Buy a promising place to work.  Only real drawback is at the associate level the pay tiers are on the low side.  That isn't to say that the compensation package is lacking, however, as the healthcare, employee discount, and other benefits certainly round out a comprehensive benefits package."
good,I've learned so much about technology and customer service skills wile working at best buy in laurel and I highly recommend anyone looking for entry level positions to apply at best buy if they are looking for employment.
good,"Awesome company to work for, have fun while your work and Learn while you at it. It has a great work environment and great group of people to work with and absolutely like the management"
good,"I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to worked for such an amazing company for the past decade. "
good,"Am amazing place to work, "
good,"Before store hours I set ads and made sure ""signage"" was up-to-date for every week, during store hours I was either taking inventory, down stocking or putting out breakage tags for damaged merchandise. After hours I was setting planograms, our store was going through a floor change. After I became pregnant I was assigned strictly to inventory, searching the floor for anything that needed to be restocked."
good,"A positive and energetic environment with a team of enthusiastic employees, as well as managers. The Managers are friendly, easily approachable, and understanding. I have worked at Best Buy for over a year now and have been able to establish trust between myself and management. I have learned valuable skills that transcend being an asset protection specialist, or an automotive technician. I am grateful for the opportunity to work at Best Buy and be surrounded by such a caring and supportive group of co-workers."
good,"During my time with Best Buy, I received all of my training on how to troubleshoot phones. I worked at a desk with customers and discussed their current phone plans. We built sales off upgrading contracts and selling the best and latest technology. There are insurance plans based off these sales and this conducted monthly payment plans. On the downtime, I would walk the sales floor and seek out potential customer purchases."
good,My job experience here was great the management was overall great. The team was great you learn so much and also meet great people. Its fast pace and everyday theres something new.
good,"The leadership at bestbuy is always supportive. Room to grow is plenty in sales, other department not so much. Pay is relatively low, but same goes to most retail, however the intrinsic rewards such as job autonomy and generally a fun place to work helps."
good,"Best buy is a great company, has great people, and decent benefits. The management works with you to develop the skills you need. There is just never any opportunities to advance."
good,"greet customers with a smile, take orders of thing's their merchandise cashier and cleaning, inventory. answering the phones. places orders over the phone"

good,"Constant learning environment, there is always something to do and learn when becoming a Best Buy employee. I would say that i am a prime example of all the different opportunities found within Best Buy as I have transferred into mostly all of the available departments such as customer service, geek squad, mobile and currently now in the warehouse. "
good,It was a good place to work for i learned more about electronics and other things got along well with others and management was decent  it could get crazy in there somewhere days but everybody made it thru
good,"Great place to work for employees and to shop for customers. Having Fun While Being the Best"
good,"My typical work was dealing with many different type of customers. The management was fantastic, they always supported me and gave me the opportunities to succeed. The heard part of the job was dealing with customers who had no intention of coming to a resolution on an issue."
good,I loved working at the geeksquad in watertown NY but not all geek squads are the same the one in new York really embraced the geek squad culture and made you feel like part of a team
good,A day at work would consist of arriving and helping set up equipment or shutting down equipment depending what shift you worked that day. Assisting customers find items or just answering any questions they might have was a part of the daily routine as well. The managers were very helpful and always available if you needed anything. The workplace could be slow or fast paced depending on the day. The hardest part of the job was staying on your feet at all times while working. The most enjoyable part of the job was becoming part of the team that worked that location and getting to know one another.
good,"best buy es una empresa que tiene los valores muy arraigados, es una empresa excelente si eres un estudiante joven con valores como respeto, igualdad, humildad entre otros"

good,If anyone asked for a reccomondation I would highly recommend Best Buy. It is a friendly environment and the higher ups are very helpful and caring about the place you work in.
good,Good place for college students and great discounts. Holidays run quick and now you will get trained properly. Knowledge basis isn't enough to get a raise and you must kiss butt or be in with someone to make more money. Good people get paid but sometimes not equally of new people with experience.
good,"I was only with this company for the holiday season, but I did enjoy working for them & would have accepted a permanent position if it was offered. I worked at the customer service desk handling returns & answering the phone. When needed I would be a cashier."

good,"Amazing environment, great culture with lots of opportunities to grow personally and professionally. Leadership is open and engaged to make organization and team succeed"
good,"Keeping in mind that BestBuy (and by extension, Geek Squad) is a business that's meant to remain profitable, the Lynchburg location store #0444 offers a diverse, understanding, hospitable work environment. The current management team embodies what it means to lead from the front rather than boss from the back and makes every effort to train and educate its employees with the job and product knowledge that sets them apart from similar big box office/electronics stores."

good,El trabajo en equipo en la empresa es indispensable y el equipo es elegido de la mejor manera para trabnajar en piso de venta.
good,"I learned a great deal about electronics and computer software, in a short amount of time, from co-workers who would take the time to explain product information with me. The P.O.S. system is advanced and has multi-functional usages; from processing of transactions to price check. It can be a hectic and sometimes stressful during the holidays, however, the customers were absolutely fantastic and understanding for the most part.  Floor/sales associates, when not with customers, would help out on registers as needed. Best Buy employees have vast knowledge of store merchandise and policy/procedures, which ensures customer satisfaction. I would loved to have been a permanent hire and will re-apply when there is an opening available."
good,great place to work everyday learned lots every day l went to work great part of the day was meeting new people overall fun place to work
good,"I've been here for a short time and already really love the company. The management is amazing. Everyone is friendly, and full of energy. I hope go stay with this company for a long time."
good,Warehouse can be crazy if it is just one person per shift but it is usually chill and just have to keep an ear out for TV picks.
good,"job is very relaxed compared to fast food. first job I have had where I was not running around like a chicken with my head cut off doing my job and a lot of times other peoples jobs. very great team resources for learning the job. everyone is equipped with walkie talkies so you can easily ask anyone you work with about something you need help with. or to request warehouse to obtain a product you need for a customer. feels very good when you make a customer happy with a purchase by equipping them with the knowledge to make the purchase. the co-workers are very easy to get along with and all due there own part has a team considering each employee's sales are tracked individually which I believe is what motivates them to do there job's lol. the supervisor said I have good work ethics which is nice to hear considering most jobs I have worked at seem to only pay more attention to the people who aren't doing there jobs. the hardest part of this job is not knowing where things are when a customer ask you and you feel really stupid for not knowing where it is because the store is huge and your new so you don't know where everything is lol. a typical day at work involves talkin to csutomers about apple and windows pc's to try to make a sell, downstocking laptops and other products. and checking out customers who I informed about the product. the most enjoyable part of the job is talking to customers about the things I know best. :)"

good,"Great working atmosphere. Flexible schedule and decent pay. Employee discount is good, but it could be more interesting on certain items. Great people."
good,Learned a lot of sales techniques and had fun getting to know people. You learn a lot about how to handle certain situations if the customer is distraught. Everyone worked as a team rather than on their own.
good,Comapny is great to work for ceo has a strong vision only issue in my  long tener has been the work life balance and the fact its impossible to have a family while working there

good,Not only did I like my job – I loved my job – and I loved working with all of the people there who made such a huge commitment to our work. When I first started working here I was totally amazed by the programs and how the QA teams worked with the contractors. I came in with lots of hands on skill and they allowed me the freedom to work. IT BLEW ME AWAY!!
good,"A typical day for me is doing my job, going over and beyond to make sure the customers are satisfied. I have learned how to use resources for things I don't know. My management make sure the customers are taking care of as well as their employees. I get along with all of my employees. The hardest part of the job is when people make it hard on themselves. The most enjoyable part about the job is making people happy, doing my job, and helping people."

good,"The best part about this job was knowing that whatever the customer left with was the complete solution.  I never sent a customer away with something I would not have bought myself.  And that's the great thing about working at Best Buy; we're here to help you help yourself.  Because most of the times people would walk in to the store looking for one thing, not really knowing what they needed."
good,"I further enhanced my experience as well as my knowledge in computer technology and accessories. Management was friendly, going the extra mile to ensure employees were always happy and had everything they needed to succeed in sales. I enjoyed every day i went in to work, lucky that every employee was real friendly and easy to talk to. everyone in their department had a well rounded knowledge of their products and if they didn't everyone always asked and tried hard to further enhance their skill."
good,"This is a sale oriented job that doesn't have the stresses of a commission based job. Management is very encouraging and they lead by example. The job calls for daily reviews on individual performance, so workers know where improvement is needed. The best part of working for Best Buy was the sales experience. Anyone that works for the company will learn how to sell a product from top to button. You gain understanding on how to properly communicate and build relationships with your customers, to point that they not only leave the store happy, they will fully understand and enjoy the product that your sold them."

good,I cant speak for other locations but i love working at this one. The atmosphere with my coworkers and management is so nice and comfortable. Management is very approachable and helpful in anyway. The pay is alright for retail. The only downside is working part-time and sometimes not having many hours.

good,i enjoyed work with customers and help them  on their purchasing and management very friendly. i was so happy during my period of work .
good,"There was always something to improve my knowledge on and/or something new to educate and train myself."
good,"Best Buy is an incredibly enjoyable company to work for, especially with the right team. If you have an interest in electronics, video games, movies, or anything along those lines, Best Buy is right up your alley. "
good,"I love this job, I worked at Walmart before and funny enough I worked in the electronics department. Not as big and various as BestBuy but electronics all the same, I could single hand managed my department at Walmart, down to lunch times and everything else by myself. At bestbuy I don't have to worry about managing nothing by myself because there is always support and help from other employees and management. I love how we communicate all the time and even make sure that you hit your target goal."
good,i find that best buy is one of the Best (pun intended) jobs i have ever worked for. i like the hours of operation and the discounts.
good,"A typical day would require for me to regularly interact with costumers, especially tourists. I learned how to perfect customer service skill each day I was out on the floor. I learned how to check inventory and take on overnight shifts to change the appearance of the store. I built a great relationship with my supervisors and co-workers. The hardest part of my job was trying to explain a product knew very little about but as time passed I began raising the bar by testing myself in studying a lot of products."
good,"A typical work day at Best Buy was like walking into a party. I loved the environment, culture, the liveliness. Everyday I was able to walk into work with a smile, because I know I was going to be able to help someone with the newest a greatest device. Their training is spectacular. They focus a lot on their employees and their knowledge base, because you have to know to sale it. Management was great to me. Any questions, comments, and concerns it was super easy to communicate with them and they always took care of it right then and there. Best Buy was my first employer, and what I've learned since then was how important it is to truly know something, communication is key, and training is beyond important. There's really nothing hard about being fun, open to learn, and excited about technology. In my eyes I wasn't pushing sales(people are in the store to spend money on technology), I was honestly helping someone find something that fits their needs."
good,A  lot of hands on training took place here. My managers and supervisors were all amazing. the top value promoted here was Have Fun while being the best. We had daily team builders fun games and team competitions. Promotion from with in is the way Best Buy pulls there employees up. The best job experience I ever had.

good,"Definitely a great company to start with; they will help you grow. There is pressure to help the store succeed and reach their daily goals, or else labor will get cut. Managers try to give you the tools to succeed. I've made tons of friends while working here, and you'll get to know who the regulars are.Its also a  very team oriented, helpful when you're in need.The hardest part of the job can be the way the customers treat you sometimes when your giving the your all and they give you a piece of their mind because they do not understand the equipment their sold and will not allow you to explain it to them."
good,The management is occasionally the only draw back to this company. That ranges from a lead level to a corporate level. I approve of the CEO and his efforts with the company. I have worked in two different stores within the company. Both places I have experienced a fun work environment where I make connections with my coworkers that I foresee lasting years if not a lifetime. Best Buy has the best training for employees that I have ever experienced. They have given me knowledge that I use on a daily basis in my life and at work. This knowledge will also help me proceed as an individual in life and within the company.
good,Great work environment with good leadership. A lot of leadership change but wasn't a big problem. Good advancement but not used to the low pay.
good,"Being able to interact with new people everyday was the best part of my job. Having to leave Best Buy, had to be the hardest thing for me to do. Even though moving on was to better my career, it was a job that I would recommend to anybody."

good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Geek Squad is a good job for someone looking to cut their teeth on working with computers, which is exactly why I started working there. However, the pathways for advancement here are blocked by a management staff that can't seem to decide from one day to the next who is the most qualified person for the job. Policies shift overnight with no briefing to the people actually doing the work and client experience suffers as a result. That being said, it's a decent job that pays alright for what it is and Geek Squad tends to attract good people who are both knowledgeable and friendly."
good,Fun place to work. Learned a great deal throughout the years. They went through some restructuring and it benefited the company in the long run.

good,"I worked for Best Buy Mobile for almost 3 years. I loved the training that was available to me and the continued education that they offer. I was a part time lead at the store I was at, which basically means an assistant store manager. I was responsible for money counts, security, customer satisfaction, and associate performances. The team that I was on worked really well together and we could count on each other to make sure that we were meeting our goals and getting our work done! I never had any trouble with pay, if there was an issue with the schedule, my manager was on it and willing to work with me. During my time there I was also in school full time and the company was willing to work with my school schedule and helped  me to graduate. The only reason why I left the company was because I was finishing school and had to graduate! I would return and recommend Best Buy Mobile to anyone that loves to work and to aim for success!"
good,It is very satisfied environment to work in. the manager are really helpful in training and providing all necessary information. It is a happy environment and less stress to work. The co-workers are supportive while working. It is a overall excellent team experience to work with.
good,"Work was always fun and exciting, everyday there was always something different to experience. The most difficult part of the job was not being able to completely satisfy the customer."
good,Usually when I would get there it would be the afternoon so it was usually busy most of my shifts. I learned how to set up a pick up and delivery for products the customer bought. I also learned how to set up a customer with our best buy credit card. Management was awesome honestly. Everybody was open and fun to be around personally and the work place. I didn't necessarily find anything difficult about the job. Most enjoyable thing was probably the work place in general.
good,"Geek Squad is a great company to work for as they have a fun and inviting environment for learning technology and culture. Working for the company was a great experience that i had and extremely grateful for the tools, skills, and knowledge that they thought me. "

good,"My days were never the same twice.  There was always a challenge for me to experience and grow.  I loved the team I had, enjoyed each day."
good,While at Best Buy I learned a lot of about managing a team and what it takes to accomplish team goals. My co-workers and leadership team were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was being on my feet for 6+ hours as well the downtime that occurred from time to time. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting great people like my co-workers and customers.

good,"While working at this company I got a taste for field service work. There was always a new and exciting mission to embark on. I learned about the latest technology, and how to rely on my coworkers to assist me in projects. Advanced troubleshooting and repair skills were a must, with a focus on accuracy. Typically 3-4 service calls per day, and they were rarely the same."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"work overnights for about 10 hours a day, five days a week. I learned to pull cable and operate within the communications room and set-up of the networks within different stores.  management is decently communicative. my co-workers are very team oriented.  hardest part of the job is the last minute deployment around the country and being away from family living out of a hotel. the most enjoyable part of the job is learning new things within different stores and coming up with solutions to problems on the fly."

Throughout the day clients will come to me asking for assistance with their device's problems. By working with the client and my co-workers, I am successfully able to repair and upgrade electronic devices for my clients. This hands-on experience is a crucial part of my learning process.

good,"Best Buy is a company that is known well in the retail world. Founded by Richard M. Schulze and Gary Smoliak in 1966, it began as a humble store for audiophiles and music enthusiasts. Today, it is one of the largest retail chains in the world. It is a great place to work, but faces some of the same challenges as any brick-and-mortar retail store."

good,"I learn more and more things everyday while being at my job. I like my role in this Job the most, and team leadership and work makes this job interesting and enjoyable."

good,"Best Buy had a love/hate relationship with me. I loved working there as a leader, but as a part timer, trying to move up, sucks. I hated it. But once I went to full time, and higher, it was such a perfect job. Sometimes you hate it, but the people are what make it amazing.  I was a manager, and I have to say, my team was not there just as my friends, but they were my family."
good,Every day is a new experience with employee and customer interactions. Best Buy has many seasons they focus on with the Main event being Black Friday. Management along with all their employee prep for several months in advance working on strategies to ensure all customers receive the best service everyday. The hardest part of the day would be when business is slow . And last but not least the best part of the job is the overall experience of working there. Meeting new people daily being able to impact peoples lives. The possibilities for advancement are endless and the employee benefits are ridiculous.
good,"A very calm and non hostile environment yet also fast paced. Everyone typically has a quota to meet. he hardest part of the job is hitting the quota, but they are usually very laid back about it as long as you get at least 70% of the quota. The job itself is just so fun, and it's an amazing place to work with it having a little bit of something for everyone."

From customer assistance and sales to shipping, receiving, and downstocking, no aspect of the store has been untouched. Working here, I feel, has prepared me for my future based on what has been put on my shoulders and what has been left under my responsibility over the years. It's a job that cares about its employees and understands how important school was for its younger workers. Creative differences sometimes exist between employees and management, but that's what makes a successful company. Working together to reach a common goal, from different angles."
good,"Hands down the best company i ever worked for . Although the hours are very competitive which can be stressful  your manager will constantly be coaching you to improve your skills .This is the most accepting friendly place you'll ever work for ; tattoo,  crazy hair color no problem as long as you know your stuff and understand how to preform excellent customer service best buy will give you a shot."

Best Buy allows you the time to do a proper sales job through customer interaction and relationship building.  After I helped the management team increase profit through improving sales techniques and designing a floor-positioning system that increased high-profit accessory sales I was asked to join a training program for management.  Before I could complete the program, the position I had, and the management position I was training for, were both eliminated in a corporate restructuring program.

good,Like working for the company as a whole. Retail on the other hand is a business that takes special people to be in for an extended period of time.

good,if you happen to not get along with some members of management they will let other employees know
good,"Every day I was helping people find the right computer or product that fit their life and needs instead of pitching the same thing over and over just to get the most expensive products out the door and the customer's money in our pockets. It was a very personal connection that I made with each and every customer with the goal being that they leave completely happy with whatever their life was calling for as far as technology goes. I've learned a lot about computers but before going in I already had a great base of knowledge, being around computers my entire life. The management team was great, very understanding and helpful towards the customers as well as us employees. The co-workers were awesome, very good at making new comers feel welcome and at home and showing the ropes was easy because of how friendly the environment was. The hardest part of the job was dealing with a frantic customer that just wouldn't be pleased with anything you tried, but the chances of coming across a customer like that was extremely rare. The most enjoyable part of the job was teaching people and sharing my knowledge so that the customers walk out of the building smiling and feeling complete because of the unique Best Buy experience they had learning and finding the best solution for them. I felt very accomplished every day after work."

good,"My experience at Best Buy was great, I had lots of fun learning new things about products and the retail world. I was part time so the time I spent in there was too short but worth the pay that I obtained as well as the perks. The management was great, they kept me in task and motivated me in my blue days. The hardest part of the job was the timing of when I was hired, well that was not the companies fault it was mostly how crazy my schedule was during my time at Best Buy. I enjoyed coming everyday knowing all the different people I could be able to help."

I have met many people through my time at Best Buy, many of whom are great friends of mine, not just co-workers. Most enjoyable part of this job is the company saying ""having fun while being the best"""
good,Great place to work so managers have micromanagement issues
good,"Of course the perks of working for Best Buy primarily revolves around having the discount to shop there. Management is filled with great people but unfortunately not all of them handle things the same. There is suppose to be a standard of operations but with the way things are changing, Best Buy is often bending over to make customers happy. "

good,"Best Buy was one of the best companies I could work for, the management and supervisors were extremely pleasant and fun to work with. The co- workers were friendly and it was easy to get a long with everyone. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with other people and get to see the type of people who came into the store. I learned how to use a computer and a cash register so I have experience in handling money and customers!"
good,The most enjoyable part of my almost 7 years at Best Buy would definitely be all of my co-workers that I've had the pleasure of working with over the years. I am always learning something new especially with working on computer repairs from software to hardware.
good,"Co-workers were really nice and everyone worked as a team ."
good,You have the opportunity to grow. The managers that i worked with were easy going and open minded about everything.
good,"In this position i was to deal with customers on a daily basis to help with their day to day technological needs. Customer service, sales, as well as physical labor were big aspects of this position."
good,"Relationship selling products, services and solutions by getting to know customers and helping solve their unique end to end needs."
good,"Best buy is a great place to work when you are in school. However, it isn't very easy to advance in the company, especially when you enter from an entry-level position. The atmosphere is great, managers treat you with respect and your coworkers truly become your friends. I would not choose this job as a career due to the pay and hours."
good,"I've been at GSC for three years, and had nothing but good experiences here. The culture is one of a kind, and you genuinely feel like you're working for a company that cares about you."
good,"Sales. The job is mainly sales. Pushing the warranty and accessories. They do offer a section called learning lounge where you can take learnings on new products, or even networking and advanced computer coursed. Management in my location was great, fun to work with and always in the top of the company. Co-workers changed a lot. turnover rate is high. Hardest part of the jobs is having the incentive to sell, with no commission or anything whats the point of busting your tail. The best part about the job is how laid back it is, its a fun place to work."

I learned a verity of jobs including stocking, return policy and Insurance coverage for expensive items the customers bought.

They kept our job fun and exciting along with teaching us new things."
good,Great experience for working with customers/clients from varied backgrounds and cultures.  It was a great help in learning what computer users really want and need.
good,"I loved this job and would have stayed with it, if it weren't for a few factors. While the workplace was enjoyable and the managers actually responded to employees, it was the company itself that was unfair. Specifically, during our physical inventory counts, while sales associates were given a considerable bonus due to our numbers, sales support and loss prevention (people responsible for actually maintaining accurate numbers everyday of the year) were given less than satisfactory in comparison. Plus, each year Thanksgiving continued to be cut short for employees because of Black Friday hours."
good,"Geek Squad is a very busy department to work. You have to know all the policies in the store to be sure about what you're telling customers. Working customer service is not easy. You need to be able to calm customers and give them the best solution you can provide without loosing their business. My co-workers are the best and I enjoy seeing them everyday. The hardest part of the job is all the different responsibilities we can do. Some procedures are fast and easy, while others take time and a lot of private paperwork. All in all, I love being apart of the Geek Squad!"

Within the first year i had done almost every position there, along with aquiring a vast amount of knowledge in the electronics industry."
good,"They are very flexible with working around a school schedule and are very supportive of your schooling and life outside of Best Buy. Most postions are only part time, but that does not mean you won't get close to full time hours. You will recieve lots of training and help from your co-workers."
good,"This Job was Great just too far to travel after a while. Was there with the launch of the Magnolia Home Theater Department a rewarding experience did not have to wear a uniform, I was also the hiring and training coordinator which gave me another title under my belt.. Supervised a team of 10-14 individuals, learned to count registers, and audit them learned to count safe and prepare bank deposits, management team was always helpful and co-workers were a joy to be around we always made it fun not only for ourselves but included our customers in as well. the hardest part of the job was merchandising because of the quantity of merchandise that had to be displayed each day."

good,In a typical day at Plattsburgh Best Buy I get a chance to work with some pretty awesome co-workers and work around tons of electronics that I would love to own! I've learned how to handle stressful customer situations and I've picked the brains of many intelligent electronic minds. My managers are great for the most part. I know they will give me a great chance to succeed and they want what's best for me. The hardest part of this job is that there is rarely down time. We usually have a pretty steady stream of customers and sometimes it can be hard to get other parts of the job done while dealing with the craziness. The most enjoyable part of the job has to be the comradery I feel like I have with my co-workers. I've gotten the chance to become a leader pretty quick here and I love that!

good,"Customer service can be difficult at times, but the people are amazing both customers and fellow employes!"
good,Best Buy Warehouse was a great job and I wished I didn't have to move; I would probably still be working there til this day. I liked everything about this job from the staff to the hours to the potlucks for a good days work. Really great company!!
good,"Upon arriving at Best Buy the first thing that needs to be done would be going to the office to get manager keys and phone, make sure all lunches and breaks were set for checkers and customer service, and balance out safe for shift change. Throughout the day I would be back and forth from customer service and the front end helping employees with overrides, cash and/or change, and general help. After the closing of the store collecting all the cash drawers from the store would be first, then count out deposit, make sure checkers and customer service reps were done closing and cleaning, and lock up."
good,This job is a home service company. So your bosses is the home owner at each house you go to. Some days are better than others when you can fix the appliciance with only two visits. The thing I learn most from this job is that hearing a customer out before problem solving. The management attempts to keep you updated with the latest appliciance on the market. Everyone trys to help each other on calls with out being ask several times. The best part is you can learn television while your working appliciances.

good,"At Best Buy no day is ever the same.

Management is incredibly empowering and taught me skills I will be able to use for the rest of my life. It is difficult to handle the criticism the company has received or prior months. I love getting to talk to numerous people on a daily basis, teaching and coaching my employees, and building relationships is definitely the best part of the job."

good,This had to be my favorite job. I loved the store and even all the managers. To me if you were serious about the job they took care of you and you didn't have the presure of working on commission which helps you breath easier.
good,"A general day will ususally start with a quick meeting, that we call chalk talk, discussing the previous days goals and what the daily revenue budget is for the day. Then we give peer to peer recognition with a huddle chant and then business begins as soon as the doors are open. This business has taught me for one how to be a team player, go the extra mile for the customer, listen to the customer and make sure that their needs are met. Peer to peer accountability, as well as the business aspects of what it means to our revenue and growth as a company if we make sure that every customer is approached with intent to sell and that their needs are met, When it comes to the hardest part of the job I can honestly say there wasnt anything that i viewed as hard. When you can get an opportunity to grow with the company and develop yourself along the way I look at that as positive growth. The most enjoyable part of my experience with customers and retail/electronic business is satisfying the customer with what they came into to purchase. Rather if it was a cd to a kitchen package when you see them smile with satisfaction and on there next visit to the store they personally seek you out to help thats my enjoyment."
good,Great atmosphere and people.
good,"From the moment the time starts when we clock in, there is no down time. You learn to balance out the stress of multiple things going on, from phone calls, to troubleshooting desktop/laptop issues, to researching issues and emailing co-workers of fix. You learn everyday if you're willing to learn. Management is great, great leaders, sometimes we can bump heads on what needs to get done, but the job gets done. Co-workers make the difference. A variety of different personalities and a mixture of sarcasm makes the day fun and enjoyable."

good,"Best Buy was an overall good company to work for. I worked there for six years, and it was a good experience for me. I would definitely recommend working for them."
good,"A typical day would be coming in prepping the store for open, reviewing daily sales goals, then making sure all staff were on time and in dress code. Following that I would check all product and store displays making sure they were functional and visible for customers. In the years working for the company I learned how to manage different personal, problem solving, and how to effectively run a sales floor. The managers there were great leaders who showed great enthuiasm, while effectively communicating all neccesary details for me to succeed. The hardest part of the job was dealing with call outs and staffing enough employees on busier days. The most enjoyable part of the job was store meetings and trainings."
good,A goal orientated place of business that provided good amount of incentives. Provided a good amount of security and ensured the employees safety. Frequent team building experiences provided weekly.

good,They are a good company with utilizes multiple managers to keep up with all the day to day sales operations. Have room for advancement but geared to the younger generation.
good,"Good:  Management always did a great job supporting the employees and ensured they knew what was expected of them.  "
good,"I worked at Best Buy while going to college, the schedule was flexible, the pay was okay for retail, could have always been better.  The company has its own culture, and it is encouraged to explore it and to try to embrace it.  I was in GeekSquad, which had its own unique culture to itself, which, I would have to say it quite remarkable and the amount of help and commodore that exists is more like a brotherhood, than a job.  An agent could ask for help with a strange thing they are seeing on a computer in Virginia, and an agent would go out of their way to help solve that problem in California.  The in store management really varies by store, some stores have amazing managers that are wonderful and will do anything to help you to succeed, and some stores you have managers that are so self important,  if they can look good by making you fail, they will.  The latter is few and far between, but I have met one of those mangers in my time at the company, and that manager didn't last anytime."
good,"Customer service and new Tech knowledge with solutions to customer while being the best .Excellent partnership with different venders like Microsoft, Apple ,Sony ,Samsung ,LG, Amazon and other major manufacturer."
good,"My experience with Best Buy is good, they are all nice and had great leadership, but they need to teach the managers how to professionally train others."
good,"Managers care about your well being and stick up for you when customers are being rude to you. Great pay and benefits, Good team environment overall.."
good,Leaving work each day would leave me feeling unfulfilled. But the work culture there was great. Everyone there was very nice and helpful. Management was very helpful and flexible.
good,"When you work for Geek Squad and not Best Buy, there is a lot of growth opportunities outside of Best Buy. It is very good experienced for the IT field."
good,"amazing staff, and the mangers were amazing. i have learned how to handle a problem and create a solution. the hardest part of this job would be when a customer treats you inappropriately ."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my experience. They have great benefits like matching your pay for college as well as other benefits. Great work environment and coworkers as well as management."
good,"The staff was very helpful at all times and very supportive! If I weren't returning to school, I would have stayed with them. I recommend this job to anyone with a passion for tech!"

good,"Typical Day at Work - Retail environement, high paced consistent coaching and training."
good,Best Buy is an okay company to start out at. They will give you a lot of skills but there is not always the room for advancement that you would like to see. Often it is a popularity contest rather than being based on your skills.
good,"Enjoyed my time working here. My managers were friendly and hard working, great coworkers, enjoyable job. Very willing to schedule around school and decent pay"
good,Peak season is the only bad about the job. You work crazy long days during peak but after that life is back to normal.  Some shifts are 12 hours others are 14 hours.
good,"Been here for almost a year and i love it. Flexible, pay could be better but it's worth it, and you get paid weekly. Full time gets vacation right off the bat, Part time no vacation."
good,"At Best Buy there’s lots of challenges that you have you to complete but there’s always tons of fun to have, you never get bored and the people you work with will always be there for you"

good,I loved my time working for the company. There were many opportunities that were given to me based on work ethic and drive. If you are willing to do the work you WILL grow.
good,I loved working here wish I wasnt seasonal or I would stay as long as possible. Management was lovely. They cared about my needs. Always a great time.
good,"This is a work place that is very fast  paced and always full of moving pieces and tasks from working trucks to ensuring planograms and pricing are done there is always something to do and yet you are trained on everything under the sun and then some. Amazing place to work and grow your skills with countless opportunities to advance and be promoted to new positions, as well they have amazing benefits for all level of staff."

good,"Typical days were not too busy which allowed ample time to make sales pitches and product stocking. Black Friday and Boxing Day can be very busy, but not overwhelming. Management was great. They were supportive of customer service decisions and they organized plenty of employee satisfaction events.  It was clear that employee morale was a priority for management. "
good,"Good place to work with benefits and fun people. The schedules are fine with everything online including training, but that has to be done in the store"
good,I loved working here. The environment and the people made it good to work here. Just make sure you speak to every customer possible to reach your daily goals and you'll be set. It has taught me some good selling skills and I had fun selling all the cool tech that Best Buy sold.

good,"Of all the jobs I have had, Best Buy is by far the best company I have worked for. They always make me feel valued as a worker, and I enjoy the work I do."
good,"I would say this is one of my favorite places I have worked. They did everything in their power to ensure your safety and you were happy. They had a snack bar you could buy snacks from if you forgot yours, this is separate and less expensive than what is offered at the registers. They have parties to express their gratitude to their employees. If you have a medical problem they work with you. They don't judge you. The whole workplace culture is amazing. I had a miscarriage while there and they were amazing through it! They didn't harass me for not being able to do various tasks while pregnant which I have experienced at other workplaces. They believe in positive reinforcement, not negative. I have worked multiple jobs where negativity is how they get you to work. I actually had a job where I was let go as manager because I didn't write enough people up. This place is the opposite!!! I actually looked forward to going to work. If I ever went back to the retail world, I would go back to Best Buy hands down!!"
good,"Despite a few discrepancies. Best Buy is by far the best retail store I’ve ever worked for! Room for advancement, decent salary, and good benefits even for part time.."
good,"Really depends on Management, was fun then bad then fun again after a few changes in Management. Depending on your bosses they may make you work excessively or learn to delegate and work efficiently"

good,"for the warehouse positions at Best Buy your work day will be fast paced. Standard day begins with receiving UPS, Fed Ex, printing and putting out daily price changes, Large T.V and appliance truck, and then depending on day, inventory truck (which is generally 3 times per week except during holiday season). In addition to this, on Sunday there is the full store sign audit, and the beginning of the inventory tag checks which must be turned in by Tuesday (this inclines checking to make sure all open box and shelf display tags are correct and in proper locations). In addition to those daily and weekly task, on a daily basis you must also complete online orders (grabbing items from floor and approving the order, then putting item in correct area for pickup by customer or packaging it to be shipped to customers house), assist customers while on the floor, handle loading t.v's and appliances into cars, empty trash cans in restrooms and front of store, and grab shopping carts from parking lot."

good,Ambiente muy relajado y amigable con un excelente trato y constante preparación con las nuevas tecnologías
good,A typical day would be to make sure everything is down stocked and talking to a manager on what can be done to make the store look nicer. Also on a certain day we change all of our prices in the morning before we open.
good,There is a good culture at Best Buy and co-workers are enjoyably competitive but helpful. Management is proactive and is quick to assist with any employee issues that arise.
good,"Best Buy is a very good company to work for. They take care of their employees and are seeking ways to improve. There was some situations that are handled questionably, there was a girl who committed credit card fraud pretty frequently at my old location and it was reported by multiple people to multiple managers and corporate, and HR and store management did nothing about it and it continued. There is definitely favoritism, business ethics at the store level are handled poorly, terms and conditions for customers and scopes of work were not always expected to be provided to customers and management didn’t enforce it."
good,I really enjoyed my time with Best Buy. A great work ethic definitely helps with advancement through the company. The culture was always one of fun and inclusion. It really feels like family there. Plenty of ways to keep learning about products and processes.
good,The work culture at Best Buy is very relaxed and welcoming. The employees are helpful and the management is great. A typical day at work goes by very quickly because everyone of your coworkers and managers make it feel like the hours are flying by.
good,If you love technology Geek Squad is the place for you. I work in the home theatre department and every day is different. I am accountable for myself and my work. I get to problem solve and play with the latest gadgets on the market. My Boss is the best manager I have ever worked for and it's not even close. The work culture and environment is amazing. The pay is better than any other typical job but still on the low side seeing as the age requirement is 21 years old and older to work. So having a family and trying to survive off of low pay is the only downside.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Working at Best Buy was one of the best atmospheres I have ever been apart of. Everybody including the management was really cool, understanding, and relatable."
good,"Absolutely loved my time at Best Buy, it was a fast paced environment with new challenges and welcomed critical thinking. Being the Samsung mobile expert was an enthralling and captivating experience as well. Each and every customer has a specific need, wanted to learn how to use the newest tech,r simply purchase something that fit their style. The employees I worked with all were outstanding people and all had a winners attitude. The only negative experience I had was the store receiving a new general manager who unfairly removed associates by needing to make his presence known. "
good,I love to culture within best buy my experience is its like working with family. I love meeting new people that come in to shop and I get to show them something they didn't know about. The leadership is there to help guide and develop new people coming in
good,"They really do take care of their employees in regards to benefits and training. It’s easy to move up in the company and I really did enjoy working there. I left due to personal reasons, nothing to do with the company."
good,Middle level management is the real problem at this jobs.  A lot of them tend to be lazy and thats the reason reason i didn't give all 5's. the job culture is great except for the short coming of middle limit management.

Here, just like any retail store, you are given a chance to build your interpersonal skills as well as other soft skills through every day interactions with customers. It also gives the employee the opportunity to learn about the wide variety of technology that is being sold there. If you put in your time, just like any job, you will be given the opportunity to be in leadership roles as well. They were super supportive of my part-time military career as well as my class schedule while I was in college. Overall, great place to work,"
good,"Hands down the best managers, best coworkers, and best company I've ever worked for. They treat their employees well, the crew I had in appliances was very supportive, professional, and we had a lot of fun working together. The company is in really good hands with the CEO and the pay is competitive."

good,"Overall, a great place to work, would definitely recommend. But, if you are not into sales, then maybe think about looking at other retail stores. There is a lot of sales tracking when working here, and if sales stress you out, be careful. Fellow employees are great to work with, and the education received was helpful and very up to date."
good,"Starting out, I didn't know knowledge on products but the people there will help you out to learn all manners of products, how to talk to people to help them with their needs and give enough knowledge to help you be successful."

good,"Learned how to work at a fast pace, how to communicate with customers. Learned how to handle difficult situations such as helping a customer purchase another item similar to what they wanted"
good,Good company for someone who's starting out in the career field. Long term there is only upper management available  and if you are tired out on retail you might want to think of other opportunities.
good,You’ll have a very difficult time finding another retailer that is gonna be willing to give you as nice of a work environment. Best Buy makes sure all of their employees are currently trained and ready to hit the sales floor. If you have a skill problem and not a will problem this company will take you far! I know many employees that have worked for the company for over 20 years and are being compensated well above the market in different retailers!

good,Best Buy has great work culter. Your typical workday will consist of a quick meeting/huddle followed by assisting customers. Best Buy has a No customer goes unserved and No employee goes untrained
good,"I learned a lot from my employment with Best Buy, like how to introduce myself to many people that I'm unfamiliar with and ways to best express my knowledge about a certain product. A typical day of work started out pretty fast, as many people would come into the store to check out the new deals, after lunch, it would be pretty busy also as there was plenty of people coming in from the mall. The hardest part of the job would have to be getting burnt out because of rude people, and there's not much you can do to fix that as a company. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I finally made a big sale or when I would get a customer to apply for a Best Buy credit card, the management did a great job of rewarding people who got people to apply for credit cards. The culture in Best Buy was one of the best I've seen in the workplace."
good,Pretty nice place to work. My local management team is fantastic. Not sure about management in other stores but the ones here in Grand Junction are amazing.

I've learned how to adapt to certain situations involving a complaint and how to handle it. Management is top notch as long as you don't call in every week, really no complaints. It is a competitive atmosphere at Best Buy which will keep you on your feet, and help you get prepared for the holidays. Best part is the friends and family that you grow attached to over the years."
good,Best Buy was great experience. It encourage me to grow within company with great product knowledge and also learn different ways of communications with sales
good,"Location by location can have a different leadership style, but I’ve worked for the company almost five years and the company really does care, lots of benefits and good health insurance.

good,"Greet customers, check receipts, monitor cctv for theft or other criminal activities. provide paperwork to supervisors before leaving or the day. The hardest part of the job is standing in one spot all day, but you get used to it. Best part is the team work and atmosphere the management provides."

good,Overall I love working for best buy as a company i agree with their values and the steps they take to help the communities and the environment. It is fun yet professional and i have nothing bad to say about the managers that i have had or most of my coworkers. the only reason why i want to leave is because the schedule for a full time sales consultant changes every week and i need a set schedule to take care of my family. The company is fantastic for college students or high schoolers who want a part time job but they just can't accommodate my needs for my schedule.

good,I'm either assigned to a gaming or camera department. Down-stocked empty product shelves before the store opens. Clean and bright. Help find solutions for the customer on what product they are looking for. Also use online software to find products and its description. I've learned that each customer has their own perfect solution and getting to know them helps the process of finding the perfect solution. Management is very organized and helpful. There is no hard part of the job and everything is enjoyable.
good,I Learned a lot about selling. Company stresses selling credit cards a lot. But the upper management is amazing but lower management is very cliquey..
good,"A typical day at work was running the sales floor for multiple departments such as but not limited to home theatre, electronics, and home and lifestyle.

Outside of th eholiday season they are very flexible with your work schedule without it counting against you.

good,"I really enjoyed working at Best Buy and would recommend it to anyone. Unfortunately, I had to relocate and there were no suitable positions available to me where I moved to. I was also in a position that would require a significant cut in pay if I chose to pursue another position within the company. At the level I was at, there were few career choices for me to pursue that would have made sense."
good,"I worked at two Best Buy locations and enjoyed working at both. It was fast paced, with great teamwork and job satisfaction. Management was excellent and helped you at any time you needed help."

good,Best buy was a great place overall to work. I learned how to make sales over the phone and process returns. the management there focused on core values having daily huddles to discuss where each department stood. Best buy was a good place to work at because everybody was always helping one another to meet sales. The hardest thing about working there was dealing with angry upset customers. The most enjoyable part was creating a good shopping experience for customers.
good,"Let me just say I became Asset Protection to explore what i can do."
good,you build such great relationships with co-workers. It made it easier to come to work everyday and everyone supports your goals. It was fun and not stressful.
good,Workers are given a quota for the day and a time to complete the task.

Great hours during season with a lot of opportunity for overtime and advancement.

good,"Best Buy is fully a per store experience for anybody who is looking to work within the company. If you want to actually get a good idea of what the store is like that you are going to think of working for, it is best to spend a few days within a month at the store at varying times. Talking with the workers at the store about how they feel the store and managers are and then basing your judgement for working with Best Buy on that information."
good,"I would recommend this company to anyone. If you have a specialized skill, (I.e. Technician, computers, cameras/ photography, in depth home theater knowledge) then the sky’s the limit, and you an opportunity here."

good,"I work part time at Best Buy. I work in the evening and on the weekends. The dates and times are great for me as this is a second job for money to pay for home repairs. I love the people I work with, the atmosphere and the job. I even enjoy the customers and getting to know them better."
good,Best retail experience you can have. Best Buy provides good training on the products that you will be selling to customers. Learning about the technology you're selling makes the job easy to like.
good,"Good place to work and grow your career. I was able to learn many skills such as sales training, human resource processes, inventory controls and customer service skills."
good,"I can understand the company wanting to keep up with their competition, but being open on Thanksgiving day is a bit ridiculous. Employees should have time with their families on this holiday."
good,"You learn so much about customer service and how to work in a team environment. Benefits and discounts are great! They hire really fun, outgoing people. You know it's a job but it doesn't feel like one."
good,I have never had a greater pleasure than working for Best Buy. They have supported me and have a great ear for their employees and what they want. They are more customer oriented than other companies and I am glad to recommend it to other prospective people that want to work there.
good,I loved working at Best Buy! Everyone who worked there was very friendly. Working here was super easy and everyone was very accommodating and helpful when I had questions and didnt understand something.
good,"Best buy offers a wide variety of positions and is always open to employees from all backgrounds.  Not only are you paid competitively, you become a part of a family culture that will keep you striving for the next step in your career."
good,"Fast Paced, opportunity to advance.  Opportunity to travel. Great place to learn and grow about the retail business.  Builds leaders.  Once you work there you will be able to go anywhere and succeed."
good,"I loved the job. It was easy going and stress free. The time goes by fast do to the fact that you stay busy the whole time u are there,rather you was doing the job you was assign to or something else ."
good,Funniest place i worked at. Got tons of training. Got to be around all the latest and greates tech. Never a dull moment. The best people ive ever worked around.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"The sales training and experience I got at Best Buy was great, but if you want to make money you need to move to a position that pays commission. Great management."
good,"In my time here as a merch team member I have gotta say, it was a blast. It's a fast paced environment, but at the same time the work given is pretty relaxing. As long as you work hard and are determined to help improve shopping experiences for customers, you will fit right in. The managers are easy to talk to, and will work with you if your having a hard time. Very welcoming people, which is why I joined in the first place. Only complaints I had while working there would be progressing to full time (as a merch team member or anyone in the back, full time positions are very limited),  communication could be better, and apart from an employee discount, part timers don't have much going for them in the benefits department. Despite the full time situation, if you want hours, they will give you hours. All in all, if your looking for a good retail experience or a nice part time job, then this would be the job for you (if you get hired on in the back room, didn't get to experience sales floor positions)."
good,Overall this job has treated me very well from the day that I worked there. I would recommend working here to anyone. This job is very straightforward but requires to move a lot.
good,"Have a great time working here. Pepole are great, management is great. Knew how to sell before I came here. BestBuy helped me better. Would recommend a 1000x over."
good,Depeending on the best buy you go to . The work environment is great. The pay is above min wage. You get amazing discounts and beifits. A loving staff that will son become your family.
good,I enjoyed my time at Best Buy. My only complaint is during Black Friday and that’s more on the shoppers. They are willing to train and teach you new things if you are interested in moving
good,I was able to move up the ranks of the company ladder and was able to attain the QA position because of my low return rate for repairs; really enjoyed this job.
good,A typical day at work was fun for me because my customers were always spending a lot of money on items which was during the holiday season but it was a great experience working there. We did a lot of fun things regarding the holiday season.
good,"Everyday was an adventure, the day wouldn't be the same as the last. I learned about people skills and selling efficiently in a quick and timely manor. It was a very comfortable environment where everyone was happy to be there. The hardest part of the job would have been coordinating with others to change shifts."
good,Great place to work! Best Buy provided me with the necessary training and skills to pursue my dreams. They also gave me new dreams for employment and taught me how to succeed.
good,"Loved working here great culture, great people all the things you would want in a job like this. Promotions can get a little political as they have the person picked before the job is posted alot but they are amazing people"

good,"productive and fun workplace, very flexible with school and other work schedules. friendly co workes as well as friendly management"
good,"Best Buy in San Luis Obispo is a great place to work for everyone. Typically as a sales consultant, you clock in to your shift, check in with the Manager on Duty, and then assist customers with finding the complete solution to their problem, no matter how large. Often times collaborating with other sales consultants and even the Geek Squad associates. When not assisting customers, you typically make sure your department is clean, orderly, and all products are fully stocked."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Best Buy.  It was fun & exciting. I learned a lot about different types of electronics. It was a short job, but it definitely made an impact."
good,"You will be the first to see new launches, excellent employee discount, flexible with work hours.Good benefits and commission if you are in sales. Love the black Friday events."
good,I learned how to sell. They help their employees by arranging E-Learning sessions every week. Managers are always ready to train you even if it is more then once for same thing.
good,Working in customer service can be challenging in itself but working at the Dothan store I found my peers and management were very helpful and eager to help me learn. The atmosphere is upbeat and enjoyable on most days. There is much more to learn in my job and I enjoy learning new things and keeping the job fresh and challenging.
good,From the sales associate to the managers everyone has a great attitude on a daily basis. Seeing a customer satisfied with their purchase is the most enjoyable part of the job. I learned to multi task efficiently.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Definitely enjoyed my time at Best Buy. Family atmosphere that allowed you to be yourself while being the best. Management was great, from the goals of the store to the focus of the company. The hardest part honestly was finding out my location was closing. Things I enjoyed the most were customers that had their problems solved, questions answered, and satisfied with their purchase."
good,"awesome place, and i was super grateful to join such a company. I would recommend lots of friends to work here, as it pays well above minimum wage and the hours on the clock are not stressful. My location was one of the best selling in the district, and even with that being the case, I can still vouch for us having lots of downtime at work."
good,"I worked in the gaming, cameras, and navigation department. Nothing short of a great training and positive feedback from other employees. I'd work there again if giving the opportunity."
good,This company was ok to work for but they sacked me due to being in ans out of hospital which was not my fault. The company has now closed down so this review wont mean much
good,It's worth working there u learn about business also learn how to sale and build communication skills as well as team building. You can always move up in the company as well .
good,Front lanes can get repetitive but try to flex between different stations when asked. Enjoy working with everyone as they are great people to kick it with.
good,This place is like candy land but with electronics. You honestly get paid so much more then you deserve for the job you do. It’s amazing to have a “work family”
good,"Great workplace. I've worked in various departments such as Ecom and re-pack, worked there three seasons. If it were for me I'd stay to work there full time all year."
good,"Very hands on environment that really taught me how to handle situations, customers, and work hard in a high demand workplace. Very inviting and involved with their employees."
good,A typical day at work would be arriving early to begin stocking the sales floor. Meetings in the mornings discussing the sales that we must meet. What I learned from working their is to always ask questions.
good,you learn a lot of things about how each manufacturer add their own element to their computers. Management is strict yet almost like a family. There are usually dead days yet upper management (as in way up) still demand you meet quotas.
good,"If you enjoy fast pace and are determined to learn and grow, the opportunities are always there. By far, the best management I've ever had. I worked at the flagship location, so we were 24 hours. There really was never any downtime, but that is what I enjoyed the most because it was never a dull moment."
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work at. Always have opportunities for advancement and it usually encourages inside promotion. You’ll have fun, and work hard, it is definitely a fun experience."

good,Best Buy provided a Productive and Fun Environment. Great Training Techniques and provided both Productive Sales and Team meetings on a regular basis.
good,"amazing pace to work has lots of perks  give you a alright discount."
good,The overall atmosphere in the store is extremely relaxed and you get plenty of down time and breaks between work. The managers are all very fair and can tell you intentions so as long as you intend to do well they'll help fix whatever mistakes you make along the way with little scorn.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Extremely enthusiastic atmosphere that makes the job enjoyable. Most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to have fun while also doing your job. Everyone gets along and even goes out for a family dinner weekly.
good,"I have worked Loss prevention for 3 years at the local Best Buy. It is a great company because as an individual employee, you feel as if they care what you have to say and about your personal life. The discounts are great, benefits are more than anyone could as for, and my manager is the best boss I could as for."
good,"I absolutely love my Best Buy family, they make the place highly enjoyable. I learned how to problem solve in difficult situations, work in a fast manner, multitask, and how to do administration work. Hardest part, there really isn't one the place is amazing. A typical day would consist of phone calls, customer care, apt setting, etc."
good,"Great company, listens and cares about employees. Benefits are swell. Team culture is infectious. Customers could be difficult but that's retail business. Solutions were always available and the tools needed to get them done. Black Friday's and BBY were some of the most hectic but fun experiences ever."
good,Best Buy has helped me in a lot of ways. We always work hard toward are individuals goals to help achieve the store goals. The management at Best Buy is amazing. they are always willing to help out with issues that even occur outside of work and they are very respectable about it.
good,Great culture and company. Promotions are hard to come by though. Seems like promotions are based more on the buddy-buddy system than performance or talent.
good,"This was my first job and it opened so many chances for later jobs because I worked for best buy, If you can get a job here this will help you further down the line. The discounts were great also"
good,I thoroughly enjoy the help but as part time I get so little amount of hours that trying to work there only has been difficult. Also it can be hectic at times
good,best buy has to be one of the places i have always enjoyed working. I've made strong connections as well as friendships with my team. management is always awesome and will help you whether it is business or personal. i love my team at best buy.
good,Management and Staff are both friendly and encourage growth both within the company and personal. I learned a great deal about technology and installation in my 4 years of work. Everyday is a new challenge to learn and overcome.
good,"Best Buy has a unique culture about it.  Every employee is regarded as family and as family we are all willing to make sacrifices for each other.  Employees are friendly and management is understanding but firm.  The environment promotes competition and growth, and with dedication, advancement and job satisfaction can be obtained."
good,Best Buy corporate headquarters is a great place to work! They are a leader in their industry and treat their employees professionally. Opportunities for advancement abound.
good,"I learned alot during my time at Best Buy, It definitely made me into the person I am today and I would recommend anyone to apply and hone their technology skills"
good,"My experience may be different from others. I have always been put in bad situations but its the people around you that help you grow and develop. The people that work with you share the same ideas that you do. We are all passionate about technology and the amazing things that we can do with such devices and tools. Struggling, no worries, you have a team around you that have years of experience with different ranges of skill sets. Need help with office, there is someone there willing to teach and help you understand the program. Working on something and don't have any clue as to where to find the solution or workaround? There is always someone there to help. You slowly and slowly start building through each experience and then the situations come up again, you'll know exactly what to do."
good,Great College Job.  Would spend the day helping customers find their next phone or phone plan.  This would mean being knowledge about the different cell phone providers and their phone plans.
good,Best Buy taught me a lot about management ans training employees the right way. I would recommend that job to any one seeking management. There is a great deal to be learned from working there
good,"Amazing opportunities, a great place to learn selling techniques, and really advance and learn about retail. The management was always teaching you something new, and I was constantly learning."
good,I've worked with many companies. But non like best buy. The employees are great to work with and so are the leadership. There are lots of room to grow and they care for thier employees like family. I would encourage everyone to see it for your self.

good,If you love meeting people and electronics this is the place to work. Management tend to be pretty good with few bad apples. If you work hard you can advance and make a lot of money. I wish I had never left!!!
good,"It's a great place to work at as one of your first jobs. The pay is great if part-time. Full-time pay is alright until you become a manager if Best Buy becomes your career; at that point the pay is way above average compared to general retail managerial salaries. You will need an extreme reservoir of patience set aside for the worst customers. Their level of computer knowledge usually hovers around the minimum needed to survive in this information age. On the other hand, a decent amount of customers are normal that just need help buying available tech. The managers are great, their operations are always being updated and new strategies to help customers are always made available to employees to aid them in providing exemplary service. Customers always say how much happier Best Buy employees are compared to Walmart and that creates a much happier environment for the customers as well as for the employees themselves. Much recommend."
good,"Best Buy is hard work, but with it there comes a lot of fun too. The management at our store is shoulder to shoulder working with us and are quick to make a joke over the mics to help the day go by. We work as a team, each doing our best to make the revenue for the store. I have learned so much at Best Buy. It has been a totally new experience for me as I have spent my working life behind a desk. You never know what is in store for you when you walk in the door. You will learn to deal with the public. That's the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Best Buy was a great place to work at. No matter what position i held or what store i was in, the co-workers were always very nice. Not just the co-workers, but everything from the job accommodations to the pay to even the type of work to be done was great, and while i was employed their i had a great time and an overall great experience."
good,Loved working at best buy. Teammates were amazing great crew to be around. I enjoyed it a lot and the learning. The company is great for learning about technology. If you're tech savvy or in college its a great part- time job.
good,"All I need to specify is the code of conduct they go by."
good,"I've learned a lot from Best Buy, i learned people come in for all types of electronics. We would give them the correct products even when they come in looking for the wrong one. The most enjoyable thing about Best Buy would be the workers and how you communicate with them and how you all understand each other"
good,"Great place to work!"
good,"Job title is Retail media analyst, Good management, fast paced, Agile work, Amazing team, Never ending learning process. Friendly environment. Very entertaining team and never felt like moving out of it."
good,I learned how to sell protection/replacement plans for certain items that Best Buy sells. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers.
good,"Be an expert in your respective department and apply holistic knowledge to drive profitable outcomes. Deliver on all aspects of the sales experience within your respective department through all touch points with Best Buy inside and outside of the store (eg. Online, Services, Delivery/Installation, Solutions etc.)."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Best Buy the mangers and everyone I worked with were awesome my only problem was they would not give more then 25 hours a week so I had to go. And performance was not the reason why, often times I outsold my department manager."
good,I loved working for this company. I worked in Mobile specifically. I like their pay structure and the culture that the company creates. Everyone always got along well and I made life long friends.
good,"As a manager, yes, there were some stressful times.  But, and I learned this early in my career, if you create the right culture and build the right team, the stress is minimized.  "
good,"great place to work.. great pay/benefits. On a normal day hours were very long, so you had little time to spend with family if you have small children"
good,"I had worked at my local Best Buy for 3 years and my time there was a pleasure. Though we were all serparated by departments, such a cohesive team of people coming together made co workers seem like family. Would work there again in a heartbeat."
good,"The discounts you receive are incredible, loved the people I worked with. Black Friday is an interesting day to work if you've never done a retail job."
good,Part time employees not enough hours. Lots of training. Great management team. A chance to learn all types of retail sales and techniques in selling brand name items. All major brands at great prices. Excellent Geek Squad teams
good,"It is a “customer first” job and you will have to bend over backwards for some, but management is almost always there to help. You do have daily goals to hit, so if you work at a busy store, there should be no problem to hit goal everyday."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best buy brought me a lot of experiences. I was able to move up in the company within my four years of working there. I went form a part-time multi-media representative, to working in operations lead, to a full-time employee. We did have a lot of revamping due to the changes in our economy but it was a great experience, very diverse and the company treated me like I was family. "
good,Liked working here it just wasn't very beneficial to me for being young and part time I learned a lot here about products and sales. They wouldn't allow me to move up in the company.
good,"Great company to work for with opportunities for growth; It's exciting to be introduced to next level technology as it's released. The benefits are great, the employee discounts are great, and the atmosphere in store is usually fun and laid back. At Best Buy, especially on the sales floor,  you get to have fun while being the best. "
good,"The job i performed was very productive, fast past,  helped the time go by fast although every week you couldn't depend on working full time if they was low on work we got sent home early."
good,"Bestbuy is not only my job I feel welcomed and comfortable with my staff . Bestbuy care for they employees business and personal. "
good,The job gives you opportunity to meet new people also i enjoyed the company of my co-worked. My boss and the people I worked with were like a family on their own and also were very accepting.
good,I loved working at this Best Buy. They were kind and welcoming to new employees. The managers really care about your life outside of Best Buy and are very flexible with your schedule.
good,Truly does feel like 1 big family at best buy. I will always remember working for them. Life lessons along with many other things come with working for such an amazing company.
good,"An overall fun place to work, lots of people interaction. Extensive training on all the different products and future products. Paid very fairly. My store was a smaller store so a lot of the times no matter what department you work in you had to go help where ever needed so had to know at least the basics of every other department."
good,"It has been one of the most fun, challenging and growing companies I have ever been with. I would love explore more of my skills that I was in school for and make a career out of that instead. it's something I love doing and studied for."
good,"the best part of coming to work everyday is to interact with customers and ensure they are having a wonderful experience. great culture, always changes in a positive way"
good,"I loved my time with best buy it was very fun to me. We went to small homes to mansions. I loved installing audio and network equipment to our clients. Best buy gave us all a vehicle, cell phone and laptop as tools to get the job done"
good,"Working at Best Buy is a great learning experience. They make sure to train you as best they can but it is ultimately up to the employee to embrace it. If you apply yourself to learning the sales techniques, you can make it pretty far in the company."
good,I absolutely loved working for best buy. i have met so many friends through working there and gained a lot of experience and knowledge with the help of the managers. the customers that come into the store always gave you a new experience and something to look forward to each day. The only thing i could say is that the management needs to be more informed on what is going on with the teams and be more like a leader and not a manager.
good,"Great people, and work culture. Chances at advancements. and opportunities to get discounts by doing E-learnings of products. Clean, and all the managers were good at their job."
good,"My hours were drastically cut, and i cant afford to wait around there anymore and see if they go back up. the people who run the store are great, my coworkers were amazing. the energy was unbelievable."
good,"This job was a laid back sales environment. I learned a lot about phone plans, devices, and accessories. Management was always willing to work on issues with you and willing to work around schedules."
good,Nice place to work at. You get to learn about the best electronics and products on the market. They're also able to work with your flexible schedule if you have other stuff going on.
good,"Typical day as a Consult agent: Complete opening tasks, store opens, first client shows up (this part really set the tone for the day it always felt like), Understand their problem, get them on the right track for alleviating the issue, sometimes to their dismay with the charges (Sorry nothing I could do here), recommend options, proceed at their will. Management left a little to be desired but no micromanagement was fantastic and allowed for a lot of independence between clients. Hardest part was definitely the ""spicy"" clients. They come in, already mad at the world, and take it out on you. Sometimes you want to clock'em, but you gotta just keep on smiling, but the client's that come in willing to learn really make it worth while. When you get to show them new features or get to teach them something new, and their eyes are real wide, just trying to soak up everything you tell them, it really makes you feel good."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.

good,"Best Buy was the core job that really provided much of my knowledge in customer service/satisfaction and leadership. Great place to work, the employees were family and management, at the time, was the best you could as for. Always attentive, never afraid to take risk and open to new employee based ideas. So much knowledge to be amassed and always a fun and safe place to work at."
good,A typical day of work would be helping any customers coming in with either finding a product or assisting with a product. It's a fun learning environment with a lot opportunities and chances to learn new things.
good,"The break room is very relaxed and cool. There are couches, vending machines, lockers, sink, fridge, microwave and tv. The management team of the GM AND ASM are really cool and business driver. The other managers are okay but I feel they are the front liners. Associates are cool, some are territorial. I enjoyed this job."
good,"You always have something to do. If the store is slow you can organize the stock, fill it out or clean your surroundings. We also had store party’s in the store or they would take us bowling."
good,"A typical day at work was mainly working with customers, ensuring that they got exactly what they needed. I learned a lot about computers and how to check people out at a register. Management was excellent and encouraging. The culture was positive and encouraging. The hardest part of the job was administrative things. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers."
good,Great experience working with computers and customers. Enjoyed working with all of the other employees. I was always learning about something new everyday.

good,Working at best buy is an amazing job for those looking to get into the retail field. It was by far the best retail job I have ever had. The management and team I worked for was top notch.

I loved my job and I would definitely consider going back.
good,Best Buy cares about their employees.  The work can be fasted pass and goal orientated but Best Buy gives you the tool to make your job easy.  I would recommend this job to anyone.
good,"Friendly Coworkers, Fun place to work in.  Great environment. Everyone is in a positive mood  Focusing on their daily tasks. helping drivers Locate their orders."
good,"Most days are composed of answering basic questions to anywhere between a dozen or three dozen customers, as well as 1 or 2 in depth questionnaires in order to assist the customer in deciding upon which product to purchase. Managers were fair, and always willing to get in and do the dirty work with the rest of us. What was most enjoyable were the in depth customer interactions, as they were often  a casual conversation as you help them decide a specific computer, laptop, etc."
good,You work with great people and the days are fast paced and fun. It's very rewarding too help people find what they need and too be able to get that product for them
good,This was my first time working full time in USA. I received an excellent collaboration from the administration. Incredible bosses incredible manager. The latest and most modern instruments and work equipment. I always had the love and collaboration of all my colleagues. I had a minor injury in an accident and they treated me better than the owner of the company. It was my best electronics studio in my new country
good,I loved working at best buy it was only seasonal though. My boss was excellent. The pay was more than my full-time job. It was easy to learn about all of the products because everyone worked together as a team. I would go back in a heartbeat.
good,Best Buy provides great benefits for college students and is flexible when it comes to scheduling. There are also plenty of benefits that cover many different areas. I would definitely recommend working there.
good,Job was very demanding but you are given the ownership of the P&L and autonomy to drive and execute business. Managers were hard working and very competetive. Leadership management were very talented and driven.
good,I have been working for Best Buy for roughly 2 years now. I must say my time with them has been great I love the culture and everything that goes into Best Buy. I believe to advance company it’s about networking and hard work. Doing those two things has gotten me far with the company.

good,"Working at Future Shop/Best buy, you'll definitely learn something new everyday. Specially with all the new technology coming out, it's great. It's useful for when working with electronics devices.  A lot of things a learn about computers, laptops, and all these little gadgets, I use today at home and with my other jobs, because I understand more how it works or how to fix little things. "
good,"Busy, fast paced work environment. Probably one of the best retail locations to work at. extensive training. Retail isn't always the most fun place to be especially the holidays but Best Buy does their best to make it enjoyable. Very team orientated."
good,The company was very fast - paced and the other workers were very helpful and just as productive as I was. The company was a family owned company and was very close

I didnt know anything about electronics but the staff has helped me so that I can help customers. They make me feel like I am a real asset to the team. The team at best buy got me involved right away and helped me strengthen my skills in various areas I definitely recommend as a first job or college job!

good,"The people at best buy are so kind and so friendly, management always made sure we knew what we were doing, a work day wasnt hectic but always busy..."
good,I loved the store I was at and I love my managers. We were always having a great time in the store. The staff didn't make it seem like we were always being hounded for numbers but rather they made it a fun game for us to be able to achieve our goals in a more competitive and interactive fun way.

good,"Unlike every other company I have worked for, Best Buy is very good about paying you accordingly to how well you do your job. As long as you show up on time, do a great job, and bring profit to the company as a sales consultant, they will recognize that and compensate you accordingly. I absolutely love my job at Best Buy and I am confident that I can reach out to management when there is an issue in my department, or just something I have noticed in store. If you ask for more responsibility, they will find the best spot for you to build your resume and work experience overall."

good,Best buy is a fun place to work out. It is very mellow to work here. One thing I didnt like is the lack of hours you get. Theres not much room to move up the ladder there unless you want more hours. This is a great job for a college student.
good,Everyone at Best Buy is super welcoming so it makes my daily work day go buy a lot smoother. I definitely am glad i've been able to work there for the past two years.
good,"Fast-paced, fun place to work at. Depending on what management you're given and what store you're working at, you're either going to love or hate your job. One or the other."

good,everyone should work at best buy its an amazing culture and you learn alot i would still work there is the pay was higher. good people hire good people obviously it gets stressful but over all my favored place to work
good,"Best Buy is a very face paced place. Constantly new changes, I learned from them to adaptive to change quickly. Best Buy taught me many things and gave me a lot of experience. I had a lot of promotions in the store but once I started working at home for Best Buy Corporate there is no opportunity for growth. The office is in Minnesota and I am currently in Miami, FL. If I want to grow with the company I would have to go to Minnesota and I am not interested."
good,"i sold computers. laptop cleaning. sweeping, taking classes. talking to customers ding different things. meetings in the morning stating late. doing things"
good,"A very tight knit family and everyone is constantly learning."

good,"I've worked here for over a year, it's a fun, slow-paced environment and everyone seems to get a long really well. I don't have any complaints other than you're not allowed to leave early and the work-life balance sucks!"
good,Best Buy believes in the power of it's people and it shows in the benefits and training I get. Best Buy mostly promotes from within. This is also the most diversity friendly company I have worked for.
good,"Management is always friendly and extremely helpful, friendly co-workers /working environment , enjoyed going to work every day. Hardest part of the job is calling hot lines to open credit cards for customers when there is a really long line of customers waiting to checkout. I learned a lot working here , I was put in returns/exchange a handful of times , its very busy and fast paced, which is what i like , but if you're not used to it, you will get brain fried and tired quickly. Everyone is always willing to help one another out, couldn't stress more about how friendly everyone at this job is.... Pay is regular, but there are incentives which depend on the sales after the month is over. Nice to see that in your paycheck, makes you wanna work even harder.."
good,busy and fast past. I have learn that you should  get protection on all of your electronic devices. I think that some of the management there are very understanding when it comes down to family issues. Having to work every weakened. Helping Customer resolving there issue.

I never had any issues making sales because I had learned so much about the products and I excel at professionally conversing with people. My store manager made work feel like I was at home, and always had a way to make every task enjoyable, no matter how monotonous it could have been."
good,"The management and employees are all rally good about ""having fun while being the best"" I always looked forward to going to work everyday. It's very easy to learn something new as well as being able to move to a new department. The clientele can be a little irritable, but that is to be expected in a retail environment."

good,This job is a fun place to work. It is a good place for students because they are very flexible with hours. The downside is that management is very moody.
good,"A day usually involves the stating of a revenue goal and how to obtain it. Managers would get with each employee and discuss how they should clearly reach their individual goals. The culture of the workplace was very inviting, no single person was excluded in any way. The hardest part of this job is understanding every aspect of the store and how products should be marketed and or approached. I found that interacting with each customer, discussing the products they may be looking for and to find a solution suited to their needs."
good,Learned how to operate and connect new home theater systems with top brand products. I was able to meet new people everyday as a customer service representative.
good,"Best Buy is an amazing company to work for.  I know experiences vary from store to store, but I have had some awesome managers that facilitate growth and development.  I've learned a ton from them, and highly recommend the company.  Great experience."
good,Best buy gave shares of stock to all managerial positions as well as matching your 401k 100%. Fun atmosphere as well as the great amount of product knowledge we received from sales reps.

good,"Working for Geek Squad for the past 10 years had been great!  I have learned alot about technology and customer service, as in my position, I am a combination of both.  "
good,Best Buy is a great place to work as long as you know your stuff.  Even working in the back and being a stock clerk meant you had to know about the tech that was being sold.  Customers ask questions about gear to any employee they see.  One of the most difficult parts of the job were being overwhelmed by so many customers at once. (Try to imagine working at Best Buy on black Friday)

good,"Best Buy is great if you're looking for seasonal work, if you work hard and are willing to learn, there is room for advancement. Job culture is awesome and the environment is great."
good,"Great management"
good,"it's not life changing or anything like that to work for bestbuy, but it's definitely a good job with a healthy work environment and good relations with coworkers"
good,"This was only a part-time job for me evenings after high school, but all the employees were very friendly and appreciative.  It was obvious that everyone enjoyed their job.  It could have paid a little higher, however it was still above minimum wage."
good,Definitely suggest working during holiday season. Many wonderful people to meet as Co workers. You will learn a lot and maybe some stuff you didn't already know.
good,Personally my only problem with Best Buy is that the management was extremely slacking. They also pushed us too hard to get Best Buy credit card applications.
good,I loved working in this store. I had the most amazing management and the best coworkers out of any job I've ever had. The pay wasn't so great as I only made $10 an hour after almost 5 years of working there.

good,"Loved working here, had a great manager who saw my potential and challenged me and allowed to to blossom into a young leader. Pay was good, there was several opportunities for advancement. Only thing that was somethings unfortunate was company restructures, which I know happens to every company, but seemed to happen frequently at Best Buy. Culture was great, still friends with people from best buy several years later. Jerry Garcia from store 1079 in Temecula, CA was and is the BEST manager I have ever had in my life."
good,"Working at Best Buy was an experience I shall never forget. I worked in customer service as a customer service rep II where I opened the store alone and closed it alone. During the course a day I would verify the register and maintain the cash drawer while working with customers who came in to complain. The complaints were considered serious to the store thus my job was to make sure the customer leaves with a positive experience. To obtain this goal, I would sometimes have to assist the client in the realization of their responsibility in the process leading to the complaint. "
good,"The team there makes you want to be at work. The free coffee, and range of entertainment items from video games to ping pong and foosball make working here even more enjoyable. The pay is also fair for those who are full-time with the company. "
good,"A normal day working at Best buy would consist of down stocking and making everything look as neat as possible. "
good,"A typical day for me would consist of hard but enjoyable work, if you like the service industry. Every day at my job would be a learning day simply due to the nature of my job. Management at my particular location was very relaxed, they set expectations and very rarely micromanaged any situation. The overall culture was one hard work and fun as long as no work place politics were adopted. The hardest part of the job for some was avoiding work place politics. The most enjoyable was the friendships created between co-workers and even some customers."
good,The compensation was way above and beyond including the privilege to buy stocks. The code of ethics was always followed and here is where I was given the opportunity to learn about HR.
good,"Best Buy was a amazing place to work, the people I worked with were awesome and the customers that came in were just as great, I loved everything about being a sales consultant there."
good,"Typical day includes talking to clients about their issue and accurately troubleshooting. If device is checked in, diagnostics are started and repair work is done based on the results of the diagnostics. Geek Squad sells their services. I learned about technological devices and how to fix them. The majority of people that came would just need education on an issue. My location had an excellent manager. A manager is dedicated to geek squad team specifically. Culture is an important part of geek squad and they are a proud people for the most part. I loved my team and enjoyed coming to work every day because of them. I also learned a lot and took valuable skills with me."
good,"learning about new technology "
good,Definitely a great company to work for. I like the company innovative ways to push further and getting everyone on board.
good,I can't say anything but good things about Best Buy. I was here for about 3 years and I loved it. It's like everyone is family. The pay is great as well.
good,"love working there great team environment, great team leaders and you get a great opportunity to learn about all kinds of electrics.  part timer do not get a lot of hours with is good if your looking little hours and good discounts. one of my best jobs"
good,started with basic sales and advanced a few times into better sales positions. Great company to work for. Taught me very good sales experience(s). Bonuses are nice the better your role the better your bonus.
good,"Una empresa muy preocupada por el beneficio de los empleados, adicional excelente empresa"
good,Good place to work at. Management is really good and helpful. Interview process was a bit lengthy but overall quality place to work at.
good,"A typical day at work would just be getting to have great experiences with different types of customers and having some laughs with coworkers and management. Management is extremely awesome! If you need something, they will do their best to help you out. I think what the most enjoyable part of the job is just the environment itself. I have heard of people at other jobs just dreading what they do, but at Best Buy there is absolutely nothing to dread, except the occasional snobby customer and finding a way to meet quota when there are no customers in store."
good,"A typical day at work generally consisted of walking your [articular department and being readily available to answer the questions customers had considering certain merchandise they were interested in.  I learned a considerable amount of information about home theater electronics including TVs, stereos, soundbars, etc.  Management was always very helpful if I had a problem I was having difficulty getting through and they always stressed a fun, team environment.  The only hard part about the job was learning and recalling the electronics specifics when it came to being able to help customers get the right answers to their questions. The easiest part of the job was really being able to talk with other employees and getting help with whatever issue or problem I would run into."
good,I worked here for two years during my last year in high school and first year of college. Loved this job. Loved my co-workers. Honestly enjoyed the work. Great job for anybody looking for part-time or full-time work.

good,"Media Product Specialist-I work in the aisles of the Media section"
good,"Started Best Buy in 2015 and It has been a great place to work. Very hands-on environment. I've learned a lot within the company and the company also has great work culture and ethics. Management could be a little better, (depends on which store you are located at). Hardest part of the job is learning about all the new technology that comes out so fast and you have to be very up to speed on everything all the time."
good,Los valores son muy importantes y existe un clato interés en el empleado.
good,Aside from the countless phone calls and few issues the place was fun to work at and the management made it worth while. I would have loved to continue however there were changes that were not being made fast enough .

The management was amazing, encouraging, and very helpful to me especially since this was my first job out of high school. Co workers are welcoming, and also very helpful. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with difficult customers, but like I said, it never got too out of hand. The most enjoyable part of the job would definitely be working black friday.

This job has been incredibly beneficial for learning new things because I am a hands on learner and that is how things are done and how new things are learned is by trying them. Both management and co-workers are wonderful! There is an atmosphere of teamwork as well as trust and responsibility. The hardest part of the job, as with any IT job, is not taking client's frustrations personally. There will always be times that clients are upset or frustrated because their technology is not functioning properly and there are times when then take that out on us, however while that is difficult to do sometimes it has taught me how to better handle client frustrations as well as resolve them. The most enjoyable part of this job really is the team work.

I learned how to be a better leader and how to manage a larger budget than I was accustom to. The hardest part of my job is inspiring people who don't really want to be there. I learned that if you genuinely learn about the individual, you could explain how the job can actually benefit them.The most enjoyable part of the job is the privilege to interact with so many people on a daily basis. I also love teaching others everything I know from a leader stand point, as well as a co-worker."
good,"Best Buy was a friendly place to work and enjoyed working with my co workers.. I really loved going to work everyday, I enjoyed going to work and meeting new clients everyday..."

There seem to be fewer and fewer entry level places who will do that for you, so I am definitely proud to work for them."

good,"Best Buy has been one of the most enjoyable jobs. Being a sales associate isn't as easy at it sounds. Yes you sell whatever the customer wants but you always have to over sell to hit 100 percent at the end of the day. I work in the mobile department and on the regular bases most people are looking. If order to close a sale i have to acknowledge the customer, ask if they need help, if they have any questions, if they say no just looking give them some time to look and maybe couple minutes later go back to tell them the promotions that the store is running and ask to look up their account to see if they are eligible. "
good,Have nothing negative to say about Best Buy I only worked there for 2 Months for the holiday season.

We were encouraged to be the best we could be, and bring the pinnacle of retail performance to the table. Not all companies are created equal, and I learned that, after leaving this job, thinking I'd find something better. Best Buy is ran like a team, and had meetings for productivity boosts, and constantly had nice little extras for employees. To be truthful, my favorite managers were all at Best Buy. They would actually motivated me, and pick me up through the day, and work alongside me. The pool of co-workers was certainly a good one. Nobody ever really stood still, even if the store was slow. Customers were usually very happy working with us. Now, sometimes we needed it, because some of those TVs can be quite heavy. Still, it was all worth it to make the customer happy, and potentially see them again."

good,"This is a GREAT company and I would love to move up to an HR role in this company. The only reason that I don't think that I will be able to do this is that I have to be a store manage before I can move into a role in Human Resources and I would like to just continue to work in HR. The team that I work with is the best that I have worked for and I would recommend this company to anyone who likes retail and wants to LOVE to go into work everyday! This company does not have anything that is really hard to do, it is something that is easy and fun to go to everyday."

Co-workers were the best part about Best Buy, everyone is so nice and humble it's impossible to not love everybody.

I acted as a liason for the employees and corporate and assisted with day to day planning of sales goals.

good,"I had several positions thru the 8 years I was employeed with Best Buy.  I enjoyed all diffrent positions they were all new or diffrent expirences.  Shipping and recieving I was Supervisor of the dept. for a while because there was a restructure in the company so they removed the position.  This dept was new to me but if was fun to learn something diffrent, I had done shipping and recieving with Toy's R Us but the prosses was diffrent.  I wall ways make the best of things no matter the job description I get.  I was in Loss Prevention that was a totally new position, I thought I would not be able to perform at a high level of expectations but I was wrong.  I was rated the highest score in my evaluation then people that were already there for years.  I was awarded stocks with the company that only people with the highest evaluations could get per year.  That to me was the best recognition I could of recieved.  In Appliance dept. I learned how to sell and upgrade customers orders and add additional items and services to the order.  I always learn to work with change, change is good and also is learning. The only thing that I did not agree with was the way the system worked, you were not able to be evaluated a top score of 5 because there was always room for improvement "" "",  and a person could not earn more than a set rate for a position.  If you met that rate there was no more increase in pay for the rest of the years, unless you change depts. with a higher pay rate."

good,"Working at Best Buy was a busy but comfortable work environment. The training didn't prepare me for how much fun I was bound to have. I would say the management was serious but than again very friendly and open to any concerns or questions. I learned about the many different warranties that certain products come with. My co-workers were very friendly and knowledgeable about training materials and challenges that could come on the job. I'd say the hardest part of the job would be the closing out duties. Truth be told, I'd be super tired but would still like to stay. Closing out duties would be a challenge to someone who isn't looking to do manual work. It requires great memory and simple entry-level cleaning skills. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the co-workers and customers (that are friendly)."

good,A typical day at work starts at 8am when we get our schedules for the day. We then grab product that we will need for the day and precall all of our clients. Then we would type in the clients address into our gps and head to the client’s home. We do the install and move on to our next client for the day until the day is done. When we are finally back at our home stores we check emails from the day and send out helpful hints and tips to other installers. I learned how to mount a TV’s and speakers correctly and efficiently without having to fix any problems. My management team as well as my co-workers was great if I ever had a problem during the day I know that one of my co-workers had run into the same problem before and I knew that I could get it fixed and fast. The hardest part of my job was never knowing what the day would bring. I could be at work till 2pm and get off work or I could be off work at 10pm at night. The most enjoyable part of my job was setting up the equipment and seeing the smile on customer’s faces.

I could not of been more satisfied with any of the jobs I have ever held more than this one."
good,"Fast Passed, team driven, but mostly solo-ist mindset. Management is creative and is there to push you to meet goals. Teams are great and also peer to peer accountability. Overcoming clients attitudes who are already having a bad day is the hardest part of the job, but was the most enjoyable as well when you made that persons day. Working on computers and repairing them, while meeting the deadlines of turn time,"

We all worked as a team and made everyday an enjoyable day. Hardest part of the job would be when you first start the layout and learning where every single product is throughout the store, but as with all jobs I learned quickly. The most enjoyable part for me would be the face-to-face interactions with the customers."
good,Great people to work with. Normal 8hr days with some overtime
good,"Best Buy has an extremely friendly staff and a clean workplace. Managers know how to get messages across and accomplish this without rudeness of any sort. The only downside to the job is the extreme pushing of the Best Buy Credit Card and Geek Squad Virus Protection. If you don't sell credit cards or make sure that every customer gets their virus protection from Geek Squad, you may be terminated."
good,"A typical day at Best Buy would consist mostly of selling company merchandise and the more sold the better. I gained a vast amount of knowledge on product within my department not much cross training was required nor was there time to do so. Management would vary. There are so many different managers and leads within every store. Some more business minded than others and some more in tune with employees than others. Got along great with all employees in my department but very little interaction with those outside of my department except for in special occasions. The hardest part of the job was adjusting to the temperment of different managers and the constant changing of how the store, computer systems, and policies operated. The most enjoyable part of working for Best Buy was the interaction with customers and the freedom allowed on the sales floor to close the sale."
good,Best Buy was a great place to work. I learned how to talk with customers and truly understand their needs. My managers and always encouraged me to progress in what I did and to be proficient.

Coaching and training is what I've come to live for. Everyday is a new learning experience for me because hundreds of customers walk through best buys doors and each individual has their own needs. Business wise I have learned to manage multimillion dollar departments, from effective scheduling (holidays, black fridays, etc) to breaking down business numbers and finding opportunities as well as victories and setting plans for improvement. I do not find my job difficult. I enjoy what I do."

They actually want to know more about the products rather than simply selling whatever new product hits the shelves."

good,Loved my team and management. Really flexible schedules for college students. Great training and development within the company. Plenty of opportunities to grow.
good,"The management can be super great and are willing to help you grow in your department and willing teach you a different department knowledge. The hardest part can dealing with an issue or helping that you are not knowledgeable with. The best and easiest part is helping with solutions that is your area of expertise and are trained on, and being able to give them a great solution."
good,"Don’t have to say much, but every supervisor/manager at my location was extremely helpful and caring. Good, professional environment. Every place has its good and bad, but a lot of the time, the good makes the bad fade away. Never had too many bad experiences. It does get really stressful around Christmas time. Inventory is easy but physically demanding sometimes. Not bad compared to other warehouse work."

good,I was on the forklift in the shipping an receiving department clearing the trucks out sometime I'll load a truck if they need me to do it but most of the time I was loading the truck
good,"The time I spent at Best Buy is, to this day, my favorite work experience. The managers were involved and supportive of the employees, and I always felt comfortable approaching any of them. Everyone I worked with enjoyed their job, and I can't blame them; Best Buy has a reward system for stores that do well, and that system doesn't just reward management. Depending on how well the store is doing, every employee from management to hourly will get the same percent pay bonus, up to I believe 5%. A lot of employers like to say that their workplace is like ""one big family"", and ironically the first place that ever felt that way was the first place that never told me that. If I hadn't been seasonal, I would have stayed indefinitely."
good,"I didn't work at Best Buy for very long, but I can say that without a doubt in my mind it is the best job I have had so far.  Management was very supportive with getting me basic training before putting me fully on the floor.   On top of that, once I got on the floor all of my coworkers were amazing people; everyone was willing to help me, and each other, out however needed."
good,Best Buy is a fast-paced yet fun working environment. It allows you to grow as a worker and as well as a person. A relaxed yet efficient working environment.

good,"I got a job working as an MCSA/Customer service. It was a great job, decent pay, I learned alot about differenty types of tech. Sucked having to go in to work on Thanksgiving but sadly thats most retailers now. If they hadn't cut hours so much after the holidays for part timers I'd absolutely still be there. You do get pressured to sell their credit cards to customers but as long as you're making an effort you were ok. Also the discount was amazing. You only paid 5% above the cost of the item."

good,The management is very helpful whenever you need a hand. With work culture they take pride in helping clients and customers the technology that they are needing.
good,"I worked in different departments around the store, and it was a joy every day.  Dealing with happy customers and friendly staff makes even the most tedious of jobs enjoyable.  A typical day would go as follows: Arrive a little early before your scheduled time, if it was a Sunday we would have a meeting, when the meeting was over we would go to our departments, straighten up after the closing shifts/warehouse people have stocked the shelves, and prepare our sign in sheets as well as sales tools.  The daily grind of showing customers the value of certain items and why they need them over their current products are what sets us apart from most other major retailers.  A huge focus for BestBuy is the ability to clearly lay out and explain the differences in technology from old hardware to new, and to have the technical knowledge to back up their claims as well as solve issues/answer complicated integration questions from the customer.  Management overall is wonderful, especially the General Manager in the Wausau location.  The ""blue"" culture that BestBuy has is one of the best I have seen, making employees work together and not only growing the strength of the team inside of the building but making friends along the way.  The hardest part of the job is remembering that you have numbers to hit but also delivering the most positive customer experience possible.  It is easy to force sales, but to make the customer feel valued over used it hard especially these days.  The most enjoyable part of working at BestBuy has to be seeing you and your coworkers make so many people happy with"

Management at all the locations I have worked at have been kind and friendly helping push you towards your goals, which were hard but fair in most situations. "
good,Great and fun place to work. Very professional and allows you to advance and grow within the company. Provides you with adequate training. You meet a lot of new people everyday. Highly recommend!!
good,Hands down one of the best jobs I’ve ever had. Great environment and management as well as very relaxed. If you love technology you will love to work along side individuals who are also passionate about selling it.

good,"Gained invaluable experience:"
good,"Environment was friendly, fun and enthusiastic.  Never a dull moment.  We had trainings often to keep up with the new products that came in.  Pay was decent for minimum wage and was more in appliances."
good,"Love the work environment, I just wish that there were more hours to go around. Almost all of the positions are part-time and you have to meet your sales goals if you want good hours."
good,"On a typical day at work, it would consist of accurately communicating and helping several customers. I learned how to adapt and fix different/new work issues that occur. Like problems with ringing up an item. The most enjoyable part about the job was the coworkers around me. They were very nice and funny people and great workers."
good,Internship offered a lot of exposure and opportunities to network within the company. It is a great way to get your foot in the door with the company and learn more about a typical day in the life of a demand planner or forecaster.
good,"Hardest part of the job was juggling Geeksquad life with bestbuy life. I was responsible for not only my department, but as well as the departments all over the store. Most of the time the Store needed more attention and pulled me away from my Geeksquad department. The most enjoyable time I had was the people that came into the store and the people that I worked with. Work place culture is huge within bestbuy and would recommend any person to work there as a career or even a first job."
good,"Not a bad place to work, everyone is friendly and willing to help. Always a way to get way from your desk and reset if need be. I have been able to talk to other higher up and a get feedback to further my career."
good,My stay at Bestbuy was very brief but rewarding. I learned at great deal from and operational standpoint. I was presented with an opportunity to work in a different capacity for a different company which was more suitable for me at the time.
good,It was fun I got use to it real quick. The was a lot of things to do especially during peak season. It was definitely one of the better jobs Ive had in my resume.
good,"I'm a hard working person and would go above and beyond to get the job done. I love to train people to get the job done, and I would cover other departments while other manaement was out."
good,Working at Best Buy was always fun. Both as a Sales Associate and as an Asset Protection specialist. There was always something new to do. I found myself developing genuine relationships with regular customers and always found my interactions with new customers exciting and meaningful. The team atmosphere was amazing and we would regularly challenge and coach each other to be the best we could be at our respective positions.
good,very fast paced. the store id well renown and very busy. any given day someone can come into best buy and spend 500 to1000 . so you have to be very attentive and very knowledgeable. you can make or or break a sale.
good,It’s hard to advance only because no one ever wants to leave. Turnover only happens when associates stop showing up on time or get caught stealing which is just poor work ethics

good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Working in the computer section, it was always fun because it was an interest of mine. You got to talk to people about computers all day! Good hours, depending on management. Sometimes if you had a bad supervisor, they wouldn't schedule you any hours based on your sales, but still a generally good experience."
good,"I started my career with Best Buy as an Occasional Seasonal Computer/D.I. Salesman. Within 1 year I was able to work my way up to a full-time Advanced Repair Agent at Geek Squad. The environment is friendly and uplifting, my coworkers were well-informed and honest, the pay was based strictly on your experience and job title (fair for being inexperienced). This company has helped me with my education, experience, and market knowledge."
good,"Good place to work. I Work in warehouse department. I downstock, put truck away, change prices. I worked moring shift before the store opens. Was able to work by myself and listen to my music. Management are awesome there, they're  NOT breathing on your neck or constantly yelling at you like kther llaces i work. (Cough..mcdonalds.)"
good,I learned a lot at this position and was surrounded by encouraging management and fellow employees. Everyday working here was fun and satisfying. At best buy I didn't feel like a number but rather a contributing member of the team.

The hardest part of the job was working on Black Friday just because of all the business but that is also what made that weekend great."
good,I can’t say enough about what Best Buy has done for me personally. The company supports its employees and recognizes when someone puts in the extra effort. Retail can be a tricky business to work in but I think Best Buy does it the best.
good,"I worked as a Geek Squad Agent at the Opelika Best Buy. Never have i worked in such a chaotic yet organized  atmosphere that somehow works out and provided my daily routine with a new challenge to take on every day. I really enjoyed every one of my fellow employees who all provided something to the equation to ensure there was never a lack of knowledge. I absolutely loved every encounter with my clients, and i had the hardest part of the job there which included sometimes delivering bad news. I would highly recommend working for Best Buy if you're looking for a high functional job with an outstanding feeling at the end of the day."
good,"I had amazing managers and leadership in my store, they always helped me feel loved and like I was doing a good job, and they did their best to help me be successful and improve my skills. I learned how to talk to people strategically to help meet their needs and give them a great customer service experience so they want to return to the store."
good,Loved working there.  I would recommend to anyone.  Very friendly people.  Typical day is filled with standard working requirements with a few adhoc tasks that are always part of the job.  Managers truely support their employees.

Worked part-time at a big box store and enjoyed the environment, excellent co-workers and management team.  Worked full-time at a Best Buy Mobile store for nearly 2 years until the company decided to close all the SAS stores.  Enjoyed my time and experience gained and learned with Best Buy."
good,"As the operations manager at Best Buy you get training in all aspects of the running / owning a business. From daily operations, inventory control, sales, budgeting, payroll, schedules, P&L acumen, coaching and training. If you are good at your job you know more about the store than the GM."

good,"Coming to work was kind of the hard part since it was my first job but I got the hang of it. When meeting my team they were friendly and understanding from myself asking a lot of questions if i didn't have a clue how to do something. From the staff I talked a lot to them, It was weird since I'm usually shy. The coolest thing from working here is the free lunch we get from our manager. Working here for my first job was hard and stressful, but I learned how to work with it and get back on track."

good,"Working in Best Buy is enjoyable. Comfortable hours, energetic workforce, dedicated management and equally accommodating benefits. Management is always available to fulfill any needs or requests if in reason."
good,"In my opinion Best Buy is hands down the best retail place to work in comparison to the several others I've worked at in the past. Management takes time to train employees and focus on areas of improvement. Compensation starts fairly high and there are opportunities for higher rates depending on skill or experience. The company offers great benefits including tuition reimbursement, an amazing discount, and full coverage insurance. My only complaint would be that sometimes their approach to sales can be a bit persistent if not annoying. There are sales goals, but it isn't something that they will terminate for if you don't meet. Overall Best Buy definitely takes care of you for the little that they ask."
good,"Always loved working at Best Buy. It has been a number of years since I joined the company and I can say with 100% certainty that it has been a very pleasurable, respectful and professional experience."

good,Best Buy was a great place to work. The co workers were great. Mostly all management was great. The job kept you busy there were never times I felt alone and overwhelmed. I was never really stressed and managed to get all of my work done on time. I only hated working holidays and overnight then having to be back 4 in 4 hours after getting out.
good,"Working here was working with family, everyone gets along very well and constantly works as a team. Will work around your schedule to make it easy and convenient."
good,"working at best buy was a great experience, I don't think I can complain about anything when worked there, very professional work environment. A great place to start when looking for work experience"

good,"Bestbuy is a place where you can grow and lear to work as a team with other people. The benefits are amazing if you’re full time. For the part timers, Bestbuy will offer PTO for them."
good,Challenging and fast paced environment which focuses on having fun while being the best specialty retailer in its class. Strong direction is provided from company executives allowing for teams to achieve store goals.
good,"The hardest part about leaving was definitely the great management. They go above and beyond to make other happy! Pay is decent, it goes up over time as long as you meet targets."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Working at Bestbuy you get to learn your way around every single new piece of technology that hits the market. This type of knowledge made me very valuable to future employers.
good,"Best Buy is an enjoyable place to work at. As a merchandising specialist, you learn about not only the products and services that Best Buy provides, but also how the system works. You are responsible for putting together pieces of technology as in setting up displays and such."
good,"- Management, atleast at my location, has been very helpful and understanding of each individual's needs."
good,They have great options for health benefits and their pay is very competitive  for retail. It's a great place to work if you love technology. The discounts aren't bad either
good,"clock in,check appointments, call customers to get a better insight on the work that needs to be completed on their vehicle. then prep for the installation"
good,"a typical day at work day  consists of talking to customers, and offering our services, which could be product or financing. its a good experience for someone who is just starting."
good,"Fast paced workplace, but we work as a team. Working as a team helps us all out knowing we could ask each other for help to reach our goals. Very kind staff at every station."
good,"I was very happy at my job, but followed wife's career pursuits out of the state. I learned multitasking, triage and problem solving. It gave me a great opportunity to grow my communication skills and the management supported my career moves within the company."
good,"Smiled everyday leaving work"
good,Great place to work. Lead to many opportunities within the company to advance. Best Buy as a whole has allowed me to grow but the major setback for me was the non-commission based salary. Would have had a much better drive for the company if compensated with commission.
good,This was one of the best jobs I have ever had. If it wasn't for the conflicting schedules of school I would have stayed at this job alot longer than I did.
good,"Best Buy is a very relaxing place to work at. Everyone is friendly and the managers are always there to help whenever you need it. Everyone has something to do all the time but it is not fast paced, which means you can take your time to get things right or ask for help."
good,Really enjoyed my time working at Best Buy. Would recommend working in this job especially for anyone trying to get their foot in the door in technology. Got my first tech job working at Geek Squad.
good,This job was made absolutely amazing because of my managers. They can make or break a store and my managers totally made the store. If I could take my managers to my next job I would because they bend over backwards for their employees and are always there to help.
good,"This company takes a lot of time form your private life. However, the life that Best Buy creates is a positive and fun environment. Great place to work."
good,"Great place to work at overall, there was virtually nothing I could say was wrong working at best buy. My peers were kind and knowledgeable, my managers were flexible and understanding and really set an example."
good,"Work days were generally always busy. But overall, there's a lot to learn and we're encouraged to find the solution if we don't know the answer to a customer's question. Management was supportive and knowledgeable, if a little pushy. The best part of the job was really being able to take the time to help customers."
good,I love working with best buy. They really help their employees. Really great environment! Once you've proved your self you can get along with everyone.
good,The management team at my Best Buy is fantastic and that really makes a huge difference. Best Buy is a fantastic company but each store environment depends greatly upon its management team.
good,Left before but got hired back. Love the people and the atmosphere. Want full time. They train you to advance within the company and it is encouraged. As long as your good at sales like I am you can do a good job. My work is praised. Yesterday I worked 7 hours and got 16 protections from customers and today when I went in the manager congratulated me on my hard work on selling protection. As long as you work hard you will get recognition. Most cashiers on the front end don’t seem to know how to sell that much protection but if you know what your doing you can sell it.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I loved coming to work every day. It was a joyful experience to work there and with the people I did. The management did the best they could and the overall environment was very energetic.
good,I loved working here. Everyone I worked with is still like family. They really taught me a lot about customer service and to this day I use all of the skills I learned to thrive in my job.
good,"I worked for Mobile stores, Loved my work, my team and what e=we were doing. When I got the opportunity to switch to the big stores, I found I didn't love it anymore. Don't get me wrong, everyone was  overly helpful and nice, it just wasn't the same. I got a serious churn and burn feeling at the big store when at the small stores we could sit for a bit and educate our customers about their phones or sometimes their other tech. "
good,Everyone I worked with at Best Buy was a pleasure. Management was superb with going above and beyond for the customers and employees. I worked with Best Buy in South Carolina for 3 seasons during the holidays.
good,"It all depends on your management, but overall everyone around you will help you succeed. There is no real negatives about the job that I can think of but, this job was very enjoyable."
good,"The workplace culture in Best Buy is centered around the employee experience. I've never worked for a company that values the opinions of the employees so much. There is ample opportunity for growth within the company, and even training that can be used for advancement with another company. With the tuition reimbursement for both undergraduate and graduate studies, Best Buy gives you all the tools for success."
good,Hands down good company . If you want to grow you can learn from the people around you as well as through the training that they provide. Pay is great and benefits and bonuses are worth it if you do your part as a team when it come to hitting the goals needed to bonus.
good,No complaints. Working for Best Buy for almost 3 years was amazing. Great management and great opportunities to advance if you work hard. I became supervisor in 2 years but I worked hard and was advised on how to achieve my goals. Great place.
good,I enjoyed my time with Best Buy. Management helped me become a better employee. My coworkers made me feel welcome and help make my job easy. I received many bounces and raises based on my work.
good,"Dope vibes (i.e. it was a great experience, not only did the company provide a helpful amount of product knowledge they allowed the knowledge they taught internally to help promote within inspiring a healthy work culture.)"
good,Working at best buy was the most enjoyable job I have ever had. Every co-worker was like family and made a really enjoyable work environment. There was never a day I wished I was not working there
good,They have great training and a wonderful tuition reimbursement for college students that work full time. Working weekends was not my favorite but a compromise that was definitely worth it for all the perks of the job!
good,"My take on what makes a job a 'good job' especially for students/part-time or anyone who has not had a job before, is that it should teach you something. The reality is that you wont make a lot of money from a job like this. So, if you're not taking home the dollars what are you taking home from Best Buy. Well for one, a great employee discount ( the best tbh) and better social skills, the confidence to talk to anyone and the confidence to be able to deal with people, you also get the sense of how to run a successful business, how to handle money ( ive made sales upto and more than 45k). The most important thing you get from Best Buy are all the contacts you make with your customers. If the experience you provide your customer is good enough they will remember you and that is something extremely important in a city like Toronto."
good,"I help customers find a product that suits both their needs and wants through having a simple conversation with them. Through working at BestBuy, I developed skills such as active listening, selling, and customer service to improve my overall performance as an employee. I have found that a lot of the people that work there are easy to get along with, and that the management does care about the employees."
good,"Best buy is a good place to work the culture is driven to succeed with the customer is in the middle of that. Make them happy the company will do well. Train your people make them feel included they do a great job. Employee's feel like they belong to a team and they want to win for the company not because of the company. They put people in positions of leadership to foster growth and promote there people that work hard. It is driven by sales numbers but every company is some way, but you want to meet or exceed the goals based on leadership communication and understanding how to manage to each peoples strengths and weakness."
good,"If I were able to make 5x what I make there per year I would stay there forever. The company is great but it's no place to make a lot of money. Many years ago you used to receive commission so you could make over $50,000. Now you get paid hourly and get a small bonus each month if your store hits goals."
good,"I started in high school and left after I graduated college. Best Buy always worked around my availability of school even when I was full time working there. Solid pay, good PTO, and great work environment."
good,I loved Best Buy.  They will work with your schedule and always make sure you are properly trained to do your assigned job.  There is room for advancement whenever you are ready.
good,Muy dinamico  y retador siempre estas aprendiendo cosas nuevas.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I enjoy working at best buy because of its culture and the environment. It's like having a big family where you look out for each other and want nothing more for everyone to succeed. There are times when work is stressful when they only have a few employees opening or closing during a busy time. I work in the mobile department and if it can be overwhelming when I'm the only one there and I have a line. Overall, best buy is an awesome company and I would recommend friends to work here."
good,I have worked at Best Buy for many years and it has been a fun work environment to be apart of .  Management is easy to get along with and its a stress free work place. Have had many opportunities to advance and the process is fair and not based off of tenure.
good,"Best Buy is a wonderful place to gain work experience and to learn about the newest consumer technology. The company treats its employees exceptionally well and has a structure that rewards team effort. Starting at Best Buy as a college student was perfect for my schedule. If technology is a passion of yours, this is a wonderful place to meet like-minded people that share the same perspective on the way technology can be used to improve a person's day-to-day life."
good,I needed a part time job and this has turned out to be a great job. I'm now hoping to get a promotion and become full-time. Great benefits and discounts. I like the people I work with.
good,Best Buy was one of the best work environments I encountered. My coworkers were likeminded so there wasn't difficulty on the sales floor. I really enjoyed the freedom of interacting with multiple people throughout the day.
good,"Overall working at Best Buy was a experience filled with learning and sometimes even frustration.But, with all the lessons and information I have gained,there's not a bad thing that I can really take from it."

good,"Great development if you work with your leaders on it."
good,"when ultimate electronics filed bankruptcy best buy opened there door to me, it was a smooth change for me. the sad thing was there were no spiffs and no commission."
good,A full commission job and building a clientele is the way to drive sales. Very supporting managers to assist personal growth around sales skills and motivation. Great management program to learn how to become a manager.
good,"would   Definitely   Do this   Job again"
good,"I feel like I'm part of a family that strives to be better every day. It's a great place to start in retail, and it definitely opens doors to you constantly. I wouldn't be where I am without them giving me  opportunities and the resources to be the best in my team I can be. It's a great job!"
good,"Best Buy offers benefits to part time employees, they offer competitive wages, and an option for RRSP's. "
good,"This was a very fun job, management was very good and showing how to be better in every aspect of our job. Great interactions with customers, Super busy and never a dull moment."

good,"Bestbuy was fun to work at, they were really inclusive and challenging everyday. They took care of their employess, and fostered good values."

good,Great place to work. Felt like a family more then just a job. Management is active in helping you develop your career and helping you accomplish your goals
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Mi experiencia en best buy fué muy buena hay horarios flexibles te capacitan muy bien hay cursos constantes
good,Loved working here. Fair compensation for work and excellent benefits package. Great staff discount. My supervisor was really good at accommodating my scheduling needs.
good,"Great experience and homely atmosphere, As part of the sales consultant  team I work in keeping the store at corporate regulation or standard operating procedure, as long with my sale goal.  Testing for functionality on daily basis; products on display or company hardware. Procedures for functionality starts of by sales floor employees where level 1 troubleshooting occurs. If level 1 fails level 2/3 proceed where my team troubleshoots the problems in a more sophisticated manner, ranging from replacing parts to step-by-step instructions in troubleshooting by corporate via phone call. Managing interaction with customers and handling daily operations occurred often, customer always came first. Aiding customer with general questions over product, financing plans, and just friendly conversation as well helped me improve my customer service skills."
good,its past paced and very customer focused which is very good for a company that is retail you will learn alot working there which is good if you want it for a resume builder
good,Fun to work and no pressure! There is a lot of room for progression and I felt very valued and like an asset. They are also very flexible with the hours and there are lots of bonuses and perks for working there. I liked my time there a lot.
good,"The store I work at is usually pretty busy, but with my coworkers we laugh it off day after day. Work place motto is to ""Have fun, while being the best,"" which is something that they believe strongly in. Management is extremely fair and listens to their employees. The most enjoyable part of the job would be when I can see the big smile on someone's face when I can resolve their issue at the customer service desk. The hardest part of the job is possibly a tie between thinking up all the ways that you can go about to do something at the customer service desk, and when there is an irate customer who takes their anger out on you as if you are the whole company. Of course if you can't handle it you can get your manager."
good,"Best Buy is a great company with a fun and innovative culture. Management is constantly pushing you and your team to be your absolute best you could possibly be by providing you with the resources and tools needed to continuously improve and develop. There are tons of career advancement opportunities within the company for all different personality types. Overall, great company to work for."
good,"Depending how close it is to a holiday work can be very busy or very dull, in January after Christmas very little customers come in and a lot of the time is spent cleaning the store / recovering from the holidays. Management is very keen to point out when you aren't doing your job correctly."
good,"honestly best job ever...no matter which department you work in everyone is always happy, upbeat and ready to do there part ..always something new to learn about every day as tech grows."
good,Best Buy has core values that it believes in. Every interaction I've had with upper management has shown that their priority is the people in the company above all else.
good,"This was my first time working in retail and I was very impressed with how professional Best Buy is. It is a store that I have always loved shopping at, so I thought it would be a great seasonal job. While it was very stressful at times, the workers understood that I was a seasonal worker and new. They helped me learn about products and were always there if I had questions. Employees are great and overall the company is amazing!"

good,"I have had to leave the company on 2 accounts. First one was for a higher paying position working in the field of my degree, the second was because of relocation. I recently have been interviewing to go back because the benefits are superb, management is usually great, pay is okay but you have fun at work, discount is amazing, and on top of it all the latest and greatest technology. I held many roles and loved them all including the managers. If you really dig it in, you will move up. I see people posting they were a top performer, just because you can throw product out of the door doesn’t mean that it is a complete sale, and not returned. I have gotten many pay raises and after interviewing in a different area almost 1500 miles away, they are there with open arms to get me back “home”"
good,i am always 15 mins early i look at my jobs i have for the day i make my  precalls for the day making  sure they keep the appointment i collect my devices for the day have them checked out and run my route delivering and installing home theater equipment

good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I Provided Customer Services and It has been a great experience. As a seasonal I can’t complain. They offer basic training for you to get familiar with their system. Managers and team leads are pretty committed to the store and very helpful to their coworker. The hardest part of this job was being on your feet for a long period of time. The most fun part for me was interacting with customer and learning how to be better at my job.
good,"Meeting new customers everyday, and acknowledging those that have become loyal to your store and the company."
good,"Best Buy incarne une culture de travail exemplaire ou l'employer exerce ces taches et ces mission toute en s'amusant et étant les meilleurs."
good,best retailer to work for in town. They have a lot of fun. There is a lot of work required but totally worth it. Perfect job for teenagers and twenty-somethings.
good,"Best Buy was a good place to work when I was growing up. However, unless you're in actual Management, it's not an ideal place to have a full-time career. Great for when you're in high school or getting right now, maybe even during college to get some extra spending money."
good,"One of the best retail employers in this point in time. Managers are very welcoming, the whole staff is like a huge family to one another. I would recommend applying to anyone"
good,I have been an employee for 5 years trained in all 3 departments and will decide to move to another department for a different experience and we will see
good,i worked as a merchandising specialist. people were nice but the working hours for the position were inconvenient. break room was really nice. unfortunately you didnt get to spend much time in there

good,"Meetings happen everyday with the whole crew to discuses what needs to be improved, positive actions that happen in the work place and negative things that needs to be disguised."
good,"I've been working at Best Buy for over five years. During the past four years, I was also going to school full-time. Management was very understanding and supportive, and also very flexible with scheduling in order to ensure I could attend full-time classes while also working full-time hours. The environment can be competitive, but in a good way, where associates are encouraged to perform at their best. However, associates are not paid on commission, so the environment is not cutthroat. The benefits (for full-time associates) are very nice, and also include tuition reimbursement. Pay, from what I have seen, is typically well-above minimum, and even part-time associates can be scheduled for full-time hours if they consistently meet and exceed performance goals. Overall, I would consider Best Buy an excellent place  to work."
good,"Working for Geek Squad in Best Buy has honestly been the best computer and technology retail/repair job opportunity I've personally experienced outside of my major desired career. Although my preferences are set upon creative endeavors Geek Squad has allowed me to learn diagnostics, repairs and troubleshooting of computers and mobile technology without the schooling.  And the atmosphere and energy compared to past jobs has definitely made this environment a place I can come into each day, ready to tackle the next challenge."

The other great part of the job is that you can show customers what is truly capable of technology and how it fits into their lifestyle, great wow factor for customers."
good,Its a place you dont mind working. everyone partakes in clean and setup of the store. Very Healthy and friendly work place nobody will feel out of place.
good,"Hard work encoiraging environment, job advancement opportunities, schedule flexibility, constant training to keep up with new releases, takes care of their employees"

good,Great company to work for over the years. Can't be happier with what they have provided for my family and I. The job is what you make of it. It can be stressful if you are not a strong leader. You must be able to follow the plan and the plan will not fail you.

You get an experience with all different types of training wither that's retail, customer service, sales, management, and more. A type of day at work can vary. It can be slow or it can be very busy.  The hardest part of the job would be remembering all the skills you learn."

good,Best Buy Canada had one of the best cultures I had been a part of. They were a great company to work for in my early 20's and provided me with a solid base to start my sales career.
good,"I loved the place since the first day I started. Met wonderful coworkers and managers, even customer who remember me to this day. It was always a hassle during peak hours, but that was only time I really had a good time, even though I was just selling computers and accessories most of the time. The managers were awesome, I was able to meet them all and get along with them easily. They were always around when you needed them. The place was always booming with customers and some problems could occur, but the staff made it seem like an easy day in the end. The only hard part of the job that you would have to worry about is your revenue, but other than that, its a walk in the park. I guess I would say my most enjoyable part of the job was the rewards or parties we'll have after we real our goals. Game parties, pizza, stuff like that kept us going until our unfortunate closing. Overall, the experience was amazing."

good,"I worked for Best Buy for 18 years.  I loved it.  I am sure I would still be there if the company restructure we went through hadn't gotten to me.  I love the fact that I could use my influence to coach and train others to become better is sales, time management, and overall grow their interactions with other employees and guests."

good,"I started my career here as a sales consultant. Had a lot of fun there and loved the job. Loved the managers and the overall environment. However I left for what is called the Projects Team. The corporate engineering core essentially. I wanted to work with my hands more, and when I mentioned this to the GM, he immediately recommended me to the Project Team Manager. He was very supportive in advancing my career. Made continuing to work in the same store, but not /for/ the store a fun experience.

good,"I very much enjoyed my time at Best Buy (Winston-Salem, store 158). Management was great to work with and taught me a lot. They always had the best interest for both the store and the customer at heart. The only reason I gave ""job security/advancement"" four stars instead of 5 was because the people in leadership tend to stay there, so unless you're willing/able to relocate, the ability to move up can be a bit slow."

Through my job as a Multi-channel sales associate, I had to adapt quickly and efficiently to keep my title and boost productivity, all while being a friend of the customer. Answering phone calls, emails, and handling the customer service desk were all priorities for the position. On down time, towards the end of the night, I would help every other department with closing duties as well as keep up on my own closing procedures. I learned how to be everywhere at once while keeping composed, it was one of the most enjoyable jobs I have had because of the constant movement and adaptability."

If you need someone to cover your shift people are available. There are a lot of call off though. I work almost all of my off days because someone has called off.
good,Store management is well above par and results driven. An enjoyable work environment is sometimes over shadowed by a lack of available floor associates due to budgetary constraints. This is a diamond in the rough that deserves a more attractive and visual location.
good,I come in and fill out my daily goals and then go to work helping customers find and get what they need. My managers all push me towards working hard and my coworkers all help me when I need any advice on how to sell an item correctly. the hardest part of the job is probably dealing with customers who insist they are right and know the most about a product when they are completely wrong and won't admit to fault until a manager reiterates what an associate had just said. The most enjoyable part is learning of the new technology.

The hardest part of the job is trying to reach my revenue goal. We get a lot of foreign people which is why my job is fun because I get to learn about other people's culture and wheer they come from. Management is great, managers are always there to suport you and they have one on ones with you every week to talk about what you need to work on and how you need to do it."

good,"Working for Best Buy, usually I handled logistics and helped sales team find and locate items for incoming customers.  From Best Buy, I generated a overall learning experience in the field of all things technology and home.  Management helped in every process of any new or current employee, and they were willing to always go above and beyond. Hardest part of the job is selling a customer what they need rather than their wants. But, the most enjoyable times where the feed back from customers about their experience in our store."
good,"A typical day at worked involved attending to customers at the cash, showing customers that you are available, cleaning the workspace, and organizing cases by putting them in corresponding bins or putting empty ones in the back storage room.

On a daily bases I ensure to help customers find their every need and make sure they leave satisfied with their visit to our store.
good,"starting out in computer sales, non-commission, was very educational. I was trained and learned a lot about computers and the hardware behind the computers which were very different in each one in order to fit the needs of customers who were going to use them for certain reasons. the most difficult part of the job was just learning so much at once, one must definitely take their time with product knowledge or you could get all your PK all jumbled, but once you get the hang of it, you would be able to explain the specifications right off the top of your head when you approach a certain computer or device. what I enjoyed most was when I found the perfect product that best fit their needs at the right price."

good,"To start off, I will state what I simply do not like, not Best Buy in general, but with retail as a whole, Holidays are not the same for people who work retail, and everyone else. I have been with Best Buy for going on 7 years because, as much as I would love to spend the Holidays with my family, it is not that bad looking at what we reap. After being extensively trained by managers, supervisors, department leads, and even co-workers. Going into work for every shift today, the expectations are clear, and the tools to execute are always provided. I can not appreciate Best Buy enough, from my senior year in high school, to now my senior year at the university, they have always worked around my personal/school life, and have found support throughout this journey teaching me important values in the workforce today."

I have learned the ins and outs when it comes to cameras, gaming, home improvements, home entertainment, auto, mobile, customer service, and computers. The management at Best Buy was superb. When teamed with the best of the best, pun intended, our sales were always through the roof and you can assure we had the best customer service in the area. Everyone was truly a team at Best Buy. When the store finally shut down due to total elimination, every was in tears about it; yet, to this day, we are all still in touch a true family.

I take pride in my work, and feel good knowing I do a job. I have no management in the store, rather they are in other states and I communicate with them via email, various tools provided by Best Buy, and phone.

Our management could does their best to keep us motivated and current with our training around products and how to better assist customers.

good,"Working at the Geek Squad in Cherry hill was a memorable experience for sure. This store specifically is like being part of a huge family that all wants to succeed. Everyone was super friendly and welcoming and I miss them dearly even to this day. A typical day of work varied from being really slow with not a ton to do, other than baseline duties- to being non-stop busy and frustrated with the amount of people coming in. It was a good balance, though. I learned most everything I know about software and hardware troubleshooting working here- we were a group that succeed, and succeeded hard. Placing among top stores multiple times in my time there- to be a part of this group, meant to be a part of something bigger than the small store we were. The hardest part of the job was definitely just the sheer amount of people and dedicated time we would spend up front, troubleshooting, repairing and resolving. But in the same vein, it was the most enjoyable part- when you were able to get that one really tough issue resolved, there is no better feeling. Definitely recommend working at this store, and Best Buy in general. I loved my time there."

good,"Best Buy is an amazing company to work for. I can't speak for all stores, but the one I work for, in Farmington, NM, has the best leadership I've seen in a long time. The employees are always friendly and are more of a family than as co workers. The leadership is all about seeing their employees be successful and it's very common to see department supervisors and managers test employees on various subject matters concerning the company to ensure that they are on the path to success. Best Buy as a company sends all new sales agents for Best Buy specific sales training and are not commissioned based which allows sales reps to focus more on customer needs rather than their commission."

good,I absolutely loved workin for Best Buy. Everyone there is extremely passionate about technology and learning new things. Helping customers is a priority simply because the employees are excited about what they are selling. Everyone is hourly and does not make commission so you do t have to worry about getting forced into something that you don't want or need. The management staff are all just as passionate about the product and the company as the sales associates and that goes all the way up the ladder to at least territory level (which are the bosses of the regional) managers.

A normal day at Geek Squad can see heavy traffic with many people having Pc problems, they all come to Geek Squad with the expectation that we are knowledgeable and are more than capable of giving peace of mind about their electronic devices. When we are not solving problems for customer, we are the hands that guide a lot of sales for other departments, people trust what Geek Squad has to say.The hardest part of the job can often be living up to people expectations that we can do all to fix problems they may be having, when sometimes electronics just go bad over time and from wore and tear."

I learn time management and how to be well organized with this job. I've obtained an extreme amount of patience at this location. My coworkers are generous and easy going.

good,My managers always worked hard to keep the team where we needed to be. So far I've worked in two different locations three hours apart and what I have realized as a whole is CVS hires good people. There was no picking up behind others. Everyone had their own work to get done and we all worked hard to do it. I can't begin to explain how many times an unsatisfied customer came in from another store and how I (or a fellow employee) changed their whole view of CVS as a whole.
good,I had a lot of fun working at Best Buy. I enjoyed interacting with all types of customers and vendors. Working at Best Buy allows you to keep up with the latest technology.

good,Working for Best Buy was a very good experience of how to work on a fast paced area. When i applied i was considered for a seasonal job. The best part of working for the company was learning a little bit of the Portuguese language. Many of the customers were tourists and most of the came form Brazil. I consider myself as a fast learner thanks to my experience.

good,"I enjoy working for Best Buy. I meet a lot of customers, and I enjoy helping them find items they are looking for. Great team of people the Best Buy staff, and they are easy to get along with."
good,This company is very strong. I enjoyed working for a well accomplished company. the compensation was more than fair. overall experience helped me grow as a customer service associate.
good,"Typical day at work consisted of establishing a relationship with customers and finding out what they are interested in or looking to purchase in the store. I learned how to talk to customers with a good speaking voice. make sales, not be to pushy with customers that could cause to not want to buy and go somewhere else. Management was proud of the employees that worked for the company. My coworkers were not enemies on the sales floor we worked as a whole to hit goals. The hardest part of the job was not closing a big sale or having to let a customer go because they couldn't come to a decision. The most enjoyable part was the amount of effort the company puts in to the employees to better them with learning new products"

good,Working at best buy taught me and showed me the skills that i have and didnt know i have. I would say definitely the best job i have ever had .
good,a typical day or a customer service representative is normally busy. your day starts before you even clock in customers see a blue shirt and no mater in you are on the clock or not you are here to help them and that's all they know .my favorite customers are the ones that want you to do what ever they think of and in a timely manner. the fact that you need to know a minim of at-lease every thing in the store is a big burden but if u are willing to try to help the customer is more grateful then you just telling them you don't know.

good,"I really miss working at Best Buy.  I left because I was tired of giving up my holidays - especially when Black Friday started becoming Black Thursday and I had to leave my family on Thanksgiving at 3pm.  Sad to go, but glad to have my time back."
good,"On a typical day in the mobile phone department we deal with customers and finding the right solution for them. Not only do we find solutions for them, but we help them out with any questions or concerns they have about their device. We look up their account information and we see what plans would benefit them and what accessories would benefit the customer to give them a full solution. You learn a lot with the tools they give you in best buy most of the online trainings help you out as well. They also have reps there to help you with any questions or concerns. Management is big here they are so understanding and fair and will help you to do better at your job.

Although when things like that happen we get a manager and they take care of the situation.

good,"Productive and fun place to start working up in the computers field.  There is a set standard to how things will go.  The protocol is very clear and easy to understand.  Management may be a bit busy, but if you explain what is going on to them, they will be very understanding.  As with any place you work at, there will be hard workers who want to get things done right and at a good pace, and there will be a few lazy people who bring the team down.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with people who don't know whats going on with their computer that will blame you for it.  Additionally these people tend to change what the issue or problem is often in the same conversation and turn around and say you don't know what your talking about without letting you finish troubleshooting that particular issue.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the sense of teamwork.  The Geek Squad community is a friendly one that most people pride themselves in doing a good job, or are willing to learn how to do the job better."
good,During my time of employment with Best Buy I learned leadership skills as well as team work skills that are transferable from one job to another.
good,"Best job I've ever had. Such a positive workplace. Being exposed to the latest and greatest and being a hourly paid employee. You might have budgets and credit card benchmarks for the day but with those aside, your their for the customer and not to nickle and dime them. Oh and don't worry this company will train you in areas if you don't know them that well. I started in video games then I'm moved to cameras, mp3s, carfi, computers and even Geek Squad before I sadly had to move."

good,"•	Resolve customer issues, returns and exchanges"
good,"It's hard to find a better place to work than Best Buy.  I started out in Computing and DI selling computers and cameras, and loved every second of it.  Probably a month after I started, the company sent me to ""sales induction"" a training in which sales associates learn everything there is to know about sales.  Additionally, eLearnings were implemented, which is a great tool in knowing the products you're selling.  Overall, the past 7 months at Best Buy have been incredible, and I would highly recommend it."

I learned about all of the latest and greatest mobile devices and broadband services.The management at the store I worked at were team players who did not treat us as lower than them and treated us like we were a team and they were the coaches. The hardest part of the job was staying on top of all of the price changes and wireless plan changes. The most enjoyable part of the job was the team and how Best Buy treats their employees.
good,"Best buy is an excellent place to work,  I have learned so much from being apart of this team.  For example, customer service, everyday I work here I am problem solving and trying to find the best possible solution for my customers.  The management has coached me over the past five and a half years to know how to handle any situation that comes my way.  I work in the cell phone department and sign customers up/renew plans with three major cell phones carriers  and numerous pre-paid carriers.  When a customer walks in my main goal is to find them the perfect device to fit their needs within their budget.  After all of the open ended questions the most enjoyable part of my job is the end, seeing them happy with their new phone and grateful for my personalized time with them.  I just transferred to a new store in  NC and the team there is so inviting and friendly.  I feel like i joined their family in just three short months.  The hardest part of my job by far is trying to help customers who complete shut down on me and will not let me ask questions about their issue.  The only way i have learned to get through to them is to show them I care and not battle with them but kill them with kindness."

It's fast paced environment makes it delightful to work there and always keep you on your toes and excited. The customers are and a delight and make one feel useful because of their desire to be served. When a customer comes in to Best Buy, for whatever technological need, they require and desire knowledge and a service from us and, that, we are always welcome and happy to provide, so it's no surprise that there is a great deal of knowledge that is required to fulfill the commitments of this job, but Best Buy's wonderful training program always keeps one up to date and knowledgeable on each and every product within the store, whether your specific department or not. Not only can one look forward to coming to work everyday because they love what they do, but if ever one wanted to grow and progress within the company there is a lot of room for growth and progression, due to Best Buy's enlightening mentoring program that allows for tons of newer or lower ranked employees to train and progress to much higher levels of responsibility.

good,"I can list and be nit picky about certain aspects of my job I do not like, but at the end of the day this company stood by me and helped me get through Engineering School. Not only did they work around my schedule, but they also promoted me into a position of leadership. They trust me to run a 12 million dollar department that essentially keeps our store open. There are still a few lines of management that need be removed to make the Renew Blue plan work more efficiently. I think that the company as a whole has a sound initiative, but rarely do we get the whole thing once it hits store/line level. However, with that being said I can assert that I love coming to work. I find it challenging and rewarding as we strive to be the best. Not only has this job helped me create and master soft skills that I will use throughout life, but overall has empowered me to become a great manager."

good,"A typical day at Best Buy started with printing out any price changes on tags that were sent by corporate , then depending on what day it was I'd print out the price changes for a certain planogram ex. New Releases in music or media or special sales. Once printed , I'd check to see if new planograms needed to be set so I could take the products with me to the floor ( if not overstock ).  I'd clean the top and bottom of the shelves when needed . I learned I'm great at organizing product , making it look presentable and was very proud of my work because not many had the patience or skill to follow planograms. The people I worked with made me feel like it was a family and I was more than welcome to join it . The hardest part of the job was having to transfer due to financial issues and not having the same position available at my new location and the best was meeting such great people with different personalities but yet still shared similar qualities . I'll forever be grateful to have been hired and made lifelong friends."

The most enjoyable part about my job was just being at work everyone was always so happy and I always got along with everyone so no one felt the need to not like me."

My co-workers were also very caring and hardworking. We all learned to use our talents and capabilities so that we could handle the store and customers more effectively, and we all helped each other when we needed help.

The management allows the consultants who have shown interest in moving to management positions to train and/or coach other consultants to gain experience.

I didn't have any issues or problems with management or anyone for that matter.

good,"Working for Best Buy was an opportunity to develop personally as well as professionally. More than working as a manager at Best buy I miss my team. Couldn't ask for a better one. A culture was built from day one of the grand opening back in October of 2007 I took a strong part in recruiting, selecting and hiring. Maintaining expectations daily has been a challenge which made the position even more rewarding. If not for the current condition of the company and my husbands recent promotion and transfer to Washington I would still be with Best Buy. Coworkers, my peers, they were the best and doing their jobs very well. The most enjoyable part of the job, was the team. The company listens to the customers as well as the team members.
