bad,"This was the worst job I’ve ever had. There was no work to life balance. Management has the right to change your  schedule with no real notice. Upper management is quick to give you written warning without giving you a chance to fix your mistakes or learn what not to do. The training is worthless as you are constantly being left alone to figure things out for yourself, and if you did not figure it  the way they wanted, again you get a written warning.  The good people are quickly run off or find out this job is not worth the pay for the amount of work you do.  You get yearly pay increase unless like this last year they decide you need to be there for 5 years before getting a wage increase.  There is  no retirement or 401k.  Getting time off is not easy as coworkers are always calling in.  It is only worth applying here if you are on the verge of being homeless.  In my opinion worst place period."
bad,"not a good company to work for if you  are black i have white people coming in working for more pay than i get in nine years been treated unfairly. I have been made to go to a all white church i have got wrote up for things that the white people  get away with.I have been made to do two people jobs,that they get the white people help.I can go on and on but it is not going to change"
bad,"I despise going to work here everyday! They change the schedule without warning, expect waaaay more than what they should, ridiculously short staffed, and they are NOTORIOUS for signing the Individuals up for a bunch of activities that they have NO STAFF to get them to or help them complete. You are basically on your own. More often than not they expect ONE STAFF to run a house with 5-8 Individuals by themselves!NOBODY  KNOWS knows ANYTHING"
bad,Awful place to work. Claims to be a Christian company. Not at all. You may work great with staff but management works you crazy hours by yourself with a house of 6 maybe more clients. Work anywhere from 10-20 hrs. You can verbally express your needs and management will “sympathize” with you but they just say what you wanna hear. It’s really sad when a place can’t manage to keep people.
bad,This was the worse place I have ever worked at in my life besides the racist management and the lack of communication and care to individuals served. They had absolutely no self care for staff and individuals of whom were constantly put in uncomfortable positions. Pay was very low for tasked asked of employees. Overall very bad experience.
bad,"Want a job that can be taken away whenever? How about one that makes it very unclear how much you will be reimbursed for constant travel, gas and parking? Or maybe you just want a job that's all about lying directly to consumers faces? Then this is the job for you."
bad,Don’t waste your time unless you want to be undervalued and underpaid. Defining not worth it. It is not about the care of clients and those served. It’s about management drama
bad,"To much of a buddy system it's all about how good a supervisor likes you or dislikes you, should not be that way ,if someone works hard and is reliable"
bad,Management just sit at a desk and push off all there work ton to the supervisors. Nobody gets reprimanded for bad behavior. Once you quit working a bunch of overtime the managers will treat you badly. Management is 2 faced and does not care about their staff. They just want to make money.
bad,when I was sick in the hospital fighting for my life this company let me go while in the hospital. This company don't give staff enough information about the consumers
bad,Needs new managment and people that like to wprk and get along. Not a great place to work only there for residents............. ............ Horriable job training
bad,"work many hours with no help"
bad,"I have extensive management experience and yet I have never seen a show like Mosaic before.  "
bad,"Very unprofessional, fake, pay sucks for so much work to do."
bad,"they hire based on looks not experience. interviews are degrading, literally sending you on treasure hunts running around trying to get pics with passersby - basically harassing people. it's a popularity contest - super cringey. their staff is young and rude and obnoxious and dishonest; telling you they'll schedule you for jobs in your area- they don't - so after you cancel shifts for your other job you cant get to the ones they give you. Their ""marketing"" services = making nice power points to impress clients and thats pretty much it. "
bad,it was a fair place to work my reason for leaving was it was time to move on and I was going to get a better paid at my per diam job so i took a position at another job.
bad,"Avoid this company at all costs. Management does not care about employees. If there is a concern, do NOT bring it to HR.  HR will go to great lengths to protect the incompetent management. Superintendents and Supervisors are uneducated, they only have GED's and are in charge of extremely large hazardous chemical tanks in the Port of Tampa. They constantly put employees at risk, and it is only a matter of time before numerous people are injured or worse. AVOID AVOID AVOID"
bad,"I worked in assisting clients with their daily activities as well as assisting extracurricular activities. I learned to be attentive peoples needs and their level of communications. My days working had some stressful times due to the health physically/mentally issues involving the clients. I highly enjoyed doing special activities with the clients, such as shopping, going to the movies, having game nights, and just speaking with them and getting to know them individually."
bad,Poor management and operations. Significant pay gap between senior management and staff working with clients. Good employees leave as company continues to shrink.
bad,The management is not great there. They don't know how to run the company if it wasn't for the other mosaics nearby and other towns than they would have done went under my now
bad,"STAY AWAY!! this place is tremendously awful they don’t care about the staff or the individuals . Management sucks They will over work you nonstop because of the lack of staff, you get tricked into working shifts you had no clue you’ll have to work. There’s no  confidentiality with employees or clients everyone talks about everyone behind they back avoid this place like the plague they’ll get shut down soon"
bad,I enjoyed working for mosaic but I had no social life or anytime to myself. The management at mosaic is poor. Although I managed to get a very good manager so if you can get one then this job is very fulfilling if you can do this kind of work
bad,The individuals are so untrustworthy. They lie and don't do their work and say that you are doing your part. No to me but; to other and I felt very uncomfortable in my surroundings there.
bad,underpaid not appreciated this job consisted of lack of management as well as accpintability on all levels long days took a toll on the body mind and soul
bad,Promised me work then did not answer the phone. Cancelled other work so left me sitting at home. Avoided all my phone calls. Didn’t even have the courtesy to ring me and let me know
bad,I feel the company needs management that is willing to make things work more smoothly. Things are constantly changing in this field and management needs to find ways to make it work.
bad,The company didn't have a good management and also had communication between all uppers and other people who worked. They didn't pay well and employees were treated like dirt
bad,All employees are there for the individuals we support however management is very unethical and making the job increasingly harder to do. You feel so unsafe with all of the managers and you are just another employee to them.
bad,"As an employee for 6+ years, I was over worked, under appreciated, underpaid and never compensated. I worked hard and sacrificed time with my children because they could not get internal affairs in order and management could not get it together."
bad,This company should be shut down!!!!!! They treat the employees like scum. No one knows what the other is doing. Such a waste of time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,"Worked for the kcks location in day sevice for 14 months and was promoted to DSM for my hardwork and dedication. They started me at the beginning of the year in the office with a residential mgr and a coordinator training me. I was supposed to manage a group home small 3 residents and 6 staff, a good place for a new manager to start. Less than a month into my new position i was transferred back to day service without being fully trained to manage 40 clients, 6 staff with minimal help from the new coordinator. I was supposed to go out of town for a training and they canceled it. I was wrote up for performance and demoted less than a month later before even getting a chance to improve. It was demeaning to me to have to work with the very staff i managed and not all welcomed me with open arms. I had enough when my co worker showed me how they cut her time down to a straight 80 when i know she should have had more being i asked her to stay late some days to help out because we only had 3 staff and couldn't take lunch most days due to little staff. I worked hard for them everyday 2 years no vacation with 2 kids at home i was so drained i walked off. I felt used and was not given the chance or training i deserved. This is why turnover is high at this location."
bad,"The management was so uninvolved and didn't care about their employees in the least bit. The pay was absolutely horrible. "
bad,"This company is horrible.  They lie to families & people with disabilities just to get them to live there.  During interviews the Director promises them the world and NEVER delivers!  She will say stuff like they do all this fun stuff all the time but IT'S NOT TRUE!  The Director will say they will go to the movies, shopping, bowling and even say they go to Dallas Cowboys games that has literally happened once.  The people with disabilites just end up sitting in their house doing nothing everyday and go to bed at 7pm.  The Director will turn on you if something goes wrong when the DADS comes.  She will also encourage falsying documents.  By far the WORST part is the DIRECTOR!  This is a FAITH BASED ORGANIZATION yet she had the worst temper I have ever seen.  She was even so mean & ugly to a few families and they took their kids out of the program and she would blame them leaving on them not her.  She would yell and curse all the time!  She would play favorites and give special attention to certain people.  This lady TRULY had no life of her own!  She would constantly text you everyday, night, weekends and even while your on vacation and get mad if you dont reply.  If you go to work here say goodbye to your personal life.  Basically do not go to work in LUBBOCK TEXAS.  THE DIRECTOR IS HORRIBLE AND SHE WILL MAKE YOUR LIFE MISERABLE.  SHE IS A MEAN WOMAN."
bad,"Sad to see a place that promises to make a difference in the lives of others have so little respect for clients, guardians or staff. Falsifying records as to what the clients actually receive in daily programs. . Due to short staffing will hire anyone with a pulse. MANY staff ignore clients and sit around on there cell phones. Make a complaint and expect subtle retaliation from management"
bad,"I like work with the people trying to help learn was really funny and helpful. I learned to be patient with each individual and continued to gain knowledge. I did get alone with all my co-workers, however Mosaic did have a problem with the hiring process because of people not knowing about us. We usually hired people who, didn't care about the person just the money. This was hard because people would come to work late and you'd ended up stay they until they arrive or you end up covering they shift. Mosaic didn't have plan for this at all."
bad,"These guys are NOT organized, they are NOT friendly to new hires, they screw up your pay on a REGULAR BASIS."
bad,"If you want to work in a place with no direction, no structure and poor leadership, this is the perfect place to work. Bathrooms are horrible and nasty. There is no accountability and colleagues take credit for other colleagues work. If you put in 100%, you'd be lucky to get 30% back. Don't believe in the motto, ""Invest in our people"", not true. Don't believe the previous posts, thats HR trying to lure you in, just contact an employee off of Linkedin, past or present. People are leaving left and right, Enterprise, Network and especially security is falling apart, they will be leveraging a MSSP shortly."
bad,I left within a month because I was given the dirty work like I was the only one capable of it. I Learned very little new things about the industry.
bad,no tengo mucho que decir de este trabajo ya que fue algo esporádico lo que si puedo decir que es un trabajo duro y agotador
bad,"I had the pleasure of ""advancing"" up the chain of responsibility within Mosaic after only a month of work. Basically I went from stocking shelves at a large retailer to telling people how to stock shelves. I was disgusted at the treatment of low level workers. Other management staff engaged in the practice of firing individuals for reasons that were personal or arbitrary in nature regardless of the individuals ability to perform assigned work. Wouldn't recommend this organization to anyone looking for work."
bad,Mosaic is a very professionally run 3rd party company. They take great care in making sure that client expectations are met and exceeded as their marketing activities are carried out by the merchandising specialists in the retail stores.
bad,"I have worked for mosaic Denver office.... do not work for them, management is pretty much inexistent. The R.N. never answers her emergency phone when calling regarding medical questions. What is worse, because management doesn t do their job to 'manage' and give ok's the workers get in trouble and written up for every thing....."
bad,Winfield mosaic was and has to be the worse job ever. No communication. No Leadership. Individuals are left in soaked chairs while others are allowed to threaten and steal from staff. An absolute nightmare
bad,"I started at mosaic in 2016. Fresh out of high school. Thought it was gonna be the best thing ever. And for a tiny bit, it was. But once they realized how easily Incan be pushed around, I was pushed to do things I wasn't comfortable with on day 1. The management is very poor. And the pay isn't amazing either no caregiver for the intellectually disabled is paied enough. You did get an annual raise, but it is barely noticeable. Hours are long, and your relief could not show up and you be stuck there for an overnight if you work day shifts. And it also depends on what individuals you work with. Some can be easy as pie, others can give you a run for your money. It's sad to see it Ben g such an understaffed feild, but it's difficult to keep staffing if you treat them poorly and don't pay enough for the craziness we deal with on a daily basis."
bad,"Management is horrible. They lay people off for no reason. For them being a ""Christian"" organization they sure treat their employees horrible. Don't work for this company. Go somewhere else!"
bad,love being round the disable women in the house always laughter cooking washing hardest part being away from my family on the weekend 12 hour shifts taking them to our house for hoildays when they didn't go home
bad,Doesn't care about employees. Work too many hours. To much responsibility and not enough money for the job. Claims to be a Christian organization but really isn't
bad,Not a good place to start.long hours bad on your health not a family oriented work place a lot of back stabbing going on no type of job advancement unless you have a family in upper management.
bad,Manager that oversees her houses is a bully and likes to threaten your job. Used to enjoy my job the lack of leadership and cometary is very bad. The individuals that I serve are total assist and the management team never listens to the staff that work and take care of them everyday. Basically management doesn't back up staff at all.
bad,"The ability to work with individuals and watch them advance and grow in their lives is an amazing gift. To see the progress an individual makes while under your care is awe inspiring."
bad,Over worked and under paid. The only thing that kept me here so long was my love for the residents who lived there. The house managers were on call after hours and had to cover overnight shifts. One time I worked for 26 hours straight.
bad,Poor Management and leadership skills that did not assist me in furthering my education in this field as I had hoped to. Poor leaders with clients
bad,"This job is not easy. The clients WILL try your patience and if you don't have the right kind of team backing you it can make your work life exhausting. They have a high turn over rate and are always hiring people. I went through 7 managers in 5 years,"
bad,"Over the course of my career at Mosaic I was fortunate to have participated and led projects that I may not have at other employers.  When I started my career there weren't many other people in my field, so I was often the default ""go-to guy"".  This made for many opportunities that I capitalized on."
bad,"Please, please do not waste your time here. There is no training, there are cliques, it is junior high all over again. Management is a joke. They are not trained in management, they think intimidation is management. Good managers build a team and train people for a common purpose. That does NOT happen here. There WILL be constant turnover until this place closes its doors. Writing up people and firing them are skill sets that are considered good work. Whatever you do will never be good enough, and they take advantage of your genuine desire to help the individuals. What a sad, sad testimony to a place that could be great. If you enjoy high stress for low pay, with the writing on the wall of getting fired down the road, this is the place for you. Unethical billing practices too. I would not put my loved one at Mosaic."
bad,"Work/life balance: not great. They expect you to spend a surprising amount of time off the clock fighting with their multiple websites, which don't work well with each other, or in one case even on its own. Managers are expected to be reachable even on their days off to help other employees. "
bad,"Mosaic is a faith based non-profit agency that talks a lot about values and the mission. As an employee, you will see a lot of things that should not be happening but the culture is to ignore it or cover it up. "
bad,"Management gave no direction, no proper training and forces people out who disagree with them. CFO and several VPs left the company. They layed off over 100 employees for greed purposes"
bad,Was a wonderful work place before affiliation with Mossic in 2012.  Lacks apprecitation of staff and the knowledge they have.   Staff with 30+ years of dedication in various positions were eliminated..........putting added responsibilities on already over worked staff.
bad,"Management and H.R. automatically believes anything that the Supervisors and A or B Operator's tell them, they will make up lies to get you fired if you stand up for yourself in any kind of way, they basically want robots working for them not humans, they literally will ask you to break their own safety rules, then get mad and target you if you refuse to do so. And what makes it worse is the lower class employees that work there, they will break the rules when asked to do so, then get fired themselves if caught, because the Supervisors or Operators will deny saying that they told them to do the act. Now the higher ups still have their jobs, but the material handlers are left looking for work. It's a evil place to work, and human resources does nothing to them when reported. Safety isn't a concern of theirs at all, until they hear that Florida reps are coming, then they want everyone to put on a show until they leave."
bad,Mosaic is a rewarding job at times however all other aspects of the job are terrible. They do mandatory 8hours overtime and don't tell you about it in the beginning and then get on your butt about not having at least 48+hours a week. They expect you to come in no matter what when someone calls in instead of management getting on the floor and actually working. They expect you to work all the time not caring about people with families. They hound you to pick up hours no matter if you already have 50+ a week. If you intend to have a life out of work don't apply. Don't get me started on management. If you apply for management you basically live at mosaic. My boss was always at work and never got time with her family because management above her would hound her in to work while they only work their 8 hours a day 5 days a week and nothing more. The pay  and rewarding feeling of the job are the only benefits. You acquire a lot of pto with working so much but they make you feel guilty so you don't use it. They do raises ever year however they are so little that to make up to a dollar raise you have to be there for many years. Raises are 10 cents if you're lucky.
bad,I loved this job at first but over the years I worked there it changed. Work load trippled but pay never changed. No management support or backing. Tired of being abused by the stores you merchandised
bad,"I thought this job was average for the field, until I worked somewhere else afterwards. The training program is a joke - Everything is just videos - You get a book to do all of your own training based on forms, with nobody to ask questions of. You never see nursing staff, even if individuals are sick. I saw them once for training, and that was it. "
bad,MOSAIC is funded by government and every year they layoff many teachers based on what they want. They need to be more fare to new teachers and stop laying off and hiring its own teachers again!
bad,"Want to know the truth of this company? You will work many long hard hours and be unappreciated for it. You will never get off on time and have to let management know when there is a blip in the schedule (ie: no one scheduled for the beginning of the next shift). Because management is too stupid to pay attention to that sort of thing when making the schedule. Management doesn’t care about you or you having a family. They don’t know their individuals and don’t properly train you and then tell their supervisor that they did. And you are cannon fodder, if anything goes wrong for any reason you will Be managements patsy so the higher ups don’t have to explain to DIA that they just don’t want to be bothered taking the steps to hear or investigate for the full story. So if you want to have people beat the snot out of you daily as you change them, feed them,clean their house,be under appreciated management and in general treated like mud by them then go for it."
bad,"Lack of job growth, no raises, no 401-k, short term or long term disability offered. Can be very cut throat among staff in the group home. Company does not give any incentives to stay."
bad,"I used to work from 08:00 am to 2:00 pm,  for 5 days a week."
bad,"Although I enjoyed helping out the clients. The managers I worked with didn't have my back or show concern for the problems I brought up to them. When I was 9 months pregnant they had me lifting way passed the weight limit my doctors ordered and I even gave them a doctors note. Also, the managers didn't listen to what you had to say about what a client likes or dislikes, even though we spend time with them on a daily basis. Also, one of the HR specialist person messed up on my hiring paperwork and she would take a long time to return your call or email if she even contacted you back at all. When you would take clients to their appointments they would put the address down and not do any further explaining; almost like you knew where you were going even though it was different people taking clients to appointments that they may have regularly or once a year. If you were to work holidays they wouldn't pay you time and a half and if you got a bonus it was a little one. You don't get hardly half of what you put into your job. Also, the pay isn't the greatest either."
bad,I did not like this job. I worked with mentally handicapped and they were very mean
bad,"I really loved working for Mosaic as a B.A. and Promo Model, and was very excited when I was promoted to a Coordinator. "
bad,i helped with mentally handicapped people
bad,Not in a position to do this. Gained alot of knowledge and experience through the years. Connected with lots of other employees and made some life long friends
bad,I would spend my day caring for individuals with special needs. Some days they could be violent and others could be mild. I learned to stay out of the violent ones way. If not how to smooth them over. Management didn't help the situation. The work place was cutthroat and most of the staff did as little as possible.
bad,"This job is extremely hands on with its care needs and it can be very stressful and overwhelming. The culture is very negative and sometimes it can make you feel trapped, like your job life is going nowhere. They don't usually give out promotions or increase pay raises which does not help for the cost of living situation."
bad,"I was eager to work here due to ""Christian values"" however I found that in the Waco, Texas site these values are far from expressed. In Waco there's a Day Habilitation center, foster care, and residential group homes. The Day Habilitation center has a very poor staff to client ratio, often times not the ratio they claim to hold to and be licensed for. It's not uncommon to walk in and see 20 clients to one staff because of a shortage of staff. The clients are supposed to have hourly engagement, but whenever I have walked in there on any given day the low functioning clients are farthest from the staff and only the higher level have interaction. I also find that the level of disrespect from the staff to the clients and to other staff not of  their own nationality is just unreal. I was in a training once and all that was said back to the trainer was complete disrespect and rude comments. As a DSA, my experience has been very frustrating. I was trained by someone who did not do anything she was supposed to, expectations for all shifts were not clearly laid out, and there was no teamwork from shift to shift. It was not uncommon for the night shift to do a no-call/no show and management all lives 30+ minutes away, so if you're at work you're stuck for a long time or if you live in town you WILL be called/texted/emailed OFTEN. If you don't respond to interactions on your day off, you get a firm talking to. Also, it is not uncommon to have to transport/supervise clients from other houses that you have never interacted with or be trained on appropriately. It is also common to be expected"
bad,i believe this was one of the worse places I've worked in my entire life. the location i worked at didn't know how to speak to people. she didn't give me the opportunity to learn what i needed to learn. she made it hard to succeed in that location. if i was moved to another location i believe i would have been able to make it further but the higher manager wouldn't let that happen.
bad,"Mosaic was not my cup of tea, I found it difficult to work for Mosaic after 35 years with their competitor. A typical day include getting outside equipment readings, unloading chemical trucks, keep a running inventory of chemicals, filling out log sheets and making plant adjustments as necessary. The heat in the summer was probably the hardest hurdle to overcome, temperatures inside of the vessels were extremely high. There was no enjoyable part of the job!"
bad,"Making meals, passing medication, going on activities, helping with everyday things such as personal care and feedings."
bad,"Worst company for a female. They try to encourage females in the workforce but it’s all a ruse. It’s really about the leadership in the department. They are trying to get more women in the engineer field in leadership roles so much that they are hurting themselves. At Fishhawk, no matter how qualified and talented you are, you will not be promoted unless you are a white male. It’s really sad because they have lost so much good talent."
bad,Wouldn't recommend to anyone because the have lost common sense and don't let you do your job that your trained on to many managers and policies are constantly changing and different managers also
bad,"Working with Mosaic Solutions Inc , is fun challenging , great  to work with host team in making my job interesting. Trying new foods and new ideal inventions."
bad,Its a good compant to work for the pay is great with awsome benifits but the managment is very awful there the managment has no employee relations or courtesy at all
bad,I had high hopes for Mosaic. While there are many training opportunities much of the training does not help you in your daily functions. There is lack of oversight and support from the main office.
bad,This job is not the job for you if you are looking to start a career. when i worked her it was only for a short period of time but i did get paided $15 an hour so that was a plus.
bad,"I worked at Mosaic for four years as a senior manager and found the wages and benefits second to none. They needed to be however because they were culturally disadvantaged owing to a mismatch of two or three previous organization styles. To a person, the non union workers were terrorized by the falling price of potash and their American overlords. Union workers were just fine as they hardly noticed the succession of corporate take-overs. It is easy to get on at Mosaic because of their horrendous labour practices (high turn-over) but no matter what you do - do not buy a house unless you are a unionized worker."
bad,"Mosaic grew significantly.  It began to operate like a big corporation. This change resulted in valuing benchmark achievements rather than people. Staff's voices were no longer valued.  When staff voiced concern for the lack of manpower to achieve the benchmarks plus ensure the safety and well being of people served, their voices went unheard placing people (both people served and staff) in jeopardy."
bad,"Amazing clients! They really impact you life in many positive ways. Work day consists of making sure all clients are kept up on being fresh, getting clients to appointments and things they need to go to. Make sure housecleaning duties are being kept up on. Learn how to take care of each individual and each disorder and how their lives work. Management didn't work together in anything. Communication was horrible. There was no positive reinforcement. Co-workers for the most part were amazing, you pick and choose your battles with others. Hardest part of the job is watching other co-workers neglect the cares/wants/needs of the clients. I enjoyed making the clients happy with fun things to do with them, doing activities such as cleaning and things they need to learn themselves to do, taking them on outings, making them smile."
bad,"Good pay,  senior management forced to make cold hearted decisions because of bad business  moves to protect themselves from shareholder pressure which makes site management look bad when they really do care about the employees."
bad,You have to go to different locations wearing your uniform and set up a table with your merchandise and sell them to the customers. Sometimes you have to make food and hand out samples and other times you just hand out coupons. You can also hand out samples of Liqour. It was very minimal work for minimal hours. Management was spread to thin and only sometimes came to see you.
bad,Just very petty people. The office people were stuck up and my direct boss was a creep. It was just an uncomfortable place to work for so little of money.
bad,"My managers were great. Two of the best of have had in my life. Other upper management had no skills, handling people, organizational, or any aspect to running a business.  There is no discussion with the direct support associates on how to improve the culture, working hours, or retaining staff."
bad,The job was rewarding for the clients they were great to work with but towards staff the management don't care they fire you for anything friends and myself or fired for nothing
bad,I loved working with the clients and being able to take clients to outings. Helping them with their daily life. Making sure all needs are meant and taking care of.
bad,"I was on production @Mosaic for approx. 25 years before getting my hoisting ticket I enjoyed the underground world while I was there but enjoy the hoist position even more. A typical day on the hoist is doing your daily checks on the hoist with the shaft crew or electricians, Lowering material underground. My co-worker are great and I also have a great boss too. Hardest part is not see the people you working  with and going with the signals and bell system but learning that skill is great"
bad,"Workers make a typical day stressful."
bad,"It’s a good job knowing you are helping the residents! Management is horrible and a joke!! Seems everyone is related  or know each other in one way or another."
bad,"Mosaic only hires people from out of area while local hardworking sober people struggled to get jobs in which they either are ignored, rejected or discriminated.  This is not good for the local economy as people who grew up in the area and are rejected are forced to move elsewhere to feel accepted by other mining companies and others.  If Mosaic wanted to support local businesses, schools, and organizations, but don’t want to hire locally, then the area will need to build new schools, businesses and organizations that do not need support from Mosaic."
bad,the management wasn't very good their was more favoritism going on you never could hardly take your personal time off they always tell you not enough workers you never get your PTO because you are always at your max
bad,"Management is uncooperative, completely jacked hours. Will put down for hours you didn't agree to. Work conditions are unbearable. You get paid to get beat by individuals."
bad,Love residents. But management requires you to work without any breaks and is always way understaffed which leaves residents with poor care regardless how hard and devoted staff work.
bad,"This organization is in dire need of a rebuild. From the director down. The organization is stuck in a field of groupthink and the person who is making all of the decisions has no clue about residential treatment services. I have never worked for a company in my life that is in such dispair. While working here I began to feel bad for the individuals who were in their care. Anytime a company is receiving anywhere from 80-120,000 a year to take care if an individual they should receive more than 50 dollars a month to attend to all of there needs. The lies that are told and the way that they hide when the state is coming in to check things is hillarious. Maybe if the state came without giving warning then they would see how the clients, as well as employees, are treated. For this reason alone, there turnover rate is higher than call centers and there arent enough managers to manage the homes. This leads to burn out and individuals who are qualified to leave the organization. You can’t tell the director or associate director anything innovative to do to help the organization. They ask for ideas, but nothing is never used unless it benefits them directly. Stay away from this pit."
bad,I was sent over 20 miles to essex yesterday with the promise of 4 weeks painting work. On arrival the foreman said hed asked for labourers not painters and sent me home. The agent refused to cover my days wage that i lossed....not to mention the petrol costs. With it being so close to christmas and having a newborn child this was quite a knockback. Very disappointing and quite devastating
bad,I feel that they are more focused on making money even though they are a non profit. There isn't any team work involved and as an employee you feel like you're doing everything on your own without any support.
bad,Excellent work place environment. Everyone works together as a team great support system.
bad,Loved working for the individuals but just the office and management that make it hard to work. No overtime given at all unless it benefits the management
bad,the general manager bought him self a $3000.00 dollar desk while we  all took a pay cut. not impressed with their work ethics
bad,"Waco Tx Mosaic Administration staff unprofessional, inconsiderate of clients and staff. Supervisor never has answers to your questions. Over worked and understaffed. Not a good company to work for."
bad,Just a very   un communication through the company they do not tell u stuff and when they answer your questions its to late   you have already done it the wrong way
bad,"It seemed okay at first, then the culture became where everyone was trying to get each other in trouble. Then after that.. it just went downhill. Wouldn't really recommend working here."
bad,"I worked shift work. It was 3 on and 3 off year round. we worked 12 hour shifts. I learned to move up you had to be very involved with the work and always be learning new things. The management was ok , very shady and not always on your side. The work place was ok but very dangerous . It was very hard trying to teach yourself the jobs because they didn't have a very good program for teaching . Meeting new people was the most enjoyable part."
bad,"Liked working with people that have disabilities reach their personal potential.  A typical day would be starting their morning routine in a timely manner.  I learned that no two days are alike, to be flexible and be able to adapt to change.  Management wasn't always there on a daily basis to assist.  The hardest part of the job is to be flexible and adapt to not having enough staff.  The most enjoyable part of the job is to see the clients smile"
bad,"The company overall stands with their values. They do what’s best for the clients overall. There are always staffing issues and some staff that work for the company don’t belong in this field. Pay rate sucks, no raise and the medical packets sucks."
bad,"I prefer not to give a review on Mosaic. I do apologize for my shortness, however this was  not an organized work environment and there was always entirely too much drama in the homes among the so called ""Team Leads"" and other staff."
bad,"Just don't. It will be weeks or months or years of your life you can't get back. Management is backstabbing, gossipy, play favorites and only care about money. Hypocritical for a ""Christian"" non-profit. Go somewhere else before you invest yourself in this company."
bad,"Not cut throat but very ""learn at your pace"" type of thing.  But if you take too long , they pass you on and let other people qualify in front of you."
bad,Mosaic is truly a good place to work if you like making a difference in people's lives however management could get better and you are under paid you are also asked to work a bunch of overtime and you only get one day off a week if you work full time
bad,"The company spends frivolous money on some things and is cheap with others.  The people at the agency are laidback, the people in management are somewhat standoffish."
bad,not very competent managers. managers are unable and incompetent at the job they are asking staff to do. they do shady things and dont mind if a staff gets stuck at work by themselves.
bad,"This is not the place to work if you value your family, friends and anything other than work. You're paid fairly well and expected to work a minimum of 10 hours a day (doesn't seem like that much) but you take your work home with you 24/7. Expected to answer phone calls, emails, on call rotation constantly without compensation."
bad,"There is poor management, high stress environment even for residents, staff provoking resident behaviors and no consequences for such offenses. High turnover"
bad,Manage various complex tasks for various business processes and perform various audits and provide training to all staff members and develop and maintain effective relations with all individuals and provide required support for same.
bad,"Mosaic is good for one thing only, CPR and First aid certifying it's workers in the first two weeks of work. After then, the job becomes a fight. A fight to keep the job and keep work/home life separated. Management will pick favorites and then try to get the ones they don't like fired."
bad,"If you make waves and report anything, they find a reason to fire you. There's no point in following the chain of command if you have an issue either. Management sticks together to cover their own butts and there's a lot of racism towards people of color. There are like 2 people in management that are great people but everyone else will try to start an issue with you to get you fired and will celebrate when your gone."
bad,"Mosaic has a super high staffing turnover rate, they keep on staff who are rough with the clients and don’t actually care about their wellbeing, these people are just there for the paycheck"
bad,First working there was bearable HR departments at employer was professional she tried to ensure i was trained and qualified. The supervisor had one priority and it was her favorite employees if you had a complaint or discrepancy she didn't want to hear your side of the details i worked hard to please management there were no complements always negative feedback and was told to do the task thatt was far fetched for your job
bad,"The agency is in a challenging position and they need to reflect how they intend to change to make it a positive, thriving agency again. The work life balance needs some work to ensure employees remain supported and positive, the morale has dropped as of late due to many changes."
bad,Pay employees more as you decide to increase the workload. Give more incentives to sell and discounts on the product we're selling to employees also!!
bad,"I love that I'm here for the individuals and get to be part of their day to day life you really build a connection with great people. I have met some great co-workers but unfortunately management overlooks all the efforts and constantly put you down and their are too many areas they expect you to work on and acomplish in a work day. If you're working with lazy coworkers you end up doing double the work and management is untrustworthy to report to because they make matters worse for you including throwing you under the bus or make their bosses think you're the problem. DSA's do the majority of the work and are completely replaceable and management makes generic compliments and are very fake. They go back on their word all the time. This would be an amazing place to work for if the stood by their values. They don't think you should have a life outside of work and schedule mandatory meetings outside of your work schedule you are required to attend and if you can't make it don't be surprised if you get yelled at or receive an angry text message. They expect you to follow all the rules but they go against policy all the time.  Communication is terrible and they have many ""misunderstandings"" they threaten you with write ups to control you. They also don't have very many desirable opportunities to move up. This job can drain you and take over your life if you let it."
bad,"3rd party marketing company with little or no contact with their employees. Employees were managed by a constantly rotating carousel of Best Buy retail managers and Samsung Executives."
bad,"As contract jobs go, do not expect job security. Mosaic makes it clear that everyone ""Mosaic"" is separate from the client, regardless of what may be said about seamless integration of teams. Mosaic management who has moved to CA from WA needs training on Leadership, especially coaching, direction, interviews, inspiring others, and supporting the team so that it can be the best representation of the company."
bad,"No job work/life balance. "
bad,"Working there has been the worse experience, under staff and as the Manager, I had to fill in and that meant that I worked 7 days a week and being on-call 24 hours a day. I did not have a home life and failed my first two semesters at school because of it. I had to make a decision to leave in order to succeed in my studies."
bad,"I believe I came in on the downside of things. My hiring manager and his seasoned trainer were both terminated within my first two weeks of employment. Training for me was difficult and sporadic as to all my coworkers were worried about there future employment. The ones that were training me within my first two months of employment, had either left the company or transferred to different locations and job tittles. Only the few narcissist long term employees that stayed behind automatically became my supervisor and Lead tech to me. These people were only left in our smaller group of Techs. With no one to turn to because of mass management lay offs, these people made my daily job very difficult to do. I come to find out that my Supervisor wanted me to transfer to a lower paying unskilled position to get his buddy to take my position in under him. This whole place is a very good ole boy, backstabbing, with a strong click environment that I was soon to find out and made it very difficult for me. They started putting task onto me that I wasn't trained for or hired to do. Shortly after the write ups started against me by my Supervisor as to fabricated a lack of job performance. I called corporate, and being such a large company, and also being in Minnesota, they really didn't want to bother with my situation as they had bigger things to worry about. Within four months my supervisor decided after work to follow him to the main HR building were the local HR and him Terminated me on false accusations that mostly I couldn't prove. The ones I could prove, they just came up with a excuse"
bad,"It is about who your relationship is with, and also if you are a yes man!! Management didn’t give you the correct tools to be able to complete your job."
bad,"I originally loved my work there, but I eventually began to dread going to work. Little support from management and poor communication made it like heck."
bad,"Mosaic was tough to work for. my workday varied a lot: whether I was at the woodshop or the store. in my interview I told them I was Autistic and slightly disabled, but I guess they completely forgot because their expectations were higher than they should've been. plus they don't believe you when someone accuses you of slacking off. one of the clients accused me of watching tv in the back when I was supposed to be working and their wasn't even a tv back there!"
bad,"This agency only cares about the $$. They don’t care about the staff and if you somehow you have made them mad, they will make your life living you know what.  I don’t really think upper management or corporate knows anything about the clients or remembers that is the business they are there for.  I would never leave a loved one in their care!!"
bad,Mosaic lacks communication to staff. They over work there staff except them to put in a 123 hours and most are doing over 130 hours in a two week period or better cause if you say no they have some one else ask you. If you do not the have bad attitude toward you and will make it hard for you to work in there environment.
bad,It was horrible you having patient hitting on you and spitting. I feel as the pay it should be more because of what the employees are going through with the patient.
bad,I enjoyed the people I worked with. Management was not very good over all. Advancement was not an option because they all were related and only advanced there own family. The pay was also horrible. I only made 8.84 an hr. even with all my experience I do have.
bad,"Although it was nice working with the clients, it was the staff who were unwilling to assist each other. There was always someone calling in and making the job harder for everyone else. There was little team work"
bad,"Short staffed, Unable to keep help, high turnover, uneven enforcement of rules for different people. Managers lacking ""people skills"". Punitive instead of supportive."
bad,They gave me no training. Every time I asked for training they said sure and then nothing happened. No work life balance. People were very over worked. I would never work for this company again.
bad,"Originally hired on as a part time Walmart video game representative, Mosaic eventually was bought out and merged with another company, thereby allowing the Mosaic division growth with more clients."
bad,The best thing is working with the clients. The bad thing is the drama and back stabbing among the employers. They're rude and talk about making accommodation but they don't. You can only look out for yourself.
bad,"Spend your mornings assisting individuals with hygiene, meds, meals, and transportation. Afternoons, take one individual into the community to mingle before picking up individuals who were dropped off in the morning at ""day program"" sites. Once back at the individuals' residence, complete paperwork for your shift."
bad,"setting up table and ready to promote product sampling"
bad,You got called in on your days off. Not enough staff to take care of all the clients. The pay was very low for the work we did. Had to work every holiday. Had to work double shifts all the time.
bad,This was the most horrible work experience ever in my life. There was very poor communication in all directions; lots of back stabbing by employees; also employees collaborating to get anyone they did not personally out of their job. Much overtime and weekends were 14 hour days
bad,"poor training with management, had to learn everything on my own. Upper management did not help out as much as they should have. Staffing issues all the time. "
bad,"Mosaic is a decent place to work if you like working 50+ hours a week without overtime compensation. They promise raises and bonuses, but never follow through on issuing them."
bad,"I enjoyed working here, we helped clients clean churches and our center for their job. In addition we gave meds, did a lot of problem-solving, production work, crafts, attending meetings I worked in the center, and residential."
bad,Management was awful
bad,I felt that the company was very unorganized. I had several issues with poor professionalism. I had a lot of my information told to people that  wasn't supposed to be told.
bad,"I loved the clients and loved the love that everyone had for the clients, the office was very unorganized and the people in some of the houses work in a heirarchy when really they had the same position as you"
bad,"I was happy to spend 9 years working for them."
bad,"Assisting 5 mental challenged clients, supervision of 7 Direct Care Worker. Making sure that everyone made to their worksite.  Financial responsibilities for each client"
bad,"The company is highly competitive with the classic, central-Florida good ol' boy syndrome. If you want to learn the complexities of corporate culture, mixed with highly-polarized union/management dynamics, this is a great place to find it! Advancement is slow and very cookie-cutter. Not a lot of room  for new ideas, or creative, out-of-the-box thinking."
bad,"A typical day at work for me always consisted of talking with management and sales associates. Signage was always to be put up in the store, whether it was for Straight Talk, Xbox or Playstation. That was just part of what I did for the company."
bad,Mosaic is not a equal opportunity employer. The company runs on favoritism and allows bullying and inappropriate behaviors.
bad,"Lots of talent in this organization and there were moments when I really liked working there."
bad,"Co-workers are great, customers can be a bit difficult at times."
bad,management don't work with worker communication needs improvement the worker are great not much more to say.over the years learn what to do an not to do.
bad,"Mosaic has all the ingredients to be a great, successful company with happy employees.  The down side is that several of the ingredients are rotten - you can’t create a successful meal with rotten ingredients and you won’t have a successful company using them either.  "
bad,"Okay company to work for, depends on who you work under and around. Communication and consistency is not so well on their end. Also depending on the reasons above it can feel like a family"
bad,The hours are never consistent.. your always being asked to pick up shifts but your not allowed to go in over time. You are assigned a main house yet when your asked to pick shifts up they aren't in the house your assigned
bad,I have learned through this time is how precious and special life really is. I have learned that even though I may struggle there are so many people who have it worse than us. I have learned how hard it is on our special needs individuals but how they keep a smile on their face. How much they truly appreciate the things my coworkers and I have done for them.
bad,Very disorganized. Lack of needed supplies. I have nothing more to say. Yet this keeps telling me to write more. Too many chiefs and not enough indians.
bad,"I did progress my career, however I found that there was an underlying culture that was impenetrable, and did not fit in with my ethos as a care giver."
bad,"While it still might not be the most lucrative salary out there, for entry level employee's the $70,000 plus can be enticing. I've found myself stuck in a miserable, and cliquey town, refusing to settle down. The 2 year waiting period to become vested in order to withdraw my entire compensation in retirement savings will keep me locked in until then, as well as signing bonuses and employee incentive plan. I ask myself every day whether its worth it to be miserable."
bad,"I worked hard to try and make my stores look m=nice and have product out. The trouble was communication was non existent and I had a boss who would email at least 10 times a day. She wanted everyone answered this was supposed to be a two day a week job she wanted this as our life. Unfortunately this led me to resigning especially when i was asked to lie say a product was put out when the store never even received the merchandise , Also the fact that I was in trouble for missing work when my daughter appendix burst family comes first especially emergency surgery in an 11 year old."
bad,"I no longer fit in this organization.  I am looking for a job that appreciates the work that is done and focuses on positives.  I am very open to constructive criticism as that is what allows me to grow and become a more effective employee.  When supervisors resort to name calling and refuse to listen to answers to questions they asked, I knew I no longer was a member of the team."
bad,"Without the money this place is not a good place to work "
bad,"Management is not the best, but working with the clients is wonderful! You take people out and take care of them in their home as a group. There is usually 2 sides of the home with people on each side with different levels of assistance."
bad,"Leadership lacking."
bad,"I am a recruiter responsible for matching candidates to a temporary or permanent position. My role is to use sales, business development and marketing techniques and networking. I also brief candidate with salary and benefits. I also go through company policies to ensure effectiveness."
bad,"Extremely heavy safety culture, hot, nasty, and dangerous work. Extreme  vapors and fumes. Lots and lots of paperwork. Hard to advance. And as I said in the header a part of a machine that can be changed at any time. They have a pattern of plant closures so be aware that if they so choose you could be out of a job in the blink of an eye. Absolutely devastating."
bad,"Needs to take care of there people better. More training, more mentoring and better overall environment. create more opportunities for growth within the organization."
bad,The amount of work to be performed is very stressful. Management aren't willing to help when we are short staffed. The pay is very low for the workload given.
bad,It was fun to work with the individuals and get to know them and  help them.  The management isn't good due to such a bad turnover rate and lack of experience on their part.  They want you to work in different locations without the proper training.  What is good for the goose isn't necessarily good enough for the gander for this company.
bad,"Not afraid to spend money on the wrong things, dead set against spending it on the right things."
bad,"Tuesday is Launch day when new games come out and it's necessary to be certain they are out, displayed for purchase with all the proper signage. Sometimes, it is necessary to have a midnite visit on Monday night to be certain it's available at 12:01 on that specific Tuesday. My Thursday visits are called Maintenance where it's ensured that the product is truly available for the public to purchase."
bad,Great guys working here. They will help keep you safe and learn your job. Management at corporate level are secretive and vindictive. On site it gets better down to front line Supervisors who work hard to help you succeed.
bad,"Very understaffed, when calling off sick if even in hospital you were to find a replacement body, or show up  out for the company only, not employees."
bad,"working in the care field . you will be fully trained for your position before be left on your own . paid training and and easygoing work enviroment. managers and trainers want you to succeed, and love your job."
bad,They expect too much of staff. What used to require eight staff is being done with four these days. Staff are overworked and underpaid. Call ins for illness are frowned upon (even if contagious) and you have to make up the call in on your next day off.
bad,Good job for helping those in need. Haven't worked there in years so I do not know how things have changed. When i was there I loved my clients and my coworkers. We ran a good house.
bad,Nothing to say about the place except for our department is getting cut due to technology and administration pushing us out the door. Nothing good to say really.
bad,"Mosaic was very unorganized in terms of contact with the stores they were promoting in, making it very difficult to find the product cart needed to create the display. One of the times I worked, the store did not even carry the product I was meant to promote that day. It is just an unorganized operation."
bad,"It was a fun work place the people are nice and seem to know what to do around there.  They need to work on their training program a little more, but they were a good group of people to work with."
bad,The Company have great opportunity if one has a Good Manager and not bias of High on this horse because he /she has excellent stock options and tenure in company. Lies and distrust between Management and low levels. Dishonesty when filling out paper work for Plant nudge numbers and roundabout to  get numbers for recommendations. Plenty of hours available to be worked great Pay and benefits only if u don't work three yrs the company takes back it 401 contribution on ur behave. Those Managers that are less than 66% like by subordinates usually use HR to weave employers out that stand up to their harassment and intimidations. No doubt great Christmas Parties no bonus if you are on bad terms with supervisor. Manager look away or acts if problems don't exist in certain departments.
bad,My role id SAP SD in the company
good,the perks are great if you are okay with doing nothing but work and see no family or friends. it is a fun place to work but really busy and kindof stressful. alot of management is immature
good,my day would be get in my car and drive all over to make sure that the stores had all the up dated information needed.
good,"When i started there. Training was easy and so were the surveys. My manager was awesome to have, very accommodating with me. Then she quit and the manager that took over was a nightmare. She was very unprofessional, took shift from me when i wanted to work a better job. She was the reason i quit. This company also has no health and safety training and no way to report injuries."
good,"love working with the clients, so many management changes in a short amount of time.  Mission is amazing and I’ve met some amazing people and have learned so many things from the clients."
good,"Worked here going on  7 years and have only ever received 1 pay raise 4 years ago. It's not somewhere you want to work long term, there is little to no advancement available and when it becomes available you are passed over, instead of training up one of their own they hire from outside, even though they say they prefer to promote from within."
good,"A typical day at work is very slow. "
good,"Has a large turnover for group homes, management is very bias no team players. favoritism is really shown, working with special need clients ,working and helping those who need special attention."
good,"Management was very disorganized, but that came from the Home Office. Policies would change from week to week. Hard to know if you were following the correct procedure."
good,Good company to get experience. Treat their employees very badly and don't pay good at all. Most of the time they will put you on contracts so they don't have to pay for your benefits. You work 24h/7 and you're never able to disconnect.
good,"there are a lot of staff that are there just for the pay check - even though it's not a lot.  But will sit on their butt and play on their computer, phone, or read their bible instead of giving a single drop "
good,A typical day at work involved being completely alert and ready to handle the day as each day varied as we provided services to individuals with aggressive behavior. I learned how to manage and handle the behaviors that was displayed by a few clients. I also learned how to effectively meet each clients needs. Management were not always on the same page and it seemed that management sometimes stepped on each others toes. But managers did listen to the concerns of employees and tried to provide support. I had a great experience with my co-workers and we all worked well as a team. The hardest part of the job was always being on your feet moving constantly. The best part of the job was being able to make a difference in these individual lives.
good,it was a great experience working with the people we serve. but there was no culture and no communication between management and staff. other than that it was great the people we served were  amazing.
good,Mosaic is a good place to build relationships and grow with the DD field. It is difficult to be there at times due to staff culture being overruled by people not willing to help. The mission is great but what happens behind closed doors is not what is to be expected in the service provider world.
good,"I had a lot of responsibilities as a manager, and it was nearly impossible to get it all done on time.  There was no positive feedback from upper management."
good,"As host home provider it was great pay, but there was very limited opportunity to get anyone to do respite for me if I had an emergency or some trip I wanted to take. time off was difficult to get."
good,good honest hard work people are some of the best in there fields tight net group long hours underground and the uswa is strong and stand for the worker
good,Loved serving the clients but just got to hard working 7 days a week 100 plus hours every 2 weeks.
good,"They keep moving people around, and confusing employee's."
good,"If you want to make money, then this is the place for you. But, if you want a life and make money, then this isn’t the place for you. You live here!!!"
good,"Helping those to maintain a clean home. Helping clients with showers, laundry, cooking and cleaning their home. Ensuring safety within the home, as well as outside of the home. Learned how to administer medication and reading proper doses. Regulated daily diets for different ones. Management started off well, but declined due to lack of communication. The workplace was laid-back. Always enjoyed working with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was trying to persuade adult clients into doing something the did not want to do. The best part was building those relationships with everyone."
good,Clients are fun and loving staff play a great deal in keeping the house managed very well.Its a fufilling position to help make a persons life easier and see them grow stronger in self independence
good,"Part-time workers get no benefits at all."
good,A lot has changed at Mosaic over the last eleven years of my employment there. I feel that the company isn't going to be around much longer if they keep treating their long-term employees the way that they do.
good,"Very detailed work. Enjoyable."
good,Part-Time work is ok at best. Inconsistent hours and work schedule. Flexible but tedious.
good,"i cooked , cleaned, santitized the home "
good,Mosaic was a good company except for the evil Program Coordinator
good,This is not my line of work.I'am looking for a job not having to work nights and weekends and holidays.
good,You have to have adequate time management skills and be able to be flexible for the schedule. Maintain calm composure and be able to handle behaviors.
good,"I loved working with the Clients, overall the company has no room for promotion. Staff, is not compassionate enough towards the clients needs... Some are insensitive."
good,"Hard to advance due to the number of people at the level above you, good learning experience to get management experience but the hourly work force runs rampant over front line supervisors."
good,"I was responsible for 3 men.  The expectations from management were impossible to uphold.  I enjoyed where I was placed, I got along with the clients.  I had difficulty with documentation and did not feel my issues were properly handled."
good,different job categories of jobs positions available at different locations that allows you to adapt to new work environments and trainings traveling may also be included
good,You have a high stress day of caring for individuals with disabilities and the off chance that you are put in a high behavior home you have the 'opportunity' to be abused by the clients and their are no repercussions to them for their actions. If you are put in a low behavior you will have a much better work experience. There is such a lack of staff that your hours are never what they are supposed to be. In all honesty for the amount of work and mental stress we are to put up with in this line of work the pay is insufficient to say the least.
good,"Work was overly easy, but long hours away from home. Some team leads were awesome, some were degrading and ignorant creating a hostile work environment."
good,"did not work here for long. It was a little boring and not much to the job. However, the money was very good and the scheduling was also a dream"
good,"Great place to work, management may be good or bad depending on the type of manager you have. Great opportunities for growth in the company."
good,"At Mosaic, there are absolutely no benefits. The pay is terrible and the job kills your car as it demands a lot of kilometers on your car every year."
good,"Picked up clients from Dayhab and or work, Assisted clients with medications, cooking meal, classes, light house keeping, evening daily skills. Enjoyed working with MHMR clients and my coworkers."
good,"The clients that I worked with needed a voice to express themselves. As a Direct support staff, I was able to be that voice for them. I would assist them in getting dress, eating, and meeting their daily activities. The biggest joy for me was when they were expressing their personalities through their hobbies, and their daily habits. For instance, this elderly woman, she enjoyed being in her wheel-chair, and listening to music, this made her smiled a lot!"
good,"The concept was good, set up and serve customers samples of products.. except when there were no products to demo, rude store employees, dirty and dusty storage areas, unclean demo tables and improperly trained new hires."
good,It is a fast paced warehouse job. Shipping and receiving order selecting grief product. Cleaning marking metal. In plant delivery and general warehouse duties
good,"First thing to do is to establish priorities, then from there you can make sure what needs to be accomplish that day, including time to  learn something new.  What brings me satisfaction is to know I was able to resolved any issue making sure I made someone else job easier."
good,Good job and pay for the work you do. Poor management and lack of job security.  Keep buying more and more stuff overseas leading me to believe that is the future for them.  History of buying facilities and then a few years later laying off or shutting the facility down.
good,"Good employees providing necessary services, but no business leadership or real leaders for the future. Executive positions are like a revolving door."
good,"Really not a terrible place to work, but no room what so ever for advancement probably the worst workplace environment imaginable. Great guys on shift but lazy. Job security always on your mind"
good,This company has potential to be great. They have an important mission and great products that will undoubtedly help the world grow the food it needs.
good,"ok company, HR is a disaster. little to no room to grow unless you have ""connections"" constant fire fighting.. no training program for engineers."
good,"FOM's seem like they changed every month. No consistency and too many people to have to answer to. Last FOM was not comfortable to address issues with and did not support employees, also lied about why I was pulled from program. I worked for Samsung in Best Buy, LOVED  my job and did very well at it. Just like any other Temp agency, you are expendable for any reason. Market manager on latter half of employment was non existent, pretentious, and wasn't comfortable to address issues with . Redundant mandatory conference calls every single week and one person in control of it couldn't speak proper English and gave false info about products. Beware"
good,"A typical day is getting on the road and visiting a structured predetermined set of customers. You job is to convince store owners to sell more of your product then the competition. "
good,You get to meet very special clients and learn to understand thier needs you become more then a provider they become part of your family
good,"Utilizamos o díalogo de segurança diário, conheci os procedimentos de segurança para trabalhos e contaminação ambiental."
good,It's expected that you work long hours and get no comp time. The clients are fun to work with. A very good learning experinece and the Executive Director is a wealth of knowledge.
good,"Wasn’t a bad company but never know when they will close the doors"
good,"Office buildings, network systems and business processes are a bit antiquated. New software programs and processes are being implemented to modernize and establish greater efficiency and catch up to other Fortune 500 companies. After a recent renovation to their major offices, the floor still shakes when someone walks by giving the impression it may collapse one day. Several of the windows on the outside of the building have unexpectedly cracked for no reason other than structural issues."
good,It is a cut throat culture at Mosaic. The company has shown that it does not care about the workers there. They rather take care of there stock holders than there employees
good,I really enjoyed working with the different individuals and different disabilities mental or physical. providing places they can go and have friends and places that they can work. I usually worked alone in the group home setting but management would not step up and do what they needed to do to make things run smoothly
good,I’d say the working environment is a challenge working with adults with intellectual disabilities. They are the best part about the job. Management is not so good. Lack of connection between them and no sense of communication. Raises were coming until out of the blue money was lost so everyone was stuck at a certain pay rate. Working beyond your scheduled hours is common most times you won’t get off on time
good,Too many management changes which also means changes in styles of supervision. Many incidents of workers being let go as one manager didn't like how they were doing their job or thought it was being done poorly and did not take the time to work with you to make changes.
good,The best part of this job is that you meet outstanding people and have the opportunity to build lasting friendships. This industry in general does not pay well and this company is no exception to the rule. You have to love what you do. Don't expect to be able to make a decent material living from this line of work.
good,"At Mosaic, you are there to better the lives of individuals who are in need of care or supervision 24/7.  Your work ethic, integrity and basic care for human life must matter to you.  You must be proud of the work you do as an employee and as an overseer of the care of another human life to succeed at Mosaic. Own your job."
good,"Mosaic is a tough place to work, since few people want to work in a job like this -- houses are understaffed, meaning it's easy to pick up extra hours. Things aren't organized, but the people you work with are good individuals."
good,"In the 10 years that I have worked at Mosaic, the fellow employees are the best part. Along with being exposed to different cuisines and working events with a unique twist, you learn a lot. In my time there I have grown into a much more respectable employee and I have the team at Mosaic (mostly the GM) to thank for that. The worst part of this job is the lack of communication that trickles down from the top and the lack of input on performance. In my years in the restaurant industry, regular performance reports are scarce and I personally believe they are the utmost important. This was something that was rarely ever done while working at Mosaic but one of the most beneficial acts that management could perform. Overall I have to say I enjoyed working here. I can't even begin to explain the amount I've learned just from being with this company. All-in-all it was a great job. Everywhere has downsides but here my peers kept me afloat even in the worst of times."
good,Just not secure industry any more. Poor management decisions. To many people that have not run the plant trying to manage it. Management does not listen to the people that have been there.
good,"Not a healthy place to work, alot of chemicals,but the pay is good."
good,If you're not a part of that God ole boy group of guys then you won't advance. They especially don't like for any minorities to progress within the company.
good,It seemed a little more fast paced at this job but it was a good thing. management now they were trying but they were short staffed as it was. the hardest part of the job was to see who was going to be picky out of the clients the fun part is when we get to go have fun with them.
good,"Assist the mentally and physically disabled. Make sure they get the care that they need. We cook meals, assist with cleaning, bathing and their everyday needs."
good,"I love the individuals I've had the opportunity to serve at Mosaic. This job does take patience. The hours have worked well with schooling. I assist people with intellectual disabilities in their homes. I help cook, clean, go shopping, handle money, and pass medication. Management has been a bit difficult. In the two years I have worked here I have had 6 managers. Lots of changes!"
good,"Certain staff are so close with the managers that they don't do their jobs or get in trouble when others complain about them. Managers and staff also treat overnight staff like pack mules, it's perfectly fine if other staff leave an abundance of their work for them since they feel they have more time."
good,"Alright company to work for and to have as back up. Better pay would be better, make the work worth it."
good,"Fun workplace, good benefits, good pay, great co-workers, no job security, they will not tell you when projects end and why, no severance packages no matter how long you work with them."
good,"I would review programs on a daily basis that staff would document in. Manage the clients finances and medical appointment and Mental Health needs. Also was responsible for grocery list and shopping, client activities and their daily needs are being taken care of. Staff schedules, weekly payroll and I was On Call Monday-Fri and every 3 weekend for 3 homes. "
good,"I have worked for Mosaic for over two years representing Samsung Experience Stores within Best Buy. I have absolutely loved my position until a change in management brought about a complete dictatorship direction within the program. "
good,"good company to work for but upper management needs an audit, very unorganized and unsupportive of the field representatives. All well very unpredictable work hours..one day your promised a set schedule the next your hours are cut-in half. This company has also been acquired by Acosta so a lot of budget cuts are taking place."
good,"This position was strenuous at times, but often rewarding. As a direct care assistant, I assisted individuals with disabilities with daily living. Learned much about different disabilities and laws regarding such. The most difficult part of this job was witnessing the way some of the individuals were treated by their guardians and not respected. The best part of this job was making a difference in their lives each and every day and seeing the progress they made."
good,I had the opportunity to do what I enjoy doing the most in life.  Helping others find freedom and wholeness through a deeper connection with God.  
good,"I worked for mosaic for less than two months, it depends on the job you are assigned to do, but generally it requires long hours and a lot of hard work."
good,"Typical day is to show up on time at your site w/printed instructions"
good,Good place to work if you dont mind shift work and chemicals. I regret leaving for school. Once you get one shift its easy to get training usually. Insurance is ok.
good,It improved my social skills and helped me to develop my character and find my right place in the Canadian society. Throughout this job I learned how to communicate with people and respect them as a Canadian citizen.
good,"Mosaic as a company is competing globally and not succeeding. The current landscape of phosphate fertilizer production requires cheaper products than Mosaic is equipped to create, and while profits were high in years past, that was not put into reinvestment in technology or capital. The company has a very poor training culture for new employees, with many feeling as though they are ""lost in the wash"" and unable to contribute as projects are put on indefinite holds. While there are some very competent people in the lead engineering roles, they are aging out of the workforce quickly, and knowledge pass-down is not a focus of the company at all."
good,"Tive uma experiência curta na Mosaic, mas pude constatar que se trata de uma empresa em franco crescimento, com uma cultura bem estabelecida, mas ainda enfrentando desafios de adaptação a alguns processos."
good,"On an average day of work, I had the joy of interacting with clients with a wide range of mental and physical disabilities. I scheduled all their doctors appointments as well as dental, specialist and hospital procedures. Joined the Discharge team in reviewing all hospital information upon the client coming home. I was responsible for requesting documentation for physicians and new medication orders. I updated the clients MAR with the new medications and discontinued old medications. Direct contact with the pharmacy on client medications. Also responsible for medical chart reviews and insuring all documentation is in order. I also accompanied the clients to each appointment and communicated directly with the physicians regarding their needs."
good,"•	Ensure stock is well merchandised"
good,"They changed the parameters of the job after I gained my position.  Hours where drastically reduced without notice, and my direct manager was one of the worst leaders I have ever had."
good,Mosaic was a great company.  Its not horrible but it is steady going downhill.  HR is taking over the company and many good people are losing their jobs while the snakes and lazy employees continue to grow.  Work life balance is good for the most part and pay is excellent.  Benefits are great compared to other local businesses.  Atmosphere has completely changed from 10 years ago and loyal employees are looking elsewhere.
good,"typical day at work would be gett to work loaded my barges, had lunch went back to work then home. I would learned from my co-workers. Hardest part of the job was the gossiping and the management"
good,"Good place to start a career in marketing as  you can touch mulitple clients.  "
good,Its a good place to work if your there for the clients and your a caring person. You learn new things everyday. The end of the day you are like wow didn't know that. My enjoyable part of my job is seeing the clients happy..
good,"Mosaic is a company out to gain money.  In order to do this, they tend to neglect residents and allow their staff to do so as well.  They are poorly equipped to handle their clients and often let them go to waste as they age instead of striving to their goal of their clients independence.  Management is hands-off and often out of place when they do come into the work place.  Many workers are unqualified and unable to do their jobs as described by there contract.  The hardest part of the job is watching the clients you gain emotional relationships with whither away from age and abuse.  However, the people you work with are sweet and caring and often capture the heart of many of their workers."
good,This was a great limited job offer that paid well and allowed for interaction with customers and the product that was being sold.
good,"A mosaic, Foi uma grande escola para mim la eu desenvolve o trabalho em equipe descobri como trabalhar com os gestores pressionando, e o melhor apesar de ser uma multinacional os funcionários tinha acesso direto a gerencia, e isso acho que foi proveitoso para mim e para a empresa a minha estadia por la."
good,"This was a basic marketing job, which was not in the degree field i was studying for. If you would like to create your own schedule around your lifestyle and schooling, plus travel then this job is perfect for you."
good,Mosaic has the right values and guidelines.  It is a great place to work if this is your niche.
good,"Subject to following the current trends in business practices"
good,"You get to travel around your state and interact with people across a wide variety of stores. Typically, you would teach employees about your products and quiz them, clean up displays and make sure interactive units are in working order. I learned through this job how to get along with people that I didn't know, earn their trust, and become friends and colleagues. The hardest part was being motivated--very few exciting things happened, and the opportunity to host events and fun activities was almost non-existent. With no incentive to train more employees or meet sales/training goals, it was incredibly difficult to feel excited to get out and work. When I concerns or frustrations about being motivated, I was told to keep my mouth shut and just keep doing what I was doing."
good,"Providing care, Love and a peaceful living area for my clients."
good,It was nice working here lot to learn. Had three other coworkers and job was easy. Fun working environment and lovely clients.supervisors are great and helpful
good,"Good place to develop customer service skills. As a travelling salesman going to different branches and stores, the job taught that to be effective, one had to learn to not be myopic."
good,The company is not very transparent with it's union employees. The Colonsay mine is a swing mine due to market conditions. Layoffs are long and unpredictable. The other sites seem to be in good shape.
good,I am responsible for the care of approximately 100 individuals on the night shift. Staff is very friendly and easy to work with. At times stressful and you need quick decision making.
good,"Dedicated and loyal, hard working employees work on learning how to impact safety and production."
good,love the clients i work with and the staff we became family but management is something you have some that is easy to talk to and come to when you have a problem then it some that with threating you about your job if you don't come in even when you are ill and make it hard for you to take time off to be with your family
good,I enjoyed working with the adults and seiors with disabilities at mosaic i enjoyed taking them different places exposing them to things in and out of their community i enjoyed cooking and talking with them all
good,"The clients that I worked with were always so happy to see me, and it made me smile to see them happy. Some clients however didn't have such a great day and would break out in ""behaviors""; it was always a challenge to redirect them back to ""normal""."
good,"it was okay i traveled alot, pay was okay but managers weren't very nice.my particular supervisor i had was annoying. They weren't on me as much as other companies though"
good,"No room to grow, either you know someone or you dont. Sadly it is that type of environment. Everyone must network like crazy to be able to advance. Hardworks comes after network here."
good,"I don't have many complaints about Mosaic. It's a good company. I only worked here for about a year. Met good people, and management was always nice and helpfull."
good,"a typical day at work involved managing contracts and orders, Learned more about what can be done in SAP, management was ok, could have been more patient and willing to ensure getting proper training,  hardest part of the job was communicating with account managers, I did enjoy the people i worked with"
good,I think they could do better and more things with the clients that they have that are disabled which will improve their business as a company. Have more activities for the individuals that are unable to live normal lives.
good,I have found that the company seems a bit disorganized.  When I went out to food tastings often the materials that I needed weren't there.  I finally agree to only do the wine tastings.
good,I do not feel the need to provide a review. Due to the nature of the business at Mosaic it is a unique situation. Overall it was a fun place to work and I enjoyed it.
good,"Mosaic is a faith-based organization serving people with intellectual disabilities. They believe that every individual is a person of worth. Together Mosaic staff members, volunteers and the people they support work as partners. They're passionate about opportunities and partnerships that create meaningful lives, in caring communities, giving a voice to the needs of the people they serve."
good,"good company to work for. If you like customer service, they have a lot of good positions available. Some jobs are mainly weekend work. Overall, i enjoyed my time with the company."
good,"My typical day is to pick up consumers from day-hab. "
good,"The job is tiring and can become stressful. You can get frozen in for 24 hours or more. The individuals you work for a sweethearts, all disabled mentally."
good,"I learned at mosaic on a typical day about taking care of the individuals on a daily basis,making sure they needs are being met and giving them possibility of having a good life"
good,"Assisted in the implementation of policies and procedures, handled client and customer service challenges"
good,Enjoyed my time there ... was involved on many projects and was able to assist with construction and worked with field crews to install new projects .. really enjoyed that job.
good,"A place that encourages friendships and is sure to not be boring. Most days are fun and exciting but ultimately does not allow for growth. Benefits are not great and for the amount of behaviors you deal with, pay is not enough"
good,Mosaic was a great place to work with great people. The workplace culture was very welcoming and friendly. It was enjoyable to meet all of the new staff and teach classes.
good,Great for experience.  I worked there as a student many years ago and did mulitiple marketing campaigns for Bell and Gain Laundry Detergent.  It was a lot of fun.
good,"A Fortune 500 Company with various sites located in the middle of Florida. Mosaic is increasingly challenged to compete with an increasing number of international competitors at price points that has eroded its profit margin and has depressed earnings for the last three years. This has contributed to a very tough environment for Mosaic, its leadership and employees."
good,"As indicated, I love my job at Mosaic. I enjoy working with the individuals I serve and while it's still short staffed, the teamwork is great. However, it takes over my life and I find that I have no time to do anything for myself. I'm tired on my days off and I call in sick because there seems to be no one who can replace me when needed due to everyone else on over time. I work at least 8-10 hours a day and I take no real breaks  although I am supposed to have 2- 15 minute breaks and a lunch break of 30 minutes. I enjoy my job but I can't keep this up. And it breaks my heart..."
good,Direct care for developmentally/intellectually disabled adults. Daily care and interactions with clients and their families. Mostly worked in a group home. Great potential to make big difference in people's lives.
good,"Working with the clients of Mosaic was a treat for the soul. Although not everyday ran smoothly, there was something in everyday that would override any problems. Coworkers were a large part of what could make a day run more smoothly, and for the most part, there was plenty of team work. "
good,"Overall, a pretty decent company, lots going on, a collaborative work group that required a good deal of engagement but was not overly taxing which is good."
good,"Mosaic has blessed me for many years. It is a truly rewarding job but can be mentally taxing. They provide very adequate PTO and flexible schedule. Often run short staff. Expect to work long hours, weekends, and holidays."
good,Its a good place to work if u have the clients. The leople that work there r great and fun to work with we go on outings amd make sure the clients are having fun and enjoying life
good,The processes and technical reporting is weak and needs an overhaul. You'll find yourself using a 10 key and an excel spreadsheet to get your data. Millions spent on software that they do not invest in to make better and run their business more efficiently.
good,It was a great company to work for.great staff and cool peoples. Work with your scheduling and hours.The pay wasn't that great but I liked the company.
good,worked in the muriate plant. running all areas of plant including team leader. job had quite a bit of manual labor during times of clean up but overall it is a good company with above average pay
good,"Mosaic has been a good place to work. The employee's are helpful and people are safety conscious. I've enjoyed my time at mosaic but with this current layoff I find myself in a position where I need to either find temporary work or move on in a different direction. I enjoyed going to work at mosaic and always did my best to go above and beyond my expectations."

good,"- Pode-se considerar como um dia típico de trabalho com muitas tarefas para exercer e prazos para entregas dos serviços realizados."
good,"I have an amazing team and I thouroughy enjoy my coworkers. My manager loves her team and is passionate about doing right things right. Typically my day is split between meetings and assignments that I have related to our new learning system and the areas I serve. The hardest part of my job is having to build in a new system as this is just complete foreign territory, and the best part of my job is educating new people."
good,"nothing really to say I like the people I worked for and with, I moved on to other opportunities.  The people I worked for were fun."
good,"Great company with great people, the work done is very noble. A company that values their employees and offers great benefits."
good,It was a rewarding job and I loved spending the time with the clients to help bring fun and laughter in their life. The lack of support and communication was a reoccurring issue that was not fixed. Full time staff hardly received support from PRN staff or supervisors during a crisis.
good,Develop and maintain close working relationship with residents and their families. Fast paced yet daily goals can be reached.
good,"I spent over 20 years at Mosaic. Started when it was W.R Grace, thru 2 investment groups and then to Cargill. I would have to say the time the facility was ran by Cargill was the best years there. It was a family atmosphere and the management really cared about it's employees. Safety was number one for them and they didnt push production to the front. They felt that if you take care of your people that your peole will take care of you and they did. Things ran smoothly during that time. Mosaic was a whole new culture, production took first place and other things started falling to the way side. It was always a push to get things done and alot of the time it was as if it didnt matter what it took to get it done."
good,Very stressful and had to have thick skin during the years I worked there. The clients were pleasant and loving but could be very brutal. I always had bruises on my legs from the wheelchairs and some days I was terrified to be there. Coworkers did not really help in the mornings which made for a very frustrating night of work.
good,Typical day at work involves helping customers purchase Samsung devices and troubleshooting issues with their devices. The hardest of the job is maintaining a relationship with the Best Buy employees. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to represent the Samsung brand. Management visits the store once a week. And provides feedback through.
good,"The hours were split shifts, meaning you work a few hours in the morning went home for a few hours and then went back to work to finish your shift. "
good,"Pushed the limits of what could be accomplished in one day and allowed me to develop  great multi-tasking skills"
good,I loved the hours and meeting new people everyday. The work was amazing and at times challenging.
good,I love the clients and knowing that I am making a difference in their everyday lives.
good,great pay but no job security whatsoever. working on your own is very nice but mountains of paperwork can be a little tedious. really enjoyed working here but probably not something you can make a career out of.
good,"You get great pay for what you do.  "
good,"Much easier to work for a company based out of where you live. There have been many issues where I have had to play phone tag or email numerous people to have the issue resolved.   Most of the training I received was by email and I would have to teach myself.  People I deal with at work are great, but getting anything done through the higher ups is always a hassel"
good,"Flexible scheduling, lacks hands on nursing skills, but is more geared toward management of care.  There was much more gossip than other places I've worked, with some attitude from part of the leadership team."
good,Truly enjoyed work with co-workers and had the freedom to develop a highly effective team. Thanks
good,"PM relocated in Riverview, FL at an operating mining and processing plant on Tampa Bay.  Projects were mostly managed remotely. Various local sites in Brazil, Singapore, Canada and the US.  Enjoyed working with the PMs in Riverview."
good,"The hardest part of the job is working with co workers who don't care. Who are only there for a paycheck."
good,"Worked in a team. Entailed physical work. Shift were done at night to prepare for the upcoming day,"
good,great environment of coworkers with great management relations with contractors
good,Assembled visual merchandising displays and ensured compliance.
good,"Perhaps it was just my immediate boss, who was not qualified for the position he was in, and I had much more experience, so it was a bad fit, however he was a micro manager and was clueless about solving any problems. He was also inappropriate in how he interacted with me. The company was really disorganized in not sending you out the survey sheets and other tools you needed to complete the job. I did like that you could accept as may jobs out of your regular job as you wish and training was online, however on your own time. Job was going from store to store and making sure the printers were functioning and inventory was in stock. I also had to train store employees. While not great, I have worked for far worse companies than this and were it not for my immediate supervisor's lack of ability and making me so uncomfortable because of his insistence on things that were clearly unbelievably stupid I would still be there."
good,"I took care of the clients. Cooking for them, cleaning up the house, doing their laundry and dishes. Dealt with behavioral issues. Documented every aspect of my shift and communicating with other members of the staff on what went on during the day."
good,Good place to work overall but difficult to find work within the company after the campaigns were over. Also low pay and benefits.
good,More effort is given to income as opposed to caring for either employees or individuals served.
good,"The flexibility of the job and variety of jobs to perform were most interesting. I also liked the independence of working alone and at times, with others."
good,Mosaic is a great company with an amazing cause but terrible management and awful communication within management. There were plenty of time where clients would know about activities and management wouldn't have a clue about what is going on. The miscommunication within the company is going to eventually hurt it.
good,"Overall it was a great place to work. It could be stressful as with any job, but the clients make everything worth it and knowing you’re making a difference in their lives is what mattered most."
good,"Mosaic is a top-shelf company, or rather it could be.  The jobs at the company should be challenging and fun.  But, because of lack of training and communication, work is many times frustrating - it is known on the inside as the ""self-service company""... which means that if you need anything for your work, you need to search for it and obtain it."
good,"Mosaic is a company that needs to improve it's managerial skills in all areas to be among the ranks of a winning organization. It's a wonderful company, but it needs some help to reach it's full potential."
good,High stress work environment that I do not recommend to anyone to work at. I dont feel I was treated with respect or dignity by the owners of the business.
good,"It was not enough training to do the job efficiently"
good,A typical day at Mosaic is a day full of meetings.  Time management is a must and the ability to accumulate data and analyze it and report on the analysis is a must.  Management is focused on data management.  Workplace culture is fair but all business.
good,"Empresa focada em resultados, busca o engajamento da equipe e com cultura de acidentes zero para toda equipe."
good,"Great place to work with individuals with intellectual disabilities."
good,"Alot of good people, working to do the right thing for persons with Developmental Disabilities in a very difficult budgetary environment.  Mission is important."
good,"Descarga de caminhões de fertilizantes"
good,This a nice company to work for and the people are very nice the clients are great  and nice. I process new hires and trainings have a good day
good,"Relatively similar days, clients can at times be difficult."
good,"You cook dinner, bathe the clients (if the clients can't), clean around the house, Pass meds (if need too), get the clients into bed. I loved the people I worked with at my grouphome. The hardest part is to deal with the clients behaviors. The most enjoyable part was doing crafts and interacting with clients."
good,"Assist intellectually disable with daily living aspects and activities of health, safety and emotional support."
good,"As a faith-based organization, Mosaic provides quality services to people with intellectual disabilities, which is a mission of great importance. Mosaic's staff does an outstanding job of providing services to these people, helping them to live a life of their own choosing. Their executive leadership, however, leaves a lot to be desired. They have taken a culture that was based on the Mosaic Promise of truth, integrity and teamwork and turned in into one of fear and distrust by criticizing, chastising or firing those who don't agree with the strategy du jour."
good,"One of my highest paying jobs in college, but managers only cared for the clients, not for its employees. I've heard they had a big turn over on management but I'm not sure if I want to return. Learned a lot about myself, especially with the clients."
good,Great place to work if you want to wonder if you have a job one day at time. Poor business practices lead to lay offs. Great pay and benefits along with a nice rotating schedule
good,Team work and providing services.Company provide you the support to be revolve in your job. Management provides the tools.
good,Different culture and environment. learned a lot.Good engineering experience. New Industry to explore. People are very friendly and management is good
good,"Its an average workplace to be a part of. We seem to be generally short handed and there was quite a bit of gossip that traveled around the workplace. I loved working with the clients, always making me smile and always making them smile. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the clients. They were great people."
good,"a typical day at work:Help customers with the technical question"
good,"Mosaic is your typical marketing company. I do direct marketing, mostly wet samples, interact with prospect and capture data like, age and sex of crowd, response to samples and any other information required. "
good,"It was a decent company to work for. After a while business started to decline, and things started to fall apart."
good,I've only worked here for a couple of months so here is my experience so far. Giving out samples to customers is very relaxed and there are no issues. Just know the product information and where it is and you'll be fine. Giving out coupons can be a bit stressful because surprisingly not a lot of people want to take them and it can be discouraging. The hours I am getting though are pretty bad. I was expecting to work twice a week but at times it can be twice a month.
good,O loved working here. It taught me patience and how to not swaet the small stuff. You work with individuals with intellectual disabilities and they are so sweet
good,the job is a very good job for students who want to have the part-time job while they are studying.  it is very warm and fun atmosphere on the job and you will see new people in the job every time.
good,"A consulting firm that values its employees but is challenged by client policies in the Bay Area, such as PG&E. PG&E has a policy that allows consultants to work only for 24 months so it's hard for Mosaic to manage their workforce in the Bay Area with PG&E being their largest client."
good,"Worked on a project with them for over two years. I did not get a single dollar payraise in those two years and when I asked I got told that maybe I should look for what was best for me (aka move on to another job). They also did not raise the mileage allowance of 38cents the two and half years I was employed, while gas prices rose 50%. "
good,"The clients are absolutely wonderful.  The staff is wonderful about taking the clients on daily activities, separately, and all of mosaic of Pittsburg."
good,I enjoy working on the team at Mosaic. I am willing to go back. Hope my next job team will be as great as they were. Mosaic give me the chance to work on my leadership role. I had time to strengthen my skill on a hole. The next job I get I know my work ethic will be greater then ever.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the clients and the bond that is made with them. The hardest part of the job is the physical aspect of some of the work. The turnover rate is very high and so I am working alot of times by myself and it can be stressful. I have learned that love comes in all forms from all types of people. The clients love you for no reason at all, just because of who you are and because you show up for them everyday. Falling in love with them was very easy and surprising."
good,"we fab and install all our own lots of different jobs from millwright work to welding and repair. I learned a lot at this companyand enjoyed working here but would like to further my career. my co workers are great to work with , The hardest part of the job is sometimes heat and dust in certain areas but i find you adjust to this . the most enjoyable part of my job is seeing what weve accomplished at the end of a big job."
good,"Gave me an opportunity to be a leader within the store.  Yearly training. Weekly meetings. Discount off health insurance premiums if you passed a yearly preventative physical. Legal insurance, health, vision, dental, and 401K. Opportunity to advance with yearly reviews on how to achieve advancement goals."
good,"Empresa boa, plano de carreira p crescer excelente emopresa"
good,"Do my 12 hours and go home work overtime when they need me. been working here since 2014 under Turner then got hired on with Mosaic, and I am still here loading and unloading barges"
good,"I've worked in health care for almost 30 years, being a host home is really the easiest and hardest health care I've done. It's 24/7, it's leads your life to always meet someones life. there's good and bad in this job, You are making a difference in someone else life and that's a good thing."
good,Not a mom/family friendly place. Your expected to attend alot of classes and meeting outside your work schedule regardless of what you have going on in your life.
good,Worked from 11pm-7am. Would sign in and report to manager. I learned a lot about reading modification sheets and how to communicate while under pressure. The hardest part about the job was trying to please everyone as everyone was working hard and scrambled everywhere some people would ask for help at the same time and myself could not help all at once. the most enjoyable part of the job was when everything was finished and knowing the job was done right.
good,Great place to work. The culture is great. I would go back here in a heartbeat. If there was room for advancement I more than likely would have stayed
good,You never knew who you were going to work with because the employees didn't show up for work most of the time in the home setting. I worked in the job center before quitting and this was much better place to work. You work with people with disabilities and this can be stressful and challenging.
good,"Support each person's needs, wants and interests."
good,"i liked working close to home with friends, the management there was absolutely terrible. People were fired and quitting left and right simply because of the management."
good,"a good position with good pay. but its all about how much effort you put into it. give it 120% and it will give back 120%"
good,"The overall aspects of Mosaic is a good workplace to be. The only downside is that the pay doesn't make up for the actual amount of work that you put into a day. The residents and overall feeling of this job made me feel like i actually made an impact in someones life and did a good thing every day. Another bad thing about the job itself if the management overall there are numerous good people in the high up but with the employees that have been there for years begin to have something against you in a matter of a week you will be terminated for made up reasons that in the state of Nebraska you have no chance fighting because of the ""At Will"" law."
good,"Working on the homes with the clients is really fun and a great experience! However, the job expectations are taxing and they are always short staffed, leaving others to pick up the slack and work more hours or longer shifts."
good,"Lots of fun activities to do throughout the day, rewarding to see a person accomplish something they have worked hard to do. Going places and doing things that a person want to do, activities outside the office such as exercising, cards, letters, etc. Being creative."
good,"Mosaic can be an enlightening place to work, while serving clients with developmental disabilities to live a full life. I enjoy being the best possible me in order to provide a healthy, safe, and stable environment for the individuals served. "
good,you work with adults that are wanting a meaning full life and you are there to help them with that you get bonds with the people you work with it can be difficult at times but in the end of the day you feel good about helping someone else out
good,It takes a special person.  I love my job but the way things are ran is getting to be a little bit trying at times.  We don't make as much as we should for all that we do and we are sometimes asked to work excessive hours.
good,"If you're looking for a part time job with flexible hours, this is the job for you. At the time that I worked there, I was able to work around my schedule."
good,"Empresa mediana, me serviu de grande aprendizado e inserção no mercado de trabalho"
good,The people I took care of was beautiful and wonderful I love coming to work seeing them I loved them so much wish I can see them every day being wit them made u want to come to work
good,Loved the opportunity to provide good service in group homes for adults with special needs.  Good activities for clients
good,Enjoyed working for Mosaic until they got bought out by Acosta.  What was a good part time job for a student became a part time job with full time expectations.  It is a job however and was good to get by.
good,"The group at MOSAIC is very willing to teach, making this a great place to start in an office environment.  A typical day would include scanning performance reviews and emailing them to coworkers, filing documents related to personal files, updating salary information in Payworks, updating contract information in MS Access, rearranging files to and from the termination list.  Support the HR department where ever necessary."
good,I learned more than just customer serivce skills it was a great experince.
good,"challenging, flexible, educative, friendly, rewarding, minimum pay, less hours, pay time off, vacation pay, holiday pay, good managers, good coworkers."
good,"Empresa com bons beneficios para o colaborador! Funcionários cnseguem promoções, desde que, passem no processo de seleção."
good,"Mosaic assists individuals with developmental disabilities.  It was a very rewarding position.  The workload was very heavy, however, and not enough support was given."
good,Great pt job but frequently the weekly  hours are limited. No room for advancement. No annual raises. Company pressure to down manage admin time and drive time.
good,I enjoy being a process operator and I am willing to learn key position aspects in a safe and productive manner with a new company and expand my career.
good,"For every new promotion there's a meeting/training"
good,"Mosaic that I know of was partnered with Macy's and Best Buy which are both high-end retail locations. At Macy's I try to promote and sell Samsung smartwatches. Whereas, Best Buy, vendors could do more such as sell more than smartwatches like tablets, smartphones, tablets, and laptops of the Samsung brand. "
good,"Individual work, u know where u staff , where to get it from, so just do it. Help me to know the customers, as i was interrogating with them, got know what they looking for. help to be good at survey, because i had to send report every time after the shifts."
good,Working with this facility definitely gave me patience. Everyone worked together to get things done as a team . Co workers and bosses never give on you .
good,Energetic productive place to work. All staff are friendly and helpful/knowledgable. Team environment where you can really strive to be your very best.
good,"This job isn’t for a one person to live off of job, you will barely get by, they put on a comedy show every year, they have a 0 diversity policy but yet they hire comedians to tell racist jokes at there party’s"
good,"Mosaic is a place that cares about their clients and employees. It is a friendly company to work for. The management team are a very good team to work with, also they are very knowledge and helpful. They are very concern about their clients and also employees. If you need time off for a good reason they have no problems in granting you that time. Which is a very good thing to have on your job. They, also plan for employees and clients get together and do cookout together and do things for various holidays. Also, they give some of the best training for the company about 2-3 time a year for new or review information, employee can talk with about an issues nd management will do everything possible to see that it get resolved."
good,Flexible schedule. Open minded management. Many activities are available for the folks living there. Free meals. Don't need CNA experience to work there.
good,The money is wonderful if you have enough respite providers that require your services and provided you have the best recommendations and certifications.
good,"Contract job, able to make good money but no advancement or permanent roles available"
good,"Flexible, enjoyable and great colleagues, Mosaic is a great company with an amazing work environment where u get to interact with customers and provide them with great products that they can try out."
good,Enjoyed working in the field talking with people. My job is very out going and easy. I liked talking with customers and all management of my field of my work.
good,"Somewhat stressful because some of the residents are violent and some of the staff are not very supportive in dealing with these residents. However, very fulfilling work overall."
good,"good working place,i worked well with staff .management was good. staff was acknowleged for the hard work that was applied.the training courses were good but could be more for individuals.overall a good company to work for."
good,They pay well but they are unorganized at time and will ignore you. we just got a new manager though and he is nice and is trying to change things and so far so good.
good,It depends who you have to be a care giver for. You help people with special needs. You help provide a service for them. Management did a fantastic job.
good,"Uma excelente empresa para se trabalha, muito organizadas, com salário ótimos, e que sempre se preocupa com bem estar do funcionários."
good,"Not enough hours, Part time benefits are ok, and my managers were good. Just wish they gave enough hours to support my family."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company because they were flexible with the work hours and I was able to attend school and also be there for my children, every team member was very helpful."
good,"It was a job of low stress and easy going days.  The clients and the staff were friendly. My interaction on job was both rewarding and unforgettable.  Staff enjoyed each other, we were friends."
good,Great managers that I've had an opportunity to work with. Meaningful projects have been assigned to me during my time here at Mosaic. Travel and relocation services provided.
good,Deliver the best energy possible to costumers. A fast pace job where we had to make sure sales were high. Promote each event so every weekend we would be busy
good,"A typical day at work consists of driving to the location you are assigned, setting up a booth with whatever it is you're sampling and then you begin to actually work. You get as many peoples attention as possible and you try to sell as much as possible of whatever the product you were sampling is. The management is excellent and super easy to get along with and the hour are flexible. You don't have someone watching you, you are alone in the field except for the occasional so if you don't like being micro-managed it is great. I don't have anything bad to say."
good,"a typical day is never the same, dealing with mental illness is always a challenge yet the rewards of seeing them succeed is success."
good,"A close nit office. Each job requires a great amount of teamwork from other departments. The best part of the job is definitely that patients. I have enjoyed getting to know each of them, and feel privileged to have been a part of their life."
good,"Mosaic was a energetic place to work with having fun and excitement to meeting new people everyday. and also being acustom to changing venues quite often, which not only was fun but gave me opportunity to experience to adapt to all sorts of work environment."
good,Explain and demonstrate products. Update software. inform customers about our latest and greatest devices. Give them the benefits of the Samsung merchandise.
good,"Working nights can be tough and easy at the same time. You are getting the individuals ready for their day. Making sure they are clean and dressed with a good breakfast. Making sure they also take their meds and their daily living skills are completed. Most of the time things go smoothly but here and there the individuals come to you for health reasons and you just have to notify the nurse."
good,"as a store manager i was multitasking between sales, accounting , display and presentation."
good,Its a good job to travel to different stores as a vendor and set up merchandise in a certain section. The pay is decent enough but the hours are short
good,"I love my job, but I have struggled with the lack of communication throughout the company in the past 2 months. It was perfect until I hit my one year mark. Makes me sad as I honestly saw the possibility moving up in the company until just recently. The clients are great and always bring a smile to my face."
good,"Due to the nature of Mosaic, there are multiple positions in a vast array of areas to work in. Whether it be Sales or Merchandising or Management, there are quite a few different types of work available."
good,I like this job because it taught be a lot of different lessons within working with people who have intellectual disabilities. Its a great job if you love working with others and enjoy driving and going to different events. the management is there to help and the co workers are also helpful depending on which department you work in
good,This project is a small privately owned company run locally.  I have enjoyed working with the general public and through this opportunity developed strong professional relationships.
good,I like the work place because we are introducing new product and services some times thoes are new for us too. It is fun and positive always.
good,"Travel from Store to Stores merchandinsing, rotating and growing the business."
good,I took care of people with disabilities. it doesn't get any better then that I loved helping them in anything they asked me to. This job is challenging but fun. you have to have a lot of patience and appreciation for the people your helping.
good,"6 hour shifts, great products, shortage of stock, display was seriously lacking presentation."
good,Its hard work it can be fun if you make it I can't complain about my co-workers I love them all. The hardest part is the insecurity but that's the same with any marketing job especially these days. Overall a great place to work.
good,"I love working with the individuals and getting to know each of them on a personal level. It is a hard, but very rewarding job. This is not a job you choose for a paycheck, this is a job you choose to make a difference in people’s lives."
good,I loved working with the individuals there. They were the only reason for me staying as long as I did because I did not like the organization and behavior plans and activities they created for the individuals. They did not try to work towards the individuals desires and goals.
good,"Management "
good,Part time is ok but there is no room for advancement. So if you are fine with that then you might be happy. Staff on mosaic side is ok but samsung side are kind of odd. They dont really do their job
good,Possui bons produtos e passa por uma mudança na forma de gestão. Precisa desburocratizar os processos.
good,"Its 3rd party work. It can be amazing, pay is pretty good, but you are often at the mercy of establishment that hosts you. Its important to remember that sence its third party the job is different depending on what company you represent. In that way, this kind of job is a whole lot of fun mostly cause its not dull repetitive work. However, you can go from working full time, to unemployed for no reason at all, and at no fault of your own. Which has happened to me twice now, with two sepparate 3rd parties. You will be a vendor, whcih meens the establishment that hosts you could care less about you. If there is a customer complaint, even if just cause the customer didn't get their way chances are the establishment e.g. BestBuy will file a complaint against you that could result in your removal from the establishment either by your 3rd party company, or the establishment themselves. "
good,"Go into work go pick up individuals.  Take them home for evening medication . Then prepare dinner for them. After that take them bowling or to basketball. After doing the activity for the day.  I would take them home, and they would have there night medacation."
good,Tremendous talent at Mosaic. IT staff works incrediblbly hard to meet the needs of over 10K users. Loyalty to quality staff is unfortunately driven by the bottom line far to often.
good,"Mosaic was a great place to work. I enjoyed my days out in the community with clients, and reporting standards were clear cut and easy to understand. Friendly people. Reasonable expectations."
good,This company always had events for their staff and consumers to try to build a pleasant bond with each other at times it could be difficulty because of the challenges that came about but overall the support was there.
good,Very Very serious on safety. Lots of paper work and lock outs. If made a none serious misstake could be fired! Hardest part of the job was the guidelines to follow and scared to make a misstake. Dirty conditions everywhere. Did enjoy some of the safety affairs and free lunches and great saftey awards
good,"I am very passionate about what we do each and every day at Mosaic.  However, the communication significantly lags.  Additionally, my supervisor is quite unavailable for supports."
good,working with the individuals and helping them to have a meaningful day is rewarding in itself.  Relaxed atmosphere with many opportunities to have fun. Problem is within small agencies there is no room for growth and if you are not within the management team you can't get any add on responsibilities.  Sometimes your effort and skills go unnoticed.
good,"The management was very friendly to work with, you could talk to them about anything. This company really cared about their employees, from either how they liked their work or just how their general life was going."
good,"I am the manager of the location, and develop a team of 3 sales peoeple. Also building relationships with Best Buy upper management to increase Samsung visibility/product knowledge in order to sell more. "
good,"Regular day at work is to come in and setup everything in the store and make sure all displays are up to par. Going through the day you will sell, troubleshoot, and educate consumers and employees. Hardest part about the job is to move up and most enjoyable is meeting different people every day."
good,"the days were pretty simple"
good,"The title says it all, they pay decently but unable to work with you on managing your life. Expecting you to work beyond your hours where pay isn't being given for the additional work."
good,"Company gives you awesome tools to work with out in the field! It makes reporting and product tracking very easy! The hardest part of my job is being the liaison between vendor and store.  Some stores are more receptive and find me indispensable, while others make my job very difficult."
good,I loved working with the clients. For almost the entire time I worked there I was the only day person. It was very hard for me to find a replacement when I needed it.
good,Fun place to work at and opportunities to make a difference in the life of people we serve.
good,"We have always tried to build each other up. We always had support from each other. We helped each other. "
good,"Mosaic was a great place to work, I got to work with many amazing people with crazy amounts of talent, I learned a lot in my time there until the site I was at closed."
good,"A typical day at work is engaging, to say the least. I am responsible for not only my assigned client, but well-being of other clients as well. It is the position I am applying for at this other Mosaic location. I am always learning at work.There are many things I have learned in my three years there, but I am always learning new ways to improve upon what I already know, and I enjoy that. We can get very set in our ways very quickly, so being taught new ways to achieve our goals and new ways of looking at situations pertaining to the job, excite me. This principal is applied in the well-being of our clients as well. I am always learning new things about our clients. This is truly remarkable to me; that I can take not only the skills I've earned about how to do this job into my life outside Mosaic, but the lens at which my clients view the world. This comes with repetitious involvement and patience with these folks. The workplace culture can be great and it can be stressful at times. I am not perfect at my job and I do have flaws along the way, but learning from those flaws with the correct direction and teamwork is where I believe I stand out  among the rest. The hardest part of the job is when others do not come in for their assigned shift and you are picking up the slack. It is this stress that I have learned and am still learning to improve upon. The most important thing is our clients; they come first. I am there to serve them. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to work with these amazing folks. I am always learning from the and they hopefully from me."
good,It is a good place to start your customer service experience as you will meet many new people and get to know many new things. I didn't work there for long but yes it was an average experience.
good,Mosaic was a great place to work. The company is like a family and knowing you were doing a job bigger than yourself made any small workplace issue almost non relevant. I would work there again on a heartbeat.
good,"Vacational manager is a great manager to work for. Highly recommend working day site, but not residential. Overall company not so great. "
good,"Mosaic offers opportunities for upward advancement.  It can be a difficult place to work if you are at a chemical plant.  The safety culture is excellent.  Most positions allow for opportunities to grow through training and education. There are onsite gyms, tuition reimbursement, gain sharing and an annual bonus.  Market conditions drive the industry, it's very cyclical, which means support groups that are not already lean will see employee reductions."
good,Pretty demanding of your time even though you are well compensated for it. You'll will lose quite a bit of social and family time. In return you'll will be able to afford the luxuries that a lot of people can't. Stay grounded and don't live above your means. It's a perfect job to raise a family comfortably.
good,Very professional environment yet laid back. They are very patient with new workers and it is ok to ask questions. it is an over all great company to work for other employees are very friendly and will always make you feel welcome
good,"Helping take care of individuals and assisting them with meeting goals to ensure their life is enjoyable; exceptionally rewarding.  Granted, depending on the severity of the individuals condition, I did get beat up and attacked on a couple different occasions.  But, helping enrich the lives of other is amazing.  I would assist with many aspects of the individuals daily lives and assist them in leading a good life."
good,My position was project related only. However; I did interact significantly with the maintenance group for project coordination and to help where possible in their activities. Can be demanding but rewarding upon completion of projects.
good,I have always been interested in video games. For me that is the most enjoyable part of the job. I get to make sure the video games are out on new release day for everyone. I have made a lot of friends  along the way.
good,"Good job, lousy management decisions when it came to spending. They closed doors and laid people off. The pay was very good. The job was challenging at times."
good,Culture was great get the job done underground was a nice environment no weather to worry about for the most part clean and dusty not bad though I would go back if life would allow
good,As a Mosaic operator a normal day at work is very busy permitting and getting jobs ready for whoever assigned to work. Management is ok just hard to get ahold of sometimes but overall they try to take care of you. I really enjoy a lot about this job but lack of communication can make this job very difficult.
good,they did have religion incorporated in with the job which was annoying if you were not religious. a lot of my coworkers would try to pressure me into believing something I did not want to believe. but it was a laid back job and fairly easy. but did have to deal with some behavior problems.
good,The work pays very well but can be somewhat repetitive. The people are good to work with and work is well planned out. A good place to work although it's somewhat isolated.
good,"Helping others to live in society, help them get jobs and take care of themselves. You clean, cook and take care of  other people. You  be their friend and help out."
good,"The people make the company great. I have consulted in Mosaic IT for two longer term contracts for a single reason which is due to the people. Employees are in good spirits, have great benefits and the company guards against the possible out of balance work-life scenarios. "
good,"Grande empresa,otimos beneficios,porem metodo de promoçao e qualificaçao dos funcionario abaixo da categoria que empresa ocupa no mercado."
good,"Fun environment, love working with clients, dislike hours, receive good training for the job, unlike any other job i've had"
good,"Very nice place to work,diverse,enjoyable place to work never a dull moment assisting dependent adults with disabilities with activities of daily living."
good,"Excelente organização para trabalhar, foi destaque entre as 150 melhores para trabalhar em 2016. Muito efetiva nos programas de segurança e qualidade. Sempre busca atender os clientes com excelência. Busca manter o engajamento de todos os colaboradores, tentando estabelecer uma comunicação dinâmica e satisfatória."
good,"I love the residents that I had to work with. They were fun and probably the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part was remembering to do every little detail or Id get in trouble. Management wasnt the best considering, I didn't even finish training before I was out in the field working in houses. That includes serious medication training for seizures and other health issues My co-workers were mostly dependant, depending on who it was and when they worked. I learned that people with intellectual disabilities are almost exactly like us, except better."
good,"This job required you to work very long hours, late nights and early mornings, which is one of the main reason's I've decided to leave. As much as it is an unsociable job I did have fun working here and did enjoy it. I've learnt a lot not just working in the role but working here from the age of 19 I've matured and learnt with age. Starting here first just collecting glasses and then working my way up to Management the hardest part of the job was working with staff that knew me when I was just a glass collector and being young I found it difficult to manage staff at times. But there were times I did enjoy the job, the current staff working there while I was managing were quite young so it was easy to have a laugh and joke with plus seeing people having a good night out made the job worth while."
good,"The company has done alright by me , I was just looking for some PRN positions to make a little extra money. My manager has been a far person to work for and I am able to talk freely with the management. It is possible to advance with the company and more and more oportunities keep opening up for the workers."
good,Mosaic uses a lot of temporary employees to work on projects. The work is interesting and the people I worked with were nice. Since the work is temporary though there are no benefits and no opportunity for advancement.
good,"Work varies from week to week.  Some weeks have very low hours and other weeks can be very busy.  I complete various call reports on a tablet.  Some days I am working grocery, stocking and auditing merchandise other days I am working in electronics, stocking, auditing and building new displays or placing new signage.  Work is mainly done independently with very little interaction with fellow employees.  I work hand in hand with store management and associates to get tasks completed."
good,"good easy work, fun company culture. sometimes managers don't have the schedule right and you'll end up driving a lot more than supposed to."
good,Rotina dinâmica. Trabalho em equipe. A parte mais difícil é a de que era trabalho temporário.
good,Really fantastic environment. The stress level of the job and the expectations can make you go crazy.
good,"Everyday was full of fun and the management was great. It is in a school environment and you get to meet alot of people and help them in the process,"
good,"1. Typically we price the donations and set them out on the floor while engaging customers."
good,meet new people help mentaly and physicaly disabled people and their families aid in everyday activities
good,"I loved my time at Mosaic. I worked there for over 9 years. It was a great company to work for. I always felt appreciated. Its not just a job, you’re making a difference in people’s lives."
good,"Committed to Mission, Vision, Values. Friendly atmosphere with focus on learning and self improvement.  Benefits are minimal. Holidays are paid through PTO accrual."
good,Good teams work together. And good comunecation. Everything running smooth always helps. Also having the right tool and equipment. You can never go wrong with that.
good,"A equipe sempre empenhada e com uma rotina de trabalho bem desenvolvida e treinada, as experiencias absorvidas foram de grande valia para meus conhecimentos profissionais, onde pude apreender muito com relação a instrumentação de vidrarias, exatidão de resultados e procedimentos, conhecimento em nas normas do MAPA, a parte mais difícil era trabalhar em equipe, pois a equipe era  individualista."
good,Other themn travel time and working in mud holes its a great company strives on safty there are some old timers thee that have there own ways that dont like change and gets stressful. Its a goood company just wanting some change in my life.
good,Because of last manager it was very difficult to work with that person. But overall it is a nice company to work for. The individuals are nice and appreciate what you do for them.
good,Great pay with good retail and customer service experience. Very flexible when it comes to hours and easy to work around. Easy job for anyone with sales experience.
good,"I've had the job for two years. You're basically the boss of your schedule, but you need to book a month ahead. Although, you can't book off too much work of course."
good,"Providing twenty-four hour in-home support for an adult male with mental and physical disabilities, including scheduling and transporting client to medical appointments, handling of personal finances, assistance in meeting daily goals in areas of personal hygiene, behavior, and cooking & cleaning."
good,The environment was great. People I worked with were fantastic. Working within best buy was also great.Teams worked well together to provide excellent customer service
good,"Pick up resident from day program, administering medications, cooking meals, hygiene, and making sure that there home is clean. Overall a good company."
good,"Overall, Mosaic is a great place to work. Executive Director and most management are gifted leaders and have a passion for the individuals served. Strong team to work with and the individuals are a great joy to be around. The biggest downfalls of the job apply to management positions. Work-life balance leans heavily towards work and one level of management is divisive to the team."
good,"At typical day was getting signed in computer to start your evening. Then greeting clients  that you would be working with for that evening. Anything thing might happen fun in the work place with the clients, many different cultures. Hardest part of job was at bath time and feeding clients that had to be feed by staff might have more food on staff than what client wants to eats, enjoyable part of job mainly going home but other than than that just being able to help someone that needs my HELP. because that""s what I enjoy doing helping others."
good,Mosaic is a great company to work for!  I worked at Mosaic during an exciting growth period.  Everyone really believes in the Mosaic Mission and Vision which makes for a great working environment!
good,"The job itself was okay, i love being around the clients. We can take them the movies, out to eat, and other places. I listen to the different types of stories they tell me."
good,fun place to work with great team work from coworkers very busy and crazy daily and management does not help they sit in  the office all day i enjoyed assisting my case load and taking them on outting almost daily.
good,Job is interesting and not hectic at all. Setting up the Point Of Sale is a bit tricky. Management is very accommodating. Enjoyed working with mosaic. I would advise students to apply
good,you work by yourself . you have to know a bit on the computers and have a printer . sometimes you work with other people and thats good because you can help each other out on working days
good,"Compared to other companies in the industry I feel like they are as good as any. Although my time there was not as long as I would have preferred, I enjoyed the experience"
good,"Absolutely without a doubt needs more than 1 nurse. Impossible to perform job duties to satisfaction. Extremely stressful, enormous amount of paperwork. I did appreciate my immediate boss. She did go to bat for me when required. I feel there needs to be something in place to protect an RN's license. Loved the clients and the people I worked with. Will always hold fond spot in my heart for them. I appreciated the kind support from the State Surveyors. There was however poor communication all the way around. Found out important things at the last minute, very frustrating. If there was at least a part time nurse to help it would be a very pleasant place to work."
good,"I enjoyed working at Mosaic, I just didn't enjoy the Director that was there.  I had a good supervisor in the office manager.  As I said, I enjoyed working there."
good,"Good work environment with friendly staff and management. Learned how to influence the consumer sales experience and turning buying into selling. "
good,"Working with Mosaic is very fast paced i enjoy the high energy environment. "
good,"Like a ground hog day you get into the flow of things and between ever increasing responsibilities and frequent layoffs it is a gift that keeps on giving. There is a family atmosphere at times, when people remember to pay attention to each other when they are not consumed with work. Pay is adequate but promotional opportunities are difficult to come by."
good,"Flexible hours, great company culture, decent pay, and you get to work with some impressive companies but it doesn't really feel like a career more of just a job. Still a great place to work."
good,"I enjoyed my time working for this company, it was nice to see various types of clients and their families. The management was nice too, I never had any issues with them."
good,"Very nice people who allowed for an amazing experience while I worked there. I learnt a lot about marketing from this job. I was a brand amabassador, so I often worked out of office and did in-field activations for the company. We worked with brands such as CLIF Bars."
good,"Love this place, working here was a great experience .  Couldn't ask for more when came to me clients. The work lord can be changeling but the overtime was approved."
good,"A typical day at work, includes working with intellectual adults that have learning disabilities.  I help these clients with several things. I work at  the vocational place, it's called the work shop. I normally work with 4 different individuals during the day. I do programs with them, which is helping them achieve personal goals that they have. The clients I work with like to work on production, which are small jobs for them to do during the day so they can get paid. I also take them on community outings. They enjoy going to the movies, library, and going out to eat. I do enjoy my job and working with all my clients can be very rewarding at times. It can also be very difficult at times to. Sometimes they don't want to do certain things like there programs, so I have to encourage them to do them as much as  I can."
good,"very accommodating and understanding, willing to help. they're also easily contacted in case of emergencies. communication between managers and employees is consistent."
good,"Rotina de trabalho dinâmica."
good,"Wonderful place to work, great Christian atmosphere, as with all non-profits, often more to accomplish than time allows for very low pay, but the reward of making a difference in people's lives is well worth it."
good,I enjoy working with the staff & management at Mosaic. The agency does need to increase the employee compensation to remain competitiveeld in the area.
good,"It's a good job with decent compensation and benefits."
good,Sales Ambassadors/Representatives go out in the field and perform liquor tastings at various liquor store locations. Reps must dressed appropriately and come fully prepared. People who are already social and enjoy being around people this job is a shoe in.
good,The best part of working with Mosaic is meeting new people and building relationships with the people that work at the stores you go into every week.
good,"Providing various samples of spirits within the LCBO, while promoting brand knowledge. The easiest part of the job is engaging with customers, the hardest part of the job would be sampling a product not widely liked by consumers, making it harder to meet your sales objectives."
good,"Fun and exciting place to work. Meeting tons of new and interesting people. Management is supportive and encouraging, with caring attitude toward all of their employees. Work is not stressful at all and very easy to adapt to. The hardest part of my day is having to leave at the end of my shift."
good,"Empresa que proporcionava um ambiente profissional desafiador, onde tive a oportunidade de aprender muito, conhecer pessoas que contribuíram para o meu desenvolvimento profissional e pessoal."
good,not much to be said just a great exp. and awesome benefits/pay

good,"O meu trabalho na Mosaic é bastante dinâmico, principalmente nos dias próximos aos eventos, no qual viajo bastante para conhecer hotéis e fornecedores."
good,Worked with a fantastic group of people with one mission - to improve the lives of those with developmental disabilities
good,"I worked 3rd shift, usually Midnight to 8:30am. During the overnight hours I would conduct room checks to ensure the residents were in their rooms and asleep. I would work with one other staff until 6:30am when I would assist 1st shift in getting the residents up, showered and in serving breakfast. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the residents themselves. The hardest part of my job is the shift hours. My immediate supervisors and co-workers are excellent and fun to work with. Upper management is a bit difficult to work with especially for my shift. The ongoing training in CPR/AED use, First Aid, Safety, and Resident Rights are also excellent."
good,"Good wages, excellent people to work with. lots of travel. Night work."
good,"Doing demos and getting people involved is fun. Transporting of equipment to shifts isn't ideal, but not overwhelming unless you live in a busy city. Surveys are tedious. "
good,"This company is looking to change their ways, management is fully on board and is very supportive of this initiative. Long way to go, but fear is not a factor to move ahead.  Taking lots of little steps to achieve greater things."
good,"Enjoyed my brief time there. Really hoped they'd have a position for me, as I was there temporarily. Loved the laid-back atmosphere. They made me feel like a part of the Mosaic family."
good,Not a bad place to work. I started as a staff and was promoted to supervisor even case manager. The work you put into the company is what you get in return
good,"Working with adults with special needs opened my eyes up to peoples lives that were challenging.  Some of us humans have it so good that we don’t appreciate other people with special needs or look down on them.  My clients were amazing people very loving and kind and they were like this with some of the biggest obstacles handed to them at birth and sometimes handed to them in mid life. They are truly diamonds In very rough places and they shine through all of the things that most people would crumble under! A very eye-opening experience that I will never forget, and I will never forget the people I had the opportunity to serve."
good,Working for Mosiac has overall taught me the skills of a nurse taking care of someone loved one. It is a flexible place of employment with a good environment.
good,"My job is rather relaxing, slow but satisfying. The job involves plenty of physical interactions with customers. The set up of the demo cart can sometimes be challenging though."
good,"Uma empresa com grandes possibilidades de desenvolvimento profissional, com excelente ambiente de trabalho."
good,Being a part of helping those with intellectual disabilities live a full productive life has been very rewarding. Knowing that I have been a part of something so great feels like a big accomplishment.
good,Great job great employees all around great place to work to support a family. As a technician the work environment is demanding but safety is a priorty. Management very easy to work with and very understanding of family events and issues.
good,It all depends on who you work for but most managers are very good.  It also depends on the program.  I did more Experiential Marketing which could be very rewarding.  The only downfall is they can change your schedule on a regular basis.
good,"I worked at Mosaic for a short time (was laid off due to a site shutting down) but, there wasn't a whole lot I could complain about at that company. The people were great and very helpful, they always worked with you and were there for you, and they showed they cared about you. I would go back to Mosaic if I felt confident I would keep a job."
good,get to work  so a walk through with the other staff members of what's going on with everyone meaning the clients. Then continue on to our normal duties making food for supper and doing their laundry  games if they want to. Taking showers  and doing nightly routines. ive learned that not everyone is the same in anything everyone has there own way of doing things such as calming down id upset etc. Its an easy going environment  especially when you work well with others. Hardest part is when the clients get upset and seeing them distressed or upset or having to put them in restraints. It breaks my heart but its part of the job and are trained for it. I loved/enjoyed my clients. I looked forward to seeing there faces every day it was very hard for me when I left
good,I have over 7 years experience with management. I had a crew of 14 and did an excellent job. I am middle aged and a huge assett to any company. I really enjoed my job and helping the individuals and also the staff.
good,"We worked at a community festival for 4 days in teams and it was a lot of fun.  We were doing promotional marketing as brand ambassadors.  It was hot and the management was very protective, making sure we had enough water and breaks to stay healthy."
good,"Uma otima empresa, com bons salarios e benefícios, porém deixa a desejar no equilibrio entre trabaho e vida pessoal."
good,"Working for Mosaic was pretty positive. The managers that I had worked with weren't great, but the company as a whole has lots of great opportunities for events work nationwide."
good,"A typical day at Mosaic is %50 work & %50 easy work. If you work together it makes the day better. I learned a great deal while working for Mosaic. Welding, piping, mechanics, & so on. Management is generally fair from the direct supervisor on up the latter. There is a vast culture of people there but mostly good people just trying to earn a good living. Hardest part of the job is some times you work 12 hours a day for 3 weeks straight. This is not offend.And that check you get at the end makes it well worth it. the best part of the job is that pay check."
good,"The tasks a Brand Ambassador has to complete are very simple and straightforward. The real job is being able to help customers who come with questions. Generally the store in which I worked varied from week to week, and so did the people. Being around all those different people was more fun than challenging, though. Management is as helpful as they can be. But when there is something missing from the display kit, there's nothing that anyone can really do. If you're the first choice for an activation and you can't make it to all of your shifts, you tell your supervisor and they look for another Brand Ambassador to cover them, but the ones you can do you keep."
good,"Mosaic seems like a nice place to be employed, they do brand representation for a lot of companies I'd like to work with, and the compensation is pretty good. I like how easy the hiring process was, it took a while to receive my equipment though for my actual job. That is likely because of the client in my case though, something to do with a warehouse transfer."
good,"Um dia de trabalho na Mosaic é bastante dinâmico e desafiador, a área de qualidade é responsável por diversos processos o que torna o dia-a-dia bastante atarefado mas com oportunidade de muito aprendizado. Aprendi muito sobre planejamento e reestruturação de metas, além dos processos produtivos e normas específicas da legislação vigente (MAPA)."
good,"Good Co-workers. Work/life balance was very flexible. Payroll can use a lot of training. I had to audit my paychecks for 2 years to ensure it was accurate. Overall it wasn't too bad. Good company to work for, just watch your paychecks!!!"
good,"This type of workspace is very high pace for someone in my line of work."
good,The Colonsay mine site in Saskatchewan is a fun place to work and feels like a family environment. Managers have a mentoring attitude and genuinely value safety over everything else.
good,"Constantly managing all of the control systems on site.  Hourly I'm in the PLC code adding, correcting, adjusting or troubleshooting issues.  Programming from scratch any and all control changes for capital projects, control modifications to existing systems or simple loop tuning for PID controllers.  Taking on projects for expansion or improvements.  Work / Life flow is great and Supervision encourages volunteering and community involvement."
good,"Worked independently, traveled a lot to and from work locations, was paid to travel. Work allowed me to do something different all the time, meeting new people and experiencing a different job assignment from week to week."
good,"Typical day was teaching class and helping Best Buy employees promote Samsung."
good,Working with Mosaic has been a great opportunity. A typical day includes engaging with people and offering them sample of product while giving them information about it. They enviornemt is relaxed and the people I work with are amazing. The hardest part about my job is having consistent work and standing in heels for 6+ hours. The best part is seeing new places and meeting new people

good,Awesome exposure to many aspects of information technology.
good,"loved working for this company, I was at remote locations so enjoyed the drive"

good,I can make my own hours as long as projects are completed on time.
good,J P Morgan Chase was a great job to work at. The people were positive and we had a lot of fun. Though the work day was often long and hard the people and the activities they provided made the job more enjoyable. I wish would have stayed in the states.
good,Set monthly schedule.
good,"Work with intellectual disabled adults to help them live normal lives. Help them budget their money, grogery shop, clean and cook. My individuals taught me a lot about life and how we can't take things for granted. managemnt and my co-workers were great. Always there when you needed help and always willing to help. Hardest part of the job, well I don't really know. The most enjoyable part of the job was just working with the individuals and making a difference in their lives."
good,"Mosaic was a fine company but I went through four district managers in the two years I was there. Because of this, I got zero feedback."
good,Great place to work at. Mosaic was like a second family to me. Great team work and the residents are amazing. It's  a fairly easy job. Just focus on your everyday tasks.
good,"travel alot ( I like it)"
good,For Contractors this is a cool place to work. The pace is fast as you will only have a little time to get abreast of any technology that you will have to implement or teach. The support is decent here through your team members is always encouraged on the project.
good,"The staff becomes a family, the clients are great, just a good place to work. The managers are easy to talk to, they will work with you no matter what you're going through"
good,I enjoyed flying to another state and meeting new people during training.  job has allot of communication with workers while on shift but any on site issues are yours to solve while working with management of that store.
good,At the time I worked there I had a great supervisor she worked with all her staff and she made sure we did our jobs and work didn't have to be so serious all the time if we needed time off at the last min she didn't hesitate to help us find a replacement she was truly a blessing to that company to bad they let her go other wise it would probably run so much smoother
good,Working at Mosaic was my first job. I believe I was trained really well fro the various jobs that were given to me. My managers were mainly cool people to work with.
good,"Good job to learn how to use a planogram to set and fill aisles. It is a temp job, but it pays well and is mostly fair. Travel work will pay for mileage."
good,"People say that missions drive a company but it is the utmost truth here.  Enabling millions to prosper from clean energy, and it does this everyday.  A great culture has formed and people are friendly and warm from the CEO on down to the most recent person hired."
good,"mosaic provides a working environment where you feel comfortable and safe while doing your work.  working here has provided me with the ability to think though what i am doing for potential danger before doing it, which helps maintain their safe environment"
good,"Enjoyed this company then they cut hrs  You meet a lot of people . we did video games for Wal-Mart I had 12 stores , Then they cut the hours But was a fun job"
good,I’ve been at mosaic over a year and I personally love my job and what I do. I do my best to provide care for each and every individual here . Management communicates with staff very well and ensure every individual in service is doing okay.
good,"Days were fast paced and energetic. Always given a chance to step up and learn new things. You start with two weeks of paid vacation and benefits start within the month of being hired. The downside is if your one of the last set of people to be hired and company downsized, you will be the first of many to be let go."
good,Good structure overall other than having periodic contractions due to reorganization using outside consultants.  The engineering group was good but seems to be led by senior management that did not care too much for good engineering principals but just have things running enough to make money no idea of optimization
good,Mosaic as a whole is a great place to work. The focus on the team aspect of serving individuals with disabilities. The only downside is Mosaic seems to get tunnel vision when it comes to assisting there homes. They sometimes sacrifice the well being of there other group homes to save one.
good,"Very challenging job, traveling from different stores making sure all advertisement was up, game console were working. Making sure each store had the right products on the floor and the right counts"
good,"This is a high stress, long hours, type of company with the clients needs always coming first. However, the company makes it manageable by being work from home and allowing managers to step away to have some work/life balance. Conferences are educational but also a lot of fun, and they frequently offer incentives as motivation."
good,I had the ability to grow as an operator. I was placed in a team environment. We followed safety rules and EPA/ OSHA regulations. I enjoyed the relationship I shared with my co-op workers.
good,Very good company to work for.  The working environment is relaxed and the management staff is very organized and personal.  I enjoyed my job while working at Mosaic.  It would advise anyone to work for this company
good,"I worked inside Best Buy at the Samsung Experience Workshop selling and demoing Samsung tablets, pc's, cameras, and smartphones. It was a decent job besides having to hit quota sales a day which made it stressful. Kind of like a car salesman which I didn't like."
good,"Working with Mosaic was a pleasure. excellent training, nice work environment and the residents are treated with compassion and respect. <3 They are Mosaics first priority! Has it should be!"
good,mosaic is a really good place to work as a stepping stone to learn alot. Management was really great to work with but the best part was working with the residents.
good,There was 3 of us doing the set up take down n samples for the day. we would get there set up have everything ready for the day  and then we would hand out samples. We would even go out n ask people to come try free samples at are booth. We had a photographer there the one day to take pictures for advertising. I enjoyed the hole experience n the music as it was at a jazz festival.
good,"Helping clients get out into the community to achieve all the same rights anyone else has. Medication distribution, volunteer work and always striving to be the best you, you can be."
good,Mosaic has a fun enviorment. It offers the induvidual to interact with others in a meaningful way. You hear to know people on a first name. There are very few opportunities

good,great place to work different wings to work on from rehab to alzheimers staffing is great. Great people to work with and for and plenty of hours

good,This was the same job as with Samsung except Samsung brought us internal in January 2013.
good,"When I got into work I would start with the payments of the day.  Then after that it would be helping customers with anything from paying there bill to helping them get cable,internet,telephone and a cell phone.  I learned new systems that they had and how to sell new products that I have not sold before.  I loved working with my co-workers they taught me so much about the busness.

Enjoyable parts were the company meals and different festivities that brought co-workers together in all trades and management."
good,"Mosaic is a wonderful company, and I love my job. But I was promised 40hrs a week and I don't get that. Also I had to take a $400 a month pay cut. I should have kept the pay I was making. But I had no choice."
good,I get to work with great people on a daily basis and as a group we are always striving to improve processes. I've learned that leadership is key and that many people lead by example.
good,"I enjoyed being in control of what gets done. I would go to a location with one other brand ambassador and make sure we jointly get the job done. We had a set amount of time (usually 2 hours per location), we had items to giveaway, and we had equipment to keep track of our work. It was great if you aren't shy and you love talking to people."

good,Mosaic was a company that stood well on it's feet. I like that the management was very organized and they provided great benefits for their employees.
good,"The people that work at the individual plants, are generally very friendly people, and will help out if you ever need them.  Upper management can at times be disconnected, and lack communication with employees.  Upper management is not big on promoting from within, but would rather hire outside even if experience the current employee has experience and a degree."

It is the best experienced i ever had taken in my job. the management is so strong and the skills they use to control their team are very effective. Co-workers are very co-operative.

good,My co-workers were great. This company allowed me to advance in my computer skills by sending me to classes.

good,"I would set POG's, straighten product, put up signs, or put out product."
good,"A typical day at work is filled with laughs, challenges, and many one on one interactions with customers in need of help with their device. Every day I learn something new just by talking to new customers or training courses that I have completed. The experience is awesome. The management team at Best Buy(where I am located) all work hand in hand with each other and myself. Great group of people and they make the workplace very fun and a positive environment. My co workers are the best people to work with. They are all fun and come from different roots that we can all converse over and have a good time all while being professional. The hardest part of the Job would have to be troubleshooting a device that I have never worked with before but that all comes with the territory and I enjoy doing it. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing and meeting all these new people and learning new stories and traits."
good,Mosaic treats you with respect and as a family. great team work and an understanding supervisors. they will understand you when you are having a family issues.make sure to find you a coverage when needed. the best job i ever had.
good,Working at Mosaic allowed me to gain certain knowlege that I wasn't not aware of before. I learned how to accept everyone regardless of their abilities and characteristics. The company was very well organized. The staff were treated wonderfully at this company.
good,Typical day: inventory and organizing and lifting and taking out new products to the floor. I am constantly communicating with managers and sales associates about new products launching. I travel from counties to counties. I'm constantly checking and looking over emails.
good,not many ways to advance in the company. its under the union but the union from what ive seen doesn't do anything but take their dues from your check every pay period. benefits suck .
good,"A empresa é muito boa, entretanto, é muito burocrática, sem processos definidos, muita gente fazendo a mesma coisa. Vai na contramão das melhores práticas do mercado. "
good,"Working there, I was able to meet clients  as well as coworkers from all walks of life. It truly was satisfying being able to work with the developmentally disabled as they didn't judge who you were. They were just thankful that you were there for them."
good,Working at Mosiac Plant site was great I didn't really have a lot of physical work there because it was mostly Fire watch & Hole watch but the employers made sure you were alright

good,The company and management are absolutely fabulous to work for! They work around your schedule and you have opportunity to actually choose which days you want to work. They are an equal opportunities company to work for-in other words- even people with disabilities can work for this employer!! I definitely recommend but keep in mind they are also seasonal!
good,This job is a great place to work and the supervisors really care about their staff. The individuals are wonderful and rewarding to work with and help out.

good,The clients are very nice and the staff is supportive. Its a slow paced volunteer assignment. The typical daily assignments were talking to clients and doing crafts.

good,A normal day consisted of me driving to target locations to provide samples of alcohol to customers. Most of what the person in charge of me did was tell me to go to locations and routinely checked up on me to see if I doing the job correctly and professionally. A job like this helped me with my communication skills. The work environment itself was fun since most locations were liquor stores.
good,Great place to work. You get to work with interesting  people. The time I spent with Mosaic I was mostly working on the Boston Nesquik campaign. Going all over the greater Boston area making lasting impressions on people was awesome to be a part of.

Which I'm quite sure that this is not the first time companies here these reviews...."
good,The shifts are long. The people are friendly. The hardest part of being a monitor tech is that they don't prepare you for doing the EKG's. I was not told that I would have to deal directly with patients until after I was hired.

good,Mosaic provides it employees with many opportunities to learn and grow in this field and to make a difference of the lives of the people served. You receive all the training that you need for the job.
good,"I am not sure why they pay so low, maybe because it is a non-profit company,  They do not pay for Holidays, vacations, bereavement, sick - everything is PTO that has to accrue from ZERO. For the first 6 months, accruals amount to 3.18 per paycheck; and after 6 months it increases to 6.36 per paycheck (bi-weekly payroll). Health insurance is EXPENSIVE and company does not pay any part of it.  If you can afford to work for peanuts, it's a good environment and culture. The trade-off is that Mosaic is very flexible with work schedules and family friendly."
good,"The staff at Mosaic were great, my line manager was amazing in every way. The director at the time was my only dislike (though they now have a new one) but if you enjoy helping people, like a friendly environment in which to work and all the support you could ask for, Mosaic is definitely recommended!"

The staff I worked with was outstanding!  We had a mix of people from all over the world.  It helped mold me into the person I am today.  The pay was very low, but what do you expect for a job that requires little education or advanced skills?  It makes you appreciate the life that you live!"

good,"I really enjoyed my coworkers, bosses, and individuals i supported. I had the ability to get as many hours as i wanted for quite a long time. However, the house i was working at closed down, so i would have to start working in a different town in order to make up for the lack of hours. I didn't feel like that was best for me at the time, so that was the only reason that i left."

Management was fantastic, it felt good knowing that the managers trusted the employees enough to manage their time well. Loved my coworkers and the positive attitudes.

good,Mosaic was the best job I have ever had. Having a fixed schedule helped me plan things ahead and the pay was nice. I loved my clients and my supervisor was wonderful. Would work there again if I could.
good,The grass is always greener. I left Mosaic for another corporate position and have been kicking myself ever since. Things weren't always perfect but I was surrounded by smart professionals. The compensation was above industry standard and the benefits were great. Mosaic has a tremendous mission in feeding the worlds population and that drives pride in employees. Professional development and career development was strong. I miss my Mosaic family.

Most people are very reasonable and friendly and willing to help out where they can."
good,"Ambiente profissional, pessoas engajadas e buscando sempre atingir resultados. É fato que por ser uma empresa muito grande a dispersão entre os objetivos pessoais e os da empresa pesam afetando planejamentos e nem sempre os mais engajados são notados e recebem oportunidades.

Worked on Tampa Bay in florida unloading phosphate rock from  rail cars to load on barges going up the mississippi river. trucks brought in dry material we loaded on ships that traveled to many other countries that needed the raw material to make fertilizer. WE HELPED FEED THE WORLD. Most of us there had no more than a high school diploma. Sometimes we had it real easy sitting in cabs running equipment . Other times not so easy or clean but it didn't matter we were payed well with good benefits and payed vacation.We did what needed done. In my opinion our crew was the best. We loaded efficiently,did our part of maintenance to keep things running and very rarely damaged anything.Between the 5 of us we had roughly 86 years experience at big bend. Great guys to work with. Sorry I ever left florida."

good,"Uma ótima empresa, que gera oportunidades, estabilidade, conhecimento e ótimo relacionamento com funcionários e terceiros."
good,I started my work week early at around 6:00 AM. I prefer this schedule because I am an early riser. I enjoy working independently for the most part. I developed a rapport with management and supervisors. I learned to read plano-grams and setup of displays. The personnel at the big box stores were cooperative in getting access to displays. The most difficult part of the job was there was allot of merchandise was stored in my home for the setups and displays.
good,Great place with a very fulfilling experience.  Working for the better of others not as fortunate.  Great company that provides great benefits and works to meet the needs of the employees.

good,First off the work the company does as a non-profit is amazing. They help people with mental disabilities and having an aunt with DS was a major factor into me joining. From the start my position was temp but it kept getting extended. I knew it was not going to last forever so can't fault the job security/advancement but they gave me plenty of notice when they could not keep me and that it came down to money and I really believe that and felt that management was always open and honest. The IT department heads are all super nice and helpful and the service desk lead  was one of the nicest people I have ever worked for. After I was laid off even they had me back to cover for someone that was going to be out for a while and even though I had another job they allowed me to work at my own schedule after hours. That being said the pay is not the greatest ever but is still decent. I will miss working there and with them. I'd say the hardest part about the job it it is 98% remotely helping older ladies who don't exactly know computers well so you really have to take your time and keep your cool. If you can do that you'll like the job.

Mosaic values all of it's employees and they make sure that the employees know how much they care."
good,"Mosaic isn't just a job, rarely do I work. Don't get me wrong there is work to be done but mostly its just fun with the people we support! Here I had a real chance to make a difference, make some friends, & make my own life worth while."
