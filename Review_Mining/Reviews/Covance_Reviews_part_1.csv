bad,It does not matter how hard you work or time you give. They let you go whether you have been there a few months or even years without warning or consideration.
bad,"I would strongly encourage you to stay away from this company because work culture is beyond toxic! Managers do not know how to lead, senior leadership has favorites & will throw you under the bus without any solid reasons to support those decisions. The things that continue to happen at this company are toxic with egotistic mgrs at the helm who have no clue as to what they are doing."
bad,This place is a joke and is micromanaged terribly. I hated it except training with a certain trainer. Otherwise if u are a smoker plan on being late from breaks and lunch because u have to drive off that dumb campus. And the parking sucks so u have to walk 10 miles to get to building. Just sucks allmanagement wo
bad,"Unprofessional high stress work environment. If you want to feel on edge everyday, stressed out with no job security this is your place. This is a place that disrespects, belittles, and will micro manage your every move. Not worth it."
bad,Covance philosophy is work life balance plus happy employees and they push that to the outside clients.  The turnover at Covance is greater than 10% due to what they do behind closed doors.  It is a very toxic environment that consist of undermining individuals and performance based off of gossip and not merit or evaluation of actual work performed.
bad,New position and new department.  Company was in the middle of a buyout and overall was not a good time to come in as a new employee.  Small satellite office who did not know new computer system.
bad,"Yo fui contratada por Covance para trabajar en las oficinas de Merck Sharp and Dhome. Lamentablemente, en MSD, el ambiente laboral es hostil y poco agradable. No valoran el trabajo. A pesar que conversé con mis jefes directos en  Covance y se los manifesté, no lo tomaron en cuenta. Preferiría no volver a trabajar en ninguna de esas 2 empresas."
bad,The worst company I ever worked for. Gave me a bonus for perfect attendance then let me go. Would not give a reason for termination. Manager was the worst.
bad,"Covance are without a shadow of a doubt incompetent. They have issues with management not knowing about training procedure, failed to pay me for my time, ignored the stress this caused or the knock on financial hardship it presented me with."
bad,No job security or structure. Hourly and Daily changes. Overall a awful place work. Management uneducated (at least) supervisor I had. Dressed very unprofessional
bad,Terrible work environment. There is a small group that reports about the new hires to management.  They spy for management. Management does not care about new hirees. The studies are a mess when you first get there. They need a few visits to bring them up to date. Covance only gives you two visits.
bad,A lot of internal politics.  No competitive advantage over other companies. This company is run by the operation's Department.  Each department is very separated and don't work well together.
bad,I worked for sodexo for a few months. Covance staff look down on you because they think there better then you. My advice is Dont work in the stores there is a bullying face fits culture. Nonsense rules and regs.
bad,There was no communication between “team mates”  they would always say we are a team even though they didn’t work as a team. This job is very emotionally draining. There is a lot to remember. You also never knew when you were getting out for the day so you couldn’t make plans after work. You don’t just do your own work you end up doing other people’s job and when you do they don’t check up on you to see if you need help doing their job they just leave whenever their time is to leave.
bad,Please please keep off this place if you really want to remain sane. All they see is their numbers they don’t care about you at all. You can die working here but they won’t even remove your corpse they’ll continue pushing for their numbers
bad,No training. Didn’t even know what we were doing until we were throw on our own . High turnover rate . Expect you to do magic with nothing . Management kept saying training was coming but never did. Eventually you figure out what your doing then they want to nick pick at everything you do. Even when your computer isn’t working somehow still counts against you. Definitely keep another job on hand to be on the same side .
bad,"Toxic work environment, no opportunities for career advancement and terrible management. Issues are rarely addressed. Very poor training scheme for new hires."
bad,"The staffing agency will assign you here without fully explaining the job. Management just wants you to meet metrics and they do not train their agents correctly. They set up the new agents for failure and they treat the old agents like trash. They bring in large amounts of employees at a time to see which ones will stick. They throw you on the phones before you're ready and then they tell you they will train you on it later, but never get around to it. Even though you voice your complaints, nothing eve gets done. Furthermore, the company they have reviewing your timesheets mess up repeatedly and then you have to wait for them to correct the mistake and pay you the money that you're owed, and sometimes it can be weeks later. Save yourself the time and find a better job before this one burns you out and then ends your assignment."
bad,"The lab was a bad place to work. they made you work 12 days in a row with little to no breaks during the day. Often, you'd find yourself not getting lunch and working more than 12 hours a day."
bad,"DO NOT Accept a job offer here @ Greenfield. They hurry to micro manage you, but will not help you when you have questions. This place needs to be investigated. Everyday people lives are on the line, due to patients needing there life saving insulin medication. This company will lie to you in training, once you get out of training you are on your own (I recd bare minimum training). This place is not a place to thrive at all. If you are of color-The Greenfield  Police are looking for you-to racial profile you. DO NOT use US-40. Even if you are legit, the GPD will tow your car, just because of your skin color. Their parking sucks and the cafeteria sucks. NO PROS to working here. Its a slave lifestyle mix with a penitentiary lifestyle."
bad,"i worked for this company for  year its the worst place ever the program is not even that caring the mgnt very vindictive the staff very non supportive and the company CARES LESS about the employees and the patients just want to get more numbers patients are just dollar signs to them ,most of the employees left and they keep on shifting you without any notice just send you an email managers do not even have the guts to tell it to your face that you are now in a new position ...PLEASE RUN RUN RUN"
bad,"I was on a restart of a project after the first go-around of the project was halted due to a change in direction. The chosen solution was discarded in favor of a software as service approach. Coincidentally, the CIO sat on the board of the solution provider. Just a little conflict of interest. The project was finally halted after the vendor could not certify it's service as complying with all FDA requirements. Incidentally, one Director in the organization publicly referred to contractors as ""meat shields"" since they could be used to take the blame and be discarded. One project there had 13 distinct project managers over its two year run."
bad,"If you want to work like a slave for base compensation, have no time for family, and have your results rideculed, Covance is for you! This is the worst place I've ever worked and the management is truly horrible. Seriously, don't work here."
bad,This place is a nightmare to work for. They have really small pick nick tables to work from for all employees. Management is at its worst no real team work at all they do not care about their employees the attendance policy is
bad,"It's a dead end job at a call center. Unless you want to spend your life on the phone then this is the place for you. Even if you're not taking calls, your job is centered on other people taking calls."
bad,"wouldn't work here again if I could help it. No proper training, expect the highest standard which is fine, however without proper training how can you succeed, the wage was good, which is the best thing I can actually say about it to be honest. Worked all the hours god sent, had a tough time with partner in and out of hospital which seemed to get held against me."
bad,When I started I watched 80% of my team quite for better jobs. My co-workers made it clear they were also out the door. There is a HIGH turn over rate. The management is the most unprofessional I have witnessed they put themselves in meetings most the day and then hang out with other supervisors. They go on 2 hour lunches . It was very odd and not stable.
bad,"management is horrible.the job is horrible. the people are horrible. you are overworked and underpaid. Management is rude to you, even though you are more educated than them."
bad,"Having worked at a variety of similar establishments over the last 20 years, I have to say this is the worst place I have ever worked.  Workload is ridiculous, very rarely do you get a proper break (whilst management sit in their office!) Huge blame culture, any small mistake is made into something huge... although if your 'face fits' management will sweep it under the carpet!!!  "
bad,You get a lot of experience in many different areas of clinical research at Covance/Lab Corp(owner) due to extreme amount of turnover.  Most of the upper management is completely incompetent and has never done the job they are making decisions about.  The pay is about a third of what it should be and there are NO advancement opportunities.  They don't update the computer systems so it takes 4 times as long as it should to do a job.
bad,Awful company to work for. The Harrogate site is especially poor. Management have no idea what they are doing. There is a terrible blame culture which means noone speaks out when problems arise. The pay is distribution between operational staff and senior management is shocking. Avoid Covance at all costs.
bad,"I have worked in many places but this ranks as one of the worst place to work their attendance policy does not take into account emergencies and you still get flagged no matter what happens whether it is in your hands or not. The salary is not sufficient and policies change all the time.The clients are rather picky and demand alot from the company and management has to kiss butt to keep the client.alot of employees left and emmass to  other companies offering better pay and hours.The mgnt wants you to bow down to them, if they continue like this the company will lose its clients, mgnt needs to act like mgrs and be more professional, the work is good keeps you busy all the day but the mgnt is the unprofessional .i was there for six months and at least two or three employees left every other week. In short if mgnt changes can be a great place to work but as of now not the best.  Didn't even feel bad about leaving the company was glad am out. PTO its there but you never get it when you apply always gets rejected,call it business needs does not allow Pto.But mgrs get Pto whenever they want but employers forget it.The place sucks alot don't work here you will be overdressed overworked and underpaid."
bad,"The most horrible place I havery ever worked for. The job is stressful, you can't be late minute, no fun at all. During Christmas no gifts exchanges or gifts period. I feel as if I am on a modernized plantation"
bad,"Run away! Run away! Run away!! Over worked, high stress, required to weekends and holidays, glorified factory work. Managers work the system to benefit them....never trust!"
bad,I would not recommend this company. Management is NOT for their employees. A lot of policies not followed. A lot of turn over!!! Operates as an Entry level Company!!!
bad,"Nobody stays and it's obvious why once you work here reason. They have many issues with high turnover and not wanting to hire to cut costs. They also push for no overtime, but pack too many things into the daily schedule so nothing gets done well. This leads to long hours and unrealistic expectations to employees left at the company. Extremely high stress work environment with little job security and poor compensation."
bad,They hire a ton of people as temps and weed them out until there are a few or no one left. The temp to hire period will take about 1 year and it is not worth it!  They are very short staffed and management is horrible. You are expected to take back to back calls with no breaks except for the mandatory ones. Basically they hire temps as a method of cheap labor without real consideration to hire.
bad,"Your co-workers will constantly be out to trash your reputation so that they look better because focus will be on you instead of them.  No advancement opportunities what so ever, the Manager is never around and will make false promises to keep you at the job."
bad,"Too many hours, lack of training, lack of respect for employees.  Unrealistic work hours including weekends. Colleagues were not helpful, a lot of separation between co-workers."
bad,You are constantly under review as an operations specialist and there is a culture of accountability that provides incentive to blame other in order to save face during review.  Time is calculated to the second and there is very little leeway for error.
bad,"If you are a hard worker, with good ethics and aspirations, run as fast as you can in the opposite direction. Working here will wear you down until you are a shell of your former self; management openly say that they don't care who does the work,  as long as it gets done. So if you are the fortunate few who can show up late, go for long lunches and leave early, you will enjoy: for the rest, long days, unpaid overtime and no breaks will be your life. And don't even bother with HR and Management; they don't follow the policies so you are on your own, until you realise the grass is most definitely greener."
bad,"will not recommend working here."
bad,"Hands down the worst group in the company.  Don't even expect to get anywhere, grow or be valued while working in Contract Management.  Consistent revolving door - they are always hiring because employees are treated terribly."
bad,"If you survive their torture training for one month then keep reading. Time sheets are tracked by a software CISCO that constantly logs you out giving the appearance that you left from work. Employees constantly receive emails alerting them that CISCO has logged them out, therefore NO pay. You constantly have to submit email notification begging to please fix and approve your hours so you can get paid for the errors CISCO made."
bad,"Terrible company worst experience ever, I had been contracted out to chiltern. if you value your sanity keep away from this company.   Now they have decided to deduct pay- KEEP AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY"
bad,"This was the absolute worst position I have ever had. Management talked about people, treated people unfairly, played ""favorites"" and provided little to no feedback unless it was putting you down.  The turn-around for employees was terrible, a total revolving door. Very long work days and unreasonable hours, which didn't matter to management.  Some people we're able to work from home others we're told no with no explanation.  The only plus was having decent co-workers that we're looking out for each other.. including helping each other leave this place!"
bad,"One of the worst experiences in my life.  Your supervisor/mgr doesn't really even take an active role in your position.  Very high school like.  Supervisors have their own 'click' of employees that they go to lunch with and such.  Supervisors don't even put in an 8 hour day at the office.  No organization.  Training is pathetic if you get it. Most of the times you have to find other people you work with and get them to try and train you.  Don't question anything because then you are seen as not being a ""team player"" yet that team doesn't seem to have to include managers as they just come and go as they please and are more worried about who they are going drinking with after work.  Run very fast in the other direction.  Very sad situation.  Most in the department would like to speak up but they can't because they need their jobs.  Sinking Ship !!!!"
bad,Covance is not a great place to work. Managers are not trained and do not know how to effectively run a team. There is too much stress and urgency for every matter that nothing gets done and quality of work is sub par.
bad,"If I could give this company negative stars, I would. Covance was the absolute worst company I have ever had the misfortune of working for."
bad,"This is a modern day plantation run by africian american supervisors"
bad,When I came in people where leaving leaving left and right. didn't stay long for anything
bad,"It is the worst job I have ever had!! Management is corrupt starting with the Clinical Director to the clin op supervisors. There is blatant discrimination and favoritism. HR is just as bad, pay increases are extremely low, for a good evaluation I was given a .08% increase."
bad,I would of gave them more stars but this software would  only let me give them one.
bad,I have never experienced such an environment in my 17 year career
bad,This is possibly the worst job I have ever had.  They are super strict in regards to schedules.  There is aboslutley no job security.  They treat people like they are stupid.  You have to clock out to go to the bathroom.
bad,A typical day at work consisted of taking inbound calls and making outbound calls to patients and insurance companies. I have learned how to manage difficult callers over the phone in a professional and compassionate manner. I managed my time by prioritizing my workload for the day. I was also able to assist the Special Exceptions team put together reports for patients that required an exception to the drug assistance program's eligibility guidelines that were sent to the manufacturer for review.
bad,"First of all the pay is very low for the amount of work and the lack of work-life balance. Turn over is very high, I was there for 1 year and they fired 7 people. There isn't an, ""on-boarding process"", they expect you to learn as you go without any real training process or support, if you make any mistakes you are a moving target. Oh and they will have your cell phone # and won't hesitate to call you day or night for anything."
bad,Patient medical insurance verification
bad,"This place will destroy your health.  Many employees have gone on sick leave or develop chronic stress induced ailments, such as headaches, back and neck muscle issues due to the stress.  Indoctrination is so rampant you wouldn't believe how twisted this place is! Slimy line managers are ""yes men"" who've been there 20+ years and are clueless as to how organizations have evolved since the 90's!... the list goes on.  It's an abusive environment with a revolving door and they LOVE fresh college students as well as people who are desperate for a job because they can treat them like trash."
bad,Absolutely  the worst place to work once it was sold. Laid off for cheaper labor in another country and they dont even pay at industry standards.  They didnt even try to help with placing in another position.
bad,"Preys on the newly graduated. Managers are inept, placing yes-men(or women) as supervisors, who aim to please their boss at the expense of efficiency and their workers well-being. Culture is toxic, people enjoy when others make mistakes, believing it makes them look better. Many do the bare-minimum, because if you do extra, it is continually expected of you, and you see no benefits. Expect to work 12 hour days or more in order to maintain quality. Perpetually understaffed, so everyone's workload is way too high, people quit as a result, and the cycle continues. Don't expect to reason with management, they will take suggestions as an insult rather than constructive criticism. Awful healthcare for a pharmaceutical company. Nepotism and favoritism are rampant. I wish i would have taken reviews seriously when I first looked at this company. If you are sado-masochist then go for it. Expect no work life balance, and your only solace is the fact you are in this with your co-workers who are suffering the same fate. Steer clear if you value your mental health."
bad,"My manager was my biggest complaint. She had favorites and if you weren't a favorite you got dealt all the terrible jobs. Senior tech's are rude and everyone talks about everyone. Just like high school all over again. I went to people above my manager which didnt help because they are all really good friends. My manager would get extremely intoxicated on work outings, come to work still intoxicated, didnt do her job, would sit in her office with the door shut with her boyfriend while her ex husband sat 2 offices down. Not a classy place at all. Also there is absolutely NO breaks during the day unless you want to stay until 6 every night."
bad,"I should have listen to the other reviews. This is not a company to work for. Horrible supervisor and managers, out of all my jobs I have ever had these have been the worse. All they keep track of is everything that you have done wrong, never any of the great stuff. The only way to get anywhere in this company is to brown nose, lie and sell your soul."
bad,"The people who thrive and advance at this company are people who become apart of the clique. This place does not care if you're a hard worker but would prefer you become one their pawns. I was misled about my position and then these pawns would test me on the orders of their superiors to see if I was loyal. They use the terrorist slogan of ""if you see something, say something"", which is a pretty good indicator of the fear based culture here. I was an entry level employee and we would get the blame for everything. I'm not saying they're aren't good people who work here, and I liked my coworkers at my level, but unfortunately our society rewards people who will do anything immoral and unethical in order to advance even though it's likely they are false promises anyway."
bad,"Internal promotions are so common that most times it felt someone had already been determined the person for the position before the interviews were completed. Management is not very helpful when reaching out and requesting coaching, further training, and career advancement- which in turn caused the turnover to skyrocket. The culture projected in training does not reflect the actual employee experience and I hope this is reevaluated."
bad,Horriable. They do whatever they can to get you out of there. The work was great I gained experience but the managment and the cattieness that came with the extra stuff going on there was too much!
bad,"I gained mostly life experience for all the time at covance but still learned a lot about the Central labs side of Pharma.   So much more  to learn outside of Covance.  While there, I was never able to grow and so happy I finished my schooling (MBA) and now I'm elsewhere and growing exponentially in knowledge."
bad,"The workload will either go from breakneck pace where you have to work 12 hour days with no break for 12 days straight, or it grinds to a dead halt and work hours become severely limited.  The attitude of all the employees is terrible and and the turnover is extremely high."
bad,"The management is bad, management has too much ego. You enter as a temp employee and chances of getting perm are very slim."
bad,"I worked at Covance for awhile as a Program Specialist. I loved the work I was doing, but I started to hate it when I realized how high school Covance is. There is lots of drama, no privacy, once you clock in that's it, you can't talk to anyone else without being looked down on, lots of office gossip, the only people that get advanced in the company are the ones that all stick together and are buddy buddy with management, and half the people who get promoted don't do their job well and abuse their leadership. The best feeling I ever had was leaving that company. You have to be a yes man to work there, and you also have to be friends with management to advance in your career."
bad,"This place totally sucks, I would not work here for nothing in the world, management is bad no structure no life just a total mess. They fire all the good workers and if you are a minority good luck!"
bad,"This was the worst company I have ever worked for. There was totally no structure, poor managers, no training process for new employees. If you are looking for a life balance job, do not work here. This job will be your life. Management is grandfathered in and most of them have minimal college degrees to be in a management position. 90% of them do not need to be a manager."
bad,Covance has some really bright and hardworking employees that are a pleasure to work with. They also have some very long time employees that are very comfortable but create a toxic culture. There are many expectations for employees to commit unscrupulous acts. Many longtime employees are operating under outdated processes and refuse to acknowledge the current guidelines in place.There is a huge attrition problem that causes frequent complaints from sponsors about the constant turnover and vacancy. They are unable to attract and retain the needed number of CRAs globally which frequently impacts sponsor satisfaction.
bad,This place does not function for the benefit of the employee. Employees work 7 days a week and long hours. Make one mistake and they fire you. Stay away.
bad,"They promote people to management that are not qualified and have no people skills.  It is all about management; they do not care about the employees, value, or respect them."
bad,"Did not enjoy working there, it takes a yr to get hired in the company and the benefits are not good plus the test on animals did not like working there"
bad,They have bad managment that belittles you and talks about you to other employees. Its not a female friendly environment. If you complain they move you. No real time to hang out or run errands after a 12 hour shift. Always low staffed so you have to work harder. They pay is good but thats about it. Keep your headphones in and leave on your breaks you might be okay
bad,"Management do not create an engaging environment.  Work-life balance is poor as well.  Heavy 'meeting' culture, but there are poor rules of engagement that are not enforced to be more productive or with any etiquette."
bad,Working like dog no appreciation. Incompetent / careless management . No room for career advancement. Employee just a number not an asset. Favoritism culture.
bad,There is a major lack of team building and opportunity to advance. Interaction with co-workers is not encouraged and management is very “clicky”. Unrealistic workload and expectations
bad,"I worked in the position as a Patient Access Advocate for almost two years. I read the bad reviews and decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, I found out the hard way that all management cares about here are their numbers. From unorganized training, incompetent managers, cliques, attendance policy and zero work-life balance Covance has all the components that create a toxic work environment."
bad,"The work itself is easy to do, but the amount of sheer toxicity at the Madison site is extremely exhausting and after a while makes one anxious to come into work.  "
bad,"Ich kann nur zustimmen, was der Kollege schon gesagt hat:"
bad,"I worked at Covance about 5 years ago, so things have probably changed quite a bit. However, while I was there management began getting rid of company events and forcing overtime on all employees."
bad,"Its not really a great place to work but it helps pay the bills. The culture is toxic, no one owns up to their faults, they micro manage and stress you over things that they themselves are unable to deliver. Its mentally taxing."
bad,Don't come to work here.  Lots of people doing nothing but watching out for themselves.  No team work.  Poor Management and folks in positions they have no business being in.
bad,"I loved the job I was doing, helping Hepatitis C patients receive Harvoni at little to no cost to them and curing them of Hepatitis C. This was a very good feeling and a very positive job, until we (the temps) were belittled."
bad,"Very busy work environment.    "
bad,"You want advice, follow my lead."
bad,"Working here at Covance, you really had no work to life balance.  When I first worked here, I worked over 50 plus hours on my first week. After the first week, the average was about 55-65 hours a week.  Only had a few coworkers that actually were willing to work, and management had no idea what these people were doing. Pretty much the people who did nothing got all the credit while people who did stuff got nothing.  Took on large projects without question, but management never acknowledge it.  Asked for a reference on my last day, and was told that they were only willing to say that I started on this day and ended on that day.  Like really, I worked here for a year and they can't even say anything good at all!? I did my yearly review and brought up all the points I did to management and now towards the end, they weren't willing to acknowledge it.  When I put in my two weeks, I was even given a management project that I had to do on my own time while performing my daily work, completed it, and turned it in... totally regret doing it now. I'm just glad I have some coworkers who knew what I did for the company. Was told that if I ever wanted to come back that they were willing to rehire me... my answer: No thank you."
bad,"The day started with your own personal take. I learned that you that people have need for assistance in the medical field and health providers and patient need to have great communication. I work with provider offices and very few patients, to get assistance with their out of pocked expense for cancer drugs. Helping people is a passion of mine. But in this role you had very little connection with the patient. Mainly, with provider office and insurance company. Was the people you worked with and management. The job is self was a lot of information to learn. But in time you can learn each day. Was talking to people, where insurance rep or providers office and know you were getting somewhere in helping a patient."
bad,"They time your bathroom breaks and run the place like a sweatshop. Do not expect to be allowed to develop relationships with your coworkers because unless you are strictly speaking about work, you are not allowed to speak to your coworkers (besides breaks/lunch of course)."
bad,"Covance was a great company to work for. The management team was top notch and they treated their employees well. Worked long hours daily (60 hours on average) but didn't mind the hard-work to support a exceptional IT department.  This all changed though as the company was purchased by LabCorp which promoted fear in all employees and the layoffs confirmed it for more than half the office. Till end of 2014 all contractors were let go and the work doubled for employees. At the end of 2015, most of the management and leadership teams, HR and Finance disappeared. They are now further cutting down on the technical and worker bees to a skeleton crew. No end in sight. . . There is no help from North Carolina to sustain the infrastructure and the Covance environment positioned for failure. "
bad,"I worked in powerhouse for 13 years. The last 3 after Covance took over were the worst three years I have ever had. Supervisor was unqualified and played serious favorites. Several employees needed to be reigned in, but never were. Work load was never fairly distributed. Personal confrontation was the norm and seemed to be encouraged. Just an all around terrible experience under Covance. Before Covance powerhouse was a great place to work."
bad,"Bland environment"
bad,"This was the worst company I have ever worked for. No respect for the employees. Corporate management has a different mind set than local management. The company would be much better if they followed Corporate strategies. Minimal training,there is no work / home balance, no advancement. Coworkers is the best part  of the job."
bad,Easy work. Wonderful co workers. Very unfair management and supervisors. Terrible shift schedulers. Long hours. No breaks. Supervisors pick favorites and are very negative toward staff. Great benefits but terrible place to work.
bad,"horrible management, no incentives or bonus, no work/life balance, low pay. The only reason I stay is the good coworkers. Only had one department outing, which was employee paid for."
bad,"Worst job I've never had in my life (which is why I am looking to get out)!!!"
bad,You'll be expected to meet insane deadlines. The work life balance is non-existent. It feels more like a high school considering everyone talks about one another behind their backs.
bad,Training was confusing.    To many chiefs!!!    Herd you like animals.   They do not run the call center effectively.    They do not like being questioned about anything.     They do not want you telling people you work there nor are you allowed to talk about work ever!!!
bad,"The CMA ITC is chaotic, terrible management when there is management at all. Senior managers have no idea what goes on and how the expected workload is unachievable. Extremely high turnover rate. Recently the newly hired receive a boost in base pay, while the seasoned personnel did not. Work from home was oromised, but never delivered. Overall employee moral is the worst of any place I have ever worked. When LabCorp purchased Covance years ago, it has been a downward spiral from there. If u just want the experience of patient assistance programs and health insurance reimbursement...it's a good place to learn and then move on to the competitors that way much better. Covance is basically a trainer for those looking to enter the field. Don't take it seriously as a career."
bad,"I was contracted through Ranstand as a temp to hire. I was told that this was a call center where I would be speaking to customers and helping them save money on prescription drugs they needed. Seemed easy enough, so I left my previous job to move to this one, since it paid more and I had call center experience. How I wish I stayed at my last job. "
bad,"horrible time managing and professionalism. favoritism, sexism, and harassment. throws issues under the rug. good job horrible people and environment,"
bad,The management is a joke they do not care about the workers. Its all about the money the company make. If you have kids stay away. If you like to get people in trouble it the job for you they pay more if you get people in trouble.. The wages are a joke for the work you do unless you are a manager.. You will be asked to do overtime of free no payment. But you can have loo time off. Weekends are a joke. Sometimes you can not leave if some of the work is not done even if you have something to do. If have a long term illness and need a lot of time off good luck.
bad,"It is very stressful to work in Covance call center because you are always afraid you going to loose your job the next day. Management  is horrible, they only care about how many cases you can work on a day and don't care about how they can keep their employees.  Believe  it or not but it is truth, on average Covance terminates 1-3 employees  a day.  For example, I was in a fatal car crashed and was in the hospital for a day and the doctor gave me a note to gave it Covance HR but they decline the note and gave me an occurrence  because I did not showed up to work the day of my car crashed.  An occurence at Covance is a point when you show up to work one or more minutes late or call in sick. For example, you get a half an occurence when you are one or two minutes  late to work and you get a 1 point  occurrence when you don't make it to work. Whenever, your occurence reached 10 points they write you up. I was disappointed with Covance because they fired one of my coworkers  and he was really great  with the patients . Overall, if this is your first job out of college go for it to get the experience but don't stay more than 2 years. Covance benefits package is also great too. Your first day of employment the company gives you 21 days of PTO"
bad,"Dismally poor leadership focuses on ignoring increasing workloads, problematic processes, and high risk client demands.  It is a ""yes"" culture and any ideas towards lowering risk and improving processes is essentially processed out. "
bad,"Covance is no longer a good place to work. It is now numbers driven without understanding of what the numbers mean or how they should differ between different departments and phases of study.  This place has become one of the most opaque, ruthless and obstructive environments I have worked. I can’t eat. I can’t sleep and worst of all, I cannot do my job."
bad,"Management is aweful!! Very young and unprofessional supervisors. A ton of work is expected and the hours are the worst. Plan on driving in traffic to work and going home to a two hour commute if you don't live near by. "
bad,Work at Covance for 3 years and got out just in time. The Early Development business is in a steep decline and Management is completely clueless of how to reverse trend. Worst company I have ever worked for and would not recommend it to anyone.
bad,"I have worked here for several years across several departments.  There are people in leadership that are toxic, it's like a cancer that has spread.  Poorly managed which makes for a  difficult work/life balance. This company needs to take better care of their employees and their turnover rate would drop. It's all about the dollar at Covance, at all costs to employees.  Sad."
bad,"The management would do well as used car salesman. This is the quality  valuable to the upper management, not productivity, not scientific knowledge and definitely not problem solving. The upper management has low education, but can schmooze until the client's heads are spinning. Nothing gets done in time, everything is delayed, and this site is unable to prioritize. Total disarray. When things hit the fan, blaming is the only thing to do. Not sure how the site director, scientific director, all managers got their jobs. Incompetence and Peter's principle ! Production manager is the worse!"
bad,Talk about a nightmare of an experience should have came with a buyer beware warning.  Assigned to a manager who has no no clue how to interact with people and to top it off a bi polar passive aggressive personality.  If you enjoy pain this is where you need to be.
bad,"Typical poor bids for contracts thus resources are limited and metrics are unreasonable.  This ultimately leads to poor quality, finger pointing, disorganization, and employees leaving.  Line Managers are limited as to what they can do and some project teams have poor leadership. "
bad,Every day seems normal and is expected to work every day even on public holidays. Low growth and a poor learning environment. Management is biased and boot-licking is common.
bad,"A lot of politics and 'fake it till you make it' behavior.  The sad thing too is that behavior is encouraged so your team 'wins'"
bad,"Covance was focused more on results than people and efficient processes. Although management claimed to have encourage innovation and feedback, this seems more of a formality than reality."
bad,"Poor management at many levels/highly overworked staff. High turnover of staff.  No work to life balance.  Culture between individuals is good, however this is not due to the company but with employees who may enjoy their work in spite of management and the company.  The past several years has seen a huge amount of work placed on staff to the point of inability to address all work and in the best or correct manner. Due to this reason, there are many unreasonable expectations."
bad,Covance has senior management within each organization that can not make decisions.  I heard arguments inside closed office doors that included yelling and that did not meet my expectations of the culture and environment that I need to feel safe and secure about my job.  Covance has a very large turn over rate and is severely behind the times with technology.
bad,"Absolutely NO work/life balance, no such thing as a 40 hour work week (always well above), very low compensation compared to the industry standards, on-call very often, terrible management"
bad,Loved the job hated the work place especially management.  You receive 20 days of PTO but can never use it because when you put in a request it is denied.
bad,you had to work around 60 hours per week to make any money.  The job is repetitive and relatively demanding.  There are so many technicians that it is easy to get discouraged.
bad,Starting out was great. I was hired as a program specialist. This job goes by a point system. And thats where you have to watch out. I have seen two women carried out on a stretcher from being sick and not feeling well and they were both given a point for being SICK. Even if you have an emergency just know you have to choose whether to get a point or take care of your issue. Sad to say you are a slave working for Covance.
bad,"Mi empleador era Covance pero me asignaron a Merck Sharp & Dhome."
bad,"If you work here, get ready to file a divorce, be hated by your kids, and forget your friends! they will make you work 24/7 and still make you feel guilty for not working enough hours. your annual appraisal and promotion would depends on how many 24 hours shifts you had worked in the previous year"
bad,"At the time I was associated with Covance (Princeton, NJ) in 2000 it turned out to be a very poor place to work. A lot of ""back-stabbing"" and ""turf protection"" going on. "
bad,"Being dragged into this company by family members was a mistake. I’m against animal testing now, the place was an hostile environment, and no potential for improvement."
bad,"Scicor Drive site - Parking is a nightmare, they offer shuttle service but the off site parking is not secure. The back parking lot tends to flood, and the front lot is always full. Most days it would take over 20 minutes to locate a parking space. If an employee parks in a visitor spot, they will be towed, at their expense."
bad,"I started with great hopes. Once I realized I was in a call center and couldn't even stand up from my desk is was awful. Very boring work, very stressful situations. Being in a large room with 100+ people all talking at once made me so tired. The management is under such strict rules that nothing changes. Of course with a business like this there is drama but when associates are causing it something should be done."
bad,Beware!! Very high turnover. They over work their staff. New hires are treated rudely by senior technicians. Not a welcoming team atmosphere. Supervisors and managers are poor team leaders.
bad,Oppressive! Constant change! parking is horrible. Uncaring Management. Stressful. Can't make friends. Always in training at any given time and training is poor.
bad,Just a job that I didn't really learn a lot from but has great staff and great mentors but just couldn't see myself working their later in life so I had to take another path.
bad,"The manger would have favorite certain people,  if you where a temp then you where treated as if you where a temp and you could get fired any day. They like to over hirer people make people move seat like once a week or sometime once month and then didn't have enough seat for everyone."
bad,Covance is NOT a bad company to work for. It is the negative environment fostered by the VP at the California site that makes working there less than desirable. The dysfunction becomes apparent when you discover that there are no written training materials for administrative staff. The CEO is fine. It's the vice president's micro-management that needs addressing.
bad,"Very little training for the type of work expected to be done.  When mistakes were made, still very little training or explanation of how to be done correctly.  Lots of backstabbing and trying to impress upper management by making everyone else look bad."
bad,"Very undesirable job. Management lax-company wants patients moved through system regardless of whether they are helped or not. If your goal is to help people, it will not align with the companies. Patients are seen strictly as numbers and their concerns are to be taken care of in a certain time span-number of minutes on calls are strictly  monitored. This company cares no more about its employees than it does the patients."
bad,"All I have to say is management is horrible  in the San Diego site. There and Managers and Supervisors that are not approachable, play favorites, and don't know how to do their job. The promotion process needs to be changed. It's very obvious that a lot of the promotions are based on favoritism and politics. Promotions should be based on your actual performance and a Supervisor should not be able to tell you 'yes' or 'no' to proceeding with an interview. If you are not on a written warning, you should be able to interview. These interviews should be completed by a 3rd party recruiting company who determines the best candidate. From my experience, the turnover rate is tremendous and a lot of people leave due to the reasons explained above. Something has to change Covance!"
bad,"Leadership and processes constantly changing, unrealistic expectations set upon employees of all levels. Most worked from home but colleagues all stressed. This feeling palpable on calls with strong and and sometimes hostile attitudes."
bad,"Company shift due to merger has caused confusion and dismay with employee group, leadership is absent and direction hazy. Company seems lost in their effort to gain market share and keep the drive to excellence alive and part of the company culture."
bad,"The only pro to working here are the benefits! They are amazing. I worked here for 7 years however and was overworked and underpaid every day. I worked anywhere from 50 to 60 hours a week and was always guilted to take on more work. I even pulled two 24 hour shifts before!!! They preech work/life balance, but the only way to have a work/life balance is to make work your life. There were several divorces of people who worked here and even my relationship was shakey until I left. They do year end reviews and that is what your raise was based on, however it is all politics and howuvh your supervisors liked you. I loved my Co workers and the job, but the hours and politics where rediculous. Great for a college grad looking for some experience, but I can't see it as a long term job unless you want to be married to your job."
bad,"This is the usual ""businesspeople out of their depth"" workplace. They depend on experts and professionals for the job while simultaneously resenting them and creating obstacles for everyone to do their jobs effectively."
bad,"Company makes decisions based on the quarter only.  If youre comfy with job security that lasts 3 months then youll be OK.  But if you prefer longer term-job security then Id pass."
bad,Culture of fear. Great co-workers! Too many reorganizations in a short period of time.
bad,"Training sucked  with minimal support "
bad,"I had several issues with this company and position the year I stayed before I finally quit to save my health. First, they plain lied during the interview. I tried asking about their work-life balance, hours and weekends expected to work, and job expectations and either got a half-truth or a full lie. They said they valued work-life balance for their employees and they do NOT. We were told our hours would be 6:30 to 3:15, but that was a lie. We were expected to be IN lab by 6:00 at the very latest (usually we had to be there earlier to perform AM room checks for the animals) and scheduled to stay in lab at least until 3 or 4, not including the PM room checks we need to do. We were expected to run studies for the company, which was not specified in the job description in the interview. We were given no time in our schedule to actually work on them, so we were forced to stay very late to tend to studies in their physical rooms as well as the paperwork associated with them. So long as we are at work, we are paid, but they very much expected your job to be your life and encourage a culture as such. Even if you called in sick and were practically dying, the culture makes you feel guilty for taking any amount of time to get better. Lots of people in this position turn to unhealthy forms of coping due to having no work-life balance and not taking time for themselves, like alcoholism and gambling. They make you work several weeks in a row, usually at least 2 weekends a month as well as several holidays throughout the year. "
bad,The company is great. What we do each day really helps people each and every day. There are a few company policies that make It difficult sometimes but overall is a great place to work.
bad,"Stressful, unreasonable. terrible, parking is horrible, Micromanagement. Terrible training, turnovers, terrible training. They need to hire professional trainers instead of co-workers"
bad,"Although I signed up to work at Covance through a recruiter, I started the job while pregnant, worked for a few weeks, then as I got closer to my due date I was let go. I can't prove it for a fact but extremely coincidental."
bad,I have learned that not wearing a respirator is not safe. The hardest part of the job was moving the big heavy cages and taking them to another room but you get the hang of it after you have done it so many times.
bad,"Stressful, chaotic job.  Very high turnover.  Hard to take lunch break and rarely leave on time. "
bad,"Told the reward of the job is to help people but it is to imply they are helping at times, the real goal is for the drug company to look good and manipulate patient filling out online applications for patient and making calls on their behalf. They like insured patients as then they only have to offer copay assistance, if not insured goal was to get insurance or government help for patient. We were told we offered free drug so was the patient, but the company benefited more from utilizing charitable funding or government programs.  We were to imply we were helping medicare patients but were given obstacles or rules to delay or keep from giving free drug to patient.  One rule was to be down to 5 days of medication, check medicare coverage if med part D plan or qualify for extra help. Goal was charitable funding as this benefited drug company.  They had people go on marketplace and advised, but they were not licensed agents and I do not know if they were registered with the state as a navigater.  They would come up with another rule that patient although on tier utilizing percentage, we had to get copay amount which was difficult to do, as patient may not have script or had been on prior program. Patient had to be on hold while we delayed things to find reason not to be put on free drug. This would upset patient. Constant contradiction for patient and program specialist.  They promoted good job with cheerleader mentality. They knew how to contradict and create reason to ding you on things.  Micromanaged to the max, timed going to restroom, not aloud time off its an occurance. "
bad,"Subpar benefits,  outsourcing jobs to India, very political with little chance of promotion if you are not friends of higher ups. If you work hard, you are rewarded with more work and mediocre reviews to keep your raises low. Cost cutting and lean at any cost mentality. Not focused on quality at all."
bad,It is not a place for me. Job description not related with the reality (day to day duties). There is no possibility for personal growth. No life/work balance.
bad,"Covance was my first science job out of uni and I went in with hope of pursuing a long career with them but it quickly became apparent that it was never going to be long term thing. This review is a completely unbiased and honest assessment. "
bad,"You will be very busy and probably have to work some more at home if you are a Project manager."
bad,"Management was the worst. They would let new employees do minimal work and still keep their job. When I said something about why these people still had jobs, I was the one getting in trouble. It amazed me that the laziest people were the one's getting promotion. The place has went to h$#% since lab corp. Bought covance, employees are losing bonuses and benefits."
bad,"There is always so called voluntary overtime, but if you don't sign up for enough then they say you are not a team player so it is not really voluntary. They are always short handed, but take forever to hire people."
bad,"not a comfortable place to work for"
bad,in the middle of what you are trying to accomplish you get delegated to do supervisors work also. They do not care if you have a life outside of work. you live here. uppers read emails to other coworkers and if they don't like something you said you get blindsided by the manager.
bad,"Covance is no longer Covance!"
bad,"no job security, no way to advance unless they like you. Management is disorganized and don't help, they never have an answer. I was once described as a working horse. stressful and horrible work culture."
bad,"If you have no dignity  or integrity this is the place for you. If you so happen to fall into the good Grace's of some one in authority, you might be successful here. Its highly political! Cliquism is the name of the game here. This place lacks real leaders most managers hide behind so called ""experience"" and Educational achievements if any.  They are Alot of pretenders, do not trust any one, Get in Get It GET OUT!! *hint"
bad,"This company does not believe in work life balance, promotions from within the company, their New Line Managers have not been trained on how to manage direct reports, etc. "
bad,No work life balance.  24/7 work and holidays too.
bad,Fair compensation and benefits but constant employee turn-over makes it difficult to feel part of the company team. Management and team members are ever changing adding to the chaos expected from most CROs.
bad,I had a contracted position and watched almost 100 people leave the company in the span of nine months. It was very sad. I definitely would not recommend working here.
bad,"management no people skills,no training,no employee appreciation and will work you like a slave if you let them.  Working holidays for no reason other than greed"
bad,very stressful late nights and never slows down. eat at my desk everyday and do not have enough of time for trouble shoot. management is difficult to deal with.
bad,"A typical day at work involves uncertainty and insecurity.  A lack of guidance and follow up make dedication to this company difficult.  I have learned that true talent and skills are not needed to be an MVP in this game.  A few shady strategic plays will get you in! Take note, get good with a couple higher ups, make others feel inadequate, be highly visible (doesn't matter if your working or not), give credit where its not due, sign up for any extra assignment presented (don't worry they fall through anyway) and finally sit back and enjoy!  Your coworkers should have your back and some honestly do.  Knowledge is power and it is not readily shared due to the cut throat environment.  The health insurance is good and the amount of PTO given is very nice...but actually getting to use it can be difficult."
bad,"Horrible management.  Cliquey.  Advancement not merit-based; rather, it was based upon favoritism.  Long periods of no work to be done.  Lots of time spent sitting and doing nothing, like during sample collection periods, but not allowed to read or do anything else besides stare at the wall.  Rotating all shifts with inconsistent start times even within those shifts.  Mandatory weekends.  Unprofessional coworkers and management (!)"
bad,"The only thing I can say is the money was good, I think it was the Dept I was in that was not good . It might be a different experience in a different dept"
bad,Stressful workplace with large disconnect between offsite upper management and study technicians/ lower management.  Supervisors and department management seem powerless to help make positive changes although many try and are excellent people.
bad,"Covance is a science assembly-line whose unspoken policy is to intentionally burn-out analysts by overworking them, thereby keeping wages suppressed via constant turnover of employees."
bad,"Work days were long as when people left which was often, their workload was just dumped on others.  There was little concern for quality or people, only the bottom line. Managers were not leaders but bosses who played favorites. Morale was mostly low.  There are some good employees, but there is a need for strong scientific leadership."
bad,Careers are not secure as jobs are being sent to India from Indiana. LabCorp has sole ownership of Covance and it is all about the numbers. Benefits are being cut extensively each year.
bad,"I took this job because of a sign-on bonus. Take my advice, no amount of money is worth working here."
bad,"The environment can be fast paces and stressful. A lot of demanded of your as an employee. Unfortunately, the management could be improved and more praise could be given to individuals who are team oriented and reliable. The majority of people who advance are those who mainly look out for themselves and pay more attention to meeting minimal performance requirements. Helping others around you and being to team oriented has a tenancy to backfire."
bad,"Company has a very stringent attendance policy which does not allow for traffic or weather concerns. Strict adherence to breaks ad lunch times and require permission to deviate from set schedule, Difficult to obtain time off. Seem to be biased in terms of advancement and training opportunities. Focuses on quantity and not quality. While this company provides a great service to patients and providers,they are a family oriented corporation. In other words do not care what type of personal needs an employee has,"
bad,Awesome place to learn about new products and how you can really impact someones life is a great feeling. However they bring in contracted employees to just fill seats vs really searching for good knowledgeable candidates to grow with them. And in order to move up its all about favoritism and who's been there the longest vs who's qualified for the job and nobody wants be apart of a company like that especially if your putting effort into work and fixing peoples mistakes constantly. They definitely favor and treat full time employees vs contracted employees with more respect and lenience which isn't right at all. However lots of overtime and potlucks and in a gorgeous location!
bad,"When working for Covance there is no such thing as a life outside of Covance.  It is extremely unfortunate that this is the reason for my separation from the company.  I thoroughly enjoyed my team and loved my position but the work load was too much.  The expectations that they put on Lead study techs is unreasonable and if you are unable to fulfill their needs you will be pushed out, opportunities taken from you and eventually looking for a new job.  If you have no family, able to work every weekend, and do multiple split shifts without question, you will be a great fit."
bad,The work environment at Covance was straining to my psyche. The training process seemed pointless when inevitably you will have to ask for a refresher of the training context.
bad,"I worked for Covance from 2008-2016 and there were times where I enjoyed my job as a Staff Scientist II (113-level), however the leadership/management was very bad at my department level.  The work environment was very stressful."
bad,"Great entry level job, but when wanting to further career- this site has a hard time advancing individuals."
bad,in/outbound calls
bad,"Very much the corporate stereotype. All bottom line driven. Upper, middle and front line management are mediocre at best."
bad,Don’t take this job unless it’s a first job. It would be  great job for starting in the job market. If I ever held a job before & want to feel respected & appreciated for the hard work you do. This job isn’t for you!
bad,"This is the most stressful job I have ever had. The training is 6 weeks with one week on site. Every employee gets a mentor which has been a life saver. New employees should be given more on the job training. Instead, we are given 20-25 studies one month out of training! Several people have left the company due to the stress. I am unable to sleep at night due to stress. I work 50-60 hour per week just to keep up!"
bad,"The pay is decent, still low wages for what they expect you to do.  Expected to pick up slack of other people, and if work gets busy, who really needs a lunch or breaks.  Overtime is plentiful but, over time, it drains your work life balance entirely.  "
bad,"Covance is a science assembly-line whose unspoken policy is to intentionally burn-out analysts by overworking them, thereby keeping wages suppressed via constant turnover of employees."
bad,"Es gibt einige Mitarbeiter, die nichts tun und viel kassieren, es gibt andere, die 200% Leistung bringen und bis zu Tode arbeiten. Resultat Merging und Personalabbau. Leider, die jenigen, die gehen gehören zur Gruppe der Tüchtigen und die faulen und unfähigen bleiben."
bad,"Working as a temp personnel, you know you are a temp. Both by regular staff as co-workers but also members of the management team as well as personnel in Human Resources. You are not sure where you fit in."
bad,Very high turnover rate. All documentation is mainly by paper. You have to kiss a** to advance. Management is very poor in the sample processing department. VERY high turnover rate and the employees are fake. All new management will come by 2018-2019
bad,"Covance is great if you get brought on permanently, which is very hard to do here. They just contract you out until they cannot contract you anymore. I would say this is good for students right out of school, would not recommend for anyone who has a family."
bad,"working out of hours, lack of trust, work overload, unsupportive management, restriction to the systems made processes hard to execute tasks. Favourisim if a family member is in a high postion in the company."
bad,My experience with management is mixed.  Many managers are very mean spirited and political.  Their main goal is to advance themselves and look down on and take pleasure is mistreating their direct reports.  The good managers are intentionally left out of department meetings and information is not shared with them.  There are many cases where various managers within Finance dislike each other so much that they don't work together or even talk to each other.   Extremely sad place to work.  The dynamics are counterproductive to a healthy company and pleasant work environment.  Many excellent employees have left as a result.
bad,"Don't socialize, don't talk too loud, and your productivity numbers better be optimal or you could lose your job. I've seen too many coworkers terminated for minuscule ""offences."" Call centers are not a good place to work, and this is definitely a call center environment. You're just a number here."
bad,"The work environment was very hostile and competitive. There was little to no team work, it was about concentrating on focusing on yourself. Which I have not difficulties working individually or as a team player. The company only measured mistakes, which in turn caused individuals to turn against each other creating hostile and competitive work environment. Especially when management played favoritism. What I learned was its all about who you know within that company, not what you know or how long you have served. Most enjoyable part about the job, was working with the animals. Having the experience to train primates, perform surgeries on animals, caring or carrying out treatment for the animals."
bad,Upper management does not listen to line members when it comes to concerns about line managers. As long as the numbers looks good they dont care how the line managers are. My manager continually plays favorites and flat out lies to the newer employees. If one of the associates does something wrong its somehow the assistants fault. And she does not use the assistants as the job description. We are used as file clerks and assistants to the associates. Again this has been voiced to upper management several times to to avail. But this is just in my little area of the company. I hear other divisions work better...wish i was in one of them.
bad,"This is a nice place to work for a starter job, to get your feet wet.   A very high turnover rate.  No chance for advancement. Also ways new management and employees."
bad,"Upon my arrival at work, I am trained to call various insurance companies to obtain medical and prescription benefits for an injection specialty drug.  I am ordered by the supervisors and managers of the team to open, initial review, fax and closed 6 insurance verification cases daily.  "
bad,Working in the LPS Deaprtment makes you feel you have no stability for your job. They tend to act on highschool values and dont create a pleasant atmosphere. It is high stress and barely advancement.
bad,"Always expect a work day full of issues. You’re almost always working 12 hour days or even more and that’s without breaks. I’m happy if I can even get out in 10 hours. The work drains you completely that once you come home, you’re too exhausted to do anything else. I suggest working here for a year, maybe two if you can handle it, but save your sanity. It’s a very high stressed job that messes with your mental health. People in my department are always unhappy and look like they got the life sucked out of them when they come in. If I can think of a few good things about this job its the paychecks after working all that over time and a selective amount of good people you work with."
bad,"The first few months I really enjoyed my time at Covance. You learn a large amount quickly, and although it is a bit overwhelming, I found it both rewarding and a great way to build my skill set for the future. While this went on for some time, my overall opinion quickly changed. "
bad,"The days are hard and long and the unit is very understaffed, management give you a lot of false hope when it comes to promotions and pay rises. You can be busy all day when other which have less skills getting paid more spend the day slacking off. Staff turn around is also ridiculous. Management is extremely poor in the animal house they certainly need more training."
bad,Days are scheduled out for you and constantly running from one thing to the next.  Then work that needs done outside of your schedule must be done in overtime.
bad,"Covance is a very stressful environment.  Though they do there best, it is hard for mangement to give the proper support with the pressure it feels on a daily basis.  The people are great to work with overall and they do give you a voice here, but the stress is very hard to deal with."
bad,It was difficult to obtain training for assigned tasks and management was not supportive when requests were escalated.  Employees did not seem to be able to provide guidance to new hires as they indicated they were struggling themselves.
bad,"The WORST job I have ever had by far.  The pace was impossible to maintain, and within ONE month, I had traveled to meetings in 4 continents (not countries... CONTINENTS).  I was constantly overworked and exhausted.  It was almost as if they expected you to be in more than one place at a time, which is not sustainable by any means."
bad,It's a paycheck.   High stress.  Not good worklife balance.   Feel pressured to work extra or penalized if not.   Career advancement seems limited.  Current benefits package no different than industry standard for large corporations.
bad,Good for entry into the science field.  There are favorites.  There is no promotion from within.  Benefits are not worth it.  No appreciation and no reward for doing a good job.
bad,"Covance was bought out by LabCore in early 2015 or so.  Since then people have lost their bonuses, had their time off trimmed/reorganized, had their promotions and annual merit pay increases drastically reduced, and taken a very significant hit in terms of employer healthcare coverage.  And there have been layoffs, at least in the North America Early Development area.  If you’re upper management, not to worry, if you are not?  You know the drill."
bad,"Do your job and you'll be okay. They would always tell me if you don't do your job right we will find someone who will, so I took that to heart and pushed myself to learn as much as I could"
bad,"It's a great right out of college job, but not a long term career. They work you until you are exhausted! You will work over 40 hours every week, take multiple weekends a month and work holidays no exception. The money is decent, but not really worth the stress of the job."
bad,"fast paced, no lunch breaks, poor pay, no room for advancement, company is not great with providing continued education or advancement opportunities. Co workers were great"
bad,"Disability discrimination. Bullying in the workplace. HR not caring for employees unless 100% fit and never ill. If this doesnt show you what the work environment is like I dont know what will. HR will bully you and make you feel bad for going to hospital if you need to, they will put you on observations unnecessarily and will protect their long term employees at all costs, to the detriment of new employees. Even if old employees are lying and backstabbing."
bad,"Overworked and underpaid. No real opportunities for advancements, only move to different departments. Not invested in developing employees."
bad,Good opportunity for starters in career. It gave me basic knowledge and skills of working in a Laboratory.
bad,There are lots of opportunities here if and only if you know the right people. Friends of managers are promoted and not the best qualified for the position. Benefits are not competitive at all. Company seems to underbid jobs just to win the bid then work employees to death while yelling at them for using too much billable time. Horrible employee turnover rate.
bad,"Admin GSS Manager hardly speaks English, no knowledge of what is done in the department, poor training, no personal interaction at all, you are treated as a no one and no one cares about your carers prospects."
bad,"Communication and management are unorganized and make decisions for and without input or notification to all departments involved. Work long hours and not recognized for hard work and efforts, just expected to do more and more."
bad,"Over worked and underpaid. The pay would be great if the cost of living in Madison wasnt so high. Co workers were clichy and not easy to get along with. Animals were the best part, always loving (the dogs anyways), Way overworked. Constently worked 50-60 hour weeks, usually the average. too tired to do anything else outside of work. hated working here."
bad,"Great team, poor management, TERRIBLE PAY. Good to do for a year but the pay increases are few and far between. Management are very “buddybuddy” so if you have a problem with one, you can’t tell the other."
bad,"Do not have any kind of cohesion as far as procedures. One supervisor will tell you to do it one way and the next minute, you will be getting reprimanded."
bad,This job I was a overworked animal cage cleaner. I would have to be there at least an hour before my shift so that I could check emails and check up on paperwork. then I would have to go and change my clothes in to company provided scrubs and socks. I would have to go through so many security check points. Sometime I would have to get a pat down to make sure that I didn't try to sneak things in to the lab. I would then have to go into another locker room to put on my ppe. then got and clean cages for the test animals. Sometime I would have to feed the animals. I would have to clean my set rooms before I got to go home and they would always schedule us for more than we could do in 8 hours. I was let go because it was over an hour away and during the winter I would sometime not be able to make it because of weather.
bad,"It always seemed to me that the people working there weren't especially happy, and would rather have been somewhere else.  I certainly wanted to be somewhere else!  I recently read an article that a big motivator in people changing jobs is not to leave the role itself, but to get away from their manager.  I would have left sooner if I could have done!  It's in the past now, so I can let it go."
bad,"This is a great place to get your start in clinical research but not a place I would advise to stay long term."
bad,"Covance was a great company before LabCorp buyout.  Since 2015 the culture has deteriorated and benefits have been cut drastically.  The culture has shifted from customer service and quality data to that of micromanaging budgets and expenses.  Multiple mass layoffs done in both public and secretive manner further eroded the culture and job security through 2017.  I once would have recommended them as a great place to gain experience in the industry, but cannot in good conscious do that anymore."
bad,It was a financially beneficial place to work but I did not enjoy the people who i worked with or the corporate environment. They did not have good trainings.
bad,"The company at whole never really looked at its employees to see why they had such a high attrition rate. The training left a lot to be desired, it set an individual up for failure."
bad,Enjoyed the client contact and being part of an organization that makes a difference in people's lives. Company is growing very fast and management has poor communication.
bad,"Work a lot of hours, weekends, holidays.  No work life balance.  Management keeps making the same mistakes over and over again.  The benefits got a lot worse over the last year."
bad,"Good place to add time to cumulative work experience.  There is an entire bureaucratic level of tasks on top of your study projects that add 25% of uncompensated time to your workload."
bad,"If you are looking career development, this is not the place"
bad,"Over all there wasn't much of a work/life balance. "
bad,"Environnement de travail agréable - équipe sympathique"
bad,"Great to start. Be careful of Management. Lots of nepotism and harassment. If you can find better, get better.  Get the skills you need from this company and move along a better path."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of collecting samples and scanning them into long term storage drawers. Very mundane, very boring, but absolutely necessary because it is the backbone of their business. I learned how to handle dry ice and liquid nitrogen but that was basically it. Management was pretty disconnected with the lower level employees. In fact when I was let go I was never given a warning or was approached why anyone, I got a call that night after work from the contracting company that got me the job saying I got let go. To me that was a classless move. Most of the coworkers were nice but none of them were too worried about making friends with anyone. The hardest part of the job was not going crazy. It was super boring and not very engaging, I would rather do hard manual labor. The most enjoyable part was the unlimited overtime."
bad,"I work in the call center at Covance and I have been here for over 4 years. I started through the Temp Agency and was advised that it was a Customer Service position but when I got here I found out it was a call center position. I stayed because I needed a stable job and position. I do everything on my program and have been the go to person for questions, trainings and updates for a little over 3 years now. Management is horrible ( for a lack of better words). There is a lot of micromanagement and lack of self - respect from management. I was actually told, while I was pregnant, by my direct supervisor that she has no sympathy for pregnant women because she was still here giving interviews while in labor. How rude and disrespectful right? My co-workers are the best and really keep me going throughout the day. We have recently lost holiday time and the benefits have gotten worst and more expensive. We have lost our bonus' and the company is requiring us to complete more work. I enjoy my co-workers however the hardest part of my day is dealing with my supervisor, whom likes to micromanage to make sure that everything is completed in a timely manner however; wants to have personal conversations ALL DAY long."
bad,"Unfortunately, my experience at Covance has been mediocre at best.  The management plays favorites. There are limited chances for advancement. It is rare to hear any employees say positive things about the company."
bad,"Not a good job they make you do all the senior employee work I would never work there again. only 30 minute lunches. You work like a slave. As a temp they except you to make 50 calls a day. while the permanent employees sit on there butts and talk all day. I never enjoyed this job the whole time the supervisior watched you like a hawk,"
bad,"very busy, micro managed, co workers family oriented., rate of pay low. management not friendly. looking for new opportunities were I am able to enhance my current skills while growing with the company."
bad,"Worked there as a contractor. Underpaid, only given negative feedback. Five contractors were up for perm hire, the only one not hired was the US citizen, over 50 who had more education and experience. Mangement played big time favoritism. "
bad,"You sign on for one role, but you end up taking on many “hats” with no pay increase. There is a high turnover rate, (which increases the workload for everyone) and leads to unrealistic expectations. Management is unorganized and lacks effective communication. Training sucks. You’re basically thrown to the wolves and hope you can succeed at faking it until you make it. It was depressing going into work after a while. The only thing that helped me get through my shift were my amazing co-workers."
bad,"High throughput laboratory. After learning a few methods, expect to repeat these methods every day for years without new opportunities to expand your skill set because now you're ""too valuable"" at what you do. You'll constantly fight to be noticed and allowed to spend time on new projects or learn a new method."
bad,"After the acquisition, I thought working for Covance would bring more training but it did not. I could have learned so much more and would have been better equipped to work independently, with less stress.There is never any down time and you play catch up on the weekends. Work/life balance was nonexistent for me.The people is what makes going to work enjoyable. And the turnover was too many to count."
bad,"Very busy and understaffed.  Employees do not feel appreciated, but he people are hard working and wonderful to work with.  Lots of opportunities to learn about drug development"
bad,I worked with 4 different people to train me to do a job then i got the job to where i only had 1 or 2 mistakes the i get a new person and i have multi-able mistakes when i explain to the new lead i was never asked to do this before she said well this is the way i do it  really rude then tells the head supervisor I was argumentative but I was just trying to get an clear understanding
bad,"They are surviving on the backs of their people, while calling it 'process improvement'.  You can only squeeze so much juice  from a turnip.  Eventually the system will break."
bad,"one grows professionally in their customer service skills, however their is no job security."
bad,"regularly have to work non paid overtime due to extreme high workload which must be completed before end of day before you can finish. Majority of staff work through their breaks and lunch to meet unrealistic targets and even work throug conference call meetings as so busy. Given far too much workload with very little training if any all online and expected to work everything out independently.  The management have no time for your training needs or for support and also far too busy to even notice you never mind mentor you.Underpaid for level of hours have to put in. Stressful culture where everyone is overworked and worried do to their own targets. Foreign managers with poor English, lack of HR sensitivity or professionalism in weekly one to ones. Only good to gain experience in short term and leave for something better."
bad,Roles and responsibilities related to IT Risk & Compliance as well as Quality Assurance need to be clearly defined.  Team collaboration is essential since the staffing model is lean and the job demands are great.  Individuals with experience in this arena should be highly valued.  Support of supplier audits and timely replies to RFIs and RFPs are critical for ongoing business relationships and potential sales.
bad,I would recommend this company to anyone that is in need of a job but not necessarily for advancement or room for growth. It is a great job if you are looking to maintain a stable job with no room for advancement. Busy environment and multi-tasking are daily necessities.
bad,A typical day is starting 60 seconds after shift starts or you are late and 60 seconds to clock out at end of shift or considered OT and frowned on. Inbound calls screening patients for financial assistance for medication that they can not afford or do not have insurance for. Training is extremely fast paced and if you can not produce immediately you are terminated and most of the staff is based on temporary employees. Co- workers were fine to work with and it was great being able to help someone in need find coverage for the medication. The hardest part of the job is it changes continuously daily and there are too many people telling you how to do it and they don't agree on the process. Standards are not consistent for the way they treat employees and show much favoritism.
bad,Turnover is quicker than on-boarding because management does not deliver on word.  They have lost forward guidance and still have no realy objective strategy.
bad,"Nice Building to work in everyday but I was immediately turned off by the unorganized, bad training. It's no way to prepare employees for the position. It's no surprise the turnover rate and them being behind. If You're not close friends with your supervisor or are not the type to suck up, your job is in jeopardy. It's not fair but I've seen it firsthand."
bad,"I loved working under pressure and the thought that reports and audits needed to be completed by deadlines. What this company does tho is treat their employees like children with the micro managing. If the micro managed wasnt so much then this company and the enviornment would be great. The supervisors there tend to come off too strict and arent very helpful when it comes to asking for assistance with any escalated issues or for any questions. My co workers were great to work with, seeing that most i have trained when they first started."
bad,a typical day at work consist of getting there at 5 am then standing for 6-10 hours then I would have to work in multiple sections of the department. The workers who arrived at 5 am are always the last one to leave. Management always seems to be scattered and confused with their employees.  The hardest part of the job is standing for multiple hours.
bad,"Started working, company was strong, somewhere along the way went from being a debit free company to being on the market and sold, without any notice to employees."
bad,Poor management at the time I left. They eliminated my position and were not very helpful with re-training or offering a different role in the company.
bad,"The warehouse is unorganized and overstocked while also under staffed with management refusing to hire the help appropriately needed,  The volume of product delivered varies day to day and is often times is extremely demanding. There are no opportunities to move upward in position or to achieve higher responsibilities within the warehouse.  The one benefit to the position is the relaxed atmosphere."
bad,"Upper management has very little to do with the everyday and direct supervisors seem to care very little about their employees. In my department, there is a lot of miscommunication and it can be a toxic environment. Also, the animals are bred too frequently and culled too much. It's a sad situation and depressing place to be for five days a week."
bad,"Been at Covance in ClinOps, in various roles more than five years after working at two other large CRO's.  We used to be the best CRO for CRAs, Line Managers, & Project Managers.  However changes to bonus structure post LabCorp merger (no more bonuses for CRAs) and benefits (more expensive healthcare, no rx refills except mail order, loss of a ""discount"" on premiums if you exceed a BMI threshold ) mean our compensation falls short of other other CROs."
bad,I love the job! There is a lot of training for this position because they use the Seibel computer program for data entry. The biggest problem is that we didn't have instructions from our supervisor.  I was trained and coached by employees from the San Diego Campus. The program I was on was new so my team members and supervisors were all learning the same material at the same time.
bad,I was a contract Registered Nurse. I was out one day for my daughter for a fracture and three days sick with urgent clinic notes for myself for bronchitis and severe upper respiratory infection. I was let go over the phone the morning I was returning and told not to call again. I had no write-ups and on time daily. I am stunned at the cut-throat world we live in.
bad,"A typical day in the labs at Covance would start and end mostly the same way: monotony. Employees are responsible for registering and storing various human samples for medical studies. Using an outdated system, hundreds of thousands of samples are stored in a seemingly endless cycle of never having enough storage space. Management reacts to increases or decreases in volume sluggishly, and is often unwilling to reward or accommodate employees accordingly."
bad,Keep it short and sweet. The company used to be a desirable place to work but has gone quickly downhill after being acquired. Work life has not manageable for people with families and coworkers are underpaid compared to job titles else where in the country.
bad,"getting patients approved for loans to pay for their medication for different illness, out going and incoming calls to and from patients reminding them about their refills, loan, appointments, medications, side effects."
bad,"Do not leave your present job for Covance. Poor management,low pay, high demands, you never know what you will be doing from one day to the next, high turn-around, you can be a great employee in the morning and get fired in the afternoon......horrible place to work at!"
bad,"I've worked in the in-life department at Covance for 5 years. The only positive thing I have to say about my experience at Covance is that they're willing to pay you for the work you do. There is unlimited overtime. The next best thing is that you will probably form lifelong friendships, which is saying something post-college. The animals are fun for a while."
bad,My typical week was spent traveling/monitoring on-site 4-5 days per week.  I often spent weekends working on trip reports and expense reports.  My travel was far since my sites were not regional.
bad,A lot of BS going on. High turnover rate. They like to give you the run-around. Takes forever to reply even to a simple message. Gives me a headache thinking about them
bad,"Leaving company after many years. Since merger with LabCorp, it is not the same company. Micromanagement, inconsistent expectations, antiquated CTMS without all components - the stripped down version."
bad,"Although the paychecks do not bounce, the work you will be responsible for completing is mostly re-work or unclear instructions as even the management study team does not fully understand they responsibilities and roles as study team members."
bad,"Typical work day is intense and very scheduled. I learned to interact with IT and business leaders at upper company echelons. Management was very focused on short term goals. My co-workers were reactive to strong pressures to perform while continuous changes were occurring in the project and the IT organization. Most of the activity was routine but communication across the organization and with vendors was the most challenging aspect.  Learning the new business process as the project progressed was most informative and not typical of the industry. It showed how Covance was able to reach its goals effectively, However the impact on staff was not generally not beneficial."
bad,"Low paying very demanding work. Not really interesting work. No room for intellectual/professional growth. Salary too low, intense, very repetitive work."
bad,It was a very nasty job and the vet had very poor social communication skills.
bad,"It is very physically demanding, stressful and long days. I wouldn't go back because it is very hard to work with animals that are being tested on. It was really hard emotionally."
bad,I worked with a group of people in the screening department. The entire department seemed to be depressed. They did not treat with respect the volunteers coming in to be screened for different pharmaceutical research studies. Also there was a lot of people who had been there a long time and had their favorites so the area continued to be a gloomy place to go to work each day.
bad,"Upper management very poor, does not encourage school for advancement promotes within.  Has tenancies to hire current employees family members over qualified people."
good,Management changed. Now under micromanaging and passive agressive methods. Constant feel of pressure. Speaking to coworkers frowned upon. Write ups are easy to obtain.
good,"You are tied to your phones, can only have so many minutes a day for restroom breaks, it is a not ""what you know""  environment but a ""who you know"".  The culture is very strict, poor employee moral, career advancement is very difficult."
good,"Presently not happy in my position. While the company offers perks and benefits, my area has lacked the proper support and recognition therefore exhibiting poor retention of talent.  "
good,Overworked employees lead to slip ups in lab.  Worked average 54 hours a week.  And when cuts were made to hours were expected to do same work with a lot less time.  Even the top technicians struggled with this.  Came home exhausted to the point there was no work life balance only covance.
good,"Overall, loved the work, great scientific staff, morale progressively decreased with the overwhelming pressure to do more than capacity allowed. Good people left, sponsors were unhappy, we were set up for failure."
good,"Covance was a great place to work until Lab corp took it over. COmpany culture has declined rapidly, upper management treats employees like a number. Massive layoffs recently (700+)"
good,"The most shady place to work. Rules are always changing, plus they will hire anyone but you as manager. Not a wise investment of your time. Plus the pay is a joke! Wendys pay more."
good,The employees are well underpaid because they have no competition. The work load is ridiculous. I love the work that I do but it is impossible to get it done.
good,"There is no job security, or work life balance. They run on a points system. At ten point you are terminated, but that's still subjective. The training is poor and unorganized. Once training is over in about 8 weeks or so, they stick you in an office with one or more fellow employees and let you fend for your self. The system is run on a program that is out-dated and confusing."
good,The people you work with are wonderful! You will build great relationships and have a wonderful time while you are there! The only down side is the lack of work/life balance.
good,Management did not hold up to there end when it comes to accepting Employees with disabilities. Management Staff needs more training to be well rounded. Employees should not fear the upper authorities.
good,"their is no room for growth. If you are management you are paid well, if you are an employee they do not pay well. I did like the people I worked with and I enjoyed helping clients"
good,"The work environment was very clickish. Very hard to get help, advance or do much if you weren't in the right circles. Great amenities in the building. Bathrooms, library, gym, showers and cafeteria."
good,Covance management was great while they had a manager for my department. However the US team does a lot of work or seems to be more hard working group than the other regions. The recent lay off was unfair in some circumstances but in any field you have to accept the good with the bad.
good,"Constantly banning promotions, putting leave on hold etc. Employees tend to bond over how much they hate work. Overtime is a must and 90% of the time you don't get paid for it, even if its compulsory."
good,"Majority of project team members worked hard and were great assets in getting the job done.  Unfortunately, many were over resourced which meant long hours and/or the potential for missed deadlines.  Ultimately contributed to the loss of good employees."
good,"I did not like working here at all, training is horrible and they don't explain about the animals, you find out when you are walking in the halls. Friendly team mates usally"
good,"Working for this company, as a call center employee, is very trying.  You're often left in the dark on most things because the management is extremely unorganized, reactive instead of proactive and very unprofessional.  The culture is very depressing and promotes back-stabbing, lies and unprofessionalism.  They're also all about the numbers instead of the quality of work.  As long as you're fast and don't care about the errors you make, you'll make it here!  There is a very high turnover rate due to having the majority of the staff being contingent workers.  At the same time, they also have direct hires."
good,"A typical day at work use to be bit hectic but it was fun as everyday brought a new challenge."
good,I loved the work but employees are overworked and unappreciated.
good,Covance is a global Clinical Research Organization providing the employee base with continuous learning opportunities.
good,No recognition to one's performance.. Lots of dirty politics
good,"Due to my assignment here by the temp agency, I was fortunate to have been given a minimal amount of work security for nearly a year. There was the possibility of being hired full-time to Covance. However, after ten months of employment, it turned out that the company had hired too many temps and needed to let go of those who had already been on-staff almost a year. I was glad to have learned how to operate the Salesforce.com database and was able to share my tips for maximizing performance with other temporary employees. I enjoyed getting to know some of the other employees, permanent and temporary, and obtained good advice on the job itself as well as other areas of my academic pursuits."
good,"Since I work with 4 protocol my day could be tracking documents to file in the Trail Master FIle, scan lettes and track using various excel spread sheets and putting them into Lotus Notes-Trail Tracker, Filing various items."
good,"Too many hours, work 12 days in a row every Other week, not enough money to be worth it. "
good,"I can’t speak on the entire company,so many different departments, comes with different lead/point people and supervisors. Not all the supervisors are the same some are very friendly and helpful some are very irritable and unhelpful and will snap on you for asking a question. I can’t say I ran into too many angry workers, it's very competitive in some departments especially specimen management . It can be like a bad high school movie sometimes and a lot of spreading other people’s information or rumors, but this is the biggest company I’ve worked for. So I don’t know if this is a thing among bigger companies. I’ve met a lot of great ppl. I miss the money but I did wrk really hard for it 😂 I would only recommend this place if you are use to hard labor. And moving fast pace without being to frustrated and or sitting or standing all day."
good,"High Volume, High Expectation company with very little advancement. Turnover rate is unusually high and they make no effort to retain new hires. You're expected to work miracles with their demands."
good,"Covance is an interesting environment to work in.  The employees are very nice, knowledgeable, and work very hard at their jobs.  The global processes are being restructured."
good,"I worked from my home when not traveling. I did not have the opportunity to participate in special events located in Princeton or satellite offices."
good,"This is the wild,wild west of animal care!! No room for moving up, if your are a woman, look elsewhere. Poor culture,no direction, animal care is not priority."
good,"Covance is a service provider which has made several strategic changes since being acquired by LabCorp.  There is no clear direction as of this time and due to lack of Managerial oversight and guidance, several aspects of the business are being left stranded."
good,"Stressful and emotionally draining and doesn't pay for the type of job required, PTO was only benefit, overtime and working only every 3rd weekend was nice too, some of the hours required were crazy (starting time at 330 am)"
good,"Covance can be a great place to work if you don't mind working 50-60+ hours a week.  If you want work/life balance, this isn't the place to be."
good,"I was with Covance CMA for over 6 years.  A lot of changes since  I was first hired.  Due to the changes, the moral of the coworkers dropped significantly."
good,"Covance was bought out by LabCorp in the past couple of years and the quality of almost everything at that company has gone way downhill."
good,"Nothing positive to say....there are cliques all over the place and if your not one to gossip or get involved in the ""high school"" drama then you won't be a good fit. Don't waste your time...."
good,More work with less people. Work seems rushed to get them closed and move on to next project which makes it very stressful. The hours are flexible and people are good. There is not much room for advancement and pay is low for the work being done.
good,Toxic work environment. Management is awful. Short staffed everywhere. Benefits have gone down the drain since labcorp took over. This used to be a great place to work. Now I can't wait to get out.
good,Since lab corp has taken over benefits took a big hit and they fired a lot of people even though the research market is up.  They also only care about the numbers and do not care about employee retention.  This comany is going in a bad direction and I can only hope that they realize it before it is too late.
good,"Good Pay. Health insurance benefits could be better. You are hired as a customer service representative, but its not about customer service. Every Penny will be Squeezed out of you. Very 3rd World Underdeveloped Country Culture/Environment (Covance is Global). Training done by seasoned co-workers (lots of room for moving up), training is horrible, you may be in a room the size of a closet with 15 others, if you complain, you become a target. Attitude here is not about caring for employees, but about producing for the Pharmaceutical clients who are wealthy, so Supervisors are stressed in which you will be stressed. They are just all over the place, NO ONE smiles, Very Depressing environment. You will need the PTO for a weekly ""Mental Day""."
good,"A typical day work at Covance contains talking to patients on the phone doing a lot of data entry. Dealing with supervisors on a daily bases, phone training with clients in other states."
good,"The people are a great bunch, helpful, supervisors one is great , one is ike dead fish ( she  needs to get some  kind of personality,  one is so fake. The rest i didnt  have much contact. Any problems u have they call  u after u get home, and like i said watch your back , they call you at like 8 at night to tell your let go , no balls to meet with you before you leave for the day, they dont want to let the others know VERY SNEAKY,  they make a big deal about money spent on training, but instead of working with you , they just you go. Just a side note to the head of the department.  ONE LESS PARKING SPACE YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR."
good,"I worked with some of the greatest people.  When their hard work would often go unrecognized by management, co-workers would go out of their way to congratulate others on their accomplishments, both professional and personal.  Co-workers were also quick to help others when it was needed and were very openly appreciative when the help was returned in kind."
good,"I currently work there as a program specialist answering phones and facilitating access to drugs for rare diseases.  There is a large volume of work with multiple projects going on simultaneously.  Management is unorganized and makes promises to clients without taking into consideration the program specialists' current work load.  Frequent changes to program guidelines and trainings in addition to the high work load and stressful phone calls lead to high turnover.  The people that work there are warm and inviting, however it does not make up for the amount of work that is required and how much you get paid.   The good thing is that you receive about 4 weeks of paid vacation/sick leave, however you must get prior approval for not only days off, but any late arrivals/early leave for the day.  "
good,A typical day at work consists of assisting patients find the best solution to help them pay for a much need drug to relieve them of pain that endure on a daily basis.
good,"While the job itself could be very satisfying as we were helping people obtain medication they previously could not afford, the management could not handle the stress of maintaining the number of benefit investigations needed to be done daily. That stress was relayed to the workforce. Moral was never very high due to this fact. however, the days would go by quickly as we were on the phone and busy so often we hardly knew where the time had gone. I especially enjoyed being able to begin my day at 6am and sometimes earlier."
good,"Very little room for advancement. Nothing good is remembered, only the mistakes. NO constructive feedback, only criticism with perfection expected. Overloading of work on a consistent basis and then management gets shocked when things get missed. And a horrible cafeteria to boot."
good,A good company however there are other better and better paying jobs.
good,"I worked at Covance for almost nine years and they do offer some nice advancement opportunities. Unfortunately the perks and flexibility have gone by the wayside due to the economy. They can be quite cut-throat, and constant changes to processes and policies maybe frustrating to some."
good,"Unless you are a Project Manager or Sr. Manager in the company, the compay pays poorly. The company has a weak IT infracture and is very behind in technology requiring manual entry. Many College students are brought in to do Associate roles with no experience but at low pay. In three years, they can advance to 3 different Specialist level roles. The job doesn't start paying well unless you are a Project Manager. PM can work at home so that is the best part of the company. There are no summer hours on Friday's but you can wear jeans. Management is terrible. Longevity is short. There are old school managers that want you to Yes them. HR is useless, they do not assist with anyone other than support the stupid managers. Most of the employees have rated management as not giving fair job evaluations. Raises are at least 18 months the first year, and then the second year is yearly. It is a good place to go to start out and learn about critical trials and how they set up sites but long term you are better going to another company. Lunch is only a half hour too."
good,I enjoyed this job while working with primates. My co-workers and I enjoyed interacting with the NHP's feeding and caring for daily.It was a sad day when we were told that the building was closeing.
good,Great place if you need to have flexibility in your work day to take care of stuff. Job security is great as no matter what you do it seems no one gets written up. As far as management helping advance your career or caring it seems to not exist at this location.
good,"A decent work place with normal amenities and work life, which at times can get boring and monotonous. No extra curricular activities or games room. No dorm room present for resting."
good,"Typical CPM experience: over promised at time of interview, failure to deliver by company after time of hire. Projects I worked were important, relevant, also in the TA I desired. Other than that the company fell short."
good,Its A lot of work  and very hard to move up. You will meet some great people along the way. Its a casual work Space. Some of the Supervisor are Great .
good,"the office environment is not so friendly , everyone is so involved with themselves,"
good,"The people overall is very smart, but management has buckled since the LabCorp takeover.  In the past year there has been a push for off shoring most of operational work."
good,"The company has seen better days. One day it will see better days again. Happy employees help make a company function at its best. If they turn their focus back toward their employees, they will see a big difference."
good,This is a nice place to begin but tends to be very clicky. If you are not a part of the right click of people or race then you can get lost or not well trained.
good,NA  Was released while on medical leave after extensive and numerous surgeries.  Utilized short term disability and was denied long term disability. Left a bad taste in my mouth as an employee
good,"Working at Covance was a very good learning experience as a Quality Specialist, but opportunities are extensive for a new college employees, experienced workers like myself are considered until certain point (train new employees, making them feel welcome and walk them into the organization environment), but overall it was a good working place."
good,"Work Life balance is a challenge.  The company focuses on bottom line over employees and loyalty is not treated as a value.  Management states one thing but does another.  If you just want to be a cog in the motor and treated as such, it is a fine place to work."
good,"As a temp, you are kept under a microscope and they could be let go for simple things. They are very strict and they are really stressful. As a temp you got no benefits and they do not excuse any emergencies or family emergencies so if you have to go to the hospital for any reason, it will negatively affect you and could be let go because of it. If I received benefits like permanent staff then it might be a little different but they do not compensate appropriately for this position."
good,"Their primary focus is getting new business but with changes in management, they've shifted their focus and many talented people are leaving because of the lack of leadership."
good,"Overall the company is a good company, I just happen to work with a manager who did not work well with her employees."
good,"When coming do to Database lock can be stressful"
good,"Unfortunately, since LabCorp purchased Covance a couple of years ago, there has been a distinct decline in culture.  We lost a CEO and President that actually cared for their staff and what we do for a living.  While benefits, PTO especially, is very generous, increasing healthcare cost, lack of leadership support and overall decline in our culture has caused this previously very dedicated employee to look elsewhere."
good,"A typical work day involved working with animals.  Handling different animals for testing.  This job also involved cleaning up"
good,Covance are a very American style company. There is a lot of internal competition and political infighting. The perks are good and they support internal training though.
good,"They hire a lot of new graduates without experience which is great, but the pay is pretty low for the amount expected from you and the advancement is pretty much nonexistent."
good,"The department has been seriously understaffed for many years. The inability to accurately forecast and plan the daily workload has resulted in staff essentially being held hostage for up to two hours after normal finish time, the mentality amongst management being that nobody can leave until all the work is done, or until given permission. Mandatory overtime in excess of 50 hours a month makes a mockery of the work/life balance the company claims to promote. Staff is treated poorly and are expected to routinely skip breaks or cut breaks short to manage the workload. Staff turnover has been absolutely insane and no attempt has been made to retain experienced staff. Management lacks people skills and appear to have been promoted as a consequence of incompetence at the previous level rather than actually possessing any sort of management qualities."
good,There seems to always be a sense of panic as whether or not you'll have a job the next day. People work very hard there but are rarely put on permanent. The turnover rate is very high.
good,Allows you to develop solid techniques and gain experience. Not many opportunities for advancement. Job is secure and people are good.
good,"Working as a Microbiologist for a contract research organization is very demanding and high stress with virtually no reward (dependent on management).  Focus is usually on getting the clients fast and accurate results which means the microbial testing needs constant coverage, including evenings, nights, weekends, and holidays.  These factors make for a very difficult work/life balance.  A typical day at work as a Microbiologist for a CRO includes processing incoming environmental and finished food samples from multiple clients, as well as post incubation plate counting, media transfers, and instrumentation (PCR and ELISA based assays).  Because the work is based on client needs, the day to day work load can vary drastically and can change in a moment's notice.  Work environment is very fast paced, unpredictable, and requires frequent overtime.  This job requires an individual who can work quickly and efficiently, who can go with the flow and does not get stressed out easily."
good,management was friendly and understanding. Management was willing to work with each employee based on their knowledge skills and needs. there was little room for advancement if you did not have a college Bachelors or masters degree. Experience was not valued.
good,"Review of project work"
good,Worked there a long time ago so many things could have changed.
good,"Very interesting work, however like stated before, unless you are a yes man that does not think for themselves, you will not advance in the company nor will management reward you for your efforts. Toxicology has the same management as before the plant site acquisition in 2008 and the cliques of leaders along with the 'quantity of quality"" motto ends up creating a workplace high in drama and employee confrontation."
good,Overall ok. Not great though. Not supporting one who does hard work. Only the ones who show build up grows well. Extract more work when they pay less.
good,"Covance allows you to grow and expand your skillset in a very short period of time, which is helpful when starting your career directly from undergraduate studies."
good,"Fast paced company that undergoes constant change.  Room for growth depending on the group.  Had really great managers and really bad managers, which can make or break you."
good,"A high volume lab which rewards low sample turnaround time"
good,"There are many challenges abound within the Covance work environment.  Mainly the staffing, training, & retention of staff members which has a direct effect on the management & performance of the clinical trials.  In past few months there has been a positive shift on the evaluation & implementation of those particular areas, which is a positive harbinger for the near future."
good,"Salary was okay, did not honor my experience, management was poor.  Inexperienced were in higher positions.  Not organized which added unnecessary work."
good,"Covance is great, but stressful environment. Good Benefits, lots of PTO. Little chance for advancement in my case. We are constantly in fear of our jobs leaving the US for India."
good,"A typical work day depends on the day, they monitor your every move. The attendance policy is not realistic. Honestly I think the experience is how you make it to be and could be depending on the program your in. Basically you need to be a happy robot."
good,The job was a 6 month contract job. I was placed there by an agency. I did not receive any benefits but was compensated financially to cover the benefits.
good,"A lot of family members and good friends in managerial roles, thus creating a gridlock on opportunities (Covance Indy location).  If you're looking for employment where training, promotion and internal advancement are the cornerstones of a company's success; this is not the place, unless your family or reeaally good friends with someone in management!"
good,"My typical day of work is logging on the computer in the morning, doing the job and logging off at the end of the day.  People at the office are more introverts and focused on work."
good,"I am still technically employed with them currently on short term leave, and its been 4 weeks since i have had a paycheck, because management can not seem to get the time corrected. plus my I have had 2 managers quit within 3 months so it's all a mess!"
good,"Covance had been a great company to work for; however, the past few years have been tough.  We were unable to hire new people and the lay-offs in April were not well thought out from a business perspective."
good,"They over work and underpay for what they expect. Long hours, high stress environment. The over time (when its available) makes for a great pay check. The people there are great, but at the end of the day, all the company cares about is numbers and is not afraid to cut things to make it still profitable."
good,"Good place to work and '""get your feet wet"" in the healthcare field. Fast-apced and CONSTANTLY changing, if you unable to handle constant changes do not apply."
good,Chiltern is a good company to work at with great people. Work life balance is good but left up to individual person.  You are left to get your work done as long as it is of good quality and on time.
good,"The pay was great, but you work long days, all this over time, and only have an half hour lunch. By the time you get home for the day you do not feel like doing anything else. Your life is completely taken over by this job, and that is why they pay so well."
good,Lots of hours are needed and you will work very hard. Do not value time away and company is currently under stockholder needs. However; you will be compensated very fairly
good,This is a very stressful but rewarding position. This job has excellent benefits. This position has a very strict schedule.
good,"Overall good atmosphere amongst employee, high staff turnover rate at bottom level as no security is assured in relation to hours of work/pay"
good,"La société est agréable, située à Meyrin avec un parking à distance nécessitant une navette. Les bureaux et le bâtiment sont plutôt vétustes. La position autorise un travail partiel ou total depuis la maison ce qui procure un meilleur équilibre vie professionnelle et personnelle. Malheureusement la charge de travail est lourde, les heures supplémentaires sont nombreuses et pour certaines personnes, les voyages d'affaires sont occasionnels."
good,My experience working at Covance was okay but the program that I was on was unbearable. Too many changes and not told to us in a timetable fashion.
good,"I worked at Covance a few years back.  It was a 6 month contract.  From my perspective it was a great place to work."
good,"Covance is a company full of highly educated and forward thinking employees.  Colleagues are bright, thoughtful, and client focused.  Management on the other hand works in silos and does not communicate and engage with their employees.  High turnover is a result."
good,"Many changes in the lab area have taken place, the employees all complain about wanting to go home moments from arriving. Management doesn't attend to individual needs in a timely fashion if at all."
good,A typical day is that I walk in and greet everyone. I turn on the computer and start taking calls. I have learned a lot. Some good which I intend to use in my next job and some bad which I no longer practice. My co-workers were always helpful. The hardest part of my job is when I am unable to help a client due to program restrictions.
good,"The work is fine no problem, long hours, up and down shifts, scheduling does not work around your schedule. CO workers are the best, helpful really a team. Management is okay. Typical day at work is standing on your feet for hours, double booked on rounds, lots of paperwork."
good,"Analyzed and researched benefit coverage for patients. Developed management principles including strategic planning, policy analysis, program evaluations, resource allocation and the coordination of resources and personnel"
good,"At first, management seemed very positive and appreciative of the very positive contributions I made.  But as new management took over following a merger with a lab Company, financial results took over full control of .decisions made"
good,"A typical day for a study coordinator involves creating reports and data table for clients regarding their research. When you go to the bathroom, you step in to what is essentially the equivalent to an indoor outhouse. It is disgusting. The building is old and outdated, as well as much too small for the size of the company. The work protocols are constantly changing which makes our work even more inefficient than it typically is. Responsibilities become unclear and depending on your supervisors (some are great some are terrible) these difficulties can be manageable."
good,"Covance is a great company that had a nice reward system in place to properly thank employees that went above and beyond."
good,Definitely a huge learning experience and self rewarding results that focused on helping patients. The company has a huge focus on white glove service.
good,"This company is great about working with employees on scheduled hours, very flexible. Most departments work well as teams, but there is a break down between departments. There are certain study directors who are difficult to work with and don't listen to the thoughts and opinions of the rest of the team. Be careful who you disagree with. Some employees carry out vendettas and look to implicate others for policy deviations and talk behind your back."
good,Covance provides great opportunities for placement students and graduate students. However it needs more opportunities for progression and the pay needs to be more competitive to encourage employees to stay with them
good,High turn over rate at this company. There is no job security at Covance. Not enough training is given as a new hire. I think that is very important when learning a new job.
good,"I had a wonderful manager at Covance. She was very helpful and kind. While I enjoyed the benefits of working from home, I also missed the opportunity to work face to face with colleagues.  The only time I met other Covance employees was a Bid Defense Meetings. Also, because this is a CRO, employees may be thrown into situations where they must perform tasks they have never done before, with limited formal instruction. You often have to figure things out on your own."
good,Very high paced and can be stressful. Expected to go over and beyond with little to no reward. Managers micro manage productivity and treat employees as numbers. I enjoyed the employees and weekends.
good,"Very strict about cell phones, strict dress code some days ,Everyone works together, it sucks working as a temp for the company you don't receive the same benefits as everyone."
good,Covance has an interesting dynamic. On one hand they do allow opportunities for employment within the central labs arena that most companies probably wouldn't offer. Especially for those who are in need of an entry level position this is a good start. However once you begin to gain your experience and work towards being more innovative in your thinking they are very quick to put you in a box.
good,"Not much different than any other company. The company runs on the ""two year plan"" . See what happens if you hit your numbers. Now cutting costs ……..."
good,"i learned a lot of great skills and tools at Covance that has pushed me to where I am today.  I do believe that the Directors that are hired into these roles could benefit from better training.  "
good,The job was quick and very competitive. There was a very high quota and the managers did not care about your feelings or illnesses. Their job was to make sure you put out numbers
good,"Worklife balance can be difficult.  Managers I have had are not very good/little to no training. Expect work to be done with minimum time to complete."
good,"Because there are various types of jobs at Covance, it is difficult to give an umbrella answer.  It was a typical Contract Research Organization when I worked there.  Typically, turnaround is higher in such companies.  They are looked at as companies to provide experience.  Because of this, it is slightly easier to get a job there as a scientist.  It offered a decent salary for entry level but the rate of increase did not keep up with inflation nor did it properly reflect performance."
good,"Where I work the environment is very drab, yet we are overwhelmed by work. Management has bitten off more than the department can chew and we employees are drowing beneath it."
good,"I usually check my email by 8am. Complete SOP in time to be up to date with study."
good,I enjoy the work at Covance however there are too many changes happening all at once and Senior Management are showing very poor leadership so the Project Managers do not know what processes they should be following.  In the end we are defi ning the processes ourselves.
good,Started at Covance working in the lab space. Had to work 12 or more weekends a year and 10 hour days were the standard. Management made it clear that employee retention and satisfaction was not a priority. Moving to the office was a great choice. Significantly less hours and much better work/life balance. Pay is not on par with similar jobs in the industry.
good,"Extremely busy work environment, 45+ hours a week is typical for most employees, not enough people doing the work, always understaffed in major departments that need the most help, about 50% of the management staff are there to help you improve, or they weed you out, good benefits w company, great co-workers, must have team attitude, too many changes to deal with for most people, stress level is very high, must be more dedicated to your job than your personal life."
good,"Pay scale is lower than other companies in Dane county, although benefits are fantastic.  Management doesn't  communicate well with other managers or staff"
good,"I've been there for about a year. It's a good entry level job for those looking to beef up their resume with customer service, computer skills, or health insurance knowledge. You'll be talking on the phone and doing data entry work most of the time. It's a pharma job. You'll be assigned to a specific client, and from there what you do specifically depends on the client. "
good,"Very relaxed to work there: hours are flexible, no dress code, tons of PTO."
good,"This was a good place to work, but with recent executive leadership changes, the environment changed from a family feel to very corporate/bottom line only.  With the loss of client contracts and not obtaining new contracts, Covance has become unstable.  Several reductions in force have taken place causing a very stressful atmosphere with current staff.  Additional changes to the benefits packages have been very detrimental to the employee."
good,Great global team that always puts their best foot forward and work well together no matter the time zone or challenging assigned protocols. Limited growth potential in certain departments
good,The company is downsizing after the merger with Chiltern.  Management never provided any notice that layoffs were imminent.  Learned on a Thursday that my last day was the following day.
good,We are micromanaged everyday. Management is too focused on micromanaging the negatives that they forget to compliment or even acknowledge the positives. This has a direct impact on the morale of the work environment.
good,"Overall, the core business is industry leading.  Overall talented employee base.  Priorities constantly get added without anything being deprioritized.  Consistently double booked in meetings.  Email and non-scheduled meetings occurred after hours."
good,"As a technician, an average day at work consisted of patient care, keeping up to date on procedures and upcoming protocols, and obtaining samples for processing and storage. Fairly general work responsibilities, but the workload itself keeps you on your toes for the most part."
good,"Benefits/remuneration are acceptable, work life/balance difficult to juggle due to number of studies active at any given time, rewarding career pathways and interesting work."
good,"Great people and fun place, but with no hope for decent pay or professional advancement.  More flexible schedule vs. big business downtown."
good,"Hard Work, Facility is understaffed. Poor work-life balance. Good grounding and training for skills. Poor advancement options, salary poor compared to industry competitors."
good,"The HR department does not generally follow company policies regarding internal job postings, which deters opportunities for lateral moves and advancement."
good,"Management had issues helping with productivity. Trained in shipping and registering of human specimen samples. People you work with are easy to get a long with, and are willing to help where it is needed."
good,I enjoyed working with the drug safety team overall.  I would have liked more interoffice organization and standardized processes.
good,"Need more staff, for the amount of work that is coming in.  No work life balance AT ALL."
good,"the day starts as early as 6AM, which means it ends as early as 2:30PM, which allows you to run errands or take care of matters after work. However the daily work schedule is very daunting and stressful. As a third party vendor, it is not easy to extract information from insurance companies due to HIPAA. The management is not very neutral however likes to play favorites and does give preference to employees they like but make it seem as if the opportunities are given due to the employees efforts which is not at all the case. Co-workers are close."
good,Covance was a great place to work. The staff was friendly and hardworking.
good,"Phase 1 clinical research, testing healthy patients for side effects, busy days but always learning something new"
good,"Growing CRO experiencing some industry challenges.  "
good,"A typical day would be to have multiple timed events such as blood draw, vitals signs, drug screens through out the day, very busy until end of shift, high volume days the norm."
good,"While working for Covance I have learned so much about multitasking, working with a bigger group and problem solving. My days are long and physically strenuous. I start at 6 AM and end anywhere from 3:15 - 5 PM. The hardest part of my job is the physical work, which my body can not handle much longer. I love the employees that I work with and the animals are the best. With the long hours and high demand for Animal Technicians to be at work it's very difficult to move into a different department within Covance."
good,I simply feel that it is time to move on. Working at Covance has been an excellent experience.
good,"The location and hours are good, parking is starting to be challenging and the lunch thing. We only get 30 minutes and do not have a cafeteria."
good,The company is a great place to get work experience as a fresher but can get stressful as and when business requires it.               The work culture as a whole is good.
good,"Covance is a good company to work for, however not if you like an extremely quiet office, nobody really talks much, however we do work in a fantastic building with a free coffee machine!!!"
good,there are a lot of opertunities here but they come with trade offs. managment is not the best and needs to stick up for thier employees when they need them the most
good,Management is awesome and co workers is fun and outgoing. Only issue is pay were to little and location were far with too much traffic to and from work.
good,If you are ok with tight reigns on you or tight discipline then this is a good place for you. You have to take exact time breaks. You have to meet a certain metrics or you’re gone.
good,The job itself is very intuned with building team bonding skills and making a fun environment. The compensation could be better along with more opportunities for advancement.
good,"Great place to start your scientific career, a lot of experience people to learn from and develop your skills and knowledge. Big workload a a lot of stress associated with tight deadlines and demanding clients."
good,"An environment committed to change. But often without essential communication from management. Many initiatives negatively impact the employees, while the focus is on corporate growth."
good,"My time at Covance has helped to improve various skills such as teamwork, communication, time management and organisation skills. I have had various opportunities to develop clinical skills such as ECG, Vitals, Cannulation and venepuncture."
good,I learned a lot workimg for this company and I was always challenged and busy.  I made a lot of friends and enjoyed my growth as an employee during my time with Covance.
good,"Is becoming bigger, so employees are being lost in the shuffle.  Lots of the perks that used to exist no longer do such as bonuses, company sponsored events.  Benefit packages have sky rocketed."
good,"A good company to start one's career. Long term career goals can be difficult to achieve, since the company runs on a very lean staff. There is no bench strength. If someone leaves, the remaining staff must pick up the workload. Everyone is overworked and there is no work/life balance. No bonuses for anyone under a director level. Thus, employees are expected to work 60+ hours a week, achieve unrealistic financial goals and are awarded a minimal yearly merit increase. Very tough environment to boost morale and retain good employees. Company wants to backfill open positions with minimal salaries, but wants to attract high quality talent."
good,most enjoyable part at Covance was learning about the industry and processes.  The coworkers were fantastic and worked well in a team environment.  Not much opportunity to move up.
good,"Maybe I could attribute it to having worked as an intern, but I sure avoided applying to this place after I earned my degree.  Some of the people I worked with were aggressive and nosey.  Meanwhile, I developed a macro-based Excel application for the company, that created PivotCharts for analytics purposes - and I realized a year later that I could have just used the ""refresh data"" button at the top of Excel.  How is it that my 23-year-old self presented this to executive and directors, and no one caught on to how one could have simply pressed ""refresh data"".  I am appalled by it.  That being said, the work environment is very nice, and I enjoyed going into work because of that."
good,"Clinical research holds the promise of life-changing treatments, medical breakthroughs, and better health for all. That's why LabCorp's clinical research division, Covance, has been passionately conducting research for more than 35 years."
good,"Great place to learn different skills, and season in the healthcare space. Good benefits, holidays, flexibility, compensation, career advancement. Work life balance should be the onus of the individual and not expected from the company. Overall - good place to nurture your career"
good,"I found the culture at Covance to be great, it was the working conditions that I took issue with. In order for you to perform your duties, which was an extraordinarily daunting workload, it was necessary to cut corners to complete it in a timely fashion,  which I'm not comfortable doing. Also, the storage system for which specimens are stored is archaic and a physical danger to the specimen and the worker themselves."
good,"The company is currently experiencing the pro's and con's of growing pains. Organizational  changes, increased business, Lap Corp partnership........."
good,"Typical day is challenging."
good,I enjoyed working at Covance until mid-2006 when a new VP came on board.  This person had no interest in working with anyone that had  been a part of the company for a long period of time and opted to lay me off in early 2008.
good,The work load was too much for the pay. Managers will keep pilling up your work task and you will be micro managed.  Workplace had a nice culture with friendly people.
good,"Overall nice company to in as it is start up branch in Bangalore. Friendly approach, even if there is any personal or professional issue you can easily approach the senior people without any hassle. Very flexible in timing and location is awesome for commuting."
good,Covance has some outstanding people and have a friendly working environment.  I am very impressed with the dedication of individuals and their focus on doing what is best for their customers.   This pro costumer approach can drive disconnected and non-standard approaches at times.
good,"Working as a study technician is a good stepping stone to move up within the company, or elsewhere. However, with the company constantly going under new management, things change often and job satisfaction can quickly decrease."
good,I enjoyed my time here and Ilearnt a lot. The environment was friendly and people were always willing to help. During my 12months here I learnt lots of new things
good,It has different locations. There is competition between different locations. And Company's revenue is the main target. Everyone has to work so hard to meet the on time rates. But it provides many PTO.
good,They did not honor their original promise of part-time employment.  We were asked to work on weekends.  Management did not provide a safe environment to voice opinions.
good,Good Company. Going through transition that affecting the people but yet keep the work environment busy.Very busy work atmosphere. The greatest part is working with good people .
good,Seeking an entry level job in pharma/clinical research? Covance is a great place to start. Hands-on experience with clinical research docs and clinics.
good,25 years and not even a thank you when the shut down the plant.  The managements only concern was the bottom line.  Employees were considered a necessary evil.
good,"There isn't one day that is the same at the Covance biorepository. This does not mean it is too difficult, but it does keep you on your toes. Working at the biorepository showed me how a typical workplace is."
good,"Enjoyed working in Covance and had very good team"
good,Covance had not made their mark using technology and had a long way to go. Work over there was challenging since we were entering an unknown territory with technology for most of the people.
good,"Resolving claims and coding issues related to the launching of new pharmaceuticals and medical devices."
good,it has been many years since i worked at Covance. I left for a career change. I miss the great friendships that i aquired while working in the lab setting.
good,No comment. This demand for comment must be stopped as it is rude and unproductive. A water of valuable time is not a worthy endeavor and no comment should be more than sufficient.
good,The company has purchased other companies and was recently purchased itself. There is a certain level of uncertainty regarding job stability in the future.
good,"When i first started working at Covance, it was an exciting time. The managers were nice and the colleges were very friendly and helpful. It is a fast pace environment and you must learn quickly but it was helpful that i started in working in a group to learn the SOP's. As time passed and I grew into my role, the department decided to move in a different direction. My managers in my department were shifted. That was a change for the worse. The new management micro managed my work very closely. I can not speak for anyone else but i did not like that very much. Moral in the department plummeted. Although it was not great it was not all bad. I learned so much and i really enjoy learning."
good,"Covance is great with lip action, but there is not actual follow through."
good,the job requires extensive physical which is not comparable to the low pay. The environment is hazardous and dangerous because dealing with mice and rats which were injected with medication and they bite the handlers.
good,"A very important laboratory (cGMP Lab) was shut down with most functions incorporated into other areas or moved to a UK lab.  Located near the Madison, WI airport, air traffic noise was a problem."
good,"Working at Covance as a first job had its ups and downs in CFS. It was a good opportunity to get my foot into the working force and it helped that the work wasn't too overly complicated to begin a first job.  Unfortunately, the work tends to be 'cookbook chemistry' and isn't all that intellectually demanding.  Which to me made me feel like I lost some of my skills.  The work culture here also seems to have more of an emphasis on quantity and not always quality. Though there have been some recent changes to improve this which is happy to see."
good,"I have worked at Covance for 2 1/2 years. The employees are dedicated, friendly, helpful, easy to work with. I learned how to operate a waste water treatment plant and obtained a license from Pa. DEP."
good,"Work environment / conditions vary widely depending on the department. The company is occasionally disjointed."
good,"There is no room for advancement.  Plus, there is not any career path set in place to advance."
good,The company's mission is a major factor to attracting and retaining talent. Upper management needs to be more connected to employees.
good,Good place to work. Pay not as good as industry standard. Fast paced. Diverse group of people. Opportunities within the organization.
good,"Die Arbeit erfordert persönliches Engagement durch ich viele neue Fähigkeiten und Techniken erlernt habe. Ich war größtenteils mit dm Management der Firma zufrieden, auch wenn ich nicht immer alle Entscheidungen als vorteilhaft gesehen habe. Die Kollegen sind nett und kompetent. Prozesse sind manchmal zu langwierig und kompliziert. Am besten ist der Einblick in eine große Bandbreite an verschiedenen Tätigkeiten innerhalb dieser Branche."
good,The company and their clients have high expectations so put your game face on as soon as you step through the door. It's time to work.
good,Ok but a bit restrictive depending on your chosen qualifications. Some fields of science are more respected and better thought of than others. Tends to be a reactive rather than a proactive company.
good,"Very target focuses business with some great colleagues and fun job tasks.  "
good,I loved working at Covance. I learned a lot about the clinical trials that take place in order for medicine to be approved by the FDA. I loved my job.
good,fast paced and challenging.  Good career progression and growth.  Was given amazing opportunities.  Management team needs an overhaul.
good,The co workers and other agents are very friendly.  The company has made alterations and improvements to the working enviroment.  This has made work more enjoyable.
good,"Tres peu d'activite sur le site "
good,I enjoyed my time at Covance. It is a good place to learn the basics of high quality data recording and lab work. I would recommend this place to anyone who has just graduated from university.While the career progression may not be ideal it is worth spending 2 years here to learn.
good,"Covance provided good benefits and a fairly flexible schedule (hours, work from home availability); however, I felt that my role included too much financial accountability that was not originally explained.  I had to account for financial information that was performed in start-up even though my role was in maintenance and I felt that this was never fully explained up-front.  Otherwise, I was comfortable with my role and I gained valuable experience being in the CRO role and seeing things from that point of view."
good,Overall my experience working for Covance inc was a mixture of positive and negative. Management does well to put you into a position to not fall but not much training is provided when you are placed into a more demanding job position.
good,"•	Reviewed and implemented SOPs and SSPs (Study Specific Procedures) using various information systems including web tracking, inventory, Query, IVRS, Oracle Clinical and CRFXpress"
good,"Patient work, rewarding, stable, profitable, coworkers friendly, learned a lot about business,"
good,"I did not enjoy working for this company...."
good,"I was a tech who entered in plasma samples into the pc, and barcoded them and made them ready for analytical. I enjoyed most the people who I worked with."
good,"Good benefits, great hours plenty of overtime. Friendly atmosphere."
good,Call around and verify insurances for different companies.
good,"Pay was great, but micro managers was unbearable. Managers like to delegate but they do not like to work."
good,Schedule for work at a different time each day. a lot of blood draws. screening for drug studies.
good,"While deadlines were always looming, things stayed relatively calm. The hierarchy slowed change by requiring approval far up the line when competent workers could have had it done sooner. Overall, not bad."
good,"Growing company with a lot of potential.  However, got to always keep management aware of your interest.  Some management is unlikely to change perspective."
good,I would have stayed had I not decided to move out of state. I loved my manager.
good,"This company is a great place to start your career if you are interested in biotech. However, if you are interested in long term growth you may have to find another company that can provide new and challenging opportunities."
good,"The experience with the company is extremely diverse, depending on what department/area that you work in. A good company to work for if you are in the right role. If you are in NCFS, look to move out."
good,title says it all really. been with company for over 5 years. have had 8 different supervisors.
good,A company with good benefits and generally an ok place to work. Easy to move around within the company if you wanted to. Learned good skills in the animal house.
good,"A lot of competition, not a lot of room for growth. Micro-management. Not a lot of freedom, they try to keep you under their thumb a lot, not very understanding."
good,"Covance senior management does not communicate well.  Processes are changed frequently. Management hires from outside and expects lower level staff to train higher level staff.  It's quite a smack in the face.  "
good,Above average company to work with new management (LabCorp) buyout. I did enjoy working at Covance but my last few years were unimpressive. Requested to improve skills with training and mentors for higher responsibility and positions but no available projects or training was given.
good,"Flexible work schedule. Solid compensation. Growth opportunities. "
good,A typical day is sometimes too busy and sometimes too slow. It gives a limited training knowing your responsibilities. Management is unreachable always on meetings. Hardest part is to wait for faxes that is coming from another state. the most enjoyable part people are team player.
good,"It is a job, just like any job with its ups and downs. Recent company decisions have unfortunately  not added any certainty to the job outlook. It is not the worst place to work at , but is likely not the best."
good,"Few good things: benefits start right away, and you can use your PTO before it even has accrued. But... every second of your day is accounted for...you card in and out each time you leave or enter the suite... you are expected to go to the BR on your breaks only. "
good,"Management plays favorites, other staff can be great to work with but everyone can be out for themselves only. I have found that the more you succeed in one area the more likely you will be stuck there instead of advancing forward. Always some excuse why."
good,"The hours can be long and the work stressful, especially if you are working weekends. You work one in three weekends with no time back during the week, which can mean you work for 12 days in a row. Normal day is 7:45 to 16:00, weekends are 7:30 up to anywhere from 13:00-17:00, whenever the work is done. "
good,"Salary is competitive within the industry.  Position required 8 site visits per month, which is somewhat intensive, given most visits required CRA to be on-site for an entire day.  Given travel would often occur the day before and the day after the visit, 8 days on- site per month provided to be a difficult metric to meet."
good,There is plenty opportunity to work/collaborate with other departments or groups. A place where co-workers are more like family because there are opportunities to build lasting work-relationships and connections.
good,"I likews working here, good pay, good benefits, fun staff very helpful, some snakes of course, sadly. Didnt like the crazy hours that we had to work, overall very fulfilling job."
good,I loved my job overall.  I loved working with patients and the training aspect of my job.  It was when Supervisors are listening and/or contributing to rumor mills that the job became difficult and lost my job. I would suggest not making friends and keeping your head down.  Just do your job and go home.
good,"Good work/life balance, team spirited, challenging, very quality oriented"
good,Salary is decent. Benefits are decent. Stress amount is not tolerable for me. Constantly wanting more. co workers are great on the whole. Many computer programs to learn. Not very structured on training. Learn on the fly.
good,"I imagine all large, global CROs are about the same. Little to no input in what projects you are assigned to, pretty pigeon-holed with tasks and a feast or famine workload. Although I've never had an issue with work-life balance. My only real negative is that the Project Management group and Clinical Operations group always seem to be at odds with each other and the CRAs tend to get caught in the middle. I've seen little effort to bring the entire management team on to the same page."
good,The are some realy good people at Covance. The past is fast and customer focused. The benefits are very good. There is assistance with continuing education.
good,Consistent work. Lots of places to move up if you have a degree. I didn't feel valued or enjoy my job. I did love the people I worked with. It kept me there for 5 years
good,This was a position at a call center. I would review customers prescriptions as they came in. I verified patients insurance benefits then sent their prescriptions off to their specialty pharmacy.
good,I love the company but  feel the values of the company are purely based off profit from patients who NEED expensive specialty drugs to survive. Sad when you have to explain to an elderly person their insurance doesn't cover their meds they need to live and they need to pay out of pocket.
good,They pay very well could use a little more benefits for employees. Has the option to work from home depending on the location you are working at and what department you work for.
good,"Great people and great benefits.  Unfortunately, the pay is not great. "
good,"Assigned to Covance through Ranstad so job was temp to hire.  At the time of my hire I had never worked in a call center environment before and boy, what a shocker.  I did not work in the call center, but was assigned to the support staff processing payroll, attendance, etc.  Very Very fast passed and stressful"
good,"The culture and people are amazing, however, the compensation for employees has not been increased over the years. Salary and benefits no longer as competitive within the industry."
good,I liked working at this place. It is not a traditional retail pharmacy. This practice has selected drugs dispensing under patient assistance program. No retail outlet here. A small group of employees and easy to follow but busy workflow.
good,Beginninng my career at Covance it was exciting to work on Phase 1 trials as my experience up to that time was Phases II 0 IV. The work load began at 5 - 6 protocols which was easily managed within a 40 hour work week. As time progressed the protocol load worked its way up to at least 12 protocols going at a time. This caused many long days of at least 12 hours and working weekends trying to catch up. All reports were on time for the 5 day draft and 10 days to finalization but it took a lot of extra time outside of monitoring the studies. It was difficult to find any family time with this schedule. Since these were all Phase 1 studies the stress began to climb where eventually it became so stressful it was difficult to manage. I enjoyed the team I worked with and the manager as they were all very supportive and felt the stress also. Covance has a couple of mergers recently that completely shifted the supportive culture that once was Covance to the stressful environment of nothing was enough.
good,"overall a good company to work but looking for a new opportunity, fast paced environment, current manager is very supportive. Company is going through some  changes, job security is in question for some departments"
good,"Covance was just an OK place to work. Job growth is definitely an option if you're willing to withstand the fast-paced culture, but compensation doesn't increase that much when you are promoted. Benefits are good, but they are changing with the merger. Coworkers are good, but there's tremendous turnover in many departments, so you might only work with the people you meet for about a year. Overall, it's an OK place to gain some experience, but there are better places to build a career later on."
good,"If you like fast paced environment and are quick to pick up changing trends in healthcare then you may fit in here. I really enjoyed that there wasn't a dull moment, I enjoyed my supervisor she was engaged and always had our well being in mind. This job requires a lot of mental toughness."
good,"A typical day at work would include dressing business casual or professional, clocking activity during shifts, maintaining calls, uploading and organizing fax documents, while using the Sales Force System. Also, other office type duties were assigned. Growing within the company to a supervisory role is permitted. The mission within my team was to improve patient health. On average, I would receive at least 40 calls per day. Sometimes, that would include making outbound calls and then typing case notes. My department was funded on donations received throughout the year. The compensation is okay ($17.00 hourly), but the greatest reward comes from satisfied patients! Overall, this career is great if you prefer a relaxed environment! My objective while working for Covance was to award grants (donated funding) to patients for medication!"
good,"Flexible work hours, high emphasis on scientific output with greater opportunities of mentoring from developers and on hand experience with client interactions, great and helpful co-workers, manageable work load,"
good,"Even after leaving, I still believe strongly in what Covance is about and their mission to help bring new drugs to market."
good,The ability to manage work load and time getting help when needed.
good,"I just started at this company 2 months ago as a temp. It's a nice, newer company located in the RTP, NC. Work is rewarding and the hours are normal. The people are nice."
good,"Great place to work. Great personalities. Management and staff are highly qualified. Team work is excellent. Take good care of employees. "
good,"Working at kit production has been a very interesting experience. Quite frankly the people at kit production from maintenance to the head over our department have played a major role in my journey in my working career at KP. They are the most kindest people and team work, hard working folks I have ever met. If KP  didn't have a good group of staff the job would be stressful but team work and perseverance always gets the job done. But over all KP is a great place to work great and would recommend anyone with a great personality and a hard working team player to work here."
good,I worked here on a temporary assignment. I contacted insurance companies to verify patient healthcare benefits in an effort to ensure their injections would be covered. I appreciated learning about insurance and how each type works.
good,"Overall, enjoyed working at this company.  The compensation and benefits package were competitive within the current marketplace.  Great place to learn the CRO business."
good,Every program is different. But the program I was apart of I was yelled at most of the time by customers. Not a fan of the Seqirus program. Makes you want to quit.
good,"Talent is not recognized or appreciated. Ever since LabCorp took ove r the company, the company seems to be going downhill. They care more for expansion than quality."
good,"Typical workday is 8 hours, varying shifts. The company has great benefits. It is a great place to work at for someone just entering the healthcare field. Extremely disappointed in management. Morale was low and even though training is provided, the training was not the best."
good,Great job looking for a lifetime be safe there in not easy to work so i grew to be a hard working person getting up and driving 34 miles away I lived in Premont.
good,Covance is a good place to work at. The co-workers makes it more enjoyable. The management team can do a better job at making it a better place to work
good,working at covance can be challenging sometime do to heavy work load
good,"7:30 - 4pm hours work per week(with overtime), worked once a week depending on how many people work in your area. Funnest part of the day was playing some basketball on lunch time (30min) then back to work.  I learned a lot of new things.  Management had its moment when they were awesome and when they were not awesome, but everything had a reason.  The only part of management that I dislike was when they started to care more about the work then the workers. my co-workers were awesome everyone helping each other. The hardest part was dealing with disorganize schedule for my department (not all areas are the same)."
good,"They care about their employees. I love it "
good,"I was accountable for verifying health and drug prescription coverage for patients to obtain benefits. I gained invaluable experience and knowledge working in other departments, dealing with  Financial Assistance, Appeals, & Benefit Investigation. "
good,You get amble support if you are not understanding your job duties. They always reward you for the quality of your work; you get recognized on the companies website nationwide!
good,"Started out a temp, after a year and a half was made a employee. I had plenty of training and was great at my position. I quit because my supervisor pulled me aside and told me to stop applying for promotions that she wouldn't allow me to advance. She overlooked harassment going on in the team."
good,"It was a fun job, but pay was not worth the work. Management needs to have better pay increases for tenured workers."
good,"Typical work day began at 6 a.m., it required a lot of attention to details. I did learn but was eager to learn more, the company did not like that. To be successful at Covance you must be a yes man."
good,if you are new to this business Covance is a great place to start...your constantly learning.  Currently offer mentor programs and online options for advancement
good,I worked within a team that worked collectively to increase quality compliance across the global portfolio of work from our Sponsors.  We had a great team dynamic and also voiced our concerns freely to advance towards the common goal.
good,Supervisors tend to have their favorite people. These people get the best chances for advancement. Since LabCorp took over our benefits suck. Too many requirements to carry it.love my coworkers but would like to have a fair supervisor
good,"A typical day at work is answering phones. You will definitely learn a lot they have a wealth of information on the assignment they sent me on. The temporary assignment I was like working in a prison. The company was extremely strict. Not to mention a list of co-worker you will loose everyday. They are quick to let you go for silly things. Good culture, and wonderful co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning about different insurance companies."
good,"Many times I get to use my brain and think. UAT,   edits, addressing some of the queries that are not correct. I have learned a lot in my positions I have held, and constantly want to learn and take on new challenges and tasks. My typical day is ansering emails, reviewing data, resolving queires, external vendor rec, and SAE rec (once a month)"
good,CMA is a great place to work with great people. If more visible opportunities were presented with real expectation of growth more talent would excel.
good,The company was great but not the greatest management. a very strict attendance policy caused a lot of people to lose their job. no sick days. A lot of people would have doctor notes and hospital notes and you would still accrue points for not being at work
good,"Great place to get experience as a recent graduate, options to be cross trained and progress, extra pay available on weekends, evenings and overtime also. Casual contracts is a downside to the company."
good,"Covance is a respectable company and maintains a lot of very solid contracts.  Their weakness is that they either cannot, or will not, compensate well enough to compete with internal teams at large MedTech/Pharma companies.  Covance is a great place to get your feet wet, find out if you like your role, and then look to branch out in a year or two."
good,Fun place to work but lacked solid or conisitent growth. I enjoyed my peers and loved the work which is all cutting edge. I would recommend it to my peers.
good,"Enjoyed the experiences "
good,Fast paced environment that deals with most of the pharmaceutical industry. The culture of Covance varies from department to department as does employee engagement. Opportunities for growth are extremely hard to come by. A lot of politics are involved when attempting to move from position to position.
good,Covance is a high pressure results oriented workplace. They have good training and mentoring programs in place to try and help you get adjusted early in your new position. Management is very good and listens to feedback.
good,this was a fun fast paced job with lots of wonderful people to meet.
good,"Covance is a good company to learn the ins and outs of a CRO. If you're new to the industry, it's a good place to start as they are willing to give new hires a shot. The work is very fast paced and is heavily scrutinized... but that's because it is a CRO."
good,This was a very rewarding position due to the fact that it was a non-profit organization. It provided copayment assistance for medications to persons in need.
good,"A typical day at work is comprised of a combination of customer service, analysis, and interpretation. A process of evaluation and interpretation of an individual's financial status is a common and everyday practice. In order to obtain the most beneficial financial assistance programs that a customer/patient is eligible for is based on the analysis and interpretation of that person's financial records: revenue, salary, home owner, bank statements, past credit history, debt, and other information."
good,Employment opportunities include a lot of production. There is a lack of hiring trained people in the medical field for the position. Thus the people who are hired do not have a clue about the results that they are releasing. the focus of the laboratory is production so you rarely will have any down time in the 10-12 hours you are there to work your shift. However the pay makes up for the long hours.
good,"Though I still enjoy my time working at Covance, the advancement opportunity was little to non existent. Generally given to employees who are close inside and outside of work, moving up can be more than a difficult task. While relocating you to a different team does seem to be a quicker option for the supervisors and the company itself."
good,"Operations has the most growth opportunity, but be prepared that if you stray to the wrong department in operations, you may be stuck working 60+ hrs p/week. I pursued growth, but it seemed that it put me in a place where I have zero work/life balance, and it’s not really where I want to be in any means of a long run."
good,Frenetic pace work environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is to know that you are making a difference on people's life helping to bring drugs to the market sooner.
good,"It is a good place a good place to work. The people there are helpful and work together as a team, but there is one manager there who is the root of all evil she has been the cause of many to leave. She expects you to do all of this extra stuff that she throws on you then she wants to know why your job that you were hired to do is not done in a timely fashion. She is rude and will not listen when you try to tell her anything. Upper management needs to take a good look at her even if she is doing her job, it's getting done because she's throwing it on everyone else. They also need to realize that if everyone that she manages is complaining or leaving everybody can't have the problem, she's the problem. You are losing really good hard working employees because of her."
good,"Every day something to resolve.  Fast paced, less resources so never ending work."
good,"Depending on the day, duties varied.  IRB approval was critical to reassignment of priorities.  Enjoyed clinical trial contract as it served patients with limited options."
good,Invoiced customers for staffing their clinical trials including the staffs expenses (hotel meals transportation). We had tight deadlines and it was stressful at times. Workplace culture could use some help.
good,Great environment to learn about the Healthcare industry and engage with business leaders on process improvements. The company has been acquired by LabCorp.
good,"overall a good place to work. the department I worked in was deadline driven, so it could be very stressful. Over time was often Mandatory. I don't think this was true of all departments. They gave you a lot of vacation time."
good,"Laidback and standard 8-5. Workload can become over-bearing as backfills are slow to assimilate. No bonus structure, and the annual increase in salary is subpar."
good,"At Covance you have the ability to advance your career at your own pace. If you are a hard worker and don't mind sitting in a cube all day every day, you can really excel here. Once you are in you can move around to find the right fit."
good,Great place to work.  Great opportunity to move within the company.  The benefits and paid time off are a great asset.  Hours are a really great incentive as well.
good,"A lot to learn, but a relaxed environment. As long as you pay attention the SOP's in training and have someone knowledgeable to shadow, anyone should be fine. I learned alot in my almost two years here. How to negotiate and complete a contract, regulatory documents, and reviewing documents for error before submission. The hardest part for me was the contracts, there is no set instructions for learning this in my opinion. The most enjoyable part is when you have worked long and hard to create a perfect package to receive approval, and it happens!"
good,"Covance is an employer that offers multiple opportunities to grow in any business unit that may be appealing to a job seeker. It is very suited for new and young candidates who excel in an ever-changing ever-growing environment, and for those who wish to seek promotion opportunities in short time frames."
good,"They do important work and I always felt appreciated as an employee, and supervisors were open to suggestions for improvement."
good,"Chiltern is a good company to work work. I have learned how to maneuver through Chiltern's SAFE database. My day at work consists of doing a lot of QC's, data entry and filing."
good,I hate to leave the company but my family is relocating to florida. I am looking for employment in my field in the sunshine state. If i were to stay in indiana I would not leave Covance. I would recommend the job to anyone qualified
good,"If you know someone at this company or become someones favorite, then you will go far. If not, you will not go any where. Its a nice company, but the intel center treats their employees like children."
good,"Good people to work with, Management can be difficult at times.  Team work is big part of the job. Your team is like family."
good,Worked in the marketing department to bring awareness on which competitors are advertising there services online and in magazines
good,Great experience and friendly teams. Able to make an impact and work with a variety of teams globally.Role is highly administrative.
good,The people in the Nashville office are friendly.  You will find a variety of ages and ethnicities.  It's casual and professional all at the same time! Covance itself cares about people and how Covance can make a difference in this world.
good,This is a company that truly values and cares about its employees.  The managers are very supportive and available to help their employees when needed.
good,"In a morning meeting, then go to your workplace and start working. 8h per day, two breaks. I learned communication skills, work with papers."
good,"Typical work day started with schedules lead by the Team lead. "
good,"Good entry level job to get some experience.  There is really no chance for growth or promotion,  The benefit package is really good, however with recent sale to Labcorp... who knows what is happening"
good,"I learned to lead agents, train agents effectively, and coach agents with insurance verifications. Programs are offered to help fine-tune your leadership abilities."
good,I love my job and helping others. The people I worked with were great. IT was a little stressful
good,I really enjoyed my 21 years with the company.  I especially liked the interaction with my co-workers and with clients.  The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing my work was to help others.
good,There is plenty of work and hard working colleagues with room to learn.
good,"overall a good office enviroment and friendly people, the job was difficult at times but i like a challenge."
good,This job gives you the ability to learn different technical procedures that will make a different in this field
good,"The place is a good combination between the usual office cubicles and the laboratory.  "
good,Covance is a great place to work to begin your clinical research career and to learn different areas of the industry.
good,"Very busy at times, great teamwork. Always able to learn new skills."
good,Very busy and fast paced place to work. Global company with potential employee development.
good,Chalenging environment for Covance at this time.
good,Covance has been a great starting point in my career and helped to drive me to my overall goals.
good,"learned something everyday; solid management, exposed to volatile market."
good,The division I worked in was small and underfunded/staffed.  It was solely focused on profit margins instead of employee development.  There was not much training or layout of expectations.
good,"The mid level management needs to expand it's hiring pool to more external applicants. There are not enough fresh management ideas generated among mid level management,"
good,"This is a large company therefore, they have great vendors regarding internal and external systems. Unfortunately it is a bit difficult trying to progress."
good,My last two years with Covance/LabCorp I worked as a remote Manager of Quality Assurance. I worked with a great team of individuals who taught me a different perspective of the ever changing aspects of laye phase clinical research.
good,"this was a very nice company to work with. the environment was very friendly, and once you get the hang of what the job Intel's it was very simple to do."
good,Enjoyed working for this company as an intern and then my first job after college. It offered great pay and benefits to someone just starting in the workforce. I enjoyed my job and was able to move within the company to grow amd learn new and different roles within the company.
good,"Fast past work environment, must have customer service background, most of people are friendly co workers, must May attention to details, and have good work but no overtime"
good,"Each position is different, there is no typical information to provide. I learned a lot working for this company, and I am not able to disclose any information. They have a cafeteria and break rooms ."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked for at this company, however the constantly changing environment due to M&A was difficult to navigate.  I was laid-off in March 2018 due to overlap in management as we were purchased by another corporation."
good,"While Covance has a lot to offer in terms of career growth and benefits, the work life balance was difficult. Managers and team members were not always supportive."
good,Elfogadhato. A munkamennyiseg kezelheto. Az idobeosztas rugalmas.
good,"The company is growing and recently merged with another CRO.  Mergers always unsettle both companies involved.  Covance prior to the merger was a good place to work and I have no reason to believe it will not be after the merger.  Unfortunately, reductions in staff were required and I am no longer employed due to being laid off."
good,"overall good place to work. had weekends off, standard monday to friday 9-5 job. quite diverse place to work with different opportunities. good work culture, and quite friendly"
good,This company was a good start for my career. I learned a lot and worked with good people. The company was good with good benefits and would go back again.
good,High paced working environment that due to management changes and recent layoffs has become a stressful environment.  Great benefits and access to resources to improve work life balance.
good,"Lucrat zilnic concentrat pe prioritatile momentului respectiv."
good,From the first day working there they told me of all the options everyone has to grow within the company and they promote it. That showed after I became the lead of a washroom after only 4 months of working there. The best part about my time spent at Covance was definitely the people. There are so many people that work there so there is a lot of potential for meeting new people and creating more friends and a second family.
good,This place has a lot of perks to it! excellent staff great environment! but the turn over rate is crazy! Hear today gone tomorrow! Another is there are too many chiefs and not enough Indians!
good,"Overall, Covance is a good place to work. A typical day at work is fast pace and customer focused. This is a company that provides scientific services to its demanding clients who are in a race to get their product to market before the competition. "
good,There is no work/life balance if you work in one of the laboratories. My coworkers are awesome and always willing to help if needed. There is always someone that needs something more from you. Long work days.
good,Great place to work fast pace and you must know your stuff or else. nice people and good benefits. the onsite gym is a great plus. parking is not the best.
good,"Loved working for Covance and the patients they certain made my job even better due to the fact I to  love help people. I also loved the hours that I work, only thing is Convance was really far from where I stayed."
good,"Managing multiple calls during the day to help assist patients gain access to medical therapies can be quite rewarding. It can be difficult to socialize with fellow coworkers due to the goals of completed assignments per day.  The hardest part of my job at this time is to accept certain inconsistencies, but manage them accordingly in the best interest of the company."
good,"Productive work environment with helpful associates and supervisors. Everyone is able to work as a team in a calm, collect environment."
good,"Most of the work was challenging, but my co-workers made it fun and worth staying there to work! My supervisor wasn't that active in helping me improve my work. I was challenged enough and the job was kept me busy and was actually a stress reliever at times."
good,"Fast paced"
good,The company has provided me with a vast array of experiences in which I have gained several very valuable transferrable skills. This is a fast paced company in which things are constantly changing. The people at this company are great to work along side and there is a real focus placed on work life balance here at this company.
good,Covance is a great company to work for. Employees are encouraged to use their free workout room or play ping pong over their lunch break.
good,Creative individual with strong strategic planning skills
good,Working for Covance there was spmething the same and differnt at the same time day after day.  Seemed that the postion did have a lot of either on the job training mostly from your peers even though you go through a month training.  Was a very paced enviorment with plenty of assist and suggestions from your peers on to hadle some  possible concerns with some cases.  The Postion was one that you needed an open mind and needed  to research for every possible soulation to the case you were assigned at times.  Great teamwork enviroment
good,"Loved working for Covance, enjoyed the work life balance and the people (including management). It was going so well until our global department was bought by eurofins then it all went down hill, people who already knew about eurofins reputation moved asap and others stayed in hope that things wouldn't change. In fairness they didn't but the lab was closed exactly 1 year later once the tupe law expired."
good,"Not a bad place to work. Busy environment, friendly staff, good location and plenty of career development opportunities within the company. Only downside is that they require you to stay in your current role for 12 months before you are allowed to move roles."
good,Working in a global environment is exciting and challenging. Both colleagues and clients are international so cultural diversity is critical. There are opportunities but you must be willing to work hard and seek opportunity to  advance your career.
good,"It's a place that good to grow and a good exposure to how contract research organisation runs its laboratory, very different from normal clinical laboratory."
good,The thing I love the most about Covance is my direct team in Client Service.  We are a very tight group and I am really lucky to have such a great team of people.  The thing I didn't like about Covance is the politics and doing a lot with very little.  I guess most companies are like that though.
good,This is a good place for someone to start working; they provide training so you don't need any experience. You do need a lot of patience with this job but it gets easier.
good,"Working at Covance was very enjoyable, it is a nice location with lovely people. I really liked the flexibility that I had as long as I was putting my 40 hours.workers were cooperative and sociable. I will recommand Cavance to friend and I always do, and I missed working there. At Covance you always want to be at work."
good,I enjoyed being able to help patients get the medications they needed. I loved the team environment and the opportunities for growth. Typical day involved verifying insurance and seeing if patients were qualified. I learned how insurance works and how it can be helpful or hurtful to patients. It is a very diverse company.
good,"En tant que Specialiste Start-Up Sénior possibilité d'évolution vers de la coordination internationale."
good,"You deal with intercompany teams on a regular basis"
good,Working at Covance felt like a huge weight lifted off of my shoulders.  It was a professional environment that taught me how to handle myself in a manner required to succeed in business.  It also gave me the confidence needed to venture out and seek new opportunities.
good,I enjoy working at Covance. It gave me the opportunity for growth. I was able to go back to school and paid by Covance. We also have mentoring program and employees recognitions.
good,"A fast past environment with challenging projects, interesting colleagues, and rewarding out comes. The landscape of the contract research environment is quick paced. Drug and therapeutic research globally proves to be rewarding but requires a flexible work schedule with colleagues and clients around the world."
good,"- Busy and Productive. "
good,"I feel that it is the same for most large CROs.  There are always lots of upper management issues but most times it is because it trickles down from the sponsor.  But my experience was positive, I have a great line manager.  The only negative experience has been the micromanaging sponsor."
good,"Covance is a great company. There is a lot of potential, but management needs improvement. True leadership is lacking. My department within the company just merged with Covance. It is likely that my experience doesn't encompass Covance as a whole. I believe that Covance has a great culture that my department has not adopted, yet. I still enjoy what I do and would recommend Covance for experience."
good,"Covance is a great place to lay the foundation in a health care career. It provides a lot of training and exposure on the insurance coordination , benefir"
good,Chiltern is a nice place to work however we were just told the company was bought out by LabCorp.  the acquisition will occur in 2 months so the company may merge with Covance and not be existent by the middle of next year.  I would not tell anyone to apply for a position there for that reason alone.  Chiltern was relaxed and since I could work from home it suited me very well.
good,"Fast pace, but with a room to breathe. Learned a lot, but limited to the department. Management is mostly enthusiastic about their jobs. Workplace culture is awesome. The hardest part of the job is long hours overtime.The most enjoyable part of the job is benchwork and people."
good,A typical day for me was a lot of training. Very busy. Everyone helped each other out. Need to know lots more in that type of atmosphere if you apply.
good,"This job is not as bad as some may think, but is very taxing on the person. If they hope to be promoted at a decent rate. They slowly move you up with minimal salary increases"
good,"The typical day at work is what you make of it.  They want to have you work your 40 hours.  They have put restrictions on some groups overtime.  But, if you have a busy lifestyle, this job works great.  I am able to take a day off with my son and use a vacation day without any issues.  The management lets you do your own thing, but they can be reminded when you are going above and beyond in the job."
good,"A lot of moving around, fast pace scheduled threw out your day. Interact with different animals and people threw out your day in timed events, Rotational shifts and long work days"
good,Good company and management in the department but there's a high turnover rate for temporary personnel. Had plenty of work to do and enjoyed learning and taking on new responsibilities in a team working environment. The hardest part of the job as a temp was knowing that you could be terminated any day.
good,"While working with Covance as a temporary employee, I found the environment to be welcoming. All of the more experienced coworkers were available to lend a hand, and while the material was challenging without a background in medical insurance, it was highly rewarding to be able to help those in need. Management and team leaders were always readily available and friendly."
good,"In the past years that i have worked at covance, I have held multiple positions.  The inlife department works you thin from the day you walk into the door with late night work assignments and lots of weekend work.  It pays decent starting out, but there is lots of room for advancement and pay increases.  The people are what make the culture.  I would recommend this employer to others."
good,"Helping patients and doctors get on medications and treatments. We save and change lives."
good,"I have learned a lot at Covance and my immediate management and co-workers are wonderful.  I really enjoy the team relationship and the immense access to talent.  Unfortunately, in an ever changing market the business unit I belong to is a bit stuck in the past.  The refusal to change and to improve processes is not an easy culture to overhaul."
good,"Covance was a great company to work for. The management team was top notch and they treated their employees well. The benefits are superb. This is all changing though as the company was purchased by LabCorp this past February 2015 which prompted layoffs due to synergies between the companies. This is especially so for corporate, which was expected. Hence, the unfortunate brief stay at Covance."
good,The work environment is friendly and enjoyable. You are only employed until they loose there contract with a specialty drug company. If they are able to keep the contract for more than two years then they decide who they are going to make permanent. There was A LOT of overtime given during the first 3-4 months of the year.
good,"Close to home, good benefits.  Company has grown significantly since I started.  Company is being purchased by LabCorp - sale set to close Feb/2015"
good,"I started as a temporary employee. Average employees could work on 8-9 cases per day, I was able to achieve more than 18 cases on average day. Being a temp employee, I was not sure if this was being noticed."
good,Productive fast paced work environment. Great people. Culturally diverse. Little room for advancement in current department.
good,the environment is friendly and the science is really important. I learned a tremdous amount in the 2 years I was employed at Covance. I would like to return in a management capacity.

good,"A typlical day at Covance is very busy, and fast paced. However this helps to keep your day going. Great people to work with, benefits are good, and for the most part a great place to work."
good,"At Covance, I gained lots of knowledge and training. Some of my daily tasks included data entry, answering phones, replying to emails, daily contact with multiple people and customers, ordering supplies, submitting bills for payment, keeping track of sales, creating excel spreadsheets for customer service surveys etc. I worked with a diverse group of individuals, continually learning from one another and working towards a common goal. The hardest part of the job would be continually taking on various new responsibilities but this was achieved through time management and strong organizational skills. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the relaxed office environment"
good,I was allowed to grow as an employee. Hard work and quality results were rewarded.
good,In the call center the job was not difficult. The job paid VERY well for a single male. Management suggested if you came in and worked hard you would advance.
good,"Overall, this job was great for a first job out of college. The people are genuinely the best part, but management is sometimes overbearing. There are opportunities for lots of overtime and the pay is nice, but the occasional required overtime was not as nice. They push you to get better, faster, and trained in everything quickly, which can be stressful for some. The personal advancement was a huge benefit, though, because they'll often pay for you to become certified in things relating to your job."
good,"Everyone is so happy to assist you in achieving any goal you set for yourself in this line of business.   Its a great place to work, you are fined to just one building but you are on a campus like location."
good,Good company to work with. Vacation PLB is great for tenured employees. Life work balance can sometimes be overlooked. Stable company to work for. Good job security.
good,"This job is a desk job. You answer phone calls from patient, doctors, insurance companies and assist them by any means necessary. You provide great customer service to make sure patients receive the help they need."
good,"I had a good opportunity to work remotely and learned much from the position. I went through 2 re-orgs, the last being acquisition. I left because I felt that there was a lack of promotion and growth my last year there, but I enjoyed the job and the people I worked with."
good,Company will spend considerable time with your training. Very detail-oriented. Can be stressful at times. Generally a good working environment as far as people are concerned.
good,Did not spend enough time in training. Was pulled to start with multiple sites and heavy travel not in my region. work life balance was not working for employees. Many complaints from employees.
good,"Working in a fast-paced corporate environment the average day involved preparing reports and ensuring quality of all reports, managing the work load of the team."
good,learning on the job and ability to travel worldwide are the essential skills as well as excellent customer management. international work environment gives exposure to various work cultures.
good,"I have worked at Covance for 14 years. I like it because I believe in what they do as a clinical research company. With that being said, we were recently bought out by another company and the environment that I came to know is very different, as it is a very competitive compan."
good,It's nice to be able to work from home a couple days a week. Good team atmosphere. Room for upward career growth. Good training program in place for new hires.
good,"Lots of variety in day to day tasks.  Often asked to perform ""stretch"" projects.  Lots of management turnover resulted in lack of focus and long-term sustainability with projects."
good,"Great environment for CRAs to get site monitoring experience. You can do it all at Covance--Pre Study, Routine Monitoring, Site Initiation, Close-out. Great place to advance to Lead CRA or Project Manager."
good,For contracting Covance was willing to show you new tasks and tries to keep you if you produce well. I was able to build on my skills. Co-workers at Covance were  great to work with.
good,the pressure and level of stress if a lot your day to day activities are a lot if you are not multitask person this is not the best position for someone that doesn't handle stress
good,"Covance was a good place to work. It provided me with challenging projects and I had a great supervisor, and a good work group. The instrumentation was adequate."
good,"Home based...spent majority of time in meetings and on phone working with staff, clients, management on expected daily operations."
good,I was given more responsibility but nothing I could not handle.  Because of the great people at Covance you never had to worry about learning something you needed to know.  And once learned you would have ownership.  Covance has faith in their staff.
good,"This is a call center environment. It was nice how management would acknowledge employees for their ""white glove"" customer service."
good,"Great job, relatively fast-paced, little restriction on when to come in or leave. However, pay is terrible and they are making some pretty harsh cutbacks lately."
good,A good place to get experience and expand your skills. Lots of training is provided and they prefer to promote within. Most of the employees are young and they have a high turnover rate
good,I enjoy working at Covance Medical Sol. for many reasons. One of the main reasons would have to be learning so much. The training I received has been paramount for all of my everyday duties.

I also manage staff and resources to ensure client's needs are met.  The people are the most enjoyable part of the job.  We have a high performing culture where the teams needs come first.    Everyone is willing to do whatever they can to pitch in.   The comarderie with my peers is terrific."

good,"An amazing company to work for full of hard working employees who value theit team members. There is also an amazing work likfe life balance. Quiet office, but its nice"
good,"Work groups were collaborative.   The organization structure is always changing as there were many mergers and acquisitions.  However, I enjoyed my time there."
good,"Great atmosphere to work in. Flexible hours, pay seems on the low side. Great vacation time for new employees. Plenty of room to advance within the company."
good,You have to learn alot of information and processes. They change the processes often. It is difficult to get answers to questions. Some associates and supervisors give lots of attitude when you ask too many questions.
good,"Great place for an entry level employee, especially given the generous PTO. You definitely have to be able to learn quick and work hard though. My favorite place that I've worked so far."
good,"Moved on from Chiltern after acquisition by "
good,High demand on tasks to be completed in a standard turn around time.   I had to be organized to do my standard task on top of additional added workload each day.  Multi-task was very important as long with high quality of work you did.   I work well with my team and they were very appreciated of my efforts and quality of work provided to them.   If there was a task that needed done immediately I was the go to person.  They knew I would drop what I was doing and work on the critical task at hand and still make sure my standard daily task were completed.   I loved working at Covance.
good,"Easy to ask questions and learn on the job; Although sometimes training is not reviewed extensively, managers are attentive to help you if there is trouble"

good,keep up with your occurrences!  the company is serious about unplanned situation. they don't care what happened or happens. the work can be over bearing. and the building is always freezing.
good,Great place to learn and grow into a job with plenty of room for advancement.  Hours are very long and travel is driven by client demand - not great for a young family if you want to spend any time with your kids.  Always new projects so never boring.  Overall a good bunch of people to work with.
good,"This job was what I was expecting as a first job out of school. The people are great but that is the best part about it. The pay is low, its only sustainable because of the amount of overtime worked, the hours are variable and long more often than not.

good,"My typical day consist of coming in and checking with customer service to see what was going to be shipped for the day even though I could check to see this information on my PC as well. I wanted to say good morning to everyone and touch base with them. I learned many things at Covance in my 15 year tenure there. One of them is how to interact possitively with several different personalities. This would include internal as well as external customers. The local management at our site, was in my opinion, very felxible and strait forward. I did not usually have any problems interacting with any of them. My co-workers for the most part were very kind and helpful individuals. If I asked someone for help, generally they reciprocated with out complaint and would sometimes go above and beyond my request. The hardest part of my job was to receive timely training on a specific responsiblity that was delegated to me by my superiors."

good,Great place to work. Some have lost the respect for the individual philosophy... Sad to see.

Management was very easy to talk whenever anyone had a problem you could go to them and let them know your problem and what you needed help with and whey usually resolved all issues. A typical day at work come in log on to my computer check my emails answer all emails that needed to be answered.

If authorization for a request was not granted then I would have to all and speak with the insurance company and explain to them that the patient's botox injection is medically necessary and not for cosmetics purposes.  I learned at this job how to do request for appeals and authorizations and the necessary paper work that needed to be sent to the insurance companies. I also learned how to be persuasive during an appeal. My co-workers were always helpful to assist if you had an insurance company that was difficult to persuade.  The co-workers that had been their for a lot of years knew how to get through to a difficult insurance company and would assist.  The hardest part of the job was trying to appeal a decision from the insurance company.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when your appeal changed the decision of the insurance company and the patient was able to receive the procedure."

I have learned a great deal about GCP, protocols requirements from numerous studies, Upper management from the local facility was very poor.   Never shared company information, doors were closed, very emotionless not an approachable manager rarely spoke to staff. Very micro managed. Out of touch with most of the staff.  I have been to two other sites and both directors of the clinics were inviting and personable.  Co-workers were a great group of people with plenty of real world experience in the medical field.

As a care coordinator, I used to work closely with patients, doctors, nurses, pharmacies by providing free services such as financial assistance, affordable insurance, and  ensure access to expensive drugs. My experience was amazing and unique, handling daily challenging calls for patients who needed the medicine."
good,"Covance is a great place to work.  They promote employee engagement to an extent, but the sheer size of the company has made it seem like a very business centered atmosphere.  Starting pay is ok, but given that they are located in San Diego, it's not enough to sustain an individual or a family due to the high cost of living in san Diego.  Will need to keep up with the rate of inflation if they are to continue to attract top level talent"
good,I worked as an intern over the summer. I had a blast working there. The company made sure that the other interns were able to get to know each other even if they worked in different areas. I learned a lot and was productive all day.

I learned how to type faster and how to ask the right questions for verification and how to ask for help when I needed it. Management jumped in to help when we needed it and never complained and still made their employees feel appreciated.  My co-workers and I still keep in touch and always helped when they needed to get our job done.

good,"This employment gave me the opportunity to discover clinical trials and to be a part of them. The people are fantastic and the atmosphere was great. Flex time allowed me to have a better life/work balance. I learned a lot working here and had they not  closed their Montreal office, I would have most likely continued my career there."
good,"The company hires a lot of employees and slowly lets go of them until they pick only a few to keep. It's a easy straight forward job, people there are fantastic! Very good work environment, not very secure since it takes them close to a year to decide to keep their employees as full time or let them go as a temp."
good,"With the buyout from Labcorp happening, I saw a lot of changes within the company I believed would be better elsewhere.

I can come in with tasks that need to be tackled, but within an hour or so everything could change, it's just the nature of our business...which I actually like.

After review the information I'd either set up an appointment for the participant as to when he would go to the clinic or let them know why they did not qualify. That was majority of the day.

good,"A lot of folks are putting Covance down in these reviews, I can only assume they did not meet the company expectations as this place is great to work for as long as you are prepared to work hard and accurately.  Yes they are aggressive and yes they demand only the best from their employees, but they deliver a highest quality service and pay salaries above the norm to ensure they keep the right people.  There is a good matrixed management structure so if you know how to make use of that, then you will get recognition where it is deserved.  Fully recommended."
